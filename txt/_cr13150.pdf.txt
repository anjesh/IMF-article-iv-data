STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
May 2, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context. Libya is at a crossroads. Decisions taken today will have profound
implications for the future. Libya could follow a roadmap for sustainable, inclusive
growth or face deepening hydrocarbon dependency. In the short term, sustainable
growth would require managing the political transition and addressing security
challenges while maintaining budget discipline and macroeconomic stability. Severe
institutional capacity constraints need to be addressed, particularly in the areas of
economic management and statistics. Over the medium term, structural challenges
include improving the quality of education, rebuilding infrastructure, putting in place
an efficient social safety net, and developing domestic financial markets. Private
sector-led growth is a precondition for sustainable job creation. Reducing regulatory
uncertainty and establishing a well-functioning financial sector are essential to foster
private sector development.
Outlook and risks. Hydrocarbon output should reach pre-conflict levels in 2013,
while reconstruction and private demand should facilitate an improvement in the
nonhydrocarbon sectors. Oil price volatility makes economic performance vulnerable
and complicates fiscal management. Necessary reconstruction and development
spending will eventually push the budget into deficit in the absence of a curb on
current spending. The hasty implementation of legislation prohibiting interest poses
risks to the financial sector. Until Libya generates private employment and makes
progress in curbing corruption, it will not address key causes of the revolution.
Macroeconomic policy. Macroeconomic policy is underpinned by the currency peg
to the SDR, supported by ample foreign exchange reserves. Current spending is high,
and the ramping up of necessary reconstruction and development spending will
begin to erode fiscal buffers.
Financial sector. A recently-adopted law banning interest could interrupt
commercial bank lending, until a new Islamic banking framework is put in place. The
banking system appears to be well capitalized, but is not intermediating effectively to
support private sector-led growth.

CONTEXT
1.
Following the revolution, Libya has made major strides toward establishing a
democratic system of governance. Elections were held on July 7, 2012 for the General National
Congress (GNC), which installed a new government on October 31, 2012. Nevertheless, wellarmed, autonomous militias continue to hold considerable power, making security precarious.

Libya faces the challenges of stabilizing the economy and responding to the
aspirations of the revolution. The short-term challenges are to manage the political transition,
normalize the security situation while exercising budget discipline and maintaining
macroeconomic stability. Libya also needs to address issues including capacity building,
improving education, rebuilding infrastructure, establishing a social safety net, developing the
financial system, and reducing hydrocarbon dependency. Against the backdrop of weak
institutions to enforce the rule of law, the government faces pressures for fiscal largess to buy
peace and social stability. Libya also needs to set up a governance framework linked to
transparency and accountability, including governance elements that would promote private
sector-led growth.
4.
Fund engagement will focus on technical assistance and training, as well as policy
advice on expenditure management and financial development. In light of Libya’s wealth,
staff does not envisage financial assistance from the Fund. Technical assistance and training
needs are vast; areas for Fund engagement are set out in Appendix IV.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
5.
The political situation is normalizing, but the government lacks control over parts
of the country. While the new government brings together various interest groups, it continues
to face a fragmented political landscape and tribal power struggles, which complicate the writing
of a new constitution and efforts to reestablish security and the rule of law.
6.
The loss of hydrocarbon revenues during the crisis and UN sanctions on Libya
created considerable pressures. On March 17, 2011 the UN Security Council froze Libya’s
foreign assets, which made the Central Bank of Libya (CBL) unable to provide adequate foreign
exchange to the market. In response to foreign exchange shortages, demand for cash, and
increased government spending, on March 6, 2011 the CBL imposed limits on deposit
withdrawals. Nevertheless, the impact of the conflict was mitigated by confidence arising from
large foreign exchange reserves.1
7.
Economic activity collapsed during the conflict, but is recovering rapidly. In 2011,
real GDP contracted by 62.1 percent and average consumer prices rose by 15.9 percent with
inflation peaking at a year-on-year rate of 29.7 percent (Figure 1). By end-2012 most
hydrocarbon output had been restored. Growth in 2012 is estimated at 104.5 percent with annual
average inflation declining to 6.1 percent.
8.
The fall in hydrocarbon exports in 2011 led to a budget deficit and a sharply
reduced current account surplus. The overall budget deficit was 15.4 percent of GDP in 2011,
compared to a surplus of 8.9 percent in 2010.2 Similarly, the current account surplus narrowed
from 19.5 percent of GDP in 2010 to 9.1 percent in 2011. With the restoration of hydrocarbon
production in 2012, the budget had a surplus of 20.8 percent of GDP, and the current account
surplus widened to 35.9 percent.
9.
The financial situation began to normalize in early 2012 after the CBL regained
access to its assets abroad (Figure 2). After the removal of UN sanctions on CBL’s foreign
assets on December 16, 2011 the CBL was able to provide foreign exchange to banks.3 The limits
on cash withdrawals were eased gradually prior to their elimination on June 7, 2012. The lifting of
restrictions improved confidence in the banking system. In 2012, broad money grew by
11.5 percent with a modest shift from currency into deposits, and credit to the private sector
increased by 30.3 percent. Although the conflict will have caused asset quality to deteriorate, the
systemic impact should be modest in light of the liquidity buffer provided by banks’ substantial
reserves, along with limited claims on the private sector and the implicit government guarantee
of loans to state-owned enterprises. Preliminary data show that nonperforming loans increased
from 20.2 percent of total loans in 2010 to 20.6 percent in 2011 and 21.0 percent as of end-2012.
1

During the conflict the currency traded on the parallel market at about two-thirds of its official value.

2

The budget deficit was financed by money creation—initially in cash and subsequently by central bank transfers
to household bank accounts; although some arrears were reported, they do not appear to have been pervasive.
3

The parallel market premium for foreign exchange became negligible by April 2012.

The external and fiscal sustainability assessments indicate the need for higher savings.
The external and fiscal balances will deteriorate with the increase in capital expenditure that is
envisaged over the medium and long term. Methodologies developed by the Consultative Group on
Exchange Rate issues (CGER)—adapted for oil exporters—point to overvaluation (Appendix I). Most
results from the macro-balance approach indicate that the projected current account is below the
norm. The external sustainability approach indicates that the exchange rate will become overvalued
from 2014. The equilibrium real exchange rate approach finds that the dinar was overvalued by
15.3 percent as of November 2012. For the fiscal analysis, the permanent income hypothesis (PIH)
approach suggests that the nonhydrocarbon primary balance will be 5.2 percentage points of GDP
above its equilibrium value in 2013; from 2015, expenditures will be in line with their equilibrium
value with an oil price of $100 per barrel (Appendix II).4 Beyond 2018, with unchanged current
expenditure and expected capital expenditure increases, fiscal policy will not be sustainable.
11.
On January 6, 2013 the GNC passed a law banning interest in financial transactions.
The law was gazetted on March 21, 2013, and banks are no longer allowed to pay interest to or
receive interest from individuals. Companies and state entities will be prohibited from receiving and
paying interest from the beginning of 2015.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
12.
Libya will remain hydrocarbon-dependant, with limited growth in private sector jobs
over the foreseeable future. Hydrocarbon production should reach pre-conflict levels in 2013,
while reconstruction expenditure and private demand should facilitate an improvement in the
nonhydrocarbon sectors of the economy. Nonhydrocarbon growth will be strong, averaging
15 percent during 2013‒18 and raising output to the pre-conflict level by 2015. Nevertheless, a
significant reduction in unemployment, which is largely structural, will not occur as a result of a
return to the pre-conflict status quo. Until Libya generates private sector employment it will not
address a key cause of the revolution.
13.
The near-term outlook is favorable, but there are significant risks. The economy is
projected to grow robustly, but risks include delays in normalizing the political environment and
security situation, which could be aggravated if the government fails to keep pace with expectations
including progress in curbing corruption. Security-related spillovers from neighboring countries are
a risk, and Libya remains a potential source of spillovers to the region via renewed conflict and to
the world via disruption of hydrocarbon production.
14.
Oil price volatility makes economic performance vulnerable and complicates fiscal
management (Figure 3). With the recovery in hydrocarbon exports, the fiscal and current account
surpluses in 2013 are projected at 19.2 percent of GDP and 25.3 percent, respectively. Necessary
4

The assumptions for the PIH analysis are: (i) constant real per capita government expenditure that delivers a
constant real per capita annuity after the depletion of hydrocarbon resources, and (ii) crude oil prices at $100 per
barrel.

reconstruction and development spending will eventually push the budget and current account into
deficit in the absence of a curb on current spending.
15.
With the removal of crisis-related bottlenecks, inflation has eased. Annual inflation was
-3.7 percent in December 2012, and average inflation will be low in 2013 due to the base effect.
Nevertheless, rapid nonhydrocarbon growth will put upward pressure on prices, particularly given
fiscal largesse and bottlenecks in housing and transportation. Higher international food prices would
be mostly absorbed by the budget through increased subsidies for staples, posing a fiscal risk with
possible spillovers on prices of nonsubsidized items.

Box 1. Inflation Dynamics in Libya1
Empirical analysis covering the period 1964–2010 shows that despite pervasive price controls inflation
inertia, money supply growth, and government spending are the major determinants of consumer price
inflation in Libya. Results also indicate that global inflation and the exchange rate pass-through effect have
statistically significant effects on domestic inflation. Finally, international sanctions and embargoes imposed
on Libya during the period 1983–99 had a highly significant effect on consumer price inflation. As in most
resource-dependent economies, the fiscal policy stance has a ubiquitous influence on the economic cycle
and inflation dynamics. Therefore, ensuring an appropriate balance between economic growth and price
stability requires closer coordination between monetary policy and fiscal policy.

16.
The hasty introduction of legislation prohibiting interest would pose risks to the
financial sector and could undermine efforts to diversify the economy. A law banning interest
has been passed by the GNC on January 6, 2013 and published in the official gazette on March 21,
2013. The prohibition of interest-based transactions, without the foundations of Islamic finance in
place, will stop private banks from lending, thereby constraining private sector efforts to invest and
create employment. Meanwhile, although the banking sector appears well capitalized, it may be
vulnerable to asset quality deterioration.
17.
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s assessment of the economic outlook
and associated risks and policy options. While recognizing risks associated with an unanchored
fiscal policy, the government opts for fiscal largess to bring peace and stability in the short run.
Despite the passing of a law banning interest, the CBL prefers the development a dual banking
system with both conventional and Sharia-compliant financial institutions.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The overarching macroeconomic policy objective is to foster inclusive growth, underpinned by reforms
to bolster private sector led economic diversification while ensuring transparency and accountability.
Policy discussions focused on: (i) the near-term policy mix and macroeconomic conditions; (ii) growth
and job creation; (iii) the monetary and financial sector; (iv) fiscal expenditure, public financial
management, and subsidy reform; (v) transparency and statistical capacity building; and, (vi) technical
assistance.

A. Near-Term Outlook and Policy Mix
18.
The near-term economic outlook is favorable, albeit with risks associated with an
unanchored fiscal policy. The economy is set to grow at a robust pace, driven by private demand
and government reconstruction spending, and inflation will remain low. On the fiscal front, however,
spending on wages and subsidies will remain high, while increasing capital expenditures will begin
to erode fiscal buffers. On the monetary front, the pegged exchange rate regime will remain the
policy anchor, thanks to ample foreign exchange reserves that preserve confidence in the currency.
Staff welcomed the intention of the authorities to maintain the current exchange rate of the dinar,
which has and continues to serve Libya well as the anchor of macroeconomic policy. Nevertheless,
staff cautioned that the currency is overvalued and urged the authorities to strengthen the policy
mix through fiscal consolidation.
19.
Staff urged the government to contain current expenditures in the 2013 budget and
address critical capital expenditure priorities.5 Since the revolution, the level of recurrent
spending has been inconsistent with appropriate budgetary prioritization. Increases in the wage bill
continue to undermine fiscal stabilization efforts, given the volatility of oil prices and a narrow
nonhydrocarbon tax revenue base. Compared to 2012,

20.
Staff was encouraged by the authorities’ intention to implement a national system for
the identification of individuals. The envisaged system will help to: (i) encourage the development
of the formal financial sector, including fostering financial intermediation; (ii) reduce ghost workers
in the civil service; (iii) provide scope to target social expenditure; (iv) improve revenue
administration; and, (v) bolster the Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of
Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework.

Staff projected revenue of LD 87.7 billion (27.9 percent of GDP) with crude oil output of 1.7 million barrels per day
and an oil price of $103 per barrel; capital spending was projected to be LD 13 billion (10.8 percent of GDP).

remove legislative uncertainty and improve
the business environment by rationalizing the regulatory framework. Public spending, particularly on
wages and subsidies, needs to be reined in to maintain overall macroeconomic stability. Financial
sector reform is critical to ensure that entrepreneurs and private businesses have access to finance.
Private sector development and diversification will be bolstered by strengthening regional
integration, which will facilitate the flow of technology, expertise, and entrepreneurship. The
government also intends to launch specific programs aimed at increasing credit to the private sector
with a focus on small and medium enterprises. Staff also encouraged the authorities to strengthen
the AML/CFT framework to improve the business environment.
22.
Staff noted the importance of diversification to create employment opportunities in
the private sector and reduce hydrocarbon dependency. As of end-2010, unemployment was
officially 13.5 percent with youth unemployment estimated at 25‒30 percent.7 The lack of
employment opportunities for nationals can be traced back to the domination of the economy by
the state, a mismatch between the skills of workers and the demands of the private sector, as well as
insufficient labor productivity, all of which limit demand for Libyan workers. In this connection, the
authorities need to focus on governance reforms, education, and training to provide potential
employees with the skills that are in demand by the private sector. The authorities agreed with staff
that private sector investment is necessary to create sustainable employment. Public sector
investment will need to be supportive of the private sector and should be well-targeted to alleviate
bottlenecks and well-monitored with a focus on quality rather than quantity.

C. Monetary and Financial Sector
23.
The pegged exchange rate is sustainable only as long as fiscal and monetary policies
are supportive. The CBL should ensure that its monetary policy stance is consistent with the peg
and that monetary operations are consistent with the desired stance. With no interest paid on retail
deposits, their real rate of return is negative. Looking forward, the CBL should start to assess liquidity
conditions with a view to moving toward positive real interest rates in order to increase the savings
rate and forestall overheating. Furthermore, the CBL will need to develop Sharia-compliant liquidity
management instruments before the payment of interest on current CBL facilities is prohibited by
law.
24.
Staff cautioned that the prohibition of interest would interrupt financial
intermediation unless and until Sharia-compliant instruments and institutions are operational.
The CBL has taken steps toward developing a dual system of conventional and Islamic banks. Staff
noted that implementation of an interest ban could reduce access to credit for startups,
entrepreneurs, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and urged the authorities to
develop and articulate a roadmap that is consistent with supervisory and implementation capacity,
as well as the objective of promoting financial sector development. CBL management favors
continuing with the dual system despite intense political pressure to adopt a Sharia-compliant
system. The authorities recognized the importance of access to credit for entrepreneurs and SMEs.
25.
Staff suggested that the authorities focus on efforts to develop a vibrant formal
financial sector that caters to the needs of the economy. A number of entities currently provide
financial products and services (currency exchange and transfers and short-term lending) outside of
the formal banking system. In this respect the CBL has adopted procedures with respect to foreign
exchange transfers abroad through the announcement of licensing requirements for exchange
operators. The growth of this informal sector, operating beyond regulatory and supervisory reach,
undermines public policy and potentially increases risks to financial stability and macroeconomic
performance.

Box 2. The Finance-Growth Nexus in Libya1
Libya has moved forward with reform initiatives prior to the revolution, but the banking system remains
predominantly in the hands of the public sector. The extent and diversity of financial services provided are
limited and hindered by institutional weaknesses including the lack of a robust system of property rights, the
absence of credit assessment information, the lack of competition, and government ownership.
The financial system in Libya has undergone substantial changes over the past decade, but remains shallow
and bank-dependent. Commercial bank lending to the private sector increased from 2.2 percent of GDP in
1970 to 31.5 percent in 1990, but then

declined to 21.8 percent in 2000 and
9.5 percent by end-2010. Furthermore,
the share of credit to the private
sector in total banking assets declined
from over 40 percent to about 13.5

percent. Empirical results, in general,

long-run relationship between financial intermediation and nonhydrocarbon growth reflects factors
including the volatility of hydrocarbon earnings, lack of adequate lending opportunities, and institutional
bottlenecks. Financial development is a critical channel for fostering economic growth and maintaining
macroeconomic stability, and will require a comprehensive strategy based on a well-sequenced set of
structural reforms and policy measures.

IMF Working Paper, No. 13/92.

26.
Additional structural reforms are required for the development of a growth-enhancing
financial system. Financial intermediation remains rudimentary and shallow, reflecting a number of
factors including the lack of adequate lending opportunities in nonhydrocarbon sectors of the
economy and competition from specialized credit institutions (SCIs) that are directed to implement
social programs.8 Looking forward, staff suggested a comprehensive reform strategy aimed at:
improving the legal framework; streamlining the insolvency regime; enhancing competition in the
banking sector; reducing the role of state-owned commercial banks and specialized credit
8

As of end-2010, SCIs accounted for over 65 percent of credit.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

LIBYA

institutions; and, improving the credit information system to enable banks to better assess credit risk
and improve access to finance. In particular, the reform strategy should seek to wind down the
operations of the SCIs.
27.
Staff urged the authorities to enhance regulatory and supervisory capacity. Measures
to mitigate systemic risk should address vulnerabilities arising from macroeconomic developments,
market infrastructure, and bank balance sheets. Staff argued that streamlining regulation while
strengthening the supervisory framework remains key to promoting financial intermediation that
would help underpin investment, growth, and macroeconomic stability. Staff urged the authorities
to consider measures to strengthen balance sheet resilience and risk management and prevent the
buildup of excessive sectoral exposures.
28.
An AML/CFT Law should be brought in line with international standards, and resources
should be devoted to its effective implementation. Financial sector development should be
accompanied by strengthening AML/CFT supervision to ensure compliance. Adequate preventive
measures and reporting to an independent and operational Financial Intelligence Unit will help limit
destabilization from illicit financial flows. An effective AML/CFT system would also assist in recovery
of stolen assets.

D. Fiscal Strategy
29.
Staff highlighted that procyclical policies threaten macroeconomic stability as well as
fiscal sustainability and intergenerational equity. In light of hydrocarbon dependency and the
CBL’s commitment to the pegged exchange rate, fiscal policy remains the main instrument for
maintaining macroeconomic stability. Staff noted that current policies will erode Libya’s
hydrocarbon wealth as necessary reconstruction and development spending will eventually push the
budget into deficit in the absence of a curb on current spending. Staff suggested that scaling up of
development expenditure should take into account the institutional and absorptive capacity of the
economy. This would ensure the efficiency of capital investment, mitigate the buildup of inflationary
pressures, limit real exchange rate appreciation, and be consistent with the accumulation of
precautionary savings.
30.
Staff called for reprioritizing government spending to enhance growth and efficiency.
Libya has a large infrastructure gap, which requires government spending to alleviate infrastructure
bottlenecks to development. Some components of public spending, including on education and
infrastructure, will also contribute to nonhydrocarbon growth. Reducing distortions due to high
public sector wages and subsidies would improve incentives and resource allocation, leading to an
increase in private capital formation and foster the growth of employment opportunities outside the
public sector. The authorities acknowledged the importance of speeding up the implementation of
already-approved development projects with large employment impact.

Box 3. Designing a Rule-Based Fiscal Framework for Libya1
The Libyan authorities are interested in adopting a fiscal rule to anchor fiscal policy. International experience
has shown that a rule-based fiscal framework helps insulate an economy against volatility and ensure fiscal
sustainability. Budget formulation lacks an explicit policy or development strategy, and has a weak linkage
between policy priorities and expenditures. Taking into account hydrocarbon wealth and large infrastructure
and reconstruction needs, the adoption of a rule-based, transparent medium-term fiscal framework would
provide an anchor for stabilization and intergenerational equity objectives and support the fixed exchange
rate regime. Furthermore, given the politically-induced bias toward increasing expenditures in the short run,
a transparent and well-designed fiscal policy rule constitutes a compelling option for decoupling
government spending—and the nonhydrocarbon budget balance—from the volatility of hydrocarbon
revenues.
The simulation results suggest that the “enhanced” structural balance rule—taking into account the output
gap and commodity price deviations from their long-term trend—would be the strongest anchor for fiscal
policy in Libya. However, in view of institutional capacity constraints that may prevent its implementation in
the near future, an expenditure rule—refined to take into account the front-loaded needs for infrastructure
spending in the immediate post-revolution period—appears to be the most feasible option to anchor fiscal
policy formulation, with a view towards transitioning towards the adoption of the “enhanced” structural
balance rule.
1

Based on “The Day After Tomorrow: Designing an Optimal Fiscal Strategy for Libya” by Carlos Caceres,
Serhan Cevik, Ricardo Fenochietto, and Borja Gracia, IMF Working Paper, No. 13/79.

31.
The authorities agreed with staff on the need to develop a rule-based medium-term
fiscal framework. Libya’s public finances are heavily dependent on volatile hydrocarbon earnings,
with an annual budget preparation that is characterized by a short-term horizon with little reference
to longer-term policies and objectives. Furthermore, beyond building fiscal buffers against
exogenous shocks to the revenue stream, Libya needs to cast its spending in a framework designed
to support intergenerational equity in the allocation of wealth. Accordingly, a credible fiscal policy
anchor would delink the economy from oil price fluctuations, improve the management of resource
wealth, and safeguard macroeconomic stability (Box 3). The authorities were keen to examine the
scope to institutionalize a fiscal rule in the forthcoming constitution and welcomed Fund advice in
this area.
32.
Staff argued that the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) should be integrated into the
fiscal framework.9 Libya’s sovereign wealth fund (SWF) system, operating through the LIA and the
budget reserve account (BRA) at the CBL, should be fully integrated into this framework, with welldefined and transparent rules determining the inflows to and outflows from the LIA and the BRA.
Currently, the LIA lacks a clear definition of objectives and the rules governing the accumulation,

management, and use of its resources. Accordingly, staff recommended that the LIA should function
as a savings fund for future generations as well as a stabilization fund to better manage oil price
cycles. In this respect, the SWF system should not participate in domestic investment projects—
directly or through the Social and Economic Development Fund and the Libyan Fund for Domestic
Investment and Development. Along with well-defined investment objectives, the LIA also needs to
improve transparency and accountability in its governance, consistent with international good
practices. The authorities were grateful for Fund advice on the institutional arrangements for the LIA
and were keen to address shortcomings in the governance framework.
33.
Staff suggested the adoption of a comprehensive reform strategy to strengthen the
public financial management (PFM) system.10 The core functions of the Ministry of Finance to
effectively play its role of stewardship of public finances remain to be fully established.11 Staff
highlighted that the separation of institutional responsibilities between the Ministry of Finance and
the recently created Ministry of Planning for the preparation and execution of the recurrent and
investment budgets poses a challenge to implementing a unified system of budget management.
Fiscal forecasts—covering only the ensuing year—and the budget have yet to become effective
tools for successful implementation of a fiscal strategy reflecting national policy objectives and the
volatile and exhaustible nature of hydrocarbon revenues. Fiscal accounts and budget reports are
prepared with substantial time lag undermining the government’s ability to monitor fiscal
developments and enforce accountability in public service delivery. Moreover, government banking
arrangements remain fragmented and cash resources are dispersed across numerous bank accounts.
Accordingly, staff argued that the thrust of PFM measures in the near term should be to address key
priorities with a view to building the institutional capacity for more fundamental reforms. The
authorities welcomed Fund advice on PFM reform as well as the opportunity to have a long-term
expert advise them on reforms.

Staff recognized the efforts of the authorities to elaborate a subsidy reform strategy.
Energy prices are highly subsidized in Libya with gasoline prices one of the lowest in the world.12
Food price subsidies are also large at the equivalent of 2.0 percent of GDP. Government spending
on subsidies increased from 8.5 percent of GDP in 2010 to 11.0 percent in 2012, more than half of
which was on fuel subsidies. The authorities are planning to move from price subsidies to cash
transfers, supported by a request from the GNC for a report on reform modalities from the
Ministries of Economy, Finance, and Planning, which is due by August 2013.

E. Transparency and Statistical Capacity Building
35.
The authorities agreed with staff on the need to enhance transparency throughout the
public sector. Data compilation remains weak and responsibilities are spread over several agencies.
Compilation of many key indicators was interrupted by the conflict and has not been restored. The
authorities requested assistance from staff in data compilation and in setting out a transparency
strategy that will include the CBL, the Ministry of Finance, the SWF system, and the National Oil
Corporation.

F. Staff Appraisal
36.
The political and security environment remains uncertain. Lacking the capability to
enforce the rule of law, the government has had limited success in bringing autonomous militias
under control and dealing with a fragmented political landscape and tribal power struggles.
Consequently, short-term stability concerns continue to trump much-needed medium-term
structural reforms.

12

Domestic gasoline consumption in 2010 was 4.1 billion liters with a retail price of $650 million, compared to the
pre-tax price in Italy of $3.1 billion.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

LIBYA

37.
Economic activity has rebounded. Hydrocarbon output has been restored, generating
large budget and current account surpluses. Nonhydrocarbon growth has been strong, underpinned
by private demand. Inflation has returned to single digits, reversing price increases that took place
during the conflict.
38.
The near-term outlook is favorable, but there are significant risks. Risks include delays
in normalizing the political environment and security situation. Oil price volatility makes economic
performance vulnerable and complicates fiscal management. A significant reduction in
unemployment, which is largely structural, will not occur as a result of a return to the pre-conflict
status quo. Until Libya generates private sector employment it will not address a key cause of the
revolution.
39.
The overarching policy objective should be to foster inclusive growth. Diversification
will be key to create employment opportunities in the private sector and reduce hydrocarbon
dependency. The authorities need to articulate and then implement a strategic vision for economic
development which includes steps to set up a governance framework linked to transparency and
accountability, including anti-corruption elements. Sustainable growth requires a business
environment that is conducive to private sector development.
40.
Banks are not intermediating effectively. Banks continue to suffer from the presence of
the government in the sector and the lack of an enabling legal environment. Staff encourages the
authorities to develop a comprehensive financial sector reform strategy, including a roadmap to
wind down the operations of the SCIs. Streamlining regulation while strengthening the supervisory
framework remains key to promoting financial intermediation that would help underpin investment,
growth, and macroeconomic stability.
41.
An AML/CFT Law in line with international standards is needed, and resources should
be devoted to its effective implementation. An effective AML/CFT system will help limiting illicit
financial flows including corruption and will support the recovery of stolen assets.
42.
A law banning interest in financial transactions was enacted. Implementation of the law
in the absence of Sharia-compliant institutions will preclude conventional lending. Until Shariacompliant institutions are able to deliver the services required by the private sector the interest ban
should be suspended and commercial banks should be allowed to operate.
43.
Expenditure is skewed toward wages and subsidies. The lack of institutional capacity is
constraining execution of urgent infrastructure projects, while an entitlement mentality is
encouraging recurrent spending. Current spending is eroding buffers and undermining prospects
for fiscal sustainability and intergenerational equity. Efforts to implement subsidy reform in 2013 are
commendable. Libya would be well-served by a fiscal rule to help ensure sustainability of fiscal
policy.

20

44.
The LIA should be integrated into the fiscal framework. The LIA should function as a
savings fund for future generations as well as a stabilization fund to better manage oil price cycles.
The SWF system should not participate in domestic investment projects—directly or through the
Social and Economic Development Fund and the Libyan Fund for Domestic Investment and
Development. The LIA also needs to improve transparency and accountability in its governance,
consistent with international good practices.
45.
Libya needs to adopt a comprehensive reform strategy to improve its PFM system. The
thrust of measures in the near term should address key priorities with a view to building the
institutional capacity for more fundamental reforms.
46.
Libya’s macroeconomic statistics are barely adequate for surveillance. In light of
hydrocarbon dependency and limited financial intermediation, the data provided by the authorities
is adequate for surveillance. Nevertheless, data compilation remains weak and responsibilities are
spread over several agencies.
47.
The currency peg to the SDR has served Libya well. In an environment marked by
uncertainty, volatile oil revenues, and the absence of alternative tools for monetary policy, the peg
has provided a pragmatic policy anchor supported by ample reserves. Under the baseline scenario,
continued fiscal expansion is likely to lead to a deterioration in the external position, an appreciation
of the real exchange rate, and overvaluation of the currency. Staff urges the authorities to be
mindful of this dynamic in formulating fiscal policy and to enact structural reforms that improve
external competitiveness.
48.
Staff is in the process of reviewing the foreign exchange system of Libya including
related legal instruments to assess Libya’s compliance with its obligations under Article VIII of
the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. There are issues that raise potential Article VIII concerns
including the imposition and lifting of UN sanctions freezing Libya’s foreign assets, the existence of
parallel market premium for foreign exchange and procedures with respect to foreign exchange
transfers abroad.
49.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12month cycle.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path discussed in this report

(which is the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the
staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding this baseline. The RAM reflects staff's views on the source of
risks and overall level of concerns as of the time of discussions with the authorities.

Appendix II. External Sustainability and Exchange Rate
Assessment
Estimates from CGER-type methodologies indicate that the Libyan dinar was broadly undervalued
prior to the conflict. As spending picks up, however, the current account will become unsustainable
according to the external sustainability approach. The results of the macroeconomic balance indicate
that the projected current account balance is below the current account norm, indicating
overvaluation. The equilibrium real exchange rate approach indicates modest overvaluation.

Due to high inflation during the conflict the real effective exchange rate appreciated
sharply. The real effective

appreciation.
2.
The macroeconomic balance (MB) approach indicates that the projected current
account balance is below the current account norm.1 The macroeconomic balance approach
calculates the difference between the projected current account balance and an estimated current
account norm. As presented in Table 1, the estimated current account norm for Libya ranges from a
deficit of 0.24 percent of GDP to a surplus of 6.3 percent of GDP, depending on the model
specification. Looking forward, Libya is expected to run current account deficits once capital
spending picks up, which implies the need for higher savings.

1

According to the MB approach, the current account norm is calculated using coefficients obtained from a dynamic
panel regression for 24 hydrocarbon-exporting countries (Beidas-Strom and Cashin, 2011)

According to the ES approach, the current account norm is derived from the annuity that would finance a constant
per capita non-hydrocarbon current account deficit. The key parameters are crude oil reserves of 44 billion barrels,
annual population growth of 2 percent, a real rate of return of 4 percent, crude oil prices at an average of $94 per
barrel during the period 2013–18 and then constant in real terms.

Appendix III. Assessing Fiscal Sustainability
1.
Libya is estimated to have a nonhydrocarbon primary budget deficit in line with its
equilibrium level, but deteriorating over the medium term. Evaluating fiscal sustainability is a
challenging task in a hydrocarbon-dependent economy, because of the volatility of hydrocarbon
revenues. Although the standard permanent income hypothesis (PIH) analytical framework—limiting
government expenditure in a given year to the rate of return on the present value of future natural
resource streams including financial assets accumulated until the depletion of resource reserves—is
sensitive to parameters such as population growth, real rate of return on financial assets, and the
future path of crude oil prices, it still provides a useful quantitative benchmark for fiscal
sustainability. Assuming constant real per capita government expenditure that delivers a constant
real per capita annuity after the depletion of hydrocarbon resources and crude oil prices at $100 per
barrel, the nonhydrocarbon primary budget deficit is estimated to be 5.2 percentage points of GDP
higher than its equilibrium value in 2013. However, with the rise in expenditures, the projected
primary budget deficit will move about 0.2 percentage points below its equilibrium value by 2015
(Table 1).1 Beyond 2018, further increases in capital expenditure, which are expected, will raise public
spending to an unsustainable level.
2.
The PIH model identifies the vulnerability of Libya’s public finances to a decline in oil
prices. At a crude oil price of $80 per barrel the nonhydrocarbon primary deficit would be
4.5 percentage points of GDP higher than its equilibrium value in 2013, with the gap increasing to
over 8 percentage points by 2015 and staying broadly constant at that level. This would imply a
need for fiscal rebalancing to safeguard long-term sustainability and ensure intergenerational equity
in the distribution of resource wealth. The PIH framework does not account for the possibility that
the resource base could be extended and broadened through technological developments and the
exploitation of probable reserves. Accordingly, a wider resource base would extend the production
horizon and raise the sustainable non-hydrocarbon primary deficit. Nevertheless, with the cyclically
adjusted nonhydrocarbon primary budget deficit running about 200 percent of nonhydrocarbon
GDP, these results indicate the need for fiscal consolidation to reduce vulnerability to lower oil
prices, ensure long-term sustainability, and improve intergenerational distribution of resource
wealth.

1

The calculations assume the real rate of return on financial assets, inflation, and population growth of 5 percent,
2 percent, and 1.8 percent, respectively. For Figures 4 and 5, oil price projections are based on the latest profiles
published in the IMF’s World Economic Outlook (WEO) and are assumed to increase at 2 percent thereafter.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
On January 1, 2002, the authorities adopted a conventional fixed peg to the SDR at a rate of
LD 1 = SDR 0.608. In June 2003, the exchange rate was devalued by 15 percent to
LD 1 = SDR 0.5175. From February 14, 1999 to December 31, 2001, a dual exchange rate system
was in place, with an “official” exchange rate pegged to the SDR, and a “special” exchange rate
pegged to the U.S. dollar.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
Prepared by the World Bank Staff
(As of April 16, 2013)
1.
Libya has been a member of the World Bank Group since 1958, joining the International
Bank of Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and International Finance Corporation (IFC) in
September 1958, International Development Association (IDA) in August 1961, and Multilateral
International Guarantee Association (MIGA) in April 1993. There have been no World Bank Group
loans made to Libya to date as the development of the country’s petroleum assets from 1960
placed Libya among capital-surplus oil-producing countries, and provided resources to build
extensive infrastructure and provide social services.
2.
In 2007, a Technical Cooperation Agreement was signed between the Bank and the
Government of Libya, with a total budget of $1 million contributed jointly by the two parties. The
Agreement funded a Joint Economic Advisory Program, geared to support and further Libya’s
reform process, covering the period of July 1, 2007 to June 30, 2008. Activities were launched in
the areas of an Investment Climate Assessment, Business and Legal Environment, and support for
the development of the Libya Vision 2025. The ICA report was completed in December 2010. A
Public Expenditure Review (PER) was also launched in August 2007, with the main mission taking
place in November 2007. Completion of the first draft of the document took place in October
2008. Then, a high level seminar, attended by the entire Economic and Social Cabinet took place
in December 2008. After introducing written comments from all ministries and entities, the final
version of the PER was delivered to the Authorities in April 2009 for their final clearance. The PER
benefits from multiple inputs by IMF staff. The IMF also had active participation in the
December 2008 high level seminar.
3.
Two other high-level workshops were held in 2008. The first one was on “Libya in
Transition.” It covered the economic strategy, oil revenue management and social transfers. The
second was on “Topics of Private Sector Development” and had an active participation from the
private sector. In 2007 work on providing TA on statistical capacity building and surveys started
and continues to date. Initially, this activity focused on supporting the 2007/08 Household
Survey, the Labor Force Survey, and Poverty Analysis. In 2010, TA in statistics was broadened to
the national accounts. TA in statistics resumed following the revolution in 2012, and Bank staff
worked with the authorities on their strategy to overhaul the Libyan National Statistical System
with an Implementation Action Plan for both components (National Accounts and Surveys) that
were adopted and launched in 2012.

4.
Following the revolution, a number of activities were undertaken, some jointly with the
IMF, leading to the preparation of the following reports: A Public Financial Management
assessment (joint with IMF); a report on Governance options for LIA (joint with IMF); a Financial
Sector Review; a Rapid Labor Market Assessment; a Cultural Heritage report; and reports on local
governance/decentralization. Currently, World Bank staff are working with the authorities to carry
forward the recommendations of these reports in various areas (PFM, governance, financial
sector, labor market and SME development, public service delivery). It also continues to provide
TA in statistical capacity building and is advising the government on stolen assets recovery. In
addition, the authorities have asked the Bank for support on subsidy reform.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of April 16, 2013)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: During the revolution data provision was interrupted. Post-revolution, the authorities
sporadically submit monetary data to the Fund. MCD missions are provided with broader data.
Prior to the revolution, data provision had shortcomings, but was broadly adequate for
surveillance. Pre-revolution weaknesses were in: (i) the conceptual and compilation procedures
underpinning the collection of statistics in various sectors; (ii) deficiencies in coverage,
periodicity, and timeliness; (iii) lack of consistency of data across sectors; and (iv) with the
exception of monetary data, lack of a reporting system to facilitate updating MCD’s operational
database between missions. These issues are compounded by institutional weaknesses, the lack
of interagency cooperation, the proliferation of agencies with unclear and often overlapping
responsibilities, and unclear demarcation of responsibilities between agencies.
In 2005 a multisector mission examined the conceptual and compilation procedures for national
accounts, price indices, foreign trade, money and banking, and government finance statistics. It
developed recommendations for improvement in these systems. STA will resume TA later in
2013.
National Accounts: Some progress has been made in the compilation of GDP statistics by
economic activity through 2004, based on the 1968 System of National Accounts. However, the
compilation process is hampered by high staff turnover and significant delays in the receipt of
basic data from various sources, particularly other government agencies. In addition, many of the
surveys are outdated. Annual data up to 2002 were reported to STA in 2004 and published in the
International Financial Statistics (IFS); however, the estimates are not fully consistent with other
data sets. A new household survey was finalized in 2003.
To improve the national accounts, the 2005 STA mission made several recommendations
including: (i) establishing a National Statistical Agency to produce and disseminate official
statistics and coordinate the national statistical program; (ii) creating a National Statistical
Council as a legally empowered interagency coordination committee to oversee compilation of
national accounts statistics; (iii) transferring responsibility for the national accounts from the
National Planning Council to the Census and Statistical Department of the National Information
and Documentation Agency (NIDA) and creating 6–10 additional permanent staff positions;
(iv) prioritizing implementation of the 1993 System of National Accounts and outlining entailed
data requirements; (v) improving the questionnaires used for the construction and manufacturing
surveys; (vi) initiating regular surveys of major services, agricultural output, and public and
private construction; and (vii) improving estimates for transport, storage, and communication
companies.

During 2006-2008, STA appointed a resident national accounts statistics advisor (RSA) to assist in
improving the national accounts statistics. The RSA was working on the improvement of the legal
and institutional arrangements including, the implementation of the statistics law, appropriate
funding for the production of the source data, and the allocation of an adequate number of
qualified staff. During 2007, with assistance from the RSA, five surveys and an agricultural census
were conducted. The Ministry of Planning was able to compile a revised time series of GDP
estimates for the period 2001-2007 at current and constant prices.
Price statistics: An STA mission, in February 2010, noted some progress that has been made on
developing a PPI and revising the CPI for Libya. The Tripoli-only based CPI index (2003) will be
replaced by an index that broadly represents all households in Libya. There is a need to link the
Tripoli (1999) and Tripoli (2003) indexes to create a continuous time series of data. Data from the
household budget survey (HBS) conducted during November 2007 - October 2008 had been
processed. Once approved, these data will be used to expand geographic coverage of the CPI to
include 8 urban and rural areas. An updated and expanded CPI with weights derived from
the 2008 household budget survey is planned to be released in early 2011.
The initial PPI data have been compiled for July–December 2009. The data cover
mining/extraction, manufacturing, and utilities (gas and water); with the on-going goal of
expanding coverage to ultimately include all economic activities in Libya. The PPI data are
expected to be released in 2011.
Government finance statistics: The fiscal information system remains fragmented and
inconsistent with international standards in many aspects, since it was designed for
administrative reporting under the government finance law, rather than for purposes of
providing timely statistical information for economic planning and analysis.
To improve the fiscal data, the 2005 STA mission recommended: (i) adopting centralized
management of all budgetary central government accounts at the ministry of finance; (ii)
expanding coverage of central government accounts by including extra budgetary and local
government operations; (iii) developing GFS metadata on concepts, scope, classifications, basis
of recording, data sources, and statistical techniques for posting on the GDDS website; (iv)
adopting the Fund’s 2001 Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM 2001) as a coherent
methodological framework for the production and dissemination of monthly, quarterly, and
annual fiscal data. STA is prepared to assist the authorities in initiating the compilation and
reporting of GFSM 2001-based fiscal statistics.

Monetary statistics: While the timeliness and quality of monetary data reported for IFS have
improved significantly, some methodological deficiencies remain and the data are still
undergoing frequent revisions. To enhance monetary and financial statistics, the STA missions
in 2005 and 2007 made the following recommendations: (i) reclassify Libyan Foreign Bank (LFB)
as a resident financial institution under other depository corporations and include LFB in the
institutional coverage of the monetary survey; (ii) adopt market-based valuation of financial
instruments and accrual accounting procedures for adding accruing interest to the outstanding
amount of the instrument; (iii) revalue CBL’s holdings of monetary gold at end-period market
prices; (iv) identify all Fund-related accounts in the CBL’s balance sheet as per IMF Finance
Department guidelines; (v) if specialized credit institutions start issuing deposit liabilities,
reclassify these institutions as other depository corporations and include them in the institutional
coverage of the monetary survey; and (vi) revise/develop report forms for banks that would
contain a breakdown of positions by currency of denomination, financial instrument, residency,
and economic sector of counterparty consistent with the structure of the Standardized Report
Forms. The CBL is currently in the process of improving classification and revising the monetary
survey.
Balance of payments and International Investment Position (IIP): Since 2000 annual balance
of payments data have been regularly reported to STA in the BPM5 format. As part of the Middle
East Regional Technical Assistance Center’s (METAC) work program, a long-term Regional
Statistics Advisor (RSA) was appointed to help strengthen external sector statistics and to provide
assistance either directly or through backstopping short-term experts. The main objective is to
set up a compilation program for quarterly balance of payments statistics and for international
investment position statistics.
The METAC mission that visited Tripoli in 2009 found that the CBL made little progress in
implementing the previous missions' recommendations. The balance of payments statistics are
still suffering from coverage deficiencies in the services, income and current transfer accounts,
and classification errors were detected in reserve assets and trade credits. Furthermore, there are
major differences between the trade data compiled by the CBL (based on letters of credit
information) and the trade data compiled by the General Authority of Information (GAFI), which
are based on customs forms. Oil exports data estimates from the GAFI are largely inconsistent
with the CBL’s estimates. The inter-agency cooperation is still considered inadequate. To further
enhance the coverage of the BOP data, the mission suggested incorporating in the ITRS all the
government’s and public institutions’ inward and outward transaction as well the CBL’s own
account transactions executed by the CBL’s Accounting Department and Transfers Department.
Extensive hands-on training was provided to staff to assist with the establishment of an IIP from
available data. However, stock data for FDI, portfolio investment, trade credits, and loans are still
unavailable or less comprehensive. Improved estimates and coverage of source data would be
achieved through new surveys (as FDI survey), changes to existing surveys, and other data

sources, as well as by making better use of existing data sources. Collaboration with the National
Oil Corporation (NOC) is essential to ensure inclusion of the oil companies operating in Libya in
the FDI survey.
The mission also discussed with the balance of payments compilers the major changes from the
Balance of Payments Manual fifth edition (BPM5) to the sixth edition of the Balance of Payment
and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6) that are relevant for the compilation of
Libya’s external sector statistics.
To further improve the balance of payments statistics, the 2009 RSA mission made the following
recommendations: (i) continue increasing resources; (ii) the General Public Committee of Tourism
and the GAFI to conduct a well-designed travel survey with a representative sample to cover the
arrivals and departures to/from all Libyan borders points; (iii) the CBL to seek the Ministry of
Interior’s assistance in collecting information on the numbers of arrivals and departures by
nationality (Libyan and foreigners); (iv) the CBL, in cooperation with relevant agencies to conduct
an FDI survey in early 2010; the survey should consider the inclusion of large enterprises in
construction, oil sector, hotels, and telecommunication as a high priority; and (v) the CBL to
enhance the coverage of sources of stock data and start compiling an IIP using the standard
instrument classification and sectorization recommended by BPM6.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes the 2013 Article IV Consultation with Libya
On May 17, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Libya.1
Background
The political situation is normalizing, but the government lacks control over parts of the country.
While the new government brings together various interest groups, it continues to face a
fragmented political landscape and tribal power struggles, which complicate the writing of a new
constitution and efforts to reestablish security and the rule of law.
The loss of hydrocarbon revenues during the crisis and UN sanctions on Libya created
considerable pressures. On March 17, 2011 the UN Security froze Libya’s foreign assets, which
made the Central Bank of Libya (CBL) unable to provide adequate foreign exchange to the
market. In response to foreign exchange shortages, demand for cash, and increased
government spending, on March 6, 2011 the CBL imposed limits on deposit withdrawals.
Nevertheless, the impact of the conflict was mitigated by confidence arising from large foreign
exchange reserves.
Economic activity collapsed during the conflict with real GDP declining by 62.1 percent and
average consumer prices increasing by 15.9 percent. The fall in hydrocarbon exports in 2011
led to a budget deficit of 15.4 percent of GDP and a sharply reduced current account surplus.
The restoration of hydrocarbon production underpinned growth of 104.5 percent in 2012 while

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares
a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing up can
be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

inflation declined to 6.1 percent. The budget had a surplus of 20.8 percent of GDP and the
current account surplus widened to 35.9 percent of GDP.
The financial situation began to normalize in early 2012 after the removal of UN sanctions on
the foreign assets of the central bank. In 2012, broad money grew by 11.5 percent with a
modest shift from currency into deposits and credit to the private sector increased by
30.3 percent. Although the conflict will have caused asset quality to deteriorate, the systemic
impact on the banking system should be modest in light of the liquidity buffer provided by banks’
substantial reserves, along with limited claims on the private sector and the implicit government
guarantee of loans to state-owned enterprises. Preliminary data show that nonperforming loans
increased modestly in 2011 and 2012.
On January 6, 2013, the General National Congress (GNC) passed a law banning interest in
financial transactions. The law was gazetted on March 21, 2013 and banks will no longer be
allowed to pay interest to or receive interest from individuals. Companies and state entities will
be prohibited from receiving and paying interest from the beginning of 2015.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the rebound in economic activity and the favorable growth
outlook. They noted, however, that lingering political and security uncertainties and a
pronounced vulnerability to oil price fluctuations add to the significant challenges faced by the
transition, including the need to support the reconstruction effort while maintaining
macroeconomic stability. Against this backdrop, Directors encouraged the authorities to move
rapidly in the implementation of their reform program.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to articulate and implement a strategic vision for
economic development, including setting up a governance framework based on transparency
and accountability. They noted that credible and efficient institutions and a favorable business
environment will be crucial to create employment opportunities in the private sector and reduce
hydrocarbon dependency.
Directors agreed that promoting financial intermediation is key to fostering macroeconomic
stability and growth. In this regard, they encouraged the authorities to develop a comprehensive
financial sector reform strategy to streamline regulation and strengthen the supervisory
framework. In addition, they urged the authorities to adopt an Anti-Money
Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) law in line with international
standards and devote resources to its effective implementation.
Directors noted that the recently-enacted law banning interest in financial transactions in the
absence of Sharia-compliant institutions and framework would preclude conventional bank
lending. They recommended that the authorities consider delaying the implementation of the
new law until the financial sector is able to comply with it.

3
Directors noted that expenditure is skewed toward wages and subsidies, which is eroding policy
buffers, undermining the fiscal position, and reducing space for priority infrastructure spending.
They supported the authorities’ efforts to implement an extensive subsidy reform in combination
with a safety net and welcomed plans to develop a rules-based medium-term framework that
would help ensure fiscal sustainability and intergenerational equity.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to adopt a comprehensive reform strategy for
public financial management. They urged the authorities to integrate the sovereign wealth fund
system into the fiscal framework and prohibit all elements of the system from participating in
domestic investment. Directors also encouraged the authorities to enhance transparency and
accountability in the governance of the Libyan Investment Authority, consistent with
international good practices.
Directors noted that the currency peg to the SDR has served Libya well. They cautioned that
continued fiscal expansion is likely to lead to an appreciation of the real exchange rate and
deterioration in the external position, which calls for prudent fiscal policy and far-reaching
structural reforms to improve external competitiveness and boost non-oil growth prospects.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Mr. Shakour A. Shaalan, Executive Director for Libya
May 17, 2013
Recent Developments and Challenges
On behalf of the Libyan authorities, I thank staff for their recent engagement and
constructive Article IV Consultation discussions. The authorities highly value the views
of the Fund on Libya’s economic policies and institution-building efforts. A wide-ranging
package of technical assistance is under development in support of the ongoing
rebuilding.
The Libyan economy achieved a remarkable pace of growth in the past year as the
economy strongly rebounded from its collapse during the revolution. The fiscal balance
recorded large surpluses and the accumulation of sizable external reserves resumed.
Notwithstanding the security situation, a considerable pick up in reconstruction and
private demand were evident, and both are expected to grow considerably over the next
several years.
While Libya’s prospects are favorable with continued high growth in the near term, the
authorities recognize that the country faces challenges. Addressing these challenges has
been the subject of valuable discussions with Fund staff. The authorities’ key priorities
rightly include plans for extensive institution building, comprehensive fiscal reforms,
strengthening management of the country’s resource wealth and reducing hydrocarbon
dependency through inclusive private sector growth.
Fiscal Developments and Policies
Government finances in Libya are dominated by hydrocarbon income as the main source
of revenue. The restoration of hydrocarbon production resulted in a budget surplus of
about 20 percent of GDP in each of 2012 and 2013, in spite of a sharp increase in current
expenditures. High and rising unemployment and the absence of a social safety net
system necessitated higher public spending, particularly on subsidies. Additionally, the
wage bill is rising in 2013 on account of higher salaries in some priority sectors, such as
the judiciary, and new hiring to address skill mismatches.
However, the authorities are keen to contain the growth of current expenditures and to
redirect resources to education and infrastructure that support the private sector. They
believe that the subsidy bill will shrink as subsidy reforms are introduced and as a
national system for identification is established to help target social expenditures. As for
the public wage bill, it will be easier to contain, once private sector employment
opportunities are generated. In this regard, the staff’s assessment of “limited growth in

private sector jobs in the foreseeable future” may be too pessimistic in view of the major
reconstruction effort and the expected restoration of security and business confidence.
To preserve fiscal sustainability, the authorities are interested in developing a rule-based
medium-term fiscal framework that supports intergenerational equity in the allocation of
hydrocarbon wealth. They look forward to Fund advice in formulating a rule that is
operationally feasible for the current circumstances. They also look forward to
implementing, with Fund advice, a well-sequenced reform strategy of public financial
management reform. This strategy would include public employment and wage structure,
subsidy reform and establishment of a targeted social safety net. In addition, the strategy
would provide a practical road map to enhance capacities in budget formulation, cash
management, and the transparency of fiscal accounting.
Exchange Rate and External Policies
Substantial foreign exchange reserves played a key role in mitigating the impact of
political turmoil during 2011-12 and sustaining confidence in the currency. The
restoration of hydrocarbon exports in 2012 allowed the current account surplus to exceed
35 percent of GDP and reserve accumulation to resume.
The dinar’s peg to the SDR provides a strong monetary anchor. The authorities note
staff’s assessment of the exchange rate level as somewhat overvalued based on the
modified CGER methodology in contrast to the findings of the prior Article IV
consultation. Caution is needed in treating CGER-type estimates as the basis for
prescription of a specific exchange rate target. Questions remain surrounding the validity
of the estimates for commodity exporters, particularly amid significant economic
uncertainty, including with respect to future oil prices and oil discoveries, as noted in
Appendix III. Accordingly, the authorities see merit in formulating alternative scenarios
for oil discoveries and prices when considering questions of intergenerational equity or
the optimal rate of hydrocarbon resource extraction.
Financial Developments and Policies
The Central Bank of Libya has taken steps to implement a dual banking system that
includes Sharia-compliant and conventional banking in Libya. They are keen not to
disrupt financial intermediation nor undermine the financial sector’s contribution to
diversified economic development. The Central Bank of Libya recently adopted
procedures to prevent unlicensed financial services (such as exchange and transfer
agencies) and is looking into a broader financial sector reform to bolster regulation and
supervision. So far, banks held up well in spite of some deterioration in asset quality
during the conflict as their substantial reserves helped mitigate liquidity constraints and
the impact of sanctions.

Structural Reforms for Inclusive Growth
The authorities attach the highest priority to private sector-led job creation and economic
diversification. In addition to gearing public spending in this direction, the government
intends to launch programs that facilitate credit to small and medium enterprises and is
working to remove legislative uncertainty and improve the business environment,
including by streamlining the regulatory framework.
