STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 2, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Background: Political transition is advancing and economic reforms—supported by
large external inflows including the 2012 Rapid Credit Facility (RCF)—helped Yemen
stabilize its macroeconomy. However, the political and security situation remains fragile,
and poverty and unemployment are widespread. Furthermore, the underlying fiscal
deficit has recently widened, and large wage and subsidy outlays crowd out social
spending and investment.
Outlook and risks: The fledgling recovery is projected to continue over the medium
term, supported by the implementation of the authorities’ economic plans. However,
stronger reforms and donor support are needed to achieve sustainable high and
inclusive growth as well as prevent a deterioration in public debt and the external
position. Delays in reforms, shortfalls in donor support, or sabotage activities that curtail
oil and electricity supply could undermine the stabilization gains, reduce growth
prospects, and threaten fiscal and external sustainability. Managing these risks will
require an unwavering commitment to, and broad-based support for, the reform
agenda, and careful contingency planning.
Policy Discussions focused on how to safeguard macroeconomic stability, improve
fiscal and external sustainability, and boost inclusive growth, while better protecting the
poor. There was broad agreement on the need to reorient public expenditures to
infrastructure and targeted transfers for social protection, increase non-hydrocarbon
revenues, improve public finance management, and expedite structural policies to
improve the business environment and develop the financial sector while preserving its
stability. The authorities have announced initial measures to improve governance and
efficiency in the energy sector. They agreed with staff on the need for comprehensive
subsidies reforms, but are not ready to implement stronger measures that are needed to
reduce the large energy subsidy bill. Postponing such reforms increases risks to
macroeconomic stability and growth, hinders more effective social protection, and will
require stronger adjustments down the road.
Other Article IV Issues: Further progress is needed to improve data, advance the WTO
accession process, and strengthen capacity in AML/CFT.

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

CONTEXT
1.
Yemen’s geopolitical situation is critical from regional and global perspectives. On the
border of Saudi Arabia and overlooking al-Mandeb Strait across the Horn of Africa, Yemen is
strategically important for stability in the region as well as security of key oil and commercial
maritime routes. High unemployment and poverty contribute to political tensions that are further
compounded by conflict with the Southern separatist and Houthi movements.
2.
In 2011, Yemen experienced a political crisis that triggered a political transition
process and led to a decline in economic output. The deterioration in security and supply
bottlenecks aggravated the already high unemployment and poverty levels. Gross international
reserves declined and the rial depreciated substantially. This, together with supply bottlenecks, led
to double-digit inflation. The fiscal balance deteriorated moderately and foreign assistance declined
somewhat, forcing the government to substantially cut public investment and further increase
domestic borrowing. After nearly a year of social unrest, a political agreement supported by the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) led to the formation of a National Unity Government in December 2011
and the election of a new president in February 2012 to manage a two-year transition period.
3.
The political situation is gradually improving, but remains fragile. The National
Dialogue, which aims to achieve political reconciliation and prepare for a new constitution, started
on March 18, 2013. All major political factions are participating, despite resistance from the
Southern separatist and Houthi movements. The armed forces have been restructured but security
remains poor, with frequent attacks on energy facilities.
4.
Fund-supported programs helped achieve macroeconomic stabilization. The last
Article IV Consultation was concluded on January 8, 20101 and Executive Directors highlighted the
need for prudent macroeconomic policies and sustained structural reforms to restore stability,
support growth, and reduce poverty. The authorities have been generally receptive to Fund policy
advice, particularly when supported by Fund-arrangements. Before its cancellation on April 4, 2012,
the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) program, which had been approved on July 30, 2010, helped in
stabilizing the rial, safeguarding foreign exchange reserves, and advancing important fiscal
reforms—including the introduction of the General Sales Tax (GST). Performance in the first half
of 2012 under the RCF that followed the ECF was also strong. The authorities met all the indicative
targets under the RCF and implemented additional fiscal measures, including some fuel price
increases.
5.
Nevertheless, enormous challenges remain. Unemployment—currently estimated to
average 25 percent and about 40 percent for the youth—is very high, and poverty and malnutrition
are widespread (Appendix II). The large share of wages and generalized subsidies constrain pro1

growth and pro-poor expenditures, and adversely impacts fiscal sustainability. Yemen also faces
severe water shortages that can have serious social and economic implications over the medium and
long term.
6.
The authorities have developed an economic reform agenda to address these
challenges. These reforms include raising non-hydrocarbon revenue, enhancing financial stability
and intermediation, strengthening institutions and governance, and improving the investment
climate to boost growth and reduce oil dependence. They also include governance and efficiency
measures in the energy sector, but leave out staff’s proposal for a gradual increase in fuel prices in
order to reduce generalized subsidies and re-direct resources to more effective social protection
and infrastructure investment.
7.
Donors have pledged substantial resources to support Yemen’s political transition and
economic reform. The Friends of Yemen have pledged about $8 billion for the three year
period 2012-2014 to support projects included in the Transitional Program for Stabilization and
Development. So far $1.8 billion has been disbursed, including $1 billion Saudi deposit at the
Central Bank of Yemen (CBY).

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
A. Recent Developments
8.
The macroeconomic situation stabilized in 2012 but the recovery remains fragile. After
contracting by more than 12 percent in 2011, real GDP is estimated to have grown by 2.4 percent
in 2012, reflecting an easing of supply bottlenecks and utilization of part of idle capacity. On the
other hand, oil production declined further, due to continued sabotage of the pipelines. Average
inflation declined to 9.9 percent from 19.5 percent in 2011, reflecting the appreciation of the rial to
its pre-crisis level, the moderation of international food prices, and the easing of supply shortages.
Money supply grew faster than nominal GDP, particularly in the second semester, driven by
government borrowing, while private sector credit contracted marginally (Figure 1).
9.
The external position has strengthened substantially in 2012, due largely to
exceptional Saudi support. The current account deficit narrowed in 2012 to about 1 percent of
GDP compared to 4.1 percent in the preceding year. Imports and non-hydrocarbon exports showed
a strong recovery from their sharp decline in the previous year, while oil exports suffered from
frequent sabotage of the key pipeline. Transfers increased, reflecting a Saudi oil grant of around
$2 billion and strong growth in workers’ remittances. The capital account also benefited from a
$1 billion Saudi deposit at CBY. Consequently, gross reserves increased to $5.6 billion, equivalent to
about 5.5 months of imports.
10.
The budget deficit widened to 6.3 percent of GDP due to higher spending, including
on wages and subsidies. Notwithstanding some increases in domestic fuel prices, subsidies
increased to about 9 percent of GDP. Furthermore, the hiring of additional government employees

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

and the payment of retroactive wage settlements led to an increase in the wage bill to about
11 percent of GDP. Capital spending increased but remained below its pre-crisis level. On the
revenue side, the decline in oil revenue was more than compensated for by an increase in tax
revenue and the exceptional level of Saudi grants. The non-hydrocarbon primary deficit excluding
grants deteriorated to 21.1 percent of GDP, compared to 17.6 percent a year earlier. Public debt
remained moderate at about 48 percent of GDP, with the external part constituting about
18 percent.
11.
Money supply in 2012 increased by 21 percent, reflecting higher net foreign assets and
net credit to the government. Most of this increase took place in the second semester, which was
beyond the indicative benchmarks set under the RCF. With the deceleration in inflation, the CBY
reduced the policy interest rate in October 2012 from 20 to 18 percent, and again to 15 percent in
February 2013. However, despite the substantial excess reserves in the banking system, private
sector credit contracted slightly, reflecting the still high real interest rate, the fledgling recovery, and
the high credit risk. On the other hand, net claims on government increased by 29 percent.
12.
The banking system is stable, notwithstanding some vulnerabilities. Banks are on
aggregate profitable and liquid with the capital adequacy ratio estimated at 29.6 percent at end
December 2012, partly due to the large share of zero risk-weighted government securities in the
banks’ portfolios and the high interest rates earned on these securities.2 However, non-performing
loans stood at 25.5 percent, reflecting the level of credit risk and some deficiencies in commercial
banks’ risk management capacities.3 Islamic banks are also challenged by limited eligible domestic
investment opportunities. Financial markets and the payment system that are essential for banks’
capacity to manage liquidity are underdeveloped.

B. Outlook and Risks
13.
The authorities have developed a reform plan to safeguard macroeconomic stability
and begin to address structural challenges with a view to achieve fiscal consolidation and
create an enabling environment for growth. The plan includes a broad range of measures to
increase tax revenues, contain wages, strengthen bank supervision, improve efficiency and
governance. The authorities have begun to implement some of the measures including in the
energy sector. However, the gradual fuel price adjustment that is critical for reducing the magnitude
of subsidies to create fiscal space for pro-growth infrastructure expenditures and pro-poor targeted
transfers for social protection is currently not included in this plan.

2

At end-2012, government paper in the balance sheet of conventional banks that participate in treasury securities
auctions accounted for around 50 percent of their total assets. Islamic banks do not participate in the treasury bills
and bond markets and, place their money mostly in foreign assets, which at end-2012 accounted for 64 percent of
their total assets.

3

The large share of NPLs does not currently pose stability risks because private sector credit accounts for a small
share of total assets.

14.
Under this policy scenario, staff projects that GDP growth would average around
4 percent over the medium term (Tables 1 and 8). This growth is underpinned by nonhydrocarbon growth which is projected to range between 4.0–4.5 percent over the medium term,
helped by a steady increase in utilizing idle capacity, donor-supported investment, and structural
reforms. Oil production on the other hand is expected to recover partially as the political transition
progresses and sabotage activities are reduced, but would thereafter resume its long term declining
trend. Given the limited financing availability, infrastructure and social spending would be less than
desirable, and fiscal adjustment would still be moderate. As a result public debt would increase
gradually over the medium term, to reach about 55 percent of GDP. Inflation is projected to
moderate only slightly over the medium term given the fiscal path. The external position would
worsen in the absence of stronger reforms or additional external support, with the current account
deficit widening to about 4 percent of GDP and official reserves coverage declining to 2.5–
3.0 months of imports.
15.
Delays in implementing comprehensive, yet gradual, energy subsidies reform would
necessitate a sharper future adjustment. Gradual energy price adjustments would create room for
higher infrastructure investment and effective social spending that would enhance growth and
employment creation and better protect the poor. At the same time, it would enhance fiscal and
external sustainability, keeping public debt at below 50 percent of GDP and reserves coverage at
above 3 months of imports. Stronger reforms would also encourage somewhat higher donor
disbursement, although such an increase would be limited, since most of the pledges are projectrelated. The impact on donor support for additional budget capital spending would, however, be
larger, although this would be mitigated by recent support from regional donors, including the Arab
Monetary Fund, which recently approved additional budget support of almost $100 million for this
year.
16.
There are potential risks to the outlook, which are summarized, along with mitigating
policies, in the Risk Assessment Matrix (Appendix I). These risks include political and security
developments, a decline in international oil prices, shortfall in donor support, and a further
tightening of expatriate labor controls in Saudi Arabia leading to lower remittances. On the upside,
the representation of all political parties in the National Dialogue and the coalition nature of the
National Unity Government bodes well for policy continuity. Mitigating the risks will require an
unwavering commitment to the reform process, including a gradual implementation of
comprehensive reforms of generalized subsidies, greater transparency and pro-active
communication on the benefits of reforms, and careful contingency planning.
17.
The authorities are cognizant of these risks and have been making efforts to mitigate
them. The National Dialogue is the key building block for political stability and security. There are
also on-going efforts to deter sabotage of oil pipelines. To speed up disbursement of donor
financing, in February 2013 the government established a new Executive Bureau for the Acceleration
of Aid Absorption (EBAAA) to improve project preparation and coordination. It also set up a Mutual
Accountability Framework in coordination with the World Bank, aimed at monitoring progress in
donors’ assistance and following up on their commitments.

POLICY DISCUSSION—FROM RECOVERY TO
SUSTAINABILITY AND INCLUSIVE GROWTH
18.
The main policy challenges facing Yemen are the need to safeguard macroeconomic
stability and create the conditions for sustained high and inclusive growth to reduce
unemployment and poverty. The authorities agree that this will require substantial reforms in the
fiscal, monetary, financial, and structural areas. They also recognize that economic and social
stability hinges on improving living standards, and have begun to implement the reform agenda.
19.
The policy discussions therefore centered on four main pillars: (i) Restructuring public
expenditures and increasing non-hydrocarbon revenue (ii) Enhancing the monetary and exchange
rate policy framework; (iii) deepening the financial sector while preserving its stability; and
(iv) underpinning growth with structural reforms aimed at further improving public financial
management, governance, and the business environment. Staff also discussed debt sustainability,
trade, anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) efforts, and the
adequacy of economic and financial statistics.

A. Fiscal Policies and Reforms: Achieving Sustainability and Creating Space
for Growth-Enhancing Expenditures and Social Protection
20.
The authorities and staff broadly agreed on the urgency of fiscal reforms. There was
also agreement that reforms should aim to improve sustainability and create fiscal space for an
increase in pro-poor and pro-growth spending, while enhancing public financial management.
21.
The fiscal targets in the 2013 budget are consistent with achieving some consolidation.
Assuming adherence to the government’s reform plan, the overall deficit would decline from
6.3 percent of GDP in 2012 to 5.8 percent in 2013 and fluctuate around that level over the medium
term (Table 3). The underlying fiscal position would improve over the medium term, but the public
debt would increase from 48 percent of GDP at present to about 55 percent of GDP.
22.
The authorities aim to raise non-oil revenues by increasing tax collections and
improving tax and customs administration. The ratio of tax revenue to GDP is currently low by
regional and international standards (Figure 3 and Appendix III). Efforts would focus on improving
compliance of large tax payers, combating evasion, and strengthening customs administration. In
this regard, the authorities plan to: (i) introduce pre-shipment inspection of imports to reduce
under-invoicing; (ii) upgrade IT systems in both the tax and customs authorities to facilitate timely
sharing of data and real-time monitoring of inspection areas; (iii) not allow any amendments to
the 2010 Investment Law that may include extension of tax or customs exemptions, new or
retroactive; and (iv) review tax legislation, with a view to introduce further enhancements.

23.
The authorities have taken initial steps to improve efficiency and governance in the
energy sector, but their plan does not fundamentally address the large and untargeted energy
subsidies. These subsidies which currently absorb about 9 percent of GDP and around two thirds of
hydrocarbon revenues reduce space for pro-growth and pro-poor expenditures, and
disproportionately benefit the better off (Box 1). Staff therefore recommended a gradual increase in
selected fuel prices and unifying diesel prices, while increasing infrastructure investment and
targeted transfers to mitigate the impact on the poor.4 Staff also recommended launching a broad
public communication campaign to build greater understanding of the costs of the generalized
energy subsidies and the benefits from reform. The authorities have since taken steps to unify the
price of diesel across most users, including in particular the electricity sector.5 They also recognize
the need for subsidies reform, but are not ready to implement stronger, even if gradual, measures at
this stage.
24.
The authorities plan to contain the wage bill, which has exceeded 11 percent of GDP.
The nominal wage bill will increase in 2013, reflecting a decision in early 2012 to make generalized
payment of some benefits that were originally granted to selected public sector employees.
However, in relation to GDP, the wage bill is projected to decline to about 10 percent, assuming no
further extension or retroactive granting of additional compensation. The authorities agreed with
staff’s recommendation to put in place a plan to eliminate ghost workers and double dippers, which
includes full implementation of the biometric identification system throughout the civil service as
well as the military and police.
25.
The deficit will be financed by a combination of domestic borrowing, concessional
external support, and some use of reserves. Staff encouraged the authorities and donors to work
on expediting disbursement of pledges and to mobilize more external funds for the budget in order
to reduce crowding out of the private sector and to continuing relying on concessional borrowing to
avoid increasing the debt service burden. Staff also suggested issuing more Sukuk in place of
treasury bills to tap into the excess liquidity in Islamic banks and reduce the cost of borrowing. In
staff’s view, some drawdown of reserves is feasible given the current comfortable level equivalent to
more than 5 months of imports, which is due to the exceptional external support in 2012. However,
over the medium term, stronger reforms and donor support will be needed to avoid a steady
decline in reserves to a level that would impair capacity to deter speculations or smooth exogenous
shocks.
26.
The debt sustainability analysis was updated and points to a moderate level of debt
distress (Appendix II). This is an upgrade from past analyses which pointed to high distress. Past
analyses projected the net present value (NPV) of exports to exceed the threshold on the
assumption that oil reserves would be depleted in the near to medium term. This assumption has

been updated in view of the low level of extraction of proven reserves over the past years and the
use of credible estimates from well-established international sources that report a higher level of
proven reserves. Thus, oil exports, while still declining, are projected to last for a longer period than
previously assumed.
27.
The authorities indicated their determination to keep the deficit within their target.
Staff cautioned that fiscal slippages would increase the financing gaps which, in the absence of
additional donor support, would require increasing domestic financing with further adverse
consequences for macroeconomic stability, fiscal and external sustainability, and private sector
credit. The authorities shared staff’s view and indicated plans to instruct in writing spending
agencies, including in line ministries, to strictly stay within the budget. Unforeseen and unavoidable
outlays over and above the budget spending envelope will have to be accompanied by
compensatory cuts in lower priority spending.
28.
The authorities are also continuing to implement reforms to strengthen public
financial management, including strengthening the treasury functions at the ministry of finance
and improving the process for planning and execution of public spending. These reforms include: (i)
closing multiple government accounts and moving them into a treasury single account; (ii) rolling
out of the Accounting-based Financial Management Information System (AFMIS) to line ministries
and local governments; and (iii) implementing the cash management and commitment control
systems. These reforms and their time lines are being coordinated with technical assistance experts.

Box 1. Yemen: Energy Subsidies and Reforms
Energy subsidies in Yemen are very high and represent a major drain on the budget and Yemen’s
exhaustible resources. While the subsidy bill is at less

Energy subsidies are not targeted and create major economic distortions and opportunities for
corruption. In particular, these generalized subsidies benefit mainly the rich—since they consume most fuel
and electricity—and provide incentives for overconsumption, inefficiencies, and smuggling. Furthermore,
they exacerbate Yemen’s critical environmental problems by artificially reducing the cost of pumping scarce
underground water.
Reducing energy subsidies would create fiscal space for
more growth-enhancing expenditures and more
efficient and effective social protection. Capital
expenditures have in the past borne the brunt of fiscal
adjustment and the space for increasing efficient social
protection to poor families has been limited. A gradual
reduction in energy subsidies would create sufficient space
for these pro-growth pro-poor expenditures, while
improving fiscal sustainability.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies: Ensuring a Robust Monetary and
Exchange Rate Policy Framework
29.
Monetary policy should continue to focus on achieving price stability, while
supporting private sector credit growth. Despite the recent reduction in the benchmark deposit
rate, real interest rates remain high and constrain demand for credit. The authorities agreed with
staff recommendations to consider further cuts in the benchmark rate, if inflation declines further,
while remaining vigilant to both upside and downside risks and standing ready to adjust policies.
30.
The monetary policy framework would benefit from modification and there is need to
develop interbank markets. The authorities currently target banks’ minimum interest rate on
deposits, which is used as the benchmark for other rates, including treasury bills. (Appendix IV). The
authorities noted that the framework has succeeded in stabilizing prices and the exchange rate.
However, staff noted concerns that the use of a high benchmark deposit rate increases the cost of
funding for the government and for banks and leads to high lending rates. Moreover, the
combination of high interest rates and stable exchange rate creates an incentive for speculative
capital flows. The absence of interbank markets also reduces the effectiveness of monetary policy
transmission. The authorities agreed on the need to replace the current benchmark rate with a more
conventional framework, to enhance monetary policy tools and to develop interbank markets. They
requested technical assistance to ensure appropriate sequencing so as to achieve a seamless
transition.
31.
Islamic finance instruments are needed to improve the efficacy of monetary policy and
deepen the financial sector. Islamic banks constitute about one third of the banking sector assets,
and do not participate in the treasury bill and bond markets since these instruments are not Sharia
compliant. The government has not issued any Sukuks after the debut of the two initial issues
in 2011 and 2012, hence Islamic banks have excess liquidity that is largely invested in foreign assets.
The authorities agreed with staff recommendation to improve the framework for Sukuk issuance and
to build the necessary technical capacity at the Ministry of Finance and the CBY.
32.
The exchange rate is assessed to be broadly in line with fundamentals, but greater
flexibility would help preserve reserves and support competitiveness (Box 2). The reserves level,
equivalent to more than 5 months of imports, while currently adequate largely is helped by the
Saudi deposit and will likely decline gradually unless the exceptional external support of 2012 is
repeated. Staff noted the need for a greater degree of exchange rate flexibility as a buffer to shocks
and to support efforts to diversify exports, by enhancing the competitiveness of the nonhydrocarbon sector. The authorities broadly agreed with this analysis and intend to continue to
maintain a system that allows the exchange rate to reflect market fundamentals and to limit
interventions in the foreign exchange market to smoothing out volatility. They agreed that fiscal
policy will also need to be supportive of the exchange rate and inflation objectives.

Box 2. Exchange Rate Assessment
Staff’s econometric estimates suggest that the rial is broadly in line with fundamentals. Increased
flexibility in the exchange rate is, however, desirable in order to protect reserves and support output
and export diversification.
The level of the Yemeni rial has been
closely related to oil prices, reflecting

Large deviations of the REER from its trend level were associated with large changes in oil prices. An errorcorrection regression suggests that deviations from the equilibrium REER measured by oil prices are
corrected by 8 percent on average in the following quarter.
CGER-type analyses show mixed results. The macroeconomic balance approach suggests some
overvaluation (2.3 percent) while the external sustainability approach points to an undervaluation (8.5 percent). These two approaches suggest that the real exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals.

C. The Financial Sector: Enhancing Intermediation and Contribution to
Growth while Maintaining Stability
33.
Financial sector policies aim at facilitating credit growth while maintaining the health
of the banks. Yemen’s banking sector plays a small intermediation role.6 Besides the high lending
rates that constrain demand, banks are reluctant to lend to the private sector due to weaknesses in
the insolvency regime and judiciary infrastructure for enforcing creditor rights, in addition to the
weak economic environment. The large financing needs of the government also crowd out the
private sector.7 The authorities, with assistance from the World Bank, have developed a credit
registry and also assigned specialized judges to commercial cases, but additional reforms are
needed to enhance their effectiveness. It would also be useful to establish a collateral registry, and
for the CBY to undertake loan surveys to better understand credit conditions.
34.
Banking supervision is being strengthened. Yemen’s banking system is on aggregate
stable, although there is some vulnerability related to high credit risk, loan concentrations, and
insider lending. The authorities, with METAC support, have identified areas for reform, including: (i)
developing the regulatory and supervisory framework for Islamic banking; (ii) improving processes
for data submission by commercial banks; (iii) developing a data warehouse to improve
communication with banks; (iv) enhancing corporate governance; (v) strengthening consolidated
supervision, cross border supervision, and macro prudential surveillance; and (vi) increasing
oversight of risk management practices in commercial banks.
35.
The authorities are also improving the legal and operational framework for bank
resolution. Though the banking law gives the CBY powers to resolve banks, there are important
gaps in the tools and operational capacity. The CBY, in coordination with technical assistance
experts, is currently developing guidelines for Prompt Corrective Action (PCA). The Fund has
completed a review of the Banking Act which will help in developing a comprehensive strategy to
address gaps.
36.
The authorities are making some progress in addressing FATF recommendations but
certain AML/CFT deficiencies remain. The Financial Intelligence Unit has been strengthened,
including by giving it more independence. However, it still remains to become fully operational and
effective. In line with the action plan agreed with FATF, the authorities committed to: (i) adequately
criminalize money laundering and terrorist financing; (ii) establish and implement adequate
procedures to identify and freeze terrorist assets; and (iii) to develop the monitoring and supervisory
capacity of the CBY and the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). Adequate progress is urgently needed
to prevent the FATF to call its members to apply counter-measures which could have an adverse
impact on the Yemen economy, including loss of international bank relationship and of higher
financial intermediation costs.

Private sector credit as a percentage of GDP was estimated at 5 percent of GDP and accounted for only 15 percent
of banking system assets.

Over 50 percent of the banking system assets are in government paper and another 25 percent is in foreign assets.

D. Structural Reforms: Facilitating Diversification and Inclusive Growth
37.
Higher and inclusive growth will require tackling structural impediments, in addition
to addressing the macroeconomic challenges. This will require measures to improve the business
environment and to reduce the high unemployment and poverty, including through improved
governance, infrastructure investment and a job creating growth strategy.
38.
Staff agreed with the authorities’ plan to expedite and broaden structural reforms.
Yemen currently ranks very low in ease of doing business. The business climate is constrained by a
complicated regulatory environment, uncertain property rights, and limited access to domestic
finance, particularly to SMEs that have potential to boost inclusive growth and job creation.
Improvements in governance and transparency will be critical. Poor governance and corruption are
reported to be endemic and localized patronage continues to be a strong element of social
protection. The authorities agree on the need for enhanced transparency and a well functioning
legal infrastructure. Yemen finalized the negotiations on the WTO membership with all but one of its
members, and hope to achieve accession soon.
39.
Yemen’s infrastructure is inadequate to support economic and social development. It is
the least electrified country in the MENA region, with a total power capacity catering for only half of
the demand. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that approximately 35 percent
of the urban population and 5 percent of rural households have access to electricity, with supply
remaining intermittent and more recently a target for sabotage activities. Other infrastructure is also
lacking, including the housing stock. Staff underscored the need to channel donor support to
improve the road and energy infrastructure and the provision of health and education services.
40.
The authorities have begun to further enhance CBY independence and governance
framework. An update safeguards assessment was concluded in June 2013 and noted that steps
have been taken to strengthen governance at the CBY with the appointment of new members to the
Board and the establishment of an Audit Committee, which has members with financial expertise.
However, political and economic events have strained CBY’s financial autonomy with the CBY
extending credit to the government beyond limits specified in the law. The authorities indicated that
they plan to develop a schedule for repayment of this credit. In addition, and more generally, they
agreed to ensure central bank operational independence and have recently published its full audited
financial statements.
41.
Addressing the high unemployment and poverty remains a priority. The already high
unemployment levels could be made worse by the tightening of immigration controls in the Gulf
region. Addressing the unemployment challenge and poverty will require a multifaceted approach,
including improving the structure of public spending, enhancing the business environment and
access to financial services, supporting SME’s, and reforming education and vocational training.

E. Improving the Quality of Statistics for Economic Management

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

42.
Improving financial and economic statistics is key to enhancing analysis and guiding
policy formulation. While data are broadly adequate for surveillance, there are important gaps in
quality and coverage of GDP statistics, and improvements are needed for output as well as inflation,
unemployment, and balance of payments statistics. The authorities indicated that they are
addressing the deterioration in capacity that occurred in recent years. Some progress is already
being made in improving national accounts and CPI statistics.

STAFF APPRAISAL
43.
Despite a challenging environment, the Yemeni authorities made progress towards
achieving macroeconomic stability and advancing political transition. Economic activity has
picked up, inflation declined substantially, and the exchange rate has appreciated to its pre-crisis
level. The national dialogue for political reconciliation is advancing, the security forces have been
restructured, and elections are scheduled for February 2014.
44.
However, substantial challenges remain. The recovery is still at an early stage and could
be weakened by the continued sabotage of key oil pipelines that curtail production. The underlying
fiscal position deteriorated in 2012, despite large grants, and near and medium term financing
needs are large. The large share of wages and generalized energy subsidies in the budget constrains
space for pro-poor and pro-growth expenditures. Unemployment remains very high, especially
among the youth, and poverty and malnutrition are widespread. Serious environmental challenges,
including the rapid extraction of scarce ground water, pose economic and social risks. Economic
prospects will, therefore, depend critically on sustained implementation of reforms, further progress
on the political and security fronts, and continued donor support, including for budget financing.
45.
Fiscal policy should focus on reorienting expenditures from energy subsidies to progrowth capital expenditures and targeted transfers for social protection. Energy subsidies
represent a large drain on the budget, absorbing two thirds of hydrocarbon revenues and reducing
resources that could be invested for economic growth and social development. The recent decision
to unify the price of diesel in order to improve efficiency and governance is welcome but needs to
be complemented with an urgent implementation of comprehensive, albeit gradual, subsidy reform.
Such reform would create room to finance the much needed infrastructure investment and targeted
transfers. An increase in these transfers and proactive communication by the government on the
benefits of subsidy reforms could help build public support.
46.
The authorities’ plans to increase non-oil revenues and contain the wage bill are
welcome. Containing the wage bill and eliminating ghost workers would be critical to enhancing
fiscal sustainability. It is also important to continue to strengthen compliance of large tax payers,
avoid tax exemptions, and enhance customs administration, including by introducing pre-shipment
inspection of imports. Strengthening budget control and treasury operations would help improve
public finance management. Furthermore, strict adherence to the budget targets is necessary to
avoid an increase in the already large financing needs. Contingency measures should be drawn and
implemented as needed to safeguard the deficit targets, while protecting social outlays.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

47.
The authorities need to further advance recent efforts to ensure timely donor
disbursement of pledges and attract budget support. Strict implementation of reforms would
serve as a catalyst for donor support. Close collaboration and monitoring through the Mutual
Accountability Framework and effective operation of the Executive Bureau to improve project
preparation would also be critical. External assistance is key to reducing the crowding out of private
sector credit and lowering the cost of borrowing. Furthermore, timely and increased concessional
support from donors will be critical to help cushion the impact of any future subsidies reform. At the
same time, continued prudence in external borrowing would help maintain the recently upgraded
moderate level of debt distress.
48.
Monetary and exchange rate policy has provided an anchor to inflation but
improvements are needed to the framework. The monetary policy framework needs to gradually
move from direct control of interest rates and reliance on the primary market of government papers
to a more efficient indirect approach that would also help develop the interbank market and
enhance banks’ liquidity management. Increased issuance of Sukuk would help absorb the excess
liquidity of Islamic banks and lower the cost of government borrowing. Furthermore, reduced
domestic public borrowing will be critical in providing space for banks to extend credit to the private
sector and lower interest rates in order to support private sector credit. The exchange rate is
estimated to be broadly in line with fundamentals, but greater flexibility is desirable to preserve
reserves, provide a cushion against external shocks and support export diversification.
49.
Developing the financial system while preserving its health is needed to promote
inclusive growth. Expanding access to financial services will require enhancing the collection and
dissemination of credit information while strengthening supervision and banks’ ability to assess risks
and collect collateral. In this regard, staff welcomes the ongoing effort to improve banking
supervision, regulation and resolution framework as well as the financial infrastructures. The
authorities are encouraged to further improve the AML/CFT framework.
50.
Structural reforms aimed at improving governance and the business environment are
also essential to support growth and job creation. To achieve higher and inclusive growth, it is
imperative to address the infrastructure gaps, improve the business climate and level the playing
field, promote access to financial services, and strengthen public institutions. Improved security of
the oil pipeline and electricity transmission should be given priority. In addition, strengthening
implementation capacity would help expedite donor disbursements for project finance and could
help alleviate critical infrastructure bottlenecks.
51.
The data provided to the Fund are broadly adequate for surveillance. However,
improvements are needed, particularly in national accounts, CPI, and balance of payments statistics.
Development of other high frequency economic indicators would enhance analysis and better guide
policy formulation.
52.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12
month cycle.

1/ Hydrocarbon includes oil and LNG sectors.
2/ Data includes Saudi grant in kind in 2011 of 3 million barrels of crude oil, and about US$ 1.8 million of refined oil products in 2012. Figures
from 2013 onwards reflect committed donor disbursements.
3/ The negative direct investment numbers reported in the table reflects cost recovery by foreign gas and oil companies. In 2012, this also reflects
the expiration of the foreign concession of Masila oil block and the transfer of its ownership back to government.
4/ A large increase of gross reserves in 2012 is associated Saudi US$ 1 billion deposits at the CBY.

Appendix II. Unemployment, Poverty, and Human
Development Indicators in Yemen1
1.
Unemployment is one of the most important challenges facing Yemen. It contributes to
undermining political and security stability particularly as it is highly concentrated among the youth.
Estimates of unemployment range from 15 to 40 percent, with the Central Statistical Organization of
Yemen at the lower end of this range. The labor force is only about 40 percent of the total population
in the age group 15–64, with men constituting about 90 percent. The population is very young
(42 percent is under the age of 15 and 65 percent is under the age of 24) and growing rapidly
(3.0 percent annually).
2.
The 2011 political crisis further aggravated unemployment. Due to the suspension of most
investment projects and the decline in economic activity, many workers were laid off or forced to take
unpaid leave or lower salaries. Unofficial estimates suggest that as many as to one million workers may
have lost their jobs during the crisis.
3.
Immigration reforms in the Gulf region could worsen the unemployment situation.

4.
Nearly half the population lives below the poverty line of $2 a day. Poverty is estimated to
have risen from about 43 percent of the population in 2009 to almost 55 percent in 2011. Poverty is
especially high in rural areas, which are home to about 73 percent of the population and 84 percent of
the poor.
5.
Other social indicators are also alarming. In addition to the 2011 political crisis, the 2010–11
increase in international food prices contributed to exacerbating poverty. The U.N. World Food
Program estimates that nearly 45 percent of the population was food insecure in 2012. According to
the World Bank, Yemen has one of the highest malnutrition rates in the world. Almost 60 percent of
children under the age of five have chronic malnutrition, 35 percent are underweight, and 13 percent
have acute malnutrition. In addition, 27 percent of pregnant women and 35 percent of lactating women
are malnourished. Maternal mortality, at 365 per 100,000 live births, is among the highest in the world.
The infant mortality rate stood at 69 per 1,000 live births in 2009. In general, Yemen ranks poorly in all
social indicators and occupies the 154th position (out of 184) on the U.N. Human Development
Indicators list.

Appendix III. Fiscal Policy and Structural Reforms in Yemen9
A. Overview
1.
There is an urgent need to restructure government finances to create space for
effective social spending and the much needed scaling up of public sector investment while
enhancing long term fiscal and external sustainability. Oil receipts, which make up about half of
total budget revenues, are on a declining trend. At the same time, tax revenues, which are less than
25 percent of total revenues, have remained low at about 7 percent of GDP or less recently. On the
expenditure side, current expenditures make up about 80‒90 percent of total expenditures, with
wages and subsidies accounting for about two thirds of current expenditures and public investment
remaining at less than 15 percent of total expenditures. Fuel subsidies account for over 25 percent
of total expenditures and about 9 percent of GDP.
2.
Prior to the 2011 political crisis, some progress was made in developing a modern tax
system. A modern investment law was introduced in 2010. A general sales tax (GST) was fully
implemented and most income tax and customs exemptions were eliminated in 2010. The Tax
Authority was reorganized along functional lines. The new law introduced self-assessment,
strengthened the penalty regime, and classified taxpayers under large, medium, small, and microenterprise. However, progress in these reforms stalled during the political crisis in 2011, and there
was a decline in compliance and lower tax revenues. Revenue collection recovered in 2012, rising to
about 7 percent of GDP. Nonetheless, further efforts are needed to improve compliance and reduce
tax evasion.
3.
Substantial scope remains to improve the tax regime. There is an urgent need to
rationalize the General Sales Tax (GST) registration and to improve coordination between Tax and
Customs Authorities. Furthermore, the number of registered taxpayers—about 3080, of which 2000
are large tax payers—is very low. Yemen has a cumbersome tax system. The supporting tax
documentation necessary to file a tax is complex and subject to different interpretations. In addition,
enforcement powers of the Tax Authority are not sufficient—and were further weakened during the
crisis. There is a need to start a new partnership with the business community to strengthen tax
compliance, strengthen penalty provisions, and enhance capacity to perform tax audits.
4.
Some positive steps were made in the Public Financial Management (PFM) area
through 2010, but more remains to be done. These included: (i) piloting the Accounting-based
Financial Management Information System (AFMIS) in four line ministries; (ii) developing mediumterm fiscal estimates; and (iii) establishing a cash management unit. However, the overall pace of the
PFM reforms, remains slow. There remains challenges to an establishing single treasure account
(STA) including: (i) a fragmented management of the PFM reform process; (ii) a weak and dispersed
institutional framework for PFM reforms, in particular in the treasury area; and (iii) a general lack of

financial discipline, in particular, overrides of expenditure controls that could significantly undermine
the effectiveness of the planned new expenditure control systems.

B. Cross Country Perspective10
5.
Yemen’s overall tax to GDP ratio is relatively low. Tax to GDP ratio is about 7 percent
compared with about 13 percent in low income countries, and about 13.6 percent for comparator
countries. Key contributing factors include the low general sales tax (GST) rate of 5 percent (the
lowest among the comparator countries) and the high threshold for paying GST tax (e.g., Yemen’s
GST threshold is $233,000, for Morocco it is $21,000). Additional key factors include capacity
constraints in tax and customs administrations, low compliance, and lack of confidence and low
collaboration between the tax authorities and the business community.

Almost one-half of tax revenues come from income taxes (in particular taxes on wages

Government expenditures have been persistently dominated by the rise in recurrent
spending. Spending on wages and subsidies continues to be high and rising. Wages which were
estimated to be around 10 percent of GDP in 2011 increased to about 11 percent of GDP in 2012,
following the government’s decision to increase wages in 2011 in response to demonstrations and
mounting social tensions. This is high, even when compared to the average of about 8 percent of
GDP in Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Subsidies have registered about 9 percent of
GDP in recent years compared to 7 percent in MENA. In contrast, capital expenditures continue to
suffer—declining from about 5 percent of GDP before the crisis to about 2‒4 percent of GDP
in 2011‒12, and are very low compared to the 9 percent of GDP for MENA.

C. Priority Measures
8.
The main objective of fiscal policy for 2013 and the medium terms is to strengthen
fiscal consolidation and create space for increasing targeted social spending and much
infrastructure investment. Priority reforms should aim at reducing energy subsidies, containing the
wage bill, and improving tax collection. In addition, improving public financial management and
transparency would help mobilize much needed foreign aid and bridge the resource gap to increase
pro-growth and pro-poor spending. Financial and technical assistance support from donors are
essential to jump start the reform agenda, mitigate any social effects.

D. Tax Policy
9.
The main focus of reforms in 2013 should be to carry forward the measures aimed at
strengthening tax administration, simplifying tax procedures, and reinvigorating the
partnership with the business community to build confidence and improve tax compliance.
10.
The scope for introducing new tax policy measures in 2013 is somewhat hindered
given by the current political environment and the time required for passing new legislation in this
area. However, the authorities indicated that they will oppose any amendments to the 2010
investment law that may weaken tax collection, including the extension or granting of any new tax
or customs exemptions.

36

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

11.

Over the medium-term reforms should focus on:



Reducing to the extent possible, if not completely eliminating, existing tax exemptions and
expanding the tax base.



Increasing gradually the GST tax rate toward the average for low-income countries.



Reducing the GST threshold to a “reasonably high level”, once tax administration is more
efficient and ready to handle a larger number of cases.11



Establishing a regular and periodic review of tax policy and reforms to increase efficiency
and close potential loopholes.

E. Tax Administration
12.

Immediate tax administration reforms measures should include:



Improving coordination between tax and customs authorities.



Expanding the tax base by increasing number of taxpayers (subject to GST) by 20 percent.
Opening (and making fully operational) medium taxpayers’ offices in Sana’a and major cities.



Simplifying tax procedures by strengthening risk analysis in conjunction with the
implementation of self assessments.



Empowering the tax authority to enforce collections and introduce a penalty regime.



Improving capacity of risk based ex-post tax audits by developing risk profiles for large and
medium taxpayers.

13.

Medium term measures in the area of tax administration should include:



Opening more taxpayer’s offices in phases to cover all governorates.



Continuing tax-simplification procedures and strengthening enforcement of collection in
order to increase tax revenues.

F. Customs Administration
11

In 2013, the authorities raised the threshold anew from Yrls 50 million to Yrls 200 million to focus the tax
administration’s efforts on the larger tax payers, particularly to improve compliance.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

37

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

14.

Reforms in the area of customs administration reform should include:



Introducing pre-shipment inspection of imports by hiring the services of a reputable
international company to reduce under-invoicing of imports and improve customs revenue.
Developing and updating the reference price database as a module of Automated System



for Customs Data (ASYCUDA) to prevent under-invoicing.
Replacing the physical inspection of consignment with selective inspection generated by



ASYCUDA, but only after establishing an appropriate information database and improving
staff capacity to identify consignments with risk to revenue.

G. Restructuring of Expenditures
15.
Expenditure reforms should focus on improving the structure of spending. This will
require a gradual reduction in fuel subsidies and wages in percent of GDP and recovery of
hydrocarbon revenues from the low level of 2012. In 2013, the decline in subsidies is projected to
result mainly from the full year effect of increases in the prices of diesel and kerosene which took
effect in April 2012 and from governance and efficiency measures.
16.

Rationalizing energy consumption by government agencies will enhance the credibility

of the government efforts. As a first step, the authorities have decided to unify the price of diesel
across most users, including in particular the electricity sector.12 This measure is not expected to
reduce the very large subsidies' bill, as the public electricity company and the private energy
providers (leased energy) will be fully compensated to avoid an increase in retail electricity prices.
The reform will, however, help reduce incentives for leakages and inefficient consumption of energy,
thereby supporting policies to fight vested interest and smuggling, and phasing out inefficient
energy production schemes. For the private sector, some rationing through a coupons system could
be considered in the future to allocate/limit subsidized fuel consumption by private agents.
17.
Gradually increase the retail prices for fuel and electricity. This reform is crucial to
Yemen’s fiscal adjustment over the medium-term, but also politically difficult. Targeted mitigating
measures—including through direct cash transfers—will have to be implemented in parallel with the
gradual increase in fuel prices to offset the effects on low income households (at the least the
bottom 40 percent of the population).

12

The electricity sector had been paying about half of the prevailing domestic price.

38

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

18.
Other reforms include curtailing non-essential current expenditures in order to create fiscal
space for increased capital and social spending and re-examine policy of subsidizing public
enterprises.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

39

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

H. Public Financial Management
19.

Immediate reforms should focus on:



Developing a roadmap for Public Financial Management (PFM) reforms and speeding up the
transition to a comprehensive treasury system, while rolling out an Accounting- based
Financial Management Information System (AFMIS) to additional line ministries.



Developing a macroeconomic model for cash flow estimates, using seasonal trends of
aggregate budget data and revenue estimates.



Introducing monthly reporting on incurred and outstanding commitments, received and
outstanding invoices, and payments made.

20.

Medium-term measures should include:



Establishment of a Treasury in the Ministry of Finance.



Developing cash management and commitment control functions, while enforcing
regulations that do not allow override of expenditures.



Incorporating special funds and applicable donor funds into the single treasury account
structure.



Rolling out the AFMIS to remaining ministries, and governorates, for budget preparation and
execution, while developing accompanying modules (cash management, commitment
control, debt management).Improving the management of oil revenues and develop a
strategy to extend the life of oil sector in collaboration with ministry of oil.

Appendix IV. Monetary and Financial Reforms1
A. State of the Financial System
1.
Yemen’s financial system is relatively small compared to other countries in the region.2
Total assets at end 2012 were estimated at 30 percent of GDP, much less than the comparable
countries. Private sector credit, an important factor in growth, is around 5 percent of GDP. Banking
and other financial activities are concentrated around Sana’a and Aden as rural branches are
considered non-economical. The postal services, with relatively large branch network, including nonbanked rural areas, provide basic banking services (excluding lending).

The financial system is bank dominated. Banks account for 72 percent of the financial
system assets and pensions follow distantly with 26 percent. Other sectors (insurance, foreign
exchange bureaus and micro finance) are miniscule, there are no equity markets and the debt
market consists mainly of government treasury bills and bonds. The government has not issued any

4.
The banking system is also segmented in the nature of operations. The commercial
banking sector consists of 12 conventional banks and 5 Islamic banks. In terms of ownership, the
conventional banks include 3 state-controlled banks, 4 domestic private banks, and 5 are branches
of foreign owned banks while Islamic banks include one state controlled bank and 4 privately owned
banks. Islamic banks have 31 percent of the market share, followed closely by state-owned banks
with 28.7 percent and domestic private banks with 21.6 percent. Foreign owned banks account for
16.9 percent and micro finance accounts for 14 percent of the market. State-owned banks are
heavily invested in government securities and hold about 50 percent of all government securities
issued and the balance is almost split equally between domestic private banks and foreign owned
banks. Islamic banks do not participate in the market for treasury bills and bonds since these

remains a cash economy and the share of the population that have bank accounts is reported to be
in single digits. At end 2012, the ratio of M2 to non oil GDP was estimated at 50 percent, which is
well below the regional average while currency in circulation, at 29 percent of M2, is very high.

7.
Indicators of soundness are satisfactory but there is need for vigilance. Although the
overall capitalization level of the banking system is above the minimum required level, a couple of
banks are not compliant and non-performing loans (NPLs), at 25 percent, are high and has increased
from its 2011 level of 20.6 percent. However, the high NPLs are more indicative of credit risk rather

than stability risks because most lending are to the government and private sector credit accounts
for a very small share of the banks’ assets. However, if government financing requirement decrease
overtime, banks will have to look for other—relatively more risky—avenues. NPLs could increase
unless prudent supervisory controls are in place and are strictly enforced across the board.

8.
Non-bank financial institutions and markets are small and underdeveloped. The postal
system, which provides deposit services, pensions and transfer services to non-banked rural areas, is
fully computerized and functions adequately. However, other key supporting institutions and
financial markets are either nonexistent or play a limited role. Pension funds, the main liquid nonbank financial market participants, serve as a captive source of government finance and invest in
Treasury bonds at below treasury bill rates. Insurance activity is insignificant, fragmented, and
unsupervised. The money market is limited to treasury bills auctions, and interbank money and
foreign exchange markets have not developed. Leasing is still insignificant.

B. Banking Regulation, Supervision and Resolution
9.
The authorities are making efforts to reform the framework for banking regulation
and supervision. Regulation and supervision of banks is governed by the banking law number 38
of 1998. Islamic banks are subject to a separate law which was originally issued under law no. 21
in 1996 and later revised under law no. 16 in 2009. However, there are no separate regulations,
instructions issued or reporting requirements for Islamic banks. More generally, legal provisions
need enhancing across a range of areas including licensing, supervisory powers, consolidated and
cross border supervision and issuance of prudential regulations. Supervision is constrained by
limited resources and training opportunities for supervisors. Also, the law does not include a clause
on legal protection of supervisors and while it establishes some corporate governance requirements,
detailed guidelines or instructions on corporate governance for banks are yet to be issued.
10.
The framework for supervision is risk based, but there are important shortcomings.
Inspectors perform their work according to a risk focused onsite manual, but risk based policies for
onsite inspections are yet to be developed. In particular, there are no clear policies for the frequency
and scope of inspection missions that take into consideration the systemic importance of banks,
their weaknesses and their problems. Coordination between onsite and off-site supervision is also

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

43

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

not as effective as it should normally be. Inspection of full-fledged Islamic banks is currently being
performed in a similar manner to that of the conventional banks.
11.
The regime for corrective and remedial powers and enforcement could be improved.
The banking law and regulations allow the CBY to take a series of enforcement measures to solve
any weaknesses in banks’ performance and violations of prudential requirements, but there is no
systematic or structured process to implement the enforcement framework. The criteria and
parameters that would trigger the application of enforcement measures and the progressive actions
to be applied in case of non compliance are not stipulated.
12.
Macro prudential surveillance is also not developed. The CBY does not undertake stress
testing and there are yet no guidelines on stress testing requirements for banks. Data for
undertaking stress testing is also not yet collated. The current manual process for banking
submitting returns to the CBY also does not bode well for effective surveillance.
13.
The bank resolution framework needs improvement. The CBY has powers to approve
voluntary liquidation, to revoke licenses in specified cases and to reorganize or liquidate banks
including appointing conservators. However, a number of areas need strengthening, including the
triggers for placing a bank under official administration, the deadline for terminating official
administration, powers to override shareholders and provisions for judicial review, the context for
reorganizing banks and license revocation.

C. The Monetary Policy Framework and Operations
14.
The economy is largely cash based, thereby reducing the efficacy of the interest rate as
a tool for monetary policy. Money markets are limited to primary issuance of treasury bills of 3, 6,
and 12 months. The government also issues 3 year bonds and introduced Sukuk in 2011 to help
manage liquidity of Islamic banks, but there has been no issuance after the two first issues. There is
no overnight money market, interbank market for foreign exchange, or secondary trading of bonds.
Islamic banks do not participate in the treasury bill market in line with Sharia’a.
15.
The CBY has a broad range of tools for conducting monetary policy but the principal
tool has been direct control of interest rates. The CBY sets a minimum interest rate on time and
savings deposits that serves as a benchmark for other interest rates. Other monetary policy tools
include unremunerated reserve requirements (7 percent on rials deposits and 10 percent on foreign
currency deposits); a rediscount facility at a penalty rate; an overdraft facility; treasury bill auction;
repurchase operations; foreign exchange sales; and certificates of deposits. The interest rate
structure for treasury bills and bonds has an inverted yield curve that is not anchored on inflation
expectations.
16.
In principle, the CBY operates a free floating exchange rate regime and targets
monetary aggregates with the final aim of maintaining price stability, but in practice it
targets the exchange rate. Imported food accounts for a large share in the consumer basket and
the authorities are cognizant of potential for pass through to inflation. The “benchmark” or

44

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

minimum interest rate on time and savings deposits at banks has been a principal tool to enhance
the attractiveness of the rial and ensure exchange rate stability.
17.
The benchmark rate determines the structure of interest rates. It increases banks’
funding cost and lending rates and sets the floor for banks to bid on the treasury bill interest rates.
The CBY also uses it to set rates on key monetary policy instruments, including the commercial
banks’ overdraft facility, repos, and Central Bank deposits.
18.
High interest rates present several risks. They attract more rial deposits but reduce credit
in rials, leaving banks with additional liquidity which is either invested in government securities or
foreign assets and increases the net open position. Second, it has potential to create adverse
selection in borrowers and increase banks’ non performing loans as borrowers might not be able to
pay the high rates. Third, it encourages banks to refuse remunerated domestic deposits and thereby
discourages financial intermediation. Fourth, the combination of high interest rates and a stable
exchange rate could encourage carry trade activities.

PRIORITY REFORMS
19.
Financial deepening is needed to improve the efficient allocation of productive
resources. There is a need to enhance competition, provide business friendly environment, and to
lower the cost of doing business. This requires addressing factors that constrain access to credit,
including non-user-friendly loan process, inadequate credit information, delays in legal proceedings,
and difficulties to realize collaterals. There is also a particular need to improve the data base and
dissemination of credit history and collateral information for SME sector. The administered interest
rate regime also contributes to high lending rates and constrains credit demand, thus it is important
to revisit the monetary policy framework.
20.
Banking supervision needs strengthening to ensure continued health of the financial
system. There is scope for improvement in a number of areas including: (i) closing the gaps in the
legal framework; (ii) improving the coordination of off-site supervision and on-site inspection and
implementing full-fledged risk based supervision; (iii) addressing the high credit risk by
strengthening banks’ credit risk management systems as well as supervisory oversight and
enforcement; (iv) addressing the problems of concentrated and related parties’ lending as well as
large exposures; (v) ensuring compliance with corporate governance which is exacerbated by the
predominance of large family business groups; (vi) strengthening supervision of Islamic banks; .
There is also a general need to enhance the enforcement of existing regulations, adopt international
accounting and audit standards to promote transparency and reliability of information and to
ensure timely corrective actions, where required.
21.
Macro prudential supervision could also help strengthen banking system stability.
There is a need to develop capacity in stress testing both in terms of building the staff expertise and
the data needed to undertake stress testing. Current efforts to introduce electronic submission of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

45

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

data from commercial banks could help in providing timely data and efforts to improve the data
warehouse could usefully be expedited.
22.
The development of non-bank financial sector is equally important. Policies should
facilitate the development of microfinance institutions to self sustaining levels and appropriate
prudential and supervision rules as well as supervisory skills specific to the sector should be
developed. This would help enhance competition and modernize the sector to reduce the cost of
financing for small enterprises and individual borrowers.
23.
Development of secondary market for treasury bills could also help deepen financial
markets. There is need to develop the institutional framework and introduce longer term maturity
government bonds (which will also eventually provide a basis for corporate bond and equity
markets).
24.
Efforts to improve the payments system should be expedited. The economy remains
dependent on cash payments and the current payments system provides only for checks, which are
not used much. With assistance from the World Bank, the CBY has been making efforts to improve
the system by providing a legal basis for electronic settlements, and handle payments of civil service
salaries and public utility bills more easily. Expansion of ATMs, supplemented by direct depositing of
some government salaries, has improved the services. However, the lack of modern electronic
communications facilities has been a problem. Improvements in the payment system could help
improve efficiencies in the banking system as well as facilitate monetary policy conduct.
25.
For monetary policy, the recommendations of the MCM TA Mission should be given
consideration. The Fund has in the context of the TA missions recommended replacing the
benchmarked minimum deposit rate with active liquidity management. In case of exchange rate
pressures, tightening liquidity would be a more efficient instrument to stabilize the exchange rate
and would allow for a smoother adjustment of the interest rate.

Safeguards Assessment:
An update safeguards assessment was completed in June 2013 with respect to a disbursement
made under the Rapid Credit Facility in April 2012. The updated assessment noted that steps have
been initiated to strengthen CBY governance and financial statements are prepared and audited in
accordance with international standards. The CBY has enhanced transparency with the publication of
the full set of audited financial statements as recommended by the update assessment. The
2

assessment also recommended that the CBY, in coordination with the Ministry of Finance, finalize an
agreement on repayment terms for credit extended to the government and that the capacity of the
internal audit function be further developed.
Exchange Arrangements:
The currency of Yemen is the Yemeni rial. Under the IMF’s classification, Yemen is currently
considered to have “other managed” arrangement.
Yemen has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Articles of Agreement
and maintains an exchange system that is free of multiple currency practices and restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. In accordance with UN
Security Council Resolutions, Yemen has taken measures to block the accounts of certain individuals
and organizations and has notified the Fund of these measures in accordance with Decision 144.
Article IV Consultation:
The latest Article IV consultation was concluded on January 8, 2010. Yemen is on the standard

WORLD BANK RELATIONS
1.
As of mid-June, the active IDA and TF portfolio in Yemen includes 31 projects with
US$930 million in commitments, of which about US$655 million in undisbursed balances remain.
The Bank is pursuing efforts to restructure its portfolio in Yemen, with a view to improving
implementation performance, which was affected by the political turmoil. Bank’s regular
implementation support efforts are complemented by third-party monitoring and independent
verification measures to ensure satisfactory progress and fiduciary integrity of its ongoing portfolio.
2.
The new framework for Bank support to Yemen (an ISN) was endorsed by the Board in
November 2012. It lies on three strategic pillars: (i) achieving quick wins and protecting the poor by
creating short-term jobs, restoring basic services, improving access to social safety nets, and
revitalizing livelihoods; (ii) promoting growth and improving economic management by helping
maintain macro stability, strengthening fiscal policies and public financial management, and
improving the enabling environment for private sector growth and competitiveness; and
(iii) enhancing governance and local service delivery by supporting transparency, accountability,
capacity building, institutional strengthening, and improved citizen engagement. Bank work in the
next 12 to 18 months is listed below.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data remain broadly adequate to conduct surveillance. However, some weaknesses persist
(including delays in reporting). A broad effort is in place to address shortcomings in most data with
technical assistance from the Fund and other donors. In particular, national accounts data should be
a priority for improvement.
2.
The Republic of Yemen has participated in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS)
since April 26, 2001. While some progress has been made, considerable scope remains to improve
the collection and dissemination of economic statistics, in line with Yemen’s commitments under the
GDDS.
3.
The most reliable and timely data are those on the monetary sector produced by the
Central Bank of Yemen (CBY). The CBY disseminates data on total official reserve assets and
monetary statistics with a lag of one month. To strengthen monetary statistics further, a multisector
mission in August 2000 recommended that: (a) repurchase agreements be treated as collateralized
loans; (b) all nonstandard loans be reclassified as claims on the relevant sector; (c) counterparty for
several monetary accounts be more accurately identified; and (d) a number of monetary accounts be
disaggregated so as to present position on a single financial instrument. In June 2003, the
authorities began reporting to STA a more disaggregated set of data that allowed for improved
sectoral and instrument classification. Publication of the revised monetary statistics for
December 1999 and onward, based on the more detailed data reporting, began in the August 2003
issue of IFS. In March 2007, with the availability of more detailed data, the definition of broad money
was broadened to include the deposits of the pension funds, starting with data for December 1999.
CBY does not yet report monetary data to STA using Standardized Report Forms (SRFs).
4.
Although important progress has been achieved in terms of coverage, classification, and
compilation methods of national accounts in accordance with the System of National
Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA), significant work remains to be done to improve quality of the data and
the compilation methods. The Central Statistical Organization (CSO) has benefited from substantial
TA in national accounts and price statistics provided by METAC and with the support of the IMF’s
Statistics Department (STA). A series of peripatetic missions have been conducted to date, with the
most recent mission on national accounts conducted during December 2010. As a result of this
support, the CSO has succeeded in (i) improving the GDP estimates at current and constant prices
for the period 1999–2005; (ii) constructing the new GDP series for 2000–2008, which include GDP
(public and private) by economic activities at current and constant prices, and expenditure
components of GDP at current prices; (iii) partially solving fluctuations in the nominal GDP values as
well as in the volume measures of GDP for select economic activities; and (iv) addressing various
methodological issues including assumptions concerning the intermediate consumption in different
activities. The assistance from United Nations Economic and Social Commission for West Asia
(ESCWA) during 2007, 2008 and 2009, has resulted in a new National Accounts series, which the CSO
has adopted and published on their website (June 2009).

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

5.
However, the up STA mission noticed a number of weaknesses. Notably the non-observed
economy, updating the frame and the sampling design for economic survey, using an improved set
of deflators for calculating the GDP and GDP expenditure components at constant prices,
conducting small surveys to update assumptions as in agriculture for estimating the inputs, .and
conducting a labor force survey since the last survey dates back to 1999. A follow up mission to help
CSO address these weaknesses is planned for February 2013. Regarding price statistics, some
improvements have been made in the compilation of the consumer price index and the production
of foreign trade price indices. As part of Middle East Technical Assistance Center (METAC)’s work
program a technical assistance (TA) mission on price statistics visited Sana’a during December 2–
13, 2012 to assist the CSO in developing and compiling a Producer Price Index (PPI). With the
assistance of STA, the CSO has constructed a CPI that is consistent with international standards, with
weights derived from the 1998 Households Budget Survey (HBS). The Consumer Price Index (CPI)
has a broad geographic coverage and a sufficient number of consumption items, although some
deficiencies remain in data collection practices. STA real sector missions have recommended further
improving the sources of data in general, expanding the price statistics to cover different areas, and
enhancing training and internal coordination within the CSO. Staff of CSO is currently working on
updating the weights of the CPI basket to reflect the results of the 2005 HBS, and are considering
reducing the number of commodities in the basket from the current coverage of 900 goods in the
basket. To address problems in the field, the CSO has introduced a new framework to ensure
consistency in data collection according to the following criteria: timing, good specifications, and
location.
6.
Fiscal data reliability and timeliness are improving. Fiscal data are published in the quarterly
Bulletin of Government Finance Statistics (GFS Bulletin) on the Ministry of Finance website
(www.mof.gov.ye), which provides annual, quarterly, and monthly data with significant lags and
irregularity. The authorities have reported data for publication in the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook from 2000 onwards; the latest data are estimates for 1999. No sub-annual data are
reported for publication in International Financial Statistics. The GFS mission that visited Sana’a in
January 2004 found that, while data coverage and detail had improved, there were still numerous
departures from international standards in classification and coverage. The mission encouraged the
authorities to include additional information on financing and debt in the GFS Bulletin. The mission
also recommended that the authorities expand their data dissemination by communicating the GFS
Bulletin, or the relevant data, to the IMF Statistics Department for re-dissemination and for renewing
the dialogue and remote technical assistance for developing their GFS. The August-September 2007
Multisector Statistics mission found that many of the previously identified weakness data
compilation and timeliness remained. The concepts and definitions used to compile GFS are in
transition from GFS 1986 to GFSM 2001, and the authorities’ GFS Bulletin reports fiscal data using a
mixture of both.
7.
The CBY is responsible for compiling and disseminating balance of payments statistics, and
more recently, the international investment position (IIP) statistics based on the IMF’s Balance of
Payments Manual, fifth edition. Compilation tasks are performed on a rather ad hoc basis, mostly
relying on survey-based questionnaires with a response rate that is generally poor. The quality of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

the questionnaires themselves is also weak due to the limited expertise and experience in
developing such material. Further compounding the weak quality of the statistics are inadequacies
in documented sources and methods, and the limited financial and material resources dedicated to
balance of payments compilation. The CBY publishes quarterly external debt statistics within one
quarter of the reference period for the banking sector, general government, and monetary authority.
Successive STA balance of payments statistics missions (2002, 2003, and 2005) have sought to
facilitate implementation of the action plan recommended by the IMF’s resident advisor on balance
of payments statistics (1998–2000), with only limited success. Coverage of the oil and gas industry
transactions remains weak. Data questionnaires on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and selected
items in services have either been discontinued or not followed up. The shortage of qualified staff
dedicated to the compilation as well as weak coordination between the CBY and other government
agencies (such as the customs authority, the CSO, and the ministry of oil and mining resources) are
partly responsible for the slow progress.STA missions have consistently called for better
coordination between the CBY and other government agencies for timely and effective data
collection and compilation, improved staffing and training, and the reinstitution of discontinued
surveys. A balance of payments mission in September 2005 found that the CBY had made some
progress on increasing manpower and equipment in the balance of payments division, as well as
training through the Arab Monetary Fund (AMF). The mission also focused on the present method
of estimating inward worker’s remittances. Yemen has submitted quarterly balance of payments

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITYANALYSIS

July 2, 2013

Approved By
Daniela Gressani and
David Marston (IMF) and
Manuela V. Ferro and
Jeffrey D. Lewis (IDA)

Prepared by the Staffs of the International Monetary Fund
and the International Development Association.

Based on the updated Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) reflecting the most recent
information, Yemen’s risk of debt distress is upgraded from “high” to “moderate.” The
improved debt outlook reflects updated projections of hydrocarbon exports in view of the
low depletion rates of recent years and official proven reserves figures, which are consistent
with data published by well established sources.1 All the relevant debt indicators are below
the policy-dependent thresholds in the baseline scenario. One indicator, however, breaches
the threshold in the stress scenario. Specifically, Yemen remains vulnerable to less
favorable borrowing terms and to an abrupt decrease in exports, possibly associated with a
sharp decrease in oil prices.

1

This DSA updates the previous DSA prepared for the staff report for request for RCF (EBS/12/37), Supplement 1).

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

BACKGROUND
1.
Yemen’s public external debt-to-GDP is at a relatively low level of 17.9 percent of GDP as of
end-2012. The external borrowing by the private sector is currently negligible, and the debt sustainability
analysis mainly includes public debt. The stock of public external debt is moderate partly due to Yemen’s
limited access to non-concessional borrowing.
2.
Yemen’s external debt is owed mostly to official creditors and the stock of debt is mostly
concessional. Of the total external debt of $6.2 billion, half is owed to multilateral creditors.2 The other half is
owed to bilateral creditors, with the largest creditors being Russia ($1.2 billion), Saudi Arabia ($0.4 billion), Japan
($0.3 billion), and Kuwait ($0.2 billion). Regional donors have played an important role in providing assistance
in 2012.
3.
In August 2012, the Friends of Yemen pledged around $8 billion dollars in aid for the
period 2012-2014. These figures do not include the exceptional $2 billion grant provided in 2012 by Saudi
Arabia in support of the budget. Of the Friends of Yemen pledges, the amount committed thus far—i.e., already
allocated by donors to specific projects—is $6 billion, and the amount disbursed so far is about $1.8 billion
(including the $1 billion Saudi deposit at the central bank). However, most of these pledges are for project
financing which are not part of the government budget.
4.
Yemen has borrowed more recently on some non-concessional terms from the Arab Monetary
Fund to address imminent budget financing needs. Total borrowing from the AMF has risen from around
$99 million at end 2010 to about $260 million, and an additional $100 million loan was signed and disbursed
in 2013. Other regional organizations, including the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development and Islamic
Development Bank, have also stepped up their efforts soon after the GCC-brokered deal was agreed and the
interim government established in December 2011. Given that the total amount of loans is relatively small
compared to GDP and that they carry a high grant element, these loans would not affect debt sustainability.
5.
This DSA updates the 2011 DSA (EBS/12/37—Supp. 1; 3/22/12). It incorporates more recent
macroeconomic data including new data on oil and gas exports, actual debt data, and recent WEO projections of
key economic variables, including international oil and gas prices. In addition, the assumption that oil exports will
stop suddenly within several years has been replaced by the assumption that they decline steadily at a rate of
about 3 percent a year.
6.
The Yemeni authorities’ agreed with the staff’s assessment. The staff however cautioned against the
downside risks, especially in view of the projected decline, albeit gradual, in oil revenues and the risk of a
deterioration in the fiscal and external accounts, in case of slippages in the policy stance, in addition to the high
vulnerability to adverse economic developments highlighted by the stress tests.

MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS
7.

The baseline macroeconomic framework underlying the DSA is broadly the same as the

previous one, except for oil production and exports as explained above. Detailed assumptions are
discussed below (Box 1).
Box 1. Assumptions for the Macroeconomic Framework
Growth: In the medium term (2013–18), real GDP growth averages about 4.1 percent, which is slightly
lower than the 10-year historical average before the political turmoil (4.3 percent), reflecting the recent
political settlement, increased international assistance, restoration of activities, and revitalization of idle
production capacity. It converges to average 4.5 percent over the long term (2019–33). Given the
gradually declining oil production, non-hydrocarbon growth is essential and requires increased credit to
the private sector. The recent cuts in the policy interest rate were a good move and further cuts in interest
rates are envisaged as inflation and exchange rates stabilize. The interim government would gradually
conduct structural reforms to improve the investment environment, including security conditions, and
attract sizeable donor-funded public investment. Revitalization of the domestic debt market, including
further issuance of Sukuk, and reprioritization of expenditures should support infrastructure investment,
boosting non-hydrocarbon growth. The assumptions that non-hydrocarbon growth rates average
4.4 percent in the medium term (2013–18) and 4.7 percent in the long term, are basically in line with the
historical experience: the sector grew at an average rate of 4.9 percent during 2001–10 before the political
crisis.
Hydrocarbon Sector: One of the key changes in the assumptions is that oil production continues
towards the end of the projection period rather than being depleted in 2022, in line with the revised
authorities’ projections. The above revision is also consistent with the assessment of credible independent
sources (e.g. British Petroleum Oil Statistics, Oil & Gas Journal, and Economic Intelligence Unit), which put
Yemen’s proven oil reserves at about 3 billion barrels. Assuming a recovery in oil production over the
medium- term, and subsequent declines of three percent per year over the long-term, Yemen would use
only about half of the proven reserves by 2033. Yemen has a large potential in the LNG sector too. This
DSA assumes no increase in LNG over the medium-term and a gradual average annual increase of
5 percent from 2019 onwards.
Inflation: Inflation stays relatively high but remains at the single digit in the medium term, due to
continued fiscal pressure and recovery of economic activities. It moderates afterwards to an average of
6.8 percent in the long term assuming stable international food and fuel prices and that the central bank
refrains from financing the government budget and continues to stabilize the real exchange rate.
Public finance: After experiencing a relatively large fiscal deficit of around 5.8 percent of GDP in 2013,
fiscal adjustment continues over the projection period. An increase in non oil revenues, through recently
introduced General Sales Tax and strengthening of tax and customs administration, partly offsets a
gradual decrease in oil revenues. Total revenues (excluding grants) over GDP ratio hovers
around 20 percent. On the expenditure side, expenditure restraints, including moderate efforts to control
the public wage bill and fuel subsidies. These expenditure controls are broadly in line with projected real
GDP growth, which would allow overall expenditures to decline from 33.0 percent in 2013 to 22.1 percent
in 2033. As a result, the overall fiscal deficit over GDP gradually declines to around 2.2 percent in 2033.

External sector: Exports are expected to decrease in the medium term reflecting declining oil
productions. However, a gradual increase in non-oil exports and, more importantly, in LNG exports is to
offset a decrease in oil exports in the long run. Non-hydrocarbon exports growth would be around
5.9 percent in the medium term after a large decline during the crisis, and then stabilize at around
6.0 percent in the long run. Import growth is modest at average 2.8 percent over the projection period,
reflecting moderate fiscal adjustment and imports substitution. The current account deficit would
gradually increase to over 3.6 percent of GDP in the medium term but slowly worsen over the projection
period. Official creditors, broadly consistent with commitments made in the Friend of Yemen meeting, are
expected to resume providing financing on favorable terms, mainly in the form of grants. Improved
security conditions and business environment would attract more foreign direct investment and allow for
more commercial borrowing.

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. External DSA
Baseline
8.

Under the baseline scenario all debt indicators are below the policy-dependent

thresholds over the projection period. However, the PV of debt-to-exports ratio is the only
indicator that rises close to the threshold over the long term, but does not at any time exceed it
through the end of the projection in 2033.

Stress tests and alternative scenarios
9.

Under the alternative scenarios and stress tests, all indicators remain below the policy-

dependent thresholds with one exception. The PV of debt-to-export ratio under the most
extreme shock quickly rises above the threshold of 100 percent starting in 2015, and peaking
in 2023 at 180 percent (B2). This highlights Yemen’s high dependence on oil exports for its long
term external sustainability. However, the vulnerability to such a shock is expected to decline over
the long term as the share of non-oil exports pick up.

B. Public DSA
10.

Yemen’s nominal debt-to-GDP ratio would exceed the 50 percent mark in 2015 and

remains above it through 2020. This debt-to-GDP ratio would peak in 2018 at 58 percent and
declines through the remainder of the projection period, reaching about 32.5 percent in 2033.
11.

The alternative scenarios highlight the importance for Yemen to embark on a fiscal

consolidation path. The PV of public debt to GDP is vulnerable to growth shocks (A3) (B1).

CONCLUSION
12.
Based on the updated macroeconomic assumptions and ongoing reforms, Yemen’s
risk of debt distress is upgraded to “medium” from “high.” This reflects in particular the revised
assumption on oil output beyond 2022.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 31, 2013

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

The IMF Concluded 2013 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Yemen
On July 19, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Yemen.1
The macroeconomic situation stabilized in 2012 but the recovery remains fragile. After
contracting by more than 12 percent in 2011, real GDP is estimated to have grown by
2.4 percent in 2012, reflecting an easing of supply bottlenecks and utilization of part of idle
capacity. On the other hand, oil production declined further, due to continued sabotage of the
pipelines. Average inflation declined to 9.9 percent from 19.5 percent in 2011, reflecting the
appreciation of the rial to its pre-crisis level, the moderation of international food prices, and
the easing of supply shortages. Money supply grew faster than nominal GDP, particularly in
the second semester, partly driven by government borrowing, while private sector credit
contracted marginally.
The external position has strengthened substantially in 2012, due largely to exceptional
Saudi support. The current account deficit narrowed in 2012 to about 1 percent of GDP
compared to 4.1 percent in the preceding year. Imports and non-hydrocarbon exports showed
a strong recovery from their sharp decline in the previous year, while oil exports suffered
from frequent sabotage of the key pipeline. Transfers increased, reflecting a Saudi oil grant
of around $2 billion and strong growth in workers’ remittances. The capital account also
benefited from a $1 billion Saudi deposit at CBY. Consequently, gross reserves increased to
$5.6 billion, equivalent to about 5.5 months of imports
.
The budget deficit widened to 6.3 percent of GDP due to higher spending, including on
wages and subsidies. Notwithstanding some increases in domestic fuel prices, subsidies

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary
is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found
here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

increased to about 9 percent of GDP. Furthermore, the hiring of additional government
employees and the payment of retroactive wage settlements led to an increase in the wage
bill to about 11 percent of GDP. Capital spending increased but remained below its pre-crisis
level. On the revenue side, the decline in oil receipts was more than compensated for by an
increase in tax collection and the exceptional level of Saudi grants. The non-hydrocarbon
primary deficit excluding grants deteriorated to 21.1 percent of GDP, compared to
17.6 percent a year earlier. Public debt remained moderate at about 48 percent of GDP, with
the external part constituting about 18 percent.
Money supply in 2012 increased by 21 percent, reflecting higher net foreign assets and
net credit to the government. Most of this increase took place in the second semester,
which was beyond the indicative benchmarks set under the RCF. With the deceleration in
inflation, the CBY reduced the policy interest rate in October 2012 from 20 to 18 percent,
and again to 15 percent in February 2013. However, and despite the substantial excess
reserves in the banking system, private sector credit contracted slightly, reflecting the still
high real interest rate, the fledgling recovery, and the high credit risk. On the other hand, net
claims on government increased by almost 30 percent.
The banking system is stable, notwithstanding some vulnerabilities. Banks are on
aggregate profitable and liquid with the capital adequacy ratio estimated at 29.6 percent at
end December 2012, partly due to the large share of zero risk-weighted government
securities in the banks’ portfolios and the high interest rates earned on these securities.
However, non-performing loans stood at 25.5 percent, reflecting the level of credit risk and
some deficiencies in commercial banks’ risk management capacities.2 Islamic banks are also
challenged by limited eligible domestic investment opportunities. Financial markets and the
payment system are underdeveloped.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the authorities’ progress toward macroeconomic stability. At
the same time, they noted that the economic recovery is fragile and considerable challenges
remain. Directors stressed the importance of sustained implementation of reforms to
strengthen macroeconomic stability and promote strong growth, employment, and poverty
reduction.
Directors urged the authorities to contain the widening fiscal deficit and continue fiscal
restructuring. They supported the plans to reorient the budget toward pro-growth and
pro-poor expenditures. They noted that a gradual reduction in the share in the budget of
wages—including by eliminating ghost workers—and generalized subsidies would provide
room for infrastructure investment and priority social spending. They also noted that the
2

untargeted fuel subsidies disproportionately benefit the rich and encourage smuggling. In this
regard, they welcomed the recent decision to unify the price of diesel. They urged the
authorities to build public support for a comprehensive, albeit gradual, reform of fuel prices.
Increased targeted transfers will be important to mitigate the impact of fuel price increases on
the most vulnerable. To that end, further concessional donor assistance will be needed, and
Directors urged the authorities to secure timely donor disbursement through enhanced
transparency and capacity in public finance management and program implementation.
Directors welcomed recent efforts to improve non-hydrocarbon revenue. They highlighted
the need to strengthen tax and customs administration and to refrain from extending tax
exemptions. They also cautioned that limiting nonconcessional borrowing will be important
to safeguard debt sustainability.
Directors emphasized the need to achieve price stability while ensuring monetary policy
support for growth. They underscored the importance of fiscal restraint to help reduce
inflation and interest rates and avoid further crowding out credit to the private sector.
Directors saw a need to improve the monetary policy framework and enhance central bank
independence. Directors noted that the exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals.
They noted that greater exchange rate flexibility would help preserve international reserves
and provide a cushion against external shocks.
Directors highlighted the importance of safeguarding the health of the financial system and
further developing financial intermediation. They encouraged the authorities to expedite
efforts to strengthen the framework for bank supervision and resolution. They also called for
measures to address the remaining shortcomings in the AML/CFT framework.
Directors emphasized the importance of structural reforms to support high and inclusive
economic growth and diversification. Priorities include improving infrastructure, enhancing
the business climate, expanding access to financial services, and strengthening public
institutions and governance.
Directors called for further efforts to improve economic and financial statistics to facilitate
economic analysis and policy formulation.

1/ The sharp decline in crude oil production reflects the impact of oil pipeline sabotage in 2011 and 2012.

Statement by A. Shakour Shaalan, Executive Director for Yemen
July 19, 2013
The Yemeni authorities would like to convey their appreciation to staff for the continued
collaborative engagement and the 2013 Article IV Consultation discussions. They look
forward to continued work with the Fund and valuable technical assistance in support of
their reform efforts.
Background
1. Despite the difficulties inherent in the process of democratic transition, the Yemeni
economy began to recover in 2012 after contracting by 12 percent in 2011. Inflation
fell substantially and the exchange rate stabilized at pre-crisis levels, while foreign
exchange reserves increased significantly.
2. However, the recovery is still nascent, and the authorities are facing the challenges of
restoring economic stability and supporting growth in a fragile political and security
environment. Attacks on oil pipelines and electricity transmission lines continue to
interrupt oil production and electricity delivery. Moreover, the country faces
significant development needs, chronic water shortages, and pressing social demands.
With one of the highest malnutrition rates in the world, Yemen’s poverty reduction
needs are enormous. More than 55 percent of the population lives below the poverty
line, a situation which has been significantly exacerbated by the 2011 crisis.
Unemployment is high, particularly among the youth.
3. The authorities’ Transitional Program for Stabilization and Development for 20122014 addresses these challenges. The program is focused on maintaining
macroeconomic stability, while implementing an ambitious reform agenda, to
promote inclusive growth and address basic social needs. The authorities’ program
also aims at enhancing governance and civil sector reforms, financial sector
regulation, and the business climate, while reducing the country’s dependence on oil
revenues. Timely donor disbursement is crucial to help Yemen tackle these
challenges. So far, only a fraction of the pledged resources to support Yemen’s
political transition and economic reforms have been disbursed. The authorities are
hopeful that the Mutual Accountability Framework, which has been set-up in
coordination with the World Bank to oversee aid disbursements, will help improve
the timeliness of donor disbursement.
Fiscal Policy and Reforms

4. The authorities are committed to improving fiscal sustainability and to create the
fiscal space for poverty reduction and pro-growth spending. To boost nonhydrocarbon revenues, they intend to strengthen tax collection, and revenue
administration. Several measures are planned in this regard, including introducing
pre-shipment inspections, upgrading the IT systems in the customs and tax areas, and
enhancing cooperation between the tax and customs authorities. The government is
committed to avoid grandfathering previous tax or customs exemptions under the
2010 investment law.
5. On budgetary expenditures, the authorities have announced a set of measures to
improve the efficiency of public spending and reorient spending to social and
developmental needs. In particular, they are taking initiatives to control the wage bill
by eliminating fraudulent wage payments through the introduction of a biometric
identification system for the civil service as well as the military and police. They will
also strengthen public financial management and improve the planning and execution
of public spending. Measures have been taken to unify the price of diesel
domestically, in particular, in the electricity sector. The timing for further subsidy
reforms will depend on political and social developments.
6. The fiscal deficit will be financed mainly from domestic borrowing and grants. The
authorities also plan to reissue Islamic bonds (Sukuks) to diversify the sources of
budget financing. As mentioned above, additional and increasingly concessional
donor support will therefore be crucial in meeting development and poverty reduction
needs. In the event of a revenue shortfall, the authorities stand ready to cut
expenditures, although they are aware that this could adversely affect investment and
social spending.
Monetary and Financial Sectors Policies
7. Monetary policy has been successful in stabilizing prices and the exchange rate.
Going forward, monetary policy will continue to support the post-crisis economic
recovery while ensuring price stability. The Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) has
lowered the benchmark interest rate from 20 percent to 15 percent in order to
encourage credit to the private sector. They stand ready to adjust policies as needed,
and to consider further cuts in interest rates as inflation declines further. The
authorities share staff’s assessment regarding the exchange rate. They intend to
maintain an exchange rate system that reflects market fundamentals and limit
intervention to smoothing short-term fluctuations of the Yemeni rial. They stressed
that fiscal policy could be more supportive of their exchange rate and inflation
objectives.

8. The CBY is committed to strengthening banking supervision and to improving the
legal and operational framework for bank resolution. They will increase oversight of
internal controls and risk management practices in commercial banks, and will
enhance cross-border and macroprudential surveillance. The authorities intend to
develop a special regulatory and supervisory framework for Islamic banking. The
CBY is currently developing guidelines for Prompt Corrective Action and is
reviewing the Banking Act to address legal gaps in CBY’s tools and operational
capacity. In addition, and based on the Financial Action Task Force’s
recommendations, measures will be taken to strengthen the AML/CFT framework.
Other Structural Reforms
9. The authorities will continue to implement structural reforms to diversify the
economy in the non-hydrocarbon sectors. Improving the business climate will be a
key priority to generate inclusive growth and address unemployment. Other structural
reforms include governance and judicial reforms to enhance transparency.
