STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
August 19, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Setting: Botswana’s economic performance over the last few decades has been
impressive. At the same time, however, as in many other small middle-income countries
(SMICs) in the region, trend growth has softened in recent years, which has exacerbated
the long-term challenge of persistent unemployment and high income inequality.
Outlook and risks: Output growth is expected to remain broadly unchanged in 2013 as
strong non-mining sector growth would offset the subdued mining output. Inflation
(average) is projected to converge to the Bank of Botswana’s objective range (3-6
percent) in 2013. The uncertainties in the global economy pose downside risks to mineral
export demand.
Near-term macro-policy mix: A “growth-friendly” fiscal consolidation strategy adopted
in the FY2013/14 budget is appropriate. Staff advocates for a broadly neutral monetary
policy stance in the near term. In the event of further adverse global spillovers, staff
advises the authorities to allow the automatic stabilizers to operate on the revenue side.
Financial stability: Botswana’s banking system is profitable and well-capitalized with
relatively low nonperforming loans. Banks’ high exposure to households and the
acceleration in the growth of unsecured lending are, however, potential vulnerabilities.
The authorities should continue to bolster their surveillance capacity to monitor financial
sector developments and consider implementing macroprudential measures to temper
the rate of growth of household borrowing.
Medium-term fiscal consolidation: Reining in unproductive current spending, while
protecting growth-promoting capital spending is the main pillar of the authorities’ fiscal
consolidation strategy. The government’s commitment to rebuild the fiscal buffers,
improve the quality of spending, and limit labor market distortions stemming from public
wage and employment policies are also appropriate.
Reinvigorating growth, enhancing inclusion and economic diversification: Returning
to an era of strong growth would require a set of efficiency-driven reforms to
reinvigorate productivity drivers. Policies should target inequality more effectively,
including fostering high quality investment in health and education and supporting
financial inclusion. The government is pursuing a multi-pronged approach to enhancing
economic diversification that leverages Botswana’s areas of comparative advantage.
Past advice: There is broad agreement between the Fund and the authorities on
macroeconomic policy and structural reform priorities. Consistent with staff’s advice, the
authorities have published both the weights of the Pula’s currency basket and its rate of
crawl. Furthermore, the ongoing fiscal consolidation is focused on reining in
unproductive current spending, as recommended during past consultations.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
A. The Long-Term Setting
1.
Botswana has made impressive strides in economic development in the past few
decades. A prolonged period of strong growth has raised overall incomes and delivered good
economic outcomes. The government has been effective in addressing the country’s development
challenges including narrowing the infrastructure gap and facilitating access to education and
health. At the same time, as in many other small middle-income countries (SMICs) in the region,
trend growth has softened in recent years, amidst persistent unemployment and high income
inequality. There is a general recognition that the public-sector driven capital-deepening growth
model has run its course.1

As in other SMICs in the region, returning to a period of strong growth in Botswana
would require a productivity-driven economy underpinned by a leaner and more efficient
public sector. This approach will reduce the crowding out of the private sector, while seeking to
support private-sector activity through regulatory and other structural reforms. Over the years,
public sector dominance in Botswana has led to distortions in the broader economy and stifled
progress toward a private sector-led economy. In particular, there has been:


High concentration of bank lending to households, including to public-sector employees:
Households have become increasingly leveraged in recent years. The large number of relatively
well-paid government employees provides a captive market for bank lending backed by wages,
which limits the incentives to look for productive investment opportunities (including financing
for small and medium-sized enterprises).



Persistently high unemployment with the government as the employer of last resort:
Botswana’s unemployment rate has been close to 20 percent for the last two decades. The
government is one of the largest employers in the economy with public employment accounting

1

This is also consistent with staff’s recent cross-country work on the factors that explain the slowdown in trend
growth in SMICs (see chapter II in SM/13/22).

for more than 20 percent of total employment and 40 percent of formal employment.
Government sector wages are high relative to the private sector with average wages in the
government exceeding private-sector wages by 21 percent in 2011, which is high compared with
other SMICs. Over the years, government employment and wage policies has attracted a large
share of the labor force into the public sector, raised reservation wages and influenced
schooling decisions which have contributed to the skill mismatch in the labor market. 2


Lackluster progress in economic diversification: The fact that the public sector occupies a
large segment of the economy has hindered the private sector from becoming a significant
driver of growth in Botswana. As in many other SMICs, the concentration on household credit
coincides with the economy’s reliance on consumption for growth relative to investment (Figure
4). Thus, the mining sector and government services are occupying significant shares of GDP,
which yields less broad-based growth, increases exposure to external shocks and thus
macroeconomic volatility.

Reducing the relative size of the government (as a share of GDP) would contribute to the creation of
more productive investment opportunities for the financial sector, improve labor market outcomes
and enhance prospects for greater economic diversification.
3.
These long-term challenges dovetail with the government’s own policy priorities as
laid out in the recent Mid-Term Review (MTR) of the 10th National Development Plan
(NDP10). The MTR of NDP 10 reemphasizes the policy thrust to reduce the size of government
relative to GDP so that the private sector can take the lead in returning Botswana to a period of
strong and robust growth. Within this broad remit, the MTR of NDP 10 identified the following
policies as priorities: (i) making the government more effective and efficient, (ii) tackling the high
level of unemployment, (iii) enhancing more inclusive growth and (iv) boosting prospects for greater
economic diversification.

B. Current Conditions
4.
A strong post-crisis growth has moderated—reflecting a combination of decelerating
net external demand partly offset by a solid contribution from domestic demand.


Output growth slowed down from about 6 percent in 2011 to about 4 percent in 2012.
This deceleration was driven by the decline in mining sector growth due to the subdued global
demand for diamonds. Construction and service sectors grew fast, offsetting the negative
impact of the mining sector on the overall GDP (Figure 1 and Table 1). From the expenditure
side of GDP, domestic demand was relatively strong in 2012, with private consumption and
investment growing by about 9 and 13 percent respectively in real terms, with net external
demand declining by 7 percent.



Preliminary data suggest that the growth moderation continued in the first quarter of
2013 with real GDP growing by about 3 percent. This reflects the continued weak

performance of the diamond sector and the slowdown in the construction sector. The latter is
probably a consequence of the ongoing phasing out of the big government construction
projects such as Morupule B power plant. However, services sector growth remained quite brisk.
5.
The acceleration in household borrowing supported the solid growth in domestic
demand. The increase, however, is from a low base, because the level of financial intermediation
remains low in Botswana relative to other emerging and developing economies. Private-sector credit
(in percent of GDP) is about 30 percent in Botswana compared with above 80 percent in emerging
and developing Asia. That said, private-sector credit, on average, grew by an annual 26 percent last
year, driven mainly by the expansion in credit to households (with mortgages accounting for about
fourteen percent, while unsecured credit about forty percent). Banks’ nonperforming loans (NPLs)
which were 2.6 percent at end-December 2012 increased by about 30 percent in March 2013. The
deterioration in the quality of banks’ loan portfolio to households accounts for the increased NPLs.
6.
Meanwhile, the fiscal withdrawal has not significantly dampened non-mineral sector
growth. The budget was balanced in FY2012/13 for the first time since the 2008 global financial
crisis. A “growth-friendly” consolidation was implemented through reining in nonproductive current
spending, which was supported by the windfall revenues from the Southern Africa Customs Union
(SACU).3 However, spending on wages in percent of GDP, increased by about a half percentage
point in FY2012/13 despite the authorities’ plans of a 5 percent targeted reduction in the wage bill
in the original FY2012/13 budget (Table 4d). The increase was driven by the “temporary recession
allowance” granted to civil servants at the lower end of the wage ladder to mitigate the effects of
the recession. Execution of capital spending was below budget owing to problems in the
implementation process that delayed the commencement of some government projects. On the
revenue side, non-mineral income tax and mineral revenue underperformed, reflecting subdued
economic activity.
Botswana Inflation
(Percent, year-on-year)

7.
Monetary policy was eased as inflation decelerated
towards the upper end of the Bank of Botswana’s (BoB) 3–6
percent objective range. Consumer price inflation declined
steadily in recent months and stood at 5.8 percent at end-June
from about 7.4 percent at end-2012. Core inflation, which
excludes administered prices, also declined. The BoB reduced its
policy rate by 100 basis points during April—June, 2013.

The SACU revenue windfall which explains a large part of the fiscal adjustment in FY2012/13 is due to the backward

9.
The real effective exchange rate (REER) continues to be broadly stable under the
crawling peg arrangement (Figure 1). Since 2005, the authorities have pursued a crawling peg
regime with the aim of preserving external competitiveness through real exchange rate stability. The
regime is implemented through a continuous adjustment of the nominal effective exchange rate of
the Pula, based on the differential between the medium-term inflation objective and trading
partners’ inflation forecasts. The authorities published both the Pula currency basket weights and its
rate of crawl in the FY 2013/14 budget, which has improved the transparency of the crawling peg
regime. Staff’s econometric analysis, using CGER methods, which incorporate features appropriate
for a mineral-based economy like Botswana, shows that the REER is broadly in line with
fundamentals from a medium-term perspective (Appendix II). While Botswana’s external position
continues to be strong and there are no external stability concerns, high export concentration
creates potential risks for external stability (Appendix II).

C. Outlook and Risks
10.

Outlook

Output: Staff projects that real GDP will grow by about 4 percent in 2013 on the back of a strong
non-mineral GDP growth and an anemic mining sector (Table 1). Growth is expected to pick up
slightly to 4.4 percent in 2015 supported by the base effect of increased electricity production and a
recovery in the mining sector and subsequently stabilize at around 4 percent.
Inflation: Headline inflation is likely to remain close to the upper end of BoB’s medium-term
objective range in the remainder of 2013. However, below normal rainfall for the region, poses a
potential upside risk to food prices. At the same time, fiscal consolidation, underpinned by
government wage restraint, should help to contain demand-push inflationary pressures.
External position: The current account deficit is expected to narrow in the coming years supported
by the public sector savings generated by the planned fiscal consolidation and the expected
recovery in diamond exports along with global recovery. As measures by the government result in
tempering the rate of growth of household borrowing, import growth should slow down. This
combined with a stable electricity supply by Moropule B power plant, will contribute to closing the
current account deficit. More broadly, success toward export diversification and an improvement in
competitiveness, underpinned by the implementation of regulatory and structural reforms should
help the return to a current account surplus and enhance external sustainability over the long term.
11.

Risks

The main near-term risk relates to the uncertain external environment, which poses significant
downside risks to diamond export demand4, and on the domestic front potential delays in the full
commencement of the Morupule B power plant. Under some adverse scenarios, output growth
could be lower by 1–1½ percentage points compared with the baseline forecast. Botswana is also
exposed to spillovers through strong economic and financial linkages with South Africa, where
recent developments and outlook suggest sluggish growth (Appendix I). Banks’ high exposure to
households and rapid increase in the growth of unsecured lending is an emerging policy challenge.
A key medium-term risk relates to the sustainability of long-term growth as trend growth has
softened in the last decade requiring new growth drivers. Another medium-term risk is that, like
other countries in SACU, Botswana faces the prospect that SACU revenues may decline either
because of a prolonged period of low global growth or changes in the SACU revenue-sharing
formula.
4

Diamonds constitute about 75 percent of Botswana’s exports—other minerals represent a tiny part of the export
base. While the recent sharp decline in commodity prices may to some extent rub off on diamond prices, the storable
nature of diamonds that allows buffering of shocks by adjusting inventories will likely limit the price decline. Indeed
since the 2008-09 global financial crisis, Debswana has been keeping production volumes stable while using
inventories in respond to global demand changes. The distinction between diamonds and other commodities is also
reflected in the market structures. There are no international diamond markets in the same sense that other
commodities are traded. Diamonds are sold through various channels (auctions, tenders and, of course, the Diamond
Trading Company, as well as various trading "networks") and the various price indices are based on assessments of
current trends by industry analysts, rather than any independently verifiable benchmark.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The authorities largely agreed with the staff’s assessment of recent economic developments, outlook,
and prospects. They reiterated the need to pursue a “growth-friendly” fiscal consolidation plan and
reduce the size of the government (as a share of GDP). Consistent with the Fund’s surveillance of
SMICs in sub-Saharan Africa, the need to address the policy gaps, and the authorities’ policy priorities
as laid out in the recent MTR of the NDP10, this year’s consultation focused on four main themes: (i)
global economic spillovers; (ii) fiscal policy implications for labor market outcomes; (iii)the implications
of rising household indebtedness for financial stability; and (iv) how to return the economy to an era of
strong growth, enhance job creation and boost prospects for economic diversification.

A. Policy Theme 1: Near-Term Macroeconomic Policies and Global
Spillovers
12.

Near-term macroeconomic policy stance



Fiscal policy: Staff supports the FY2013/14 budget, which targets a small fiscal surplus and reins
in unproductive current spending, while protecting growth-promoting capital spending. As in
other SMICs in SSA, the government’s wage bill is high by international standards, which
combined with subsidies and transfers, account for about 50 percent of total expenditures,
thereby limiting the room for fiscal policy flexibility. Thus the targeted reduction in the
expenditure-to-GDP ratio by 2.5 percentage points, reflecting mainly reduced wages and
subsidies, is appropriate. The budget’s emphasis on the need to rebuild fiscal buffers, improve
the quality of spending, and buttress medium-term fiscal consolidation, is also well placed.



Monetary policy: In staff’s view, a neutral monetary policy stance is appropriate in the near
term. After five years of strong non-mineral sector growth, the negative output gap for the nonmineral sector has largely closed and at 5.7 percent, core inflation (excluding administered
prices) is projected to remain firmly within the objective range for the reminder of the year. A
simple Taylor rule under the baseline scenario suggests that the BoB should err on the side of
caution on further cuts in its policy rate in the near term. In addition, lowering rates may do little
to boost private investment given that other structural factors are holding it back, while it may
stimulate private consumption and unsecured lending and result in a further buildup of
vulnerabilities on households’ balance sheets. Beyond these, the real interest rate in Botswana is
the lowest among MICs in the region (South Africa, Namibia, Mauritius, Cape Verde), while
private sector credit growth is the fastest and average inflation the highest (Figure 1).

13.
The authorities emphasized that they still see a need to improve the efficiency of
public spending. More generally, they continue to put emphasis on a thorough assessment of
pockets of unproductive spending and ways to increase efficiencies and generate value for money
most notably in the area of education and spending on state-owned enterprise. They also noted
that a medium term expenditure framework is being adopted that both better aligns ministries’
spending plans with strategic priorities as set out in the NDP 10 and improves expenditure

projections and the relevance of budget ceilings, while reinforcing the integrity of the development
budget through enhanced project evaluation and prioritization.
14.
On monetary policy they noted that further adjustment in the policy rate will be
guided by the medium-term outlook on inflation. The BoB pointed to evidence from recent
Business Expectations Surveys, which suggests that inflation expectations are on a downward trend
as well as the benign inflation outlook. They noted that the lower rate of crawl of the pula based on
inflation forecast differentials compared with the actual inflation differential contributed to the
reduction in inflationary pressures.
15.

Managing global spillovers



If further adverse global spillovers beyond the staff’s baseline scenario lead to a decline in
diamond prices and a significant loss of revenues, staff advised the authorities to allow
the automatic stabilizers to work on the revenue side (Appendix I). Although this will
slightly delay the fiscal consolidation path envisaged under the FY2013/14 budget by at most
1 percentage point of GDP, in staff’s view, it should not undermine medium-term fiscal
sustainability. A more accommodative monetary policy stance would be appropriate in this
adverse scenario, because lower domestic demand and the benign external inflation
environment would reduce inflationary pressures. More generally, with increased policy
uncertainty in South Africa, such spillovers call for policy response to be measured, carefully
calibrated, and proportional to risks and pressures coming from the global economic
environment.



The authorities agreed with staff’s view that the potential global spillovers to Botswana
would be limited and short-lived. Although China and India’s shares in diamond consumption
have been growing in recent years, they are still not the major player among Botswana’s trading
partners. In addition, they expect the growth slowdown in South Africa to have limited spillover
effects in Botswana. Over 85 percent of Botswana’s exports go to countries outside South Africa,
and the funding base of banks is largely domestic. The authorities don’t expect demonstration
effects of large wage demands in South Africa’s mines on Botswana’s mining sector as industrial
relations in Botswana are less confrontational. However, there would be significant impact on
business and economic activity if the recurring labor strikes were to disrupt the transportation of
goods from South Africa to Botswana. They underscored their commitment to continue to
rebuild the fiscal policy buffers, which have served them well in the past, to respond to such
adverse shocks.

Improving Labor Market Outcomes

Medium-term fiscal consolidation plan



Medium-term fiscal sustainability requires reducing the non-mineral primary deficit to
about 5 percent of nonmineral GDP from the current level of about 11 percent.5 In the
staff’s view, the pace

and very low debt). 6
The envisaged consolidation should not unduly undermine the authorities’ goal of growth
inclusion as Botswana has fairly generous social welfare programs and the authorities are
working on making their targeting more effective. The government’s efforts to rationalize
parastatals and public entities and identify additional programs that can be outsourced to the
private sector would also contribute to lowering the government wage bill. Strengthening the
operations of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) can generate the needed savings but only
gradually.



The authorities affirmed their medium-term fiscal consolidation goals, centered on reining
in unproductive current expenditures and improving the quality of spending. They
underscored that their draft Privatization Master Plan II for SOEs is aimed at reducing their
burden on fiscal resources and propelling them on a path towards commercial viability. In
addition, the government is planning to introduce performance contracts between SOEs and the
responsible line ministries, which assumes conducting annual audit and performance review to
make sure that these SOEs remain focused and serve their purpose.

5

Staff’s analysis, based on the permanent income hypothesis, suggests that in order to fully preserve mineral wealth
for future generations, the non-mineral primary balance (NMPB) should be reduced to about 5 percent of nonmineral GDP from the current level of about 11 percent—background work could be found in 2012 Article IV staff
report (http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=26166.0).

Botswana’s debt ratio has been historically very low and is expected to decline over the medium term—see the
annex on the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) using the new market access DSA template.

17.

The contribution of revenue mobilization to fiscal consolidation



In staff’s view, broadening the tax base should be an integral pillar of a balanced mediumterm fiscal consolidation process. Measures in this regard include an increase in the effective
tax rates on income and value added taxes through a judicious rationalization of the large tax
expenditures and improvements in tax administration. Tax compliance should also be improved
by reducing tax evasion and eliminating loopholes in the tax system. Staff recommends
integrating tax expenditure quantifications into the budget process and maintaining tax
incentives that provide fast recovery of investments (in the form of accelerated depreciation
regime for productive assets) as they are most cost-effective relative to tax holidays.



The authorities noted that their strategy for achieving a balanced fiscal consolidation
focuses on improving tax administration combined with expenditure restraint. They are
fully cognizant of expected reduction of revenues due to depletion of diamond mines in the
long run. Their primary focus is on strengthening the administrative capacity of the Botswana
Unified Revenue Service (BURS) and simplifying the tax system to encourage tax compliance.
Given that their revenue mobilization efforts through making the tax system more efficient, most
likely will not fill expected revenue gap to the full extent, they will complement these with
putting more emphasis on curtailing expenditures. While they concurred that the negative
externalities of tax incentives outweigh their marginal benefits, their rationalization would
require more time. Their medium-term expenditure framework, which is expected to be in place
by 2016, should also assist their broader goal of a balanced fiscal consolidation.

18.


The distortions created by public employment and wage policies in the labor market
Staff’s analysis suggests that reforms aimed at reducing rents of public employees and the
size of public employment would improve labor market outcomes.7 The cumulative growth
of average government sector wages for the period 2001—09 was about 126 percent, much
higher than the 75 percent cumulative growth of nominal GDP per worker for the same period.
Staff urged the government to articulate a clearer set of measures that would underpin the
reduction of the wage bill to improve labor market outcomes. Staff advocated for the
government to limit public sector wage awards below nominal GDP per capita growth, which
takes into account both inflation and economy-wide productivity gains.8 Given that there is no
wage premium at the medium to senior level civil servants, going forward, to cope with the

7

See chapter 1 of the accompanying selected issues paper. This paper, which looks at the impact of public sector
employment and wage policies on labor market outcomes for MICs, was also presented at the Fund-wide Small
Islands Club on July 25th, 2013.
8

Other policy measures that staff have recommended to the authorities include short-term—streamlining the system
of nonwage payments, including tighter eligibility criteria for allowances; medium-term—rationalizing the size and
structure of government, tightening the link between pay and performance; and strengthening payroll systems (see
2012 Article IV consultation report http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=26166.0 ).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BOTSWANA

intense regional competition for scarce skilled labor at those levels, the government could use
wage decompression, which will give higher wages to high-skilled civil servants.


16

The focus of the authorities’ MTR of NDP 10 is to reduce the size of the government (as a
share of GDP) and increase its efficiency. While the authorities took note of the staff’s advice
to achieve targeted reduction of the wage bill, they highlighted a potential risk of social tensions
when dealing with wages and public employment in an environment of relatively low growth,
high unemployment, with labor disputes in the region. They reiterated that, given the
complexities in this area, reforms would need to be implemented gradually. They also pointed
out that the wage premium of the government is largely concentrated at the lower end of the
wage ladder, while the middle and senior civil servants earn relatively lower wages compared
with their private sector peers. In the last few years, public sector wage growth has moderated
significantly following a three-year wage freeze. With regards to public employment, in some
critical areas, the government may need to recruit more staff. Specifically while they have
reduced the employment in some sectors of the government, they had to allow an increase in
the employment in the Administration of Justices, Attorney General’s office, and in the
Corruption Court to help pursue the government’s zero tolerance policy on corruption and deal
with the large backlog of important legislative bills. In addition, the process of outsourcing some
of the government services to the private sector was slow. To address the issue of skill mismatch
in the labor market, the government is reviewing the Botswana Qualification Authority act and is
continuing its work on the Internship Program and the Youth Development Fund.

C. Policy Theme 3: Strengthening the Monetary Regime and Enhancing
Financial Stability
19.

The current exchange rate regime



The authorities noted that the crawling peg arrangement continues to serve Botswana
well and merits continued support. They noted that the current policy framework remains
appropriate given the circumstances, and a major review would only be necessary if and when
there is a reason to believe that this is no longer the case.



The staff concurred. The current crawling peg regime minimizes the distortions associated with
a hard peg while providing some flexibility in the exchange rate to absorb shocks. A shift to a
strict peg to the South African rand will hinder the relative price adjustment required for terms
of trade shocks given the lack of full price flexibility in both product and factor markets. At the
same time, the characteristics of Botswana’s foreign exchange market, in particular “lumpy”
diamond revenues that arrive periodically but in very large amounts on “diamond days,” and the
lack of institutional readiness are constraints to a fully floating exchange rate regime. Thus, a
more liquid foreign exchange market, combined with well developed derivative markets to help
hedge volatilities, would be a prerequisite prior to adopting a floating exchange rate regime.



Staff encouraged the authorities to continuously look for opportunities to further
strengthen the operational aspects of the regime. Staff welcomed the disclosure by the
authorities on the Pula currency weights and the rate of crawl. The banks noted that the
publication of the weights of the Pula’s currency basket and its rate of crawl has improved
trading in the foreign exchange market. The authorities should also regularly assess the
optimality of the Pula’s currency basket based on the changes in the underlying trade pattern
and structural parameters of the economy. Going forward, staff encourages the authorities to
continue to refine their analytic tools for monetary policy analysis and facilitate the deepening of
the interbank market including for foreign exchange. These steps toward capacity building
would, in their own ways, contribute more broadly to the strengthening of monetary
management.

20.


Financial sector developments
Botswana’s banking system is profitable and well-capitalized with relatively low NPLs.9
However, there are potential vulnerabilities stemming from the high concentration of banks’
loans to households and the recent acceleration in the growth of unsecured lending (Appendix
III). Loans to households amount to about 60 percent of total loans in the banking system. The
increase in household debt partly reflects the authorities’ desire for enhancing greater financial
inclusion. Coming from a relatively low base, and largely backed by public sector wages, which
limits the associated credit risk, at this stage, household lending by itself does not pose major

9

Like many SMICs in the region, financial access remains relatively low for both individuals as well as small and midsized enterprises. According to Finscope’s 2009 study, more than half of Botswana’s population is unbanked.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BOTSWANA

risks to financial or macroeconomic stability. At the same time, given the rate at which
unsecured lending has been growing, if not contained, this could eventually require
macroeconomic policy adjustments and also lead to a large number of debt-distressed
households, which could potentially undermine the government’s objective of enhancing
greater financial inclusion. Thus, striking an appropriate balance between financial inclusion and
stability is an emerging policy challenge.

The authorities should bolster financial stability including through the use of macro
prudential measures to mitigate the risks from the growth in household borrowing. Staff
recommends strengthening the authorities’ existing architecture for preserving financial stability
to temper the rate of increase in household borrowing. The relevant measures include:
 Macroprudential tools: Consideration should be given to enforcing a household debt-toincome (DTI) limit or higher risk weights for unsecured lending, and tightening the definition
of loan-to-value (LTV) in mortgages as was done in Brazil, Hong Kong SAR and Malaysia and
is being considered in other countries in the region. As a first check for potential
vulnerabilities in the household sector, the BoB could consider performing a limited asset
quality review by investigating a sample of the banks’ loan books. This would highlight how
standard risk metrics such as DTI and LTVs are distributed across the banks’ debtors and
across the banks themselves.
 National Credit Bureaus: Financial market participants noted that the lack of a fully
functioning national credit reference bureau means that the screening of borrowers is weak.
 A study of households’ balance sheet: Staff sees merit in carrying out a comprehensive
assessment of households’ borrowing, disposable income, and investment activities and
monitoring them on a regular basis. The memorandum of understanding between the BoB
and Non-Bank Financial Institutions Regulatory Authority (NBFIRA) could help facilitate the
compilation of such statistics.
 Property market monitoring: Staff also recommends continued close monitoring of the
developments of the property market. Since 2009, residential property prices have increased
by about 75 percent with moderate increases since 2012.



The authorities agreed that the pace of credit expansion warrants close monitoring. The
BoB has most of the proposed tools at its disposal and is putting together elements of such an
architecture through the establishment of its FSD. They stressed that the BoB is closely
monitoring trends in household lending and risks to financial stability are low as banks

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

BOTSWANA

themselves are applying prudential measures including on households’ DTI ratio. The BoB has
assigned higher risk weight on both unsecured credit and residential mortgage loans compared
with Basel II. The authorities acknowledged that while their surveillance is constrained by the
paucity of information on household debt outside the banking system, the non-bank regulator
is monitoring the activities of the key micro lenders with the remainder forming a very small part
of the overall household debt. At the same time, they argued that it is important to
acknowledge that this credit expansion, at least in part, also reflects the continued broadening
of the banking industry in Botswana to include more households. Moreover, it should not be
presumed that such borrowing is purely for consumption purposes. To prevent debt distress
households from turning to another financial institution for borrowing, the government with the
ongoing technical assistance from the World Bank is working to establish an integrated credit
bureau to serve as the formal repository for both banks and non-banks on households’ credit
history and profile. The BoB is also strengthening its capacity to monitor the property market
and the Real Estate Institute of Botswana is working toward compiling an index of property
prices. The BoB is also increasingly infusing financial stability analysis (disaggregated credit
trends/ratios and property market developments) into monetary policy discussions.
21.

NBFIRA’s capacity to supervise the rapidly growing NBFIs



NBFIs (non-bank financial institutions) have been growing rapidly in recent years and
their assets account for about 50 percent of GDP. Furthermore, the cross linkages between
NBFIs and the commercial banks have increased. Thus, any large shock to the non-banking
system could reverberate through the banking system and pose systemic stress across the
financial system and the broader economy. This said, NBFIRA is not yet fully equipped to
discharge its mandate due to delays in building a skilled and experienced staff, and a legal and
regulatory infrastructure that is not fully in place. Staff advocates for continued strengthening of
the regulations on NBFIs, drawing on recommendations of the ongoing technical assistance
from the Fund. To prevent less creditworthy households from turning to non-bank lenders at a
higher cost, the BoB and NBFIRA should consider addressing regulatory arbitrage gaps between
banks and non-banks.10 Staff recommends that NBFIRA steps up its efforts in monitoring the
activities of micro lenders and other unregulated financial institutions. The BoB and NBFIRA
should conduct a mapping exercise on the inter-linkages between the banking system and the
NBFIs. The exercise could cover deposits in banks by NBFIs, loans from banks to NBFIs, offbalance sheet exposures (such as non-life credit insurance sold to banks), cross ownership,
common exposures to the property sector and how NBFIs use banks for payments services.



The authorities are aware of the capacity issues in NBFIRA and continue to strengthen its
skill base and regulatory infrastructure. In addition, the government is putting in place the
supporting enabling legislation for pension fund and life insurance institutions, which would
include parameters such as minimum capital requirements for non-banks, maximum
concentration by borrower and sector, and relevant solvency indicators.

10

20

The current regulatory framework provides the legal force to implement macroprudential measures when needed.

These include increasing the quality of public spending, improving the efficiency and
effectiveness of the tax system, reducing the costs of doing business, and diversifying the
economy. In addition, given the negative impact of income inequalities on growth spells, staff
recommended policies to target inequality more effectively, including fostering high quality
investment in health and education.12
The nature of Botswana’s resource rich and landlocked economy is an obstacle to
diversification, and leveraging its strong physical capital and institutions could improve
diversification prospects. In addition, the restrictive service sector and shortage of high-skilled
workers, has hindered knowledge transfer and innovation.



The authorities are aware of the economy’s long-term challenges, and the recent MTR of
NDP 10 aims to address them. The MTR of NDP 10 stressed the government’s intention to
reinvigorate reforms and lay the foundations for greater private sector development in
Botswana. The government’s multi-pronged approach to diversification (through the Economic
Diversification Drive-EDD) leverages Botswana’s areas of comparative advantage to support new
engines of growth. Given the country’s well-established infrastructure for mineral development,
the focus is on expanding the mineral product space beyond diamonds, including downstream
sectors which have relatively large employment multipliers, as well as cost-effective service
sectors. In addition, the authorities noted that policy coordination among government agencies
that was initiated in the thematic working groups for the MTR of NDP 10 was to ensure macromicro congruence and overall consistency of the policy initiatives for boosting job creation and
diversification. The authorities are also focusing on improving the business climate in the
country in response to Botswana’s reduced rankings in the doing business indicators.

E. Other Surveillance Issues
23.
Data quality is broadly adequate for surveillance, although there is room for
improvement. While steady progress has been made by Statistics Botswana most notably for
rebasing the country’s national income accounts, challenges remain in the compilation of some of
the components of the national accounts. In this respect, staff sees merit for further Fund technical
assistance in the area of national accounts. There is also room for improvement in the compilation
of the balance of payments statistics, including data on trade in services. Following the relocation of
the aggregation and sales functions of the Diamond Trading Company (DTC, a De Beers subsidiary)
from London to Gaborone, the BoB has introduced detailed new tables for import and export of
diamonds to present the rising re-exports trade for diamonds. The BoB and Statistics Botswana are
also working closely on the appropriate treatment of diamond related re-export trade both in the
national accounts and balance of payments. Staff also welcomed the BoB’s efforts to collect
information on property prices. Finally, in line with some of its upper-middle income country peers,
staff commends Botswana’s plan to move towards subscribing to the IMF’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard.

STAFF APPRAISAL
24.
Botswana has made impressive strides in economic development over the past two
decades. The positive growth record registered by the country has raised overall incomes and
delivered good economic outcomes.
25.
However, in recent years, Botswana’s trend growth has softened in the midst of
persistent unemployment and high income inequality. Reducing the relative size of the
government (as a share of GDP) would improve labor market outcomes, create more productive
investment opportunities for the financial sector, and enhance economic diversification.
26.
The recent mid-term review (MTR) the 10th National Development Plan (NDP10)
serves as the authorities’ blueprint for structural transformation. Staff welcomes the MTR of
NDP 10, which stressed the government’s intention to reinvigorate the implementation of reforms
to lay the foundations for greater private sector development in Botswana.
27.
The uncertain global economic environment and the potential spillovers to Botswana
call for a delicate balancing act in the implementation of macroeconomic policies in the near
term. Botswana’s fiscal and external positions are very strong, thanks to the government’s prudent
macroeconomic management. A “growth-friendly” fiscal consolidation strategy adopted in the
FY2013/14 budget is appropriate. In the near term, staff advocates for a broadly neutral monetary
policy stance. In a more adverse scenario, the authorities should allow the automatic stabilizers to
work on the revenue side. In such adverse scenarios, there might be some scope to ease monetary
policy given that inflationary pressures would likely decline.
28.
The authorities’ medium-term fiscal strategy adopted in the FY2013/14 budget should
help to rebuild the policy buffers. In the staff’s view, the pace of the government’s medium term
fiscal consolidation strategy is appropriate.
29.
Staff urges the government to articulate a clearer set of measures to underpin the
reduction of the wage bill as a share of GDP, which should help improve labor market
outcomes. Botswana’s public employment and wage policies lead to high reservation wages and
attract a larger share of labor force into public sector at the expense of the private sector.
30.
Broadening the tax base would make the process of fiscal adjustment more balanced.
This would require enhanced efforts in streamlining the existing large and discretionary tax
expenditures. Staff welcomes efforts by the authorities toward a simplified tax system with high
compliance and a low cost of administration as articulated in the recent mid-term review of NDP 10.
31.
Botswana’s exchange rate regime has served the country well. The government’s
publication of the weights of the Pula currency basket and its rate of crawl bodes well for enhancing
the transparency of the exchange rate regime.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

BOTSWANA

32.
The government’s emphasis on greater financial inclusion through its financial sector
development strategy, while preserving the stability of the financial system, is appropriate.
Staff recommends that the authorities strengthen their existing architecture for monitoring financial
sector developments to temper the rate of increase in household borrowing and thereby help
minimize the associated vulnerabilities. In this context, staff welcomes efforts by the Bank of
Botswana in strengthening the work of its Financial Stability Division.
33.
Returning to an era of strong growth would require a set of reform-oriented,
innovative policies to reinvigorate economy-wide productivity growth. These include
increasing the quality of public spending, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the tax
system, including by fighting tax evasion, reducing the cost of doing business, and diversifying the
economy.
34.
The government’s multi-pronged approach to diversification that leverages
Botswana’s areas of comparative advantage is a step in the right direction. Delivering good
outcomes from these policies would require supportive measures to liberalize the service sectors
and reduce the domestic regulatory burden on firms.
35.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Botswana take place on
the standard 12-month cycle.

Fiscal Policy

Authorities’ Response
Broadly consistent
The FY2013/14 Budget targets a small
fiscal surplus, and is centered on further
expenditure restraint, while improving
the quality of spending. Mid-term
review of the authorities NDP10
envisages fiscal surpluses in the next
three year. Despite the authorities’
announcement of a 5 percent targeted
reduction in the original FY2012/13
budget, spending on wages in percent
of GDP increased by about a half
percentage point in FY2012/13.

The fiscal stance is not formally delinked
from volatile mining revenues. While the
authorities recognize the need to delink
the fiscal stance from volatility in the
mining revenue, they are of the view
that their sustainable budget index rule
provides enough ground to deal with
this volatility.

The RAM shows events that could materially alter the baseline path—the scenario most likely to materialize in staff’s view. The relative

likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below
10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on
the source of risks and overall level of concern at the time of discussions with the authorities.

Appendix I. Managing Inward Global Spillovers1
1.
Context: Natural-resource based and highly open economies like Botswana’s are
vulnerable to global economic shocks. The global demand for diamonds—Botswana’s main
export—highly depends on developments in advanced economies, and to a lesser extent in key
emerging market economies—in particular, China and India, whose share of diamond consumption
increased in recent years albeit coming from a low base. Botswana is also exposed to spillovers
through strong economic and financial linkages with South Africa, where recent developments and
outlook suggest sluggish growth.
2.
An estimated vector autoregressive model indicates a significant but short-lived
impact of a growth slowdown in advanced economies on diamond prices and hence
Botswana’s output growth.1A one standard deviation decline in output growth in advanced

South Africa has strong ties with other countries in the region, including its partners in
the Southern African Customs Union (SACU)—Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, and Swaziland
(BLNS). South Africa’s economy is by far the largest—it accounts for about 90 percent of the
region’s GDP at market exchange rates. It is also tightly integrated with the economies of its
neighbors, while also being exposed to global shocks. It is often described as an “engine of growth”
for the region. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that South Africa’s business cycle and its long-term
growth rate will affect its neighbors. While there are multiple linkages (trade, investment, financial,
institutional) that appear plausible, formal econometric analysis has found their net spillover impact

to be statistically insignificant. This reflects the fact that Botswana’s trade linkage with South Africa is
mainly through imports rather than diamond exports. South Africa appears to channel global
economy shocks to the regional economy, rather than directly affecting countries in the region.2
Overall, a possible explanation is that the multiple spillover channels operate in ways that offset
each other, so their net impact is relatively small.3
4.
Staff also conducted a simulation analysis using the Global Integrated Monetary and
Fiscal model (GIMF), tailored to Botswana’s specific economic circumstances. Four regions are
included to capture Botswana, the United States, the euro area, and the rest of the world, which
includes emerging market economies and South Africa. The model includes the financial sector and
the natural resource sector set up as the diamond sector. Monetary policy is modeled as a Taylor
rule, and, for Botswana, the crawling peg regime is captured by some weights in an interest rate
reaction function on exchange rate differential to the rest of the world. The share of liquidityconstrained households who do not have access to finance is calibrated to 60 percent in Botswana,
based on data from the 2009 Finscope survey.
5.
The simulations suggest that global spillovers to Botswana would be limited and
short-lived in adverse scenarios beyond the baseline (Figure 3). The adverse scenarios are based
on a selected set of external risks in the Risk Assessment Matrix (Table 2). They consist of (i) reemergence of financial stress in the euro area, (ii) a deeper-than-expected slowdown in emerging
market economies, and (iii) capital flow reversal from emerging markets.4 Botswana’s output growth
would be lower by 1–1½ percentage points than the baseline, and the impact would dissipate in
about one year. The transmission works mainly through the trade channel as lower global demand
for diamonds results in a decline in Botswana’s diamond exports. The resulting limited and transitory
spillover impact reflects the storable nature of diamonds that allows Debswana (Botswana's joint
venture with De Beers) to smooth shocks by adjusting inventories, and also stems from the transitory
impact of the initial shocks on the global economy.
6.
In light of the assessment that global spillovers to Botswana would be limited and
short-lived, staff believes that in the event of such an adverse scenario beyond the baseline,
an appropriate response would be to let the automatic stabilizers work on the revenue side.
Pursuing more active discretionary fiscal stimulus measures would not be recommended owing to
the need to re-build the fiscal buffers and the likelihood that the effect of fiscal expansion would
leak abroad through imports in an open economy like Botswana. Consumer price inflation would be
2

A bulk of Botswana’s exports goes to countries other than South Africa. See also Canales-Kriljenko, Gwenhamo, and
Thomas, 2013, IMF Working Paper, WP/13/31 (Washington: International Monetary Fund).
3

This explanation is based on ongoing work by staff in the IMF African Department’s Southern II Division (Olivier
Basdevant, Andrew Jonelis, Borislava Mircheva, Slavi Slavov) on the impact of the growth slowdown in South Africa
on Botswana and other SACU members.
4

Specific shocks in the model are: (i) an increase in credit spreads, reaching 3.4 percentage points after two years
(2.4 percentage points in the first year) combined with a 100 basis point increase in the sovereign risk premium for
the euro area, (ii) a 25 percentage point investment shock in the rest of world with a 10 percentage point commodity
price shock, and (iii) a 200 basis point increase in the sovereign risk premium for the rest of the world.

lower than the baseline scenario, as economic activity decelerates, which would provide space for
further easing of monetary policy in such an adverse scenario.

Appendix II. External Stability and Competitiveness
Assessment1
1.
Context: Botswana’s external position remains strong with a high level of international
reserves and low external debt, even though the current account has been in deficit since the
2008–09 financial crisis (Figure 1). Since 2008, imports grew faster than diamond exports,
resulting in trade deficit (Figure 2). The fast import growth was in line with strong household
consumption, partly associated with the rapid growth in lending to household (Appendix III). The
import growth in 2012 also reflected the need to increase energy imports owing to electricity supply
shortages. Official transfers, mainly SACU revenue, have largely contributed to the narrowing of the
current account deficit. As a result, the overall external position continues to be relatively strong
with official reserve coverage standing at about 11 months of import cover at end-June 2013.
Botswana has not been significantly affected by the recent surge in capital inflows from advanced
economies as portfolio flows remain relatively small because foreign direct investment constitutes a
bulk of the inflows in the balance of payments.
2.
The current account balance is projected to return to a surplus over the medium term.
This will be driven by the planned fiscal consolidation and the expected recovery in diamond exports
along with the global recovery. As measures by the government succeed in tempering the rate of
growth of household borrowing, import growth should slow. This, combined with a stable electricity
supply from the Morupule B power plant, will contribute to closing the current account deficit.

Botswana’s crawling peg arrangement has been largely resilient against external
shocks, underpinned by a strong external position. Since 2005, the authorities have pursued a
crawling peg regime to preserve external competitiveness through real exchange rate stability. While
the regime has evolved over the years, exchange rate policy has revolved around two main
objectives: (i) contain imported inflation and provide a nominal anchor for prices, and (ii) support

the broader national competitiveness goal, export promotion, and economic diversification. The
regime is implemented through a continuous adjustment of the nominal effective exchange rate
(NEER) of the pula, based on the differential between the inflation objective and trading partners’
inflation forecast. The pula is pegged to a basket of currencies comprising SDR currencies and the
South African rand.

The pula is broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals. The estimates of exchange
rate misalignments in Botswana, based on four CGER methodologies, are diverse, and their
confidence intervals are wide (Table 1).2 Overall, staff analysis shows the REER is broadly in line with
macroeconomic fundamentals from a medium-term perspective. However, the external sustainability

Non-price competitiveness indicators suggest that Botswana performs well relative to
its peers, but important challenges remain (Figure 5). Botswana performs better than other

misalignments. The resulting elasticity of the current account balance to the REER for Botswana is -0.5—more elastic
than standard—reflecting high price-elasticity of mineral exports.

labor market efficiency. However, Botswana has been consistently lagging its peers on health and
education. These indicators reinforce the need to prioritize investments in human capital to address
constraints to improvements in competitiveness. Sustained effort on structural reforms geared
toward reducing the regulatory burden on firms and reducing the costs of doing business would
also help to boost competitiveness.

Appendix III. Balancing Financial Inclusion and Stability—
Policy Challenges from Household Debt1
1.
Context: Striking an appropriate balance between financial inclusion and stability is an
emerging policy challenge for Botswana as in many SMICs. Because access to financial services in
Botswana is still relatively low (estimates of the number of adults without access to financial services
is about 33 percent), enhancing financial inclusion and more generally deepening financial
intermediation are key priorities for the government as described in both the Vision 2016 and NDP
10. Deepening financial intermediation is expected to support the authorities’ policy priority for
boosting prospects for economic diversification. At the same time, the recent acceleration in lending
to households has become a source of concern. Specifically, while banks’ current exposure to
household indebtedness does not in itself pose imminent macroeconomic risks in Botswana, the
current growing trend of household indebtedness, if not contained, could eventually become a
source of both financial sector and macroeconomic vulnerability.

current rapid buildup—which is above 30 percent on
the basis of year-on-year growth—warrants close
monitoring considering the region’s benign inflation and tepid growth perspectives.

3.
Banking sector soundness: In broad terms, Botswana’s banking system is profitable and
well capitalized, with relatively low nonperforming loans and adequate buffers to smooth shocks.
The authorities are strengthening their toolkit for monitoring risks in the financial system. For
example, the newly established Financial Stability Division at the Bank of Botswana is developing a
simple stress testing framework, and the model’s preliminary results show systemic banks are
resilient to large shocks. Beyond this, the top four banks (whose market share is above 80 percent)
independently apply their own prudential measures to limit the credit risks from lending to
households, such as ceilings on loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios. Virtually all of the
unsecured household lending is provided to public sector employees and is backed by wages (with
debt repayments deducted directly from their pay checks), limiting the credit risk, unless there is

BOTSWANA

generalized unemployment. Finally, a part of the unsecured lending is reportedly used for building
houses in rural and urban areas, thus some of the loans are indirectly supported by real assets.2
4.
Emerging vulnerabilities: However, there are emerging vulnerabilities stemming from the
high concentration of banks’ loans to households and the acceleration in the growth of unsecured
lending. The level of household debt has arguably increased with declined real incomes and
increased access to credit from various sources—banks and nonbanks such as microlenders and
retail stores. Although the asset sizes are relatively small compared to banks, microlenders provide
unsecured lending to less creditworthy households with limited due diligence and at often punitive
interest rates. Another source of vulnerability is lack of a comprehensive database on the overall
level of household indebtedness. Commercial banks exchange debtors’ (negative) credit information
through a credit bureau, but such monitoring does not cover lending from nonbank sources. Also,
the households’ exposure to interest rate risk can be a source of stress on their balance sheets. Most
of unsecured lending is contracted at variable-rate terms with relatively short maturities, and
household credit growth was partly fueled by the recent years’ low interest rate environment as the
policy rate was cut from 15 percent (in 2008) to the current level of 8.5 percent.
5.
Macroeconomic dimensions: Besides financial stability concerns, the concentration of
credit to the household sector could potentially crowd out resources for other productive economic
sectors. The heavy concentration on household credit in Botswana, and more generally the SACU
region, coincides with the economies’ reliance on consumption instead of investment for growth
(main text Figure 4). The combination of lack of sound investment opportunities for local businesses,
which partly reflects the public sector’s dominance in the economy in SACU, and the concentration
of lending to households could further reinforce the region’s low savings and more generally
consumption-based growth. To promote economic diversification and strengthen the foundation for
future growth, policies would need to consider measures to reduce the size of the government (as a
share of GDP), improve financial intermediation, and direct scarce resources to productive sectors.
6.
Policy challenges: To minimize financial sector vulnerabilities and help direct resources to
business investments, the authorities should implement measures to temper the rate of increase in
household borrowing. One of the measures to consider is macroprudential policy, including the limit
on loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios, and higher risk weights for unsecured household
lending. Additional policy tools would complement macroprudential measures in tempering the
growth of household lending. First, a fully functioning national credit bureau should record
households’ indebtedness, including debt to nonbanks, and other aspects of households’ profiles.
Second, a comprehensive database on households’ balance sheets and disposable income would
facilitate effective monitoring on household indebtedness and risk profiles. Finally, the Non-Bank
Financial Institutions Regulatory Authority (NBFIRA) would need to strengthen its capacity to
supervise the non-banks and avoid regulatory arbitrage between the bank and nonbank sector.
2

Banks do not take certain types of land ownership deeds (tribal land) as collateral for mortgage loans in rural areas.
Thus, debtors often take unsecured lending to finance housing projects on such land.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: On November 30, 2010, the government of Botswana gazetted the commencement of the
Statistics Act of 2009. Under the Act, the Central Statistics Office (CSO), which had been a department of
the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, was transformed into Statistics Botswana (SB),
responsible for the country’s statistical system. SB will operate independently of the Ministry of Finance
and Development Planning, with its own board of Directors.
Macroeconomic data are adequate for surveillance, but some shortcomings exist in terms of accuracy
and reliability of the source data and the statistical techniques used in the compilation of national
accounts, government finance, and balance of payments statistics. The timeliness of the central bank
survey and detailed government expenditure data by economic classification needs to be increased to
better support economic analysis and prepare Botswana for an eventual subscription to the Special
Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). Further improvements would include dissemination of readily
available information on monthly production of diamonds and quarterly aggregate financial soundness
indicators.
The authorities are working on a number of fronts to improve data quality and dissemination: (i) source
data and methodologies are being reviewed for those data with obvious estimation problems/gaps,
(ii) stronger collaboration is being sought among source data producers to secure consistency and
reconcile discrepancies across data sets; (iii) the production of leading economic indicators is currently
underway; and (iv) staff shortages are being addressed within budget constraints.
National Accounts: In October 2012, the Statistics Botswana announced revised time series of GDP
rebased to 2006 as a new benchmark year. However, there are some weaknesses and areas for further
improvements, which at this stage can be considered as limitations for proper use of the revised
national accounts data. The Labor Force Survey (2005/06) is out of date. More frequent surveys would
support a better understanding of poverty and unemployment.
Price Statistics: The official monthly consumer price index (CPI) is available on a timely basis in the SB’s
website. The index is comprehensive and provides breakdowns between urban and rural price data, and
between prices of tradable (domestic and imported) and nontradable goods and services. Currently SB
is working to update the CPI weights based on the recent Household Income and Expenditure Survey.
Compilation challenges include the eventual inclusion of owner-occupied housing price data in the CPI.
Compilation of producer or wholesale prices has been discontinued.
Government Finance Statistics: The concepts and definitions used in compiling government finance
statistics generally follow the guidelines of the IMF’s 1986 Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM
1986) but cover only budgetary central government activities. No fiscal statistics are compiled for extra
budgetary institutions, consolidated central government, or consolidated general government. No
decision has been made by the authorities on adopting a “migration path” to the GFSM 2001
methodology, although the authorities are working with the Fund Statistics Department (STA) toward
that endeavor. Recurrent and development expenditure data are published in an aggregate form.
Development spending comprises a mixture of current and capital spending.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Compilation practices are consistent with the Fund’s Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual. The central bank survey is currently available with a lag of usually about

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BOTSWANA

three months, which is well short of the two-week period recommended in the SDDS. STA’s
recommendation is to make preliminary data available with clear identification of data status. The
authorities prefer a more cautious approach to data dissemination to avoid reputation damage if the
data require revisions. The BoB is seeking to expand the coverage of financial statistics to include the
operations of nonbank financial intermediaries (NBFI), such as pension funds, insurance companies, and
other financial corporations, such as unit trusts, finance companies, and financial auxiliaries. STA’s
recommendation is to focus on data collection in a handful of large institutions within each NBFI
category.
Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Statistics: Annual and quarterly balance
of payments data are published in the Botswana Financial Statistics (BF) and the BoB’s Annual Report.
Preliminary data are generally disseminated within two months of the end of the reporting period, while
revised (final) data are available after nine months. The concepts, structure, and definitions of the
balance of payments statistics follow the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Statistics Manual
(BPM5). Source data are adequate, but the International Transaction Reporting System (ITRS) data—as
opposed to alternative survey data on services and transfer items in the current account—has become
unreliable. Data compilation, estimation, and adjustments mostly employ sound techniques, but the
methods used for estimating missing data (for example, unrecorded trade), f.o.b. /c.i.f. adjustment
factors to import values, and flows from stock data are inadequate. Discrepancies exist in national
accounts data concerning: (i) the valuation of diamond exports and (ii) imports, exports, and payments
related to settlements within the Southern African Customs Union (SACU). Following the relocation of
De Beers’ London operations, the BoB has introduced detailed new forms for import and export of
diamonds to present the rising re-exports trade for diamonds. Compilation challenges include
appropriate treatment of diamond related re-export trade both in the national accounts and balance of
payments.
The BoB conducts an annual survey of Botswana’s investment and international investment position
(IIP). A quarterly IIP survey is also produced for internal use with data from the ITRS.
External Debt: Public external debt data are of good quality and but timeliness could be improved.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Botswana has participated in the GDDS since late 2002. A Data ROSC and its updates were published in
April 2002, March 2004, and April 2007, respectively.
III. Reporting to STA
Monetary data are reported for publication in International Financial Statistics using Standardized Report
Forms and Botswana reports annual balance of payments and IIP data to STA. No government financial
statistics are currently reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By
Anne-Marie Gulde-Wolf
and Mark Flanagan

Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2013
Consultation with Botswana

BOTSWANA

MEDIUM–TERM PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Botswana’s gross public debt was broadly unchanged in pula values but decreased slightly relative
to GDP in 2012/13 compared with 2011/12. The increase in external debt was compensated for by
the decline in domestic debt. As a result, the share of external debt in total debt increased slightly to
68 percent in 2012/13.
Botswana’s historically low level of public debt reflects the authorities’ prudent macroeconomic
policies. This resulted in a significant reserve accumulation, which allowed them to face the Great
Recession with strong policy buffers. Therefore, countercyclical policies were successfully
implemented without much debt accumulation.
Staff’s analysis, based on the permanent income hypothesis, suggests that in order to fully preserve
mineral wealth for future generations, the non-mineral primary balance (NMPB) should be reduced
to about 5 percent of non-mineral GDP from the current level of about 11 percent. 1
The baseline scenario, underlying the staff’s macroeconomic framework, assumes continuing fiscal
consolidation with the primary surplus amounting about 2.4 percent of GDP on average for
2013/14–18/19. The main burden of fiscal adjustment falls on primary expenditure. By 2018/19, the
stock of gross public debt is projected at about 10 percent of GDP (Table 1).
Figure 1 shows two alternative scenarios:
•
The first scenario aims to demonstrate what would be the fiscal outcome if the main macrovariables are maintained at their historical 10-year averages. In this scenario, debt-to-GDP ratio
increases and stabilizes at a level higher than suggested by the baseline scenario. The main driver
of this kind of dynamics is the deteriorated primary balances due to countercyclical fiscal policy
response to the 2008-09 financial crisis.
•
The second scenario assumes no change in the policy and holds the primary fiscal balance
constant at its 2013/14 level (0.8 percent of GDP) throughout the medium-term. In this case, public
debt also stabilizes at a level higher than suggested by the baseline scenario, because the baseline
scenario assumes further fiscal consolidation.

Histocial Scenario

2018

BOTSWANA

MEDIUM–TERM EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Botswana’s gross external debt was broadly stable at US$3.4 billion in 2013 but increased relative
to GDP due to depreciation of Pula against USD. The government’s external borrowing was mainly
from multilateral organizations, including from International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development and African Development Bank.
The stock of Botswana’s gross external debt is projected to decline gradually from about 23 percent
of GDP in 2012 to about 13 percent of GDP in 2018 (Table 2). Ongoing fiscal consolidation
supported by a steady improvement in international terms of trade, and stable FDI inflows should
support a reduction in the external debt ratio.
An alternative scenario, with key debt-creating variables at their historical levels, suggests that
Botswana could become a net creditor vis-à-vis the rest of the world over the medium-term. This is
a notable improvement over the baseline projections (Figure 2).
Simulations suggest that Botswana’s external debt-to-GDP ratio is sensitive only to a current
account shock. A real depreciation shock, while it increases the debt-to-GDP ratio initially, has only
a marginal impact on the medium-term debt dynamics. Moreover, Botswana’s external debt is not
very sensitive to a shock in interest rates and economic activity.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Botswana
On September 9, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Botswana.1
After two consecutive years of strong post-crisis growth, Botswana’s output growth slowed
down from about 6 percent in 2011 to about 4 percent in 2012. The deceleration was driven
by the decline in the mining sector growth owing to the subdued global demand for
diamonds, which continued during the first quarter of 2013. On the expenditure side,
domestic demand was strong in 2012, with private consumption and investments growth at
about 9 and 13 percent, respectively, in real terms.
Consumer price inflation decelerated markedly to 5.8 at end June 2013, just below the upper
end of Bank of Botswana’s (BoB) medium-term objective range of 3–6 percent. Inflation
deceleration was in part due to a base effect of increased administrated prices during last
year. Core inflation, which excludes administered prices, has also declined. The BOB
reduced its policy rate by 100 basis points during April – June 2013 motivated by its positive
medium-term inflation outlook.
Although Botswana’s banking system is profitable and well-capitalized with relatively low
nonperforming loans; there are potential vulnerabilities stemming from the high
concentration of banks’ loans to household and the acceleration in growth of unsecured
lending. While there is no comprehensive data on the overall level of household
indebtedness, due mainly to the paucity of information on household credit from the nonbanking sector, the level of household leverage has increased significantly in recent years.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary
is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing up can be found

The budget was balanced in fiscal year (FY) FY2012/13; the first time since the 2008 crisis.
The ongoing fiscal consolidation appears to have no substantial dampening impact on nonmineral sector growth. The authorities’ achieved this growth-friendly consolidation through
reining in nonproductive nonwage current expenditure and the windfall of Southern African
Customs Union (SACU) revenues. On the revenue side, non-mineral income tax and mineral
revenues underperformed reflecting subdued economic activity.
Botswana has been in current account deficit since the 2008-09 financial crisis. The
combination of subdued diamond exports and fast import growth continues to drive the trade
deficit. Official transfers, mainly SACU revenues, have also contributed to the narrowing of
the current account deficit from its 2009 level. As a result, the overall external position
continues to be relatively strong with official reserve coverage standing at about 11 months
of import cover at end-June 2013. The real effective exchange rate depreciated slightly over
the last 12 months.
Staff projects that Botswana’s real GDP growth will remain at about 4 percent in 2013.
Growth is expected to pick up slightly to 4.5 percent in 2015 supported by the increased
electricity production and a recovery in the mining sector, and subsequently stabilize at
around 4 percent. Headline inflation is likely to remain close to the upper end of the BoB’s
medium-term objective range in 2013. The current account deficit is expected to narrow in
the coming years supported by the public sector savings generated by the planned fiscal
consolidation and the expected recovery in diamond exports along with global recovery.
The main near-term risks relate to the highly uncertain external environment, which remains
fragile and poses significant downside risks to mineral export demand, and on the domestic
front to delays in the full commencement of the Morupule B power plant. Another mediumterm risk is the prospect that SACU revenues may decline either because of a prolonged
period of low global growth or changes in the SACU revenue-sharing formula.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Botswana’s impressive economic performance over the past
two decades, which has raised overall incomes and delivered good economic outcomes.
Nonetheless, amid softening growth, persistent unemployment, and high income inequality,
Directors stressed the need to improve public sector efficiency and speed up reforms to
promote economic diversification.
Directors supported a gradual, growth-friendly fiscal consolidation to rebuild policy buffers.
Should the need arise, automatic stabilizers on the revenue side should be allowed to operate.
Directors stressed the importance of protecting planned capital spending while reducing the
large public sector wage bill and unproductive current spending. They urged the authorities
to broaden the tax base by streamlining the existing large and discretionary tax expenditures.

3

They welcomed the authorities’ efforts to create a simplified tax system with high
compliance and low administration costs.
Directors supported a broadly neutral monetary policy stance in the near term. They
welcomed the government’s publication of the weights of the pula currency basket and its
rate of crawl, which will enhance the transparency of the exchange rate regime and facilitate
the development of the foreign currency market. They stressed the importance of continuing
to strengthen the operational modalities of the crawling peg regime.
Directors concurred with the government’s strategy of keeping a right balance between
financial inclusion and financial system stability. They encouraged the authorities to enhance
their existing mechanisms for monitoring financial sector developments to temper the growth
in household borrowing and unsecured lending. They welcomed efforts by the Bank of
Botswana to strengthen the work of its Financial Stability Division, and urged the authorities
to continue to enhance the skill base and regulatory infrastructure of the Non-Bank Financial
Institutions Regulatory Authority.
Directors highlighted the need to raise economy-wide productivity, including through
fostering private sector development and economic diversification. Priorities include
reducing the domestic regulatory burden on firms and increasing investments in health and
education. Directors welcomed the authorities’ multi-pronged approach to promoting
diversification, leveraging Botswana’s areas of comparative advantage.

Statement by Mr. Saho on Botswana
September 9, 2013
My authorities in Botswana are grateful for the constructive discussions they had with staff
during the recent Article IV Consultations. Generally, my authorities agree with the main
thrust of the staff report, particularly with respect to the assessment of important policy and
institutional developments. Furthermore, my authorities are of the view that the report
provides a fair account of recent economic performance and prospects.
There is a general consensus between my authorities and staff that the previous strong
economic performance driven by the mining industry, especially, diamonds has tapered off,
and that time has come for a more diversified private sector to take a lead in growing the
economy. To be sure, my authorities have long recognized the need to diversify the economic
base in order to transition from a diamond dependent economy to a broader based one. To
this end, my authorities have implemented a number of initiatives such as the publication of
“Botswana Excellence – A Strategy for Economic Diversification and Sustainable Growth”,
and the launch of the Economic Diversification Drive, meant to guide the economy in
addressing challenges that hamper the diversification of the economy.
As reflected in the views of my authorities, the staff report has adequately covered most of
the issues; hence this statement will reiterate important developments and highlight those that
transpired after the release of the staff report and some areas of different stand points
between staff and authorities.
Recent Economic Developments
Real Growth
The Botswana economy grew by 4.2 percent in 2012, down from 6.1 percent in 2011, as
mining output continued to decline, mainly reflecting a slack in the global demand for
diamonds, the country’s major export commodity. According to the latest GDP data, the
domestic economy grew by 3.2 percent (unseasonalized) in the first quarter of 2013,
reflecting another contraction in mining output, after the sector posted a substantial growth in
the previous quarter. Overall, growth in the first half of 2013 remained subdued, and both
staff and authorities expect the economy to grow by about 4 percent during the year.
However, this is subject to continued resilience of the non-mineral sector which has been
driving growth in recent years. Furthermore, additional ventures in mining, particularly in the
coal and copper industries are expected to complement performance of the non-mineral
sector in spurring growth in the remainder of 2013.
However, the prognosis also points to downside risks, predicated on the continued fragilities
that hamper the pace of economic recovery in the global markets, hence the demand for
Botswana’s mineral exports. The latter is among the largest single sectoral contributors to
aggregate output hence, sets the tone for the country’s economic growth, making the
economy vulnerable to external pressures. This prompted the Minister of Finance, in the

2
2013 Budget Speech, to advocate for the development of the potential of the non-mining
sector to counter uncertainties surrounding performance in mining.
Inflation
Domestic inflation averaged 7.5 percent for the whole of 2012, and this average was
maintained from January 2013 to April 2013. However, annual inflation dropped to 6.1
percent in May, 5.8 percent in June and 5.7 percent in July, and thus falling within the Bank
of Botswana’s (BoB) inflation objective range of 3-6 percent. This is in line with predictions
made during the launch of the 2013 Monetary Policy Statement earlier in the year. The
reason for the decline in inflation was the dissipation of inflationary pressures arising from an
increase in administered prices during the first half of 2012. A generally subdued increase in
prices of most categories of goods and services during the period, also contributed to the
declining inflation. After accounting for all the upside and downside risks, the Mid Term
Review of the 2013 Monetary Policy Statement anticipates the sustenance of inflation within
the objective range of 3-6 percent for the rest of the year.
Fiscal Policy
The 2013 National Budget Speech reiterated government’s commitment to fiscal
consolidation and returning the budget balance to a surplus. The same sentiment was
repeated in the mid-term review of the National Development Plan 10, which aims for
surpluses throughout the remaining years of the Plan period ending in 2015/16. Already, the
revised budget estimates for 2012/13 recorded a modest surplus, while the preliminary
budget for 2013/14 also predicts a small surplus, and this is expected to improve in 2014/15
and 2015/16.
To help achieve the envisaged balanced budgets, my authorities recognize that as public
expenditure cuts continue, there is a need to return economic growth to pre-global crises
levels through improvements in productivity and competitiveness to raise additional
revenues. Doing so would also minimize negative effects of austerity measures on the nation.
Furthermore, additional revenue would allow fiscal policy to continue stimulating the
economy when the need arises, and thus pursue a ‘growth friendly’ fiscal consolidation
strategy referred to by staff in their report.
My authorities are also committed to rationalizing and prioritizing expenditure to high return
and self-liquidating projects. The resultant efficient expenditure would pave a way for a
leaner public sector, and enable government to facilitate a conducive environment for the
private sector to ultimately play a paramount role in driving the economy. In addition,
through privatization and divestiture of state owned enterprises and outsourcing of non-core
duties, direct role of government in economic activity will be reduced as private sector
participation improves.
Monetary Policy and Exchange Rates
The medium term monetary policy objective of the BoB is to achieve price stability, by
maintaining an inflation level that falls within the range of 3 – 6 percent, which is supportive
of a sustainable long run growth and development of the domestic economy. In pursuit of this

3
objective, BoB uses interest rates and open market operations to influence domestic demand
conditions and, hence, the rate of price changes.
Throughout 2013, monetary policy has been used to invigorate the economy, as the
continued public spending restraint implied limited ability of fiscal policy to pursue that role,
as was the case during the pre financial crisis period. The prevalent international environment
of slow growth in both demand and commodity prices, provided an opportune time for the
Bank of Botswana to pursue an accommodative policy stance to support economic growth,
whilst inflationary pressures remained benign. Similarly, domestic pressures on inflation
were fairly weak, reflecting the slowdown in growth of both household income and
government expenditure, and an economy operating below capacity. The developments,
further allowed the BoB to inject a non-inflationary stimulus to the economy. Accordingly,
BoB reduced the bank rate by 50 basis points in April from 9.5 percent to 9 percent, and
again in June to 8.5 percent. A further 50 basis points reduction was effected in August
bringing the policy rate to 8 percent, as the international and domestic conditions remained
conducive for such a stimulus.
The Exchange Rate
The BoB policy objective range of 3-6 percent, which roughly matches inflation in trading
partners, is also intended to support external competitiveness, through maintenance of a
stable real effective exchange rate (REER), in the context of a crawling peg exchange rate
regime adopted in 2005. For the first time the rate of crawl, which is -0.16 for 2013, and the
composition of the Pula currency basket (55% South Africa Rand and 45% SDR), were
published in the 2013 Budget Speech. Staff welcomed this as a positive development towards
transparency in the country’s exchange rate policy.
During the first half of 2013, the real effective exchange rate of the Pula appreciated by 0.1
percent.
Financial Sector Stability
As reflected in the staff report, the Botswana banking system remains profitable and well
capitalized, with a relatively low incidence of non-performing loans (NPLs). Household
credit, mainly unsecured debt, constitutes the largest share of total commercial bank lending.
Credit to households increased sharply, by about 30 percent, between 2011 and 2012,
following another high increase of almost 20 percent between 2010 and 2011. A high
proportion of household debt is due to unsecured borrowing, at about 70 percent of total
household credit.
Despite the high rise in unsecured household credit between 2011 and 2012, the NPLs ratio
increased negligibly from 2.6 percent to 2.8 percent in the period. Therefore, staff and
authorities agreed that the ballooning unsecured lending does not pose an immediate threat to
financial sector stability. My authorities will continue to monitor the developments in the
credit market and shall not hesitate to take requisite macroprudential policy measures, should
the need arise.

5
Conclusion
The economy of Botswana has performed very well in the past decades, driven by diamond
exports. The recent global crises have revealed vulnerabilities of the domestic economy, thus
calling for an urgent diversification of the economy, reduction of government, empowering
the private sector and nurturing alternative sources of government revenue through measures
such as tax efficiency and effectiveness. A successful diversification strategy would also help
to address persistent challenges of unemployment and lack of inclusive growth.
