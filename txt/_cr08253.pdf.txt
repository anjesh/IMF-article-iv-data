Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2008 Consultation with Japan
Approved by Daniel Citrin and Adnan Mazarei
June 27, 2008

•

This report is based on discussions held in Tokyo during May 13–22. The team
comprised Messrs. Citrin (Head), Gordon, Kang, Iizuka, N’Diaye, Sommer (all APD),
Mr. Semblat (OAP) and Mr. Frydl (MCM). Messrs. Kotegawa and Yamaoka (both OED)
also participated.

Counterparts. The mission met with Bank of Japan (BoJ) Deputy Governor Nishimura,
Vice-Minister of Finance for International Affairs Shinohara, other senior officials,
academics, and private sector representatives.

•

Context of past surveillance. In recent years, the Fund and the authorities have agreed on
the broad policy priorities—pursuing medium-term fiscal consolidation, further
strengthening the financial and corporate sectors, and stepping up productivity-boosting
reforms. Notwithstanding the progress made, the Fund has advocated that fiscal
consolidation and structural reforms proceed at a somewhat faster pace to strengthen
growth prospects in the context of population aging and promote an orderly adjustment of
global imbalances.

•

Japan’s exchange rate is market determined. Japan has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII. The exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of current
international transactions, with the exceptions of those notified to the Fund in accordance
with Executive Board Decision 144-(52/51) and UN-sanctioned restrictions on external
payments for security reasons.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND STAFF APPRAISAL
Outlook and risks. Japan appears headed for a modest slowdown, although there remain risks
from the global economy. Subprime fallout has been limited and activity has been supported
by strong exports to non-U.S. destinations. GDP growth is expected to moderate to slightly
below potential in 2008–09 in line with lower global demand and the less favorable terms of
trade. Headline CPI inflation has edged up, reflecting higher commodity prices, but wages
remain sluggish, and inflation risks so far appear contained. Risks to the growth outlook have
become more balanced in recent months, although considerable uncertainty remains,
particularly regarding global commodity prices and their effects on the economy.
Fiscal policy. Strong tax collections and cuts in public works have trimmed the fiscal deficit
in recent years, but public debt remains high. The government is targeting a primary deficit
(excluding social security) of ½ percent of GDP in FY2008 (year begins in April) and is
aiming for primary balance by FY2011. Assuming only a slight cyclical downturn, the
FY2008 deficit target should be maintained even if tax revenue falls short. Thereafter, a more
ambitious strategy would be desirable so as to place public debt on a firmly downward path:
beginning in FY2009, staff recommends deficit cuts of ¾ percent of GDP per year on
average.
Tax reform. With limited scope for further expenditure cuts, fiscal consolidation will require
comprehensive tax reform including raising the consumption tax. The tax reform debate has
moved slowly. Nonetheless, the government’s FY2009 plan to end earmarking of gas taxes is
welcome. The government also intends to increase its contribution to the basic pension, which
will require additional revenue. In light of these plans, various tax reform options are on the
table. A consumption tax hike may become more palatable if it is linked to the need to fund
social security spending and this opportunity to raise the consumption tax rate should be
seized.
Monetary policy and the exchange rate. Underlying inflation is still about zero and the BoJ
can afford to hold interest rates steady until concerns over domestic activity and the global
economy have eased. However, prices have begun to rise, and to guide inflation expectations,
the BoJ is rightly improving communication about the future conduct of monetary policy. The
yen remains market-determined and has appreciated by about 10 percent in real effective
terms since mid-2007, but staff estimates suggest that it remains undervalued relative to its
longer-term equilibrium.
Financial sector policies. Japan was not a major subprime player and the financial system has
escaped serious damage, with the BoJ’s flexible liquidity management keeping money
markets stable. The authorities remain vigilant to risks from further global market disruptions,
as well as from a slowing economy. Banks’ end-year results already incorporate additional
information on structured holdings as called for by the Financial Stability Forum (FSF).
Bolstering capital cushions and improving risk management would help to further strengthen
the financial system and enhance financial intermediation.

4

Structural reforms. It would be highly desirable to reinvigorate structural reforms. Priorities
remain to increase labor market flexibility and promote competition through greater market
opening and further deregulation in sectors such as agriculture and services. Such reforms
could lift medium-term growth prospects and contribute to the resolution of global
imbalances.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12-month
cycle.
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The economy has weathered the global financial turbulence fairly well, but the
terms of trade loss has weakened confidence. Household spending growth has slowed from
its peak in 2006, while corporations have scaled back investment. Both domestic and external
factors have contributed to slowing momentum and deteriorating sentiment. Domestic factors
include the poorly executed tightening of the building code last year and sluggishness in
wages. External factors relate to moderating foreign demand, high fuel and food prices, the
appreciation of the yen, and the global market turmoil. After four years of growth above
potential (estimated at about 1.7 percent), a mild slowdown is expected in 2008-09.
2.
Political developments have also hurt sentiment. Reforms have slowed amid
concerns over widening dualities between regions and sectors, and between regular and
nonregular workers. At the same time, the opposition’s control of the Upper House has
weakened the ruling LDP coalition’s position and Prime Minister Fukuda’s approval rating
has slumped. Feuding in the Diet in March left the BoJ without a Governor and led to a lapse
of the gasoline surcharge. In April, however, a new Governor was appointed and the gasoline
surcharge was reinstated.
II. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.
The economy has shown resilience to the U.S. slowdown, although inflation has
picked up.
•

Activity. GDP grew by 2.1 percent in 2007, down from 2.4 percent the previous year.
Domestic demand weakened significantly, mostly owing to lower private consumption
growth and the regulatory-induced slump in construction activity. In Q1 2008, GDP
growth was strong at 4 percent (q/q, s.a.a.r.), led by robust export demand, particularly
from the rest of Asia and oil-producing countries. A recovery in residential investment
also provided support to growth. However, some of the strength in Q1 may reflect
statistical leap year effects, and leading indicators, such as the BoJ Tankan survey,
point to a slowdown ahead (Figure 1).

•

Inflation. CPI inflation has recently been running at about 1 percent, well above last
year’s levels, with firms starting to pass through cost increases to consumers. Firms
have also responded to higher input prices by granting limited wage increases and unit
labor costs continue to fall on a year-on-year basis. Core inflation, which by staff’s
definition excludes both fuel and food prices, remains about zero. Measures of
inflation expectations have various flaws, but suggest that short-term inflation
expectations have risen, while longer-term expectations remain contained.

•

Current account balance. The external surplus rose to 4.8 percent of GDP in 2007 on
the back of strong export demand and a continued surge in investment income. In Q1,
the trade balance narrowed substantially owing to the large deterioration in the terms
of trade, while income inflows continued apace.

•

Exchange rate. The yen has appreciated against major currencies, particularly the
U.S. dollar through March 2008, supported by an unwinding of carry trades and the
large current account surplus. Outflows by Japanese investors continued to provide an
offset. While the yen has more recently begun to weaken again, the real effective
exchange rate has risen about 10 percent since mid-2007.

4.
The fallout from the global market turmoil on the financial system has also been
limited (Figure 2).
•

Money markets. The spread between 3-month LIBOR and the overnight index swap
(OIS) rate has widened, but to a lesser extent than in the United States and Euro area
and with considerably less volatility. The more muted impact in Japan reflects the
banking system’s lower exposure to subprime and other securitized products. Larger
and more frequent liquidity operations by the BoJ, including for same-day settlement,
have also helped to stabilize money markets.

•

Financial Institutions. Subprime-related losses for banks, including their securities
affiliates, have risen to $8 billion, but still remain well within operating profits and
capital.1 Profits of nonbank lenders relying on wholesale financing, such as consumer
finance companies, have been affected by higher funding costs due to the financial
turmoil and the introduction of tighter interest rate ceilings under the new consumer
finance law. However, the size of these lenders relative to banks is small.

•

Stock markets. The Japanese stock market has been highly volatile and fell sharply in
early 2008, driven by heavy selling by foreign investors related in part to the need to

Official data on losses made by other securities and insurance companies have not been released, but a recent

III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
Staff’s Assessment
5.

The economy appears headed for a soft landing, notwithstanding downside risks.

•

Baseline. Staff project GDP growth to moderate to around 1½ percent in 2008
and 2009, somewhat below potential. Private consumption and business investment
are likely to slow, offset in part by a turnaround in construction and robust exports to
emerging markets.2 Headline CPI inflation is expected to rise to around 1 percent
in 2008, reflecting higher food and fuel prices, but should moderate somewhat next
year as pressure from commodity prices dissipates. The current account surplus is
expected to narrow to 4 percent of GDP in 2008.

6.
Given the uncertain outlook, significant deviations from the baseline cannot be
ruled out. These include a global recession scenario and higher-than-expected global
inflation in the context of a slow global recovery:

2

The share of Japan’s exports to North America and Western Europe has declined from 56 percent in 1990 to
49 percent in 2000 and 36 percent in 2007. Export shares to Asia have risen from 31 percent in 1990 to
41 percent in 2000 and 48 percent in 2007.

9
•

Global recession. A downside scenario, such as that considered in the April 2008
WEO in which annual growth in the United States falls to -1¾ percent in 2009 (and
global growth declines to 2¼ percent), would likely put the Japanese economy on the
edge of a “shallow” recession.3 If such a global slump were accompanied by renewed
financial turmoil that further tightens credit conditions, confidence and domestic
demand in Japan could weaken by even more. Even with a monetary easing in Japan,
inflation could fall back into negative territory. Given Japan’s increased trade and
financial integration with the rest of Asia, there would be negative spillovers effects
on the region. Growth in emerging Asia would fall by 1¼ percentage points.

Global inflation. International commodity prices could continue to soar, raising
inflation expectations and fanning generalized inflation. Assume for illustration a
supply shock that raises global inflation by about one percentage point in 2009,
eliciting a round of monetary tightening across countries and requiring a period of
below-potential global growth. If monetary tightening was to lag in Japan, perhaps
because the growth outlook still appeared very uncertain, staff simulations show that
inflation in Japan could rise to as high as 2 percent by 2010. Alternatively, if monetary
policy was to be tightened at the same time as in other countries, the pick-up in

10
inflation would likely be smaller. Growth would decline by a little more initially, but
would also recover faster.
The Authorities’ Views
7.

The authorities had a similar assessment of the outlook and risks.

•

Near-term outlook for growth and inflation. In its semi-annual Outlook in April, the
BoJ noted that it expected GDP growth to slow this fiscal year to around potential.
Core inflation (by the BoJ definition, which only excludes fresh food) was projected to
accelerate to around 1 percent, mainly driven by higher fuel and other commodity
prices.

•

Risks. The BoJ considered rising demand from emerging markets and commodityproducing countries to have so far more than offset the adverse effects of the
deterioration in the terms of trade, but there were risks to the near-term outlook from
weaker global growth and financial markets, higher commodity prices, and
deteriorating business confidence. Overall, the risks were judged to be tilted slightly to
the downside in 2008, but more balanced in 2009.
IV. NEAR-TERM POLICY IMPERATIVES IN AN UNCERTAIN GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT

Against the forecast of a soft landing, fiscal policy should focus on medium-term challenges,
while given the considerable uncertainty in the outlook, the current accommodative setting for
monetary policy appears appropriate. Financial sector policies should continue to guard
against spillovers from global markets and risks from slowing domestic activity.
A. Reducing the High Debt Burden
Background
8.
Fiscal consolidation has paused this year and the authorities’ medium-term plans
fail to build on recent progress.
•

FY2007 outturn. Buoyant tax revenue and public investment cuts reduced the general
government primary deficit (excluding social security) to around ½ percent of GDP in
FY2007, down from 3 percent of GDP in FY2005. The net public debt ratio is
estimated to have risen to about 90 percent of GDP in FY2007.

•

FY2008 budget. This year’s budget targets a broadly unchanged primary deficit with a
slight increase in total expenditures due to higher social security costs and lower tax
buoyancy. The gasoline surcharge and other taxes that expired at end March were
quickly reinstated with minimal effect on the FY2008 budget. The revenue is still

11
earmarked for road construction and maintenance, but the authorities intend to
discontinue this practice from FY2009.
•

Authorities’ medium-term plans. The authorities’ revised fiscal plans continue to target
a primary balance (excluding social security) by FY2011. This plan assumes
expenditure cuts of ¥11.4-14.3 trillion (2¼–2¾ percent of GDP), but no major revenue
measures. Under staff’s lower growth projections, the authorities’ plans would be
insufficient to prevent net public debt from continuing to trend up (Figure 3).

•

Consumption tax and social security reform. To address inequities in the pension
system, consideration is being given to extending the coverage of the basic old-age
pension, the National Pension (NP), irrespective of past premium payments and
linking an increase in the consumption tax to the need to finance the pension program
(Box I). An immediate challenge is to finance a planned increase in the government’s
contribution to the NP system from ⅓ to ½ in FY2009 at a cost of about ¥2½ trillion
(0.5 percent of GDP). This is equivalent to increasing the consumption tax rate by
1 percentage point to 6 percent.

Policy Issues and Staff Views
9.
Fiscal policy should remain focused on reducing the high debt burden and
addressing the needs of an aging population.
•

Near-term fiscal stance: The FY2008 budget’s broadly neutral stance seems
unambitious given that public debt is still so high and only a mild slowdown is
expected. In the event that revenues fall short of the budget target, it would be prudent
to constrain spending in order to prevent undermining fiscal consolidation. At the
least, an expansionary supplementary budget should be avoided this year.

•

Near-term fiscal stance under a global recession scenario: If growth were to slow
sharply, the automatic stabilizers could be allowed to work, although their size is
subject to uncertainty. The scope for more active fiscal policy is limited by the high
debt and the unsuccessful experience with stimulus spending in the 1990s.

•

Pace of consolidation over the medium term. Starting in FY2009, the staff
recommends an adjustment of the primary balance (excluding social security) of about
¾ percent of GDP per year or about ½ percent of GDP more than in the authorities’
reference path. If maintained on average through FY2013, this would lead to a primary
surplus of 1¾ percent of GDP in FY2013 and put the public net debt ratio firmly on a
downward path (Appendix I). Faster consolidation could help to dispel uncertainties
over the pension system that may be weighing on consumption. Restoring Japan’s

Box I. Linking Tax and Pension Reforms
Japan’s social security system is under scrutiny. Concerns have arisen about whether the pension system
provides a sufficient safety net given Japan’s rapid aging and widening economic disparities. This has led to
the beginning of a public debate on revamping the pension system. At the same time, government health
spending is growing rapidly as Japan ages. Discussions are still at an early stage, but have centered around
proposals to link an increase in the consumption tax to the need to fund higher social security spending.1

opt out of the pension system, a tendency that may have
been reinforced by concerns about mismanagement of a large number of records that was revealed in
Parliament in 2007. In addition, with the number of marginalized workers (e.g., non-regular workers, workers
without past pension payments) also rising, concerns about the limited coverage of the pension system have
mounted.

extend coverage to those who have opted out of the
current system. These reforms would help improve the current inter-generational inequality arising from the
pension system (Chart). Other pension reforms such as increasing the retirement age and promoting labor
market attachment are also under discussion.

The proposals may serve as a vehicle to achieve political support for a consumption tax increase. In
2006, proposals were floated to raise the consumption tax rate as part of a general fiscal consolidation strategy
that also involved sizable medium-term expenditure reductions, but did not gain traction. However, taxpayers
may be more likely to accept a tax hike if framed in terms of the need to finance social security expenses. In
addition, such a reform would alleviate concerns over life after retirement by providing a basic pension to the
elderly on more generous terms.
That said, difficult tasks remain in the design. Managing a smooth transition to the new system will be
challenging. Japan’s pension system has been premium-based for decades and it will be particularly important
not to overly penalize those who have paid and continue to pay premiums. Other challenges include monitoring
individual income for means testing and coordination between the pension and tax agencies. And, finally, since
the coverage of the NP scheme would be expanded, it will be critical to ensure that consumption tax increases
are sufficient to cover higher spending.

Expenditure cuts are nearing their limit and further fiscal consolidation will
require tax measures, including raising the consumption tax.
•

Tax reform. A comprehensive reform of the tax system would be desirable to improve
efficiency and secure fiscal sustainability.5 The proposed ending of earmarking
gasoline taxes to road construction in FY2009 is welcome and would support the
government’s plan to continue reducing public works by 3 percent a year.

•

Pension financing reform. Proposals to link an increase in the consumption tax to
social security funding have some merit given that this may be a politically palatable
way to strengthen the fiscal position (Box I). Such a reform could also help address
concerns over inequality in net pension benefits between generations, as well as
between those covered and not covered by the system.

•

Strengthening social security. Significant parametric reforms of the pension system
were introduced following the five-yearly review conducted in 2004. While the debate
over pension financing options is now commanding more attention, the next actuarial
valuation of the pension system scheduled for 2009 provides an opportunity to assess
whether additional reforms such as increasing the retirement age are necessary to
support medium-term fiscal sustainability.

The Authorities’ Responses and Policy Intentions
11.
The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to fiscal consolidation, but stressed
the difficulty of doing more than currently planned.
•

Near-term fiscal stance. The authorities recognized that the budget outlook was
subject to uncertainty, and should revenue fall short, were unsure to what extent they
could reduce expenditure to meet the FY 2008 budget. The authorities also wondered
why the Fund’s recent advice to member countries to allow full play to the automatic
stabilizers did not apply. Staff responded that the baseline scenario was for only a
moderate decline in growth and Japan’s fiscal problems seemed particularly pressing.

•

Pace of consolidation over the medium term. The authorities remain committed to
achieving primary balance (excluding social security) by FY2011. While the growth
assumptions underlying the medium-term plans might be optimistic, they noted that it

The global implications of fiscal consolidation in Japan were analyzed in IMF country report 06/276.

System, Tax Commission, November 2007 (available at www.mof.go.jp/english/tax/e0711a.pdf).

15
would be difficult to accelerate the pace of fiscal consolidation given the need for
additional social security outlays. Fiscal plans also had to recognize that there was a
significant body of political opinion that put economic growth ahead of fiscal
consolidation, especially given concerns over increased dualities.
•

Reform options. Terminating the earmarking of gasoline tax revenue would facilitate
fiscal consolidation by allowing financing for road-related spending to be moved to
social security spending. While there would be opposition, the proposal might lead to
a more general political discussion of tax reform options. The plan to raise the
government’s funding share for the basic national pension program in FY2009 also
added immediacy to the tax reform debate and the authorities were hopeful that a
comprehensive reform involving a hike in the consumption tax would soon be
initiated.
B. Monetary Policy and the Exchange Rate

Background
12.

Monetary policy is accommodative and inflation risks seem contained (Figure 4).

•

Monetary policy stance. With underlying price pressures and domestic demand weak,
the BoJ has kept the policy rate unchanged at 50 basis points since February 2007,
implying a drop in real interest rates given the uptick in inflation.

•

Market expectations. Core inflation (excluding fresh food) is now close to the center
of the “understanding” of price stability of between zero and 2 percent (Box II). Since
mid-April, the market has changed its assessment of the future course of monetary
policy, pricing in about a 40 percent chance of a rate hike by end-2008, compared to
the earlier expectation of a rate cut.

•

Asset prices. Land prices rose by 1.7 percent in 2007, mainly in large metropolitan
areas and commercial sites, but have lagged nominal GDP on a cumulative basis
since 1970. Entrenched expectations of a continued rise in land prices are absent
according to the latest BoJ opinion surveys.

•

Liquidity management. The BoJ has a flexible monetary management system and
accepts a wide range of collateral, including ABCPs, and extends liquidity at fairly
long maturities. Given the experience under quantitative easing, banks are also more
willing to use the discount window.

Box II. Japan: Developments Regarding the BoJ’s Monetary Policy Framework
Since the exit from quantitative easing in March 2006, the BoJ’s Policy Board has based its
monetary policy decisions on the assessment of economic developments from two perspectives:
(i) the first perspective involves analysis of the most likely outlook for economic activity and prices
1-2 years ahead (i.e., currently through FY2009), while (ii) the second perspective assesses a broad
variety of risks to the outlook, including low-probability but high-cost events (such as asset bubbles)
over a longer time horizon. Monetary policy decisions are guided by the Board Members’
“understanding of medium- to long-term price stability,” which is currently defined as CPI inflation
ranging between 0 and 2 percent. This understanding of price stability is not an inflation target. Instead,
it is the range of inflation outcomes that each member of the Policy Board considers consistent with price
stability.
The Board has enhanced its monetary policy framework in response to increased uncertainty
about the future path of output and inflation. Higher commodity prices are generating cost-push
inflation, while the associated loss of income together with the global economic downturn is dampening
activity. In order to communicate better its views and guide inflation expectations, the Board has
modified its communication policy:

•

The median of the Board Members’ understanding of price stability is now more clearly centered
around 1 percent.

•

The discussion of risks in the
Outlook report has been
expanded to include detailed
risk-balance charts. These riskbalance charts are averages of
probability distributions for
growth and inflation as
perceived by individual Policy
Board members. In contrast, the
fan charts published by
inflation-targeting central banks
such as the Bank of England or
by the IMF’s World Economic
Outlook present a range of
uncertainty around a single
central forecast.

The monetary policy framework and monetary management tools have performed well. Japan’s
money markets remained stable during the recent global market disruptions in part because the BoJ has
at its disposal a broad variety of tools to provide liquidity. In addition, in the conduct of monetary policy,
the second perspective allows the Bank to assess signs of any asset price imbalances. This practice
reflects Japan’s experience with its own stock price and real estate bubbles of the 1980s, which
developed in a low-inflation environment. In this regard, the BoJ’s monetary policy framework already
includes some of the recommendations that were floated in the recent policy debate on how central banks
should respond to emerging financial bubbles.¹

The yen remains undervalued relative to longer-term fundamentals.

•

Exchange rate. Continued wide interest rate differentials and a fading home bias have
led to large capital outflows over the last few years that have depressed the value of
the yen (Figure 5).6 The paring back of yen-financed risk positions in the aftermath of
the subprime crisis caused some of these outflows to abate. Nevertheless, the yen
remains below its 2002 level in real effective terms, and by staff projections, at current
levels would lead over the longer term to a current account surplus above that
consistent with economic fundamentals.7

•

Market views. Market forecasts of exchange rates five years ahead suggest only a
small appreciation of the yen in real effective terms. The expected change in the real
effective exchange rate implied by forward interest rates is now 3¾ percent, compared
with 11 percent last year. On a bilateral basis, the yen is expected to be around
100 against the U.S. dollar by 2013, although there is a wide range of uncertainty
surrounding this assessment.

•

Intervention policy. The authorities have not intervened in the foreign exchange
market since March 2004. Nonetheless, foreign reserves have increased to about
$1 trillion on strong valuation gains and interest earnings. This has raised political
pressure for setting up a Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) to manage a portion of
Japan’s reserves. The authorities oppose this idea given that the reserve build-up was
financed by issue of short-term yen borrowing which implies that reserves do not
constitute net sovereign wealth.

Policy Issues and Staff Views
14.
Given the uncertainties surrounding the outlook, the BoJ’s “wait and see”
approach is appropriate. The Policy Board is correctly keeping monetary policy on hold
until concerns over the outlook ease. Moreover, inflation expectations appear to be contained.
The BoJ has in the past expressed a strong desire to normalize interest rates amid concerns
that too much monetary accommodation for a protracted period of time could distort
expectations and lead to excessive risk taking (the second perspective). However, there are no
indications of such excessive risk taking so far, nor are there signs of a bubble in financial or
real estate markets. From a global perspective, given the declines in investors’ risk appetite
that have followed the subprime crisis, the risks that continued low interest rates in Japan fuel
further carry trades, weaken the yen, and complicate monetary management elsewhere, have
diminished.

The role of capital flows in the yen-U.S. dollar dynamics was analyzed in IMF Country report No. 07/281.

According to the IMF’s Consultative Group on Exchange Rates (CGER), the yen is estimated to be
undervalued relative to its longer-term value, although the range of undervaluation has narrowed somewhat since
the last Article IV consultation.

Nonetheless, monetary policy action might be required under the alternative
scenarios. In the case of a sharper than expected growth slowdown, the BoJ could ease,
although with the policy rate already low at 50 basis points, its firepower would be limited.
Alternatively, under the global inflation scenario, the BoJ might need to consider normalizing
interest rates at a faster pace than warranted by domestic factors alone, especially if rising
interest differentials were to lead to a weaker yen.

Recent steps to enhance the communication strategy are welcome. Given that
firms have finally begun to pass through cost increases to consumers, guiding inflation
expectations has become more challenging. The greater discussion of the risks to the outlook
and of the views of the Policy Board Members on growth and CPI inflation in the BoJ's April
Outlook should be useful in enhancing public understanding of the future conduct of
monetary policy. In addition, in the staff’s view the increased emphasis on the 1 percent
median of the "understanding of price stability" could help anchor inflation expectations.
17.
The BoJ’s liquidity management has kept money markets stable. While liquidity
pressures have been less pronounced than in other countries, the BoJ's more frequent and
larger liquidity provisions have helped ensure market stability. That said, there may be scope
to strengthen monitoring of the overall financial system by expanding information sharing
between the BoJ and the Financial Services Agency (FSA) on activities of systemically
important financial institutions outside the banking system, particularly regarding the liquidity
positions of securities firms and the off-balance sheet exposures of nonbanks.
18.

The exchange rate should continue to be market determined.

•

The exchange rate. The yen is expected to appreciate in real effective terms over the
longer term and the current account surplus to narrow. This adjustment would be
facilitated by far-reaching structural reforms that promote a broad-based increase in
productivity and the return to capital. Such reforms, which would reinvigorate
domestic demand and capital inflows, should support a strengthening of the yen over
time and a slower accumulation of net foreign assets as capital flows related to
Japanese investors’ international diversification of assets wane. Moreover, as the
population ages, households’ savings will fall and private investment will rise as firms
substitute capital for labor, contributing to a narrowing of Japan’s current account
surplus.

•

Intervention. In the event of excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange
rates, a case could be made for intervention. In general, such intervention is more
likely to be effective if coordinated with other major countries.

The Authorities’ Responses and Policy Intentions
19.

BoJ officials provided more background about current policy issues.

21
•

Near-term monetary policy stance. BoJ officials agreed that inflation expectations
were contained and considered it unlikely that inflation would rise beyond the
understanding of price stability. Even so, they would watch closely for a possible
steepening of the Phillips curve in light of the changes that seemed to be occurring in
firms’ price-setting behavior. The authorities concurred about the absence of growing
imbalances under the second perspective, but noted that because such risks were longterm, the gradual normalization of interest rates should resume once downside risks to
activity receded.

•

Risks from the global economy. While the BoJ is likely to be flexible in the event of a
severe downturn, the required monetary policy action in the case of the global
inflation scenario was less certain. Higher global inflation that led to monetary
tightening elsewhere would widen interest rate differentials and could weaken the yen.
However, that alone would not justify a monetary response in Japan unless it also
caused a change in the domestic outlook.

•

Communication. The BoJ continues to strive for better communication policies. BoJ
officials considered the risk balance chart in the April outlook report to be a useful
tool for improving monetary policy transparency and communicating the Board
members’ views on the outlook for prices and output.

20.
BoJ officials regarded their monetary framework to be well suited to handle
disruptions in money markets. Although subprime exposure was limited, Japan had not
been insulated, which illustrated how integrated global financial markets had become. In
responding to market pressures, the BoJ had fallen back on the flexible tools that it had tested
during the banking crisis in the 1990s and period of quantitative easing. The BoJ was able to
share some of this experience with other central banks wrestling with the subprime fallout.
With regard to possible gaps in financial sector monitoring, BoJ officials explained that
informal sharing of information about non-bank financial institutions with the FSA was
already occurring. Formally expanding such information sharing could create a false
expectation that the BoJ would be a lender of last resort for these institutions.
21.
The authorities again voiced skepticism about current account-based estimates of
“equilibrium” exchange rates and reaffirmed their commitment to a market determined
exchange rate. The authorities maintain their view that a methodology such as the CGER
does not fully account for capital flows, a serious omission in the case of Japan given the
structural outflows underway. Moreover, they continue to believe that this type of
methodology overplays the role of the exchange rate in current account adjustment, again a
weakness for Japan where income flows from foreign asset holdings have become the main
component of the current account surplus. Disagreements about equilibrium exchange rates
aside, the authorities could see no case for intervention in the foreign exchange market as long
as conditions remained orderly, consistent with the recent G7 communiqué.

22
C. Policies to Safeguard Financial Stability
Background
22.
Challenges for the financial sector include reducing banks’ exposure to equity
and strengthening regional banks.
•

Major banks. In FY2007, major banks’ net profits are estimated to have declined by
nearly a third due to subprime-related losses and higher loan-loss reserves. Core
earnings fell by 4 percent amid compressed margins and declines in fee income.
Falling share prices reduced by about 60 percent the unrealized equity gains on
stockholdings (representing two-thirds of Tier 1 capital). Major banks also have
significant exposures to structured products excluding subprime (estimated at around
$177 billion) where write-downs so far have been limited. Rising defaults and credit
spreads could lead to additional losses, including on hedges through CDS contracts
and monoline insurers.

•

Overseas lending. With domestic interest rates expected to remain low, Japanese
banks have increasingly turned abroad. Overseas lending grew by 23 percent (y/y) in
2007 with the subprime crisis apparently creating opportunities as European and U.S.
banks pull back.

•

Regional banks and SMEs. After showing steady improvement over the past few
years, NPL ratios for regional banks have stopped declining, and at 4 percent are more
than twice as high as for major banks. Regional banks are more exposed to the
difficulties in the SME sector where bankruptcy rates are rising (Figure 6).

•

Japan Post. As scheduled, Japan Post was transformed into a joint-stock company
wholly owned by the government in October 2007. Japan Post’s potential entry into
retail banking has prompted some regional banks to form partnerships or merge.

Policy Issues and Staff Views
23.
Financial sector policies are appropriately focused on guarding against spillovers
from the global market turmoil. In addition to providing exceptional liquidity, the
authorities have taken a number of useful steps that have helped support market confidence
including disclosing banks' subprime holdings. Looking ahead, the following policy
priorities—consistent with those recommended by the FSF—would further strengthen the
financial system.
•

Enhanced transparency. Greater disclosure of structured holdings, including on the
underlying assets and hedging coverage, and of off-balance sheet vehicles would
strengthen market confidence and discipline. Consideration could also be given to
extending enhanced disclosure to nonbanks, such as insurers, with the understanding
that the accounting and regulatory treatments may differ from banks.

•

Adequacy of capital cushions. Japanese major banks should be encouraged to continue
efforts to improve the quality of their "core" capital as their Tier 1 capital ratios
remain below those of other leading international banks. For regional banks, in light of
their expansion into securities and overseas investments, consideration could be given
to gradually raising the minimum capital requirement for domestic banks above the
current 4 percent level. Most regional banks’ capital ratios are already above
8 percent, and a higher minimum would give supervisors more flexibility in dealing
with weaker banks at an earlier stage.

•

Strengthening the market for securitization. Although securitization has grown
steadily since the late 1990s, the market remains small with the volume of secondary
trading limited. Greater disclosure by the originator on the underlying assets, such as
for SME-ABSs, and the creation of reliable market benchmarks (e.g., for commercial
real estate) would improve price discovery and liquidity in the secondary market.

24.
The financial system faces risks from a slowing economy. Widening credit spreads
for low-rated companies and rising corporate bankruptcies, led by SMEs, suggest the need for
vigilance against credit risk.
•

Strengthening risk management. Supervisors need to ensure that banks, particularly
regional banks, have appropriately classified and provisioned against problem loans.
At the same time, having in place robust credit risk assessment systems to manage
overseas portfolios will help Japanese banks to take advantage of new lending
opportunities while guarding against possible risks.

•

Reducing market risk. Banks should be encouraged to continue efforts to gradually
reduce their stockholdings as part of an overall strategy for improving their risk-return
profile. This reduction will be promoted by the increase in capital charge for existing
equity holdings to the same level as that for new equity purchases which is set for
2014 under Basel II.

25.
Over the longer term, further reforms are needed to improve financial
intermediation and promote stability. These would include: encouraging further bank
consolidation to boost core profitability; managing the privatization of Japan Post to ensure a
level playing field for all institutions;8 and promoting a broader sharing of credit information
to strengthen risk pricing and financial stability. Further development of the capital markets
would also help enhance Tokyo's appeal as an international financial center.

8

An Annex to the Selected Issues paper describes developments regarding J-Post privatization.

25
The Authorities’ Responses and Policy Intentions
26.
The authorities are closely monitoring developments in the financial sector, and
are taking steps to enhance its resilience in accordance with the FSF recommendations.
•

Greater disclosure for structured products holdings. As recommended by the FSF, the
authorities have encouraged banks under Pillar III of the Basel framework and non-life
insurers to disclose more detailed information on structured holdings in their end-year
reports. The Accounting Standards Board of Japan is also reviewing enhanced
disclosure for off-balance sheet items, including for special-purpose companies.

•

Adequacy of capital cushions. The authorities pointed out that raising the minimum
capital requirement for domestic banks above 4 percent was not called for under the
Basel framework which established a minimum capital requirement of 8 percent only
for internationally active banks. Such a step might also harm already weak local
economies that depend heavily on relationship-based lending by regional banks. Staff
responded that the Basel framework does not preclude regulators from tightening
minimum capital requirements for domestic banks if conditions warrant. Moreover,
tighter standards could strengthen the overall system by encouraging a small number
of weak regional banks to rebuild their capital or seek a merger. Consolidation would
put regional banks in a better position to compete with Japan Post.

•

Strengthening the market for securitization. The authorities emphasized that steps
have been taken under Basel II to require rating agencies to disclose more detailed
information on the underlying assets of securitized products. In 2004, a working group
consisting of the BoJ and market participants also laid out a number of measures for
strengthening the infrastructure and disclosure. That said, the authorities recognized
that more should be done to enhance evaluation and trading of securitized products.

•

Improving risk management. The FSA observed that in recent years, regional banks
have strengthened their financial conditions, as shown by their improved capital and
NPL ratios. While the FSA remains vigilant to regional banks in light of the slowing
economy, the authorities did not view the weakening conditions of SMEs as a
significant risk to the financial system as a whole, particularly when compared to the
risk from a U.S. slowdown or renewed global market turmoil.

•

Reducing market risk. The authorities noted that banks have reduced their holdings of
equity, but the pace has slowed. The authorities are taking steps to encourage banks to
reduce their equity risk and pointed out that the schedule for raising the capital charge
for existing equity holdings is set three years earlier than for European and U.S. banks.

26
V. STRUCTURAL POLICIES TO BOOST GROWTH
The structural reform agenda is largely unchanged from last year and was not a major focus
of this year’s consultation. There is a need to increase the pace of reforms.
Background
27.
Some progress has been made in implementing structural reforms commitments
under the Multilateral Consultation, but momentum has slowed.
•

Liberalizing product markets. The government signed economic partnership
agreements (EPAs) with Brunei, Chile, Indonesia, and Thailand in 2007 and with
ASEAN in 2008. While some progress has been made in expanding successful
reforms outside “special zones,” there has been little progress in opening up protected
sectors, such as in nursing and education.

•

Promoting inward FDI. Last year, the government allowed capital gains to be deferred
in “triangular” mergers where a foreign company acquires a Japanese target via a local
unit. While this facilitated Japan’s first major triangular merger, foreigners still view
investing in Japan as difficult as firms have taken steps to limit minority shareholder
rights (e.g., through “poison pills” and cross-shareholdings).

•

Labor reforms. Privately-run job placement centers have been set up on a trial basis,
but the bill to extend pension coverage to temporary workers was not passed by the
Diet. The government plans to revise the labor standard law to raise the minimum
overtime pay and reduce overtime hours worked.

•

Financial market development. The authorities are implementing measures to
strengthen the competitiveness of Japan's financial and capital markets. The Diet
amended the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act in June inter alia to enable new
exchange markets exclusively for professional investors and to expand exchangetraded funds to include commodity futures.

Policy Issues and Staff Views
28.
The priority should be to reinvigorate the structural reforms outlined in previous
Article IV Consultations.
•

Labor and product markets. Reforms to enhance labor market flexibility and
participation, and further deregulation in product markets, would raise productivity
and wages, particularly in the service sector, encourage firms to hire more regular
workers, and hence contribute to the narrowing of dualities (Box III).

27
Box III. Why Are Japanese Wages So Sluggish?1
Real wages have stagnated in Japan over the past
decade. Wage growth failed to pick up during
the 2002-07 expansion, widening the accumulated
gap between hourly wages and productivity to
about 20 percentage points. While labor income
shares have declined in many advanced economies as
a result of globalization and technological change
(April 2007 WEO), workers’ compensation in Japan
has grown at an unusually slow pace compared with
most other rich countries.

A number of explanations have been put forward
for sluggish wage growth in Japan:

Source: Cabinet Office; and IMF staff calculation.
Note: Compensation and productivity are expressed in per-hour terms.

• Impact of foreign competition. Real productivity growth in Japanese manufacturing has been rapid.
However, international competition has pushed down relative prices of manufactured goods, reducing
nominal gains. In fact, manufacturing wages have grown at an even lower pace than nominal productivity,
as internationally-competing industries have become more sensitive to cross-country wage differentials.

• Deregulation measures. Legal changes in the late 1990s expanded the list of industries which can hire nonregular workers. The large difference in employment protection and benefits between regular and nonregular workers has stimulated firms with low profitability (often in services) to offset rising input costs by
offering mostly lower-paid temporary positions.2 As a result, incentives for profitable companies to agree to
attractive compensation packages have been reduced.

• Population aging. The retirement of the highly-paid baby-boomers and their re-employment at lower parttime wage rates has possibly also tended to depress aggregate wage growth.

Notes: Wage-productivity gap is defined as the percent difference between real wage and

productivity growth per full-time employee during 2002-06. Productivity differential equals the
difference between manufacturing and nonfinancial services productivity growth over the same
technological change, and wages in nonfinancial
period.
services have been constrained by low productivity
growth, aggregate wages have trailed productivity gains. Indeed, cross-country evidence suggests that
countries with sizeable differentials between manufacturing and services productivity growth have experienced
the largest declines in labor income share in recent years. Reforms aimed at increasing productivity in services
and reducing gaps in employment protection and benefits between regular and non-regular workers could
therefore help put wages in Japan on an upward trajectory.
_____________________________________________

A Selected Issues paper examines the factors behind Japan’s sluggish wage growth in more detail.

Non-regular workers (part-time workers, dispatched workers, etc.) typically earn about 40 percent less than regular
workers, are much easier to dismiss, and have limited social insurance. The share of non-regular workers has grown
from 20 percent of the labor force in 1990 to 34 percent in 2007.

28
¾ Labor market. Labor utilization would improve with more flexible work
arrangements (including those aimed at raising female labor participation); easier
rules for dismissal; greater portability of pensions; and more balanced employment
conditions for regular and temporary workers. A more liberal and bolder approach
to immigration policy would address special labor needs and shortages. In this
regard, a government panel is considering recommendations for accepting more
skilled professionals into Japan.
¾ Product markets. Further deregulation and market opening in agriculture, retail,
and services, would give a boost to productivity and make Japan a more attractive
destination for foreign investment. In services, priorities for deregulation include
transportation, network industries, the electricity sector, and gas utilities.9
Applying successful reforms in the Special Zones on a nationwide basis and
opening further "government-driven" markets to the private sector could build
support for deeper reforms.

the labor market.

•

Enhancing Tokyo’s appeal as an international financial center. The authorities
pointed out that developing the financial system would provide households with
alternative instruments for savings, help raise income, and reduce dualities. In this
regard, it would be important to strengthen corporate governance.

APPENDIX I. JAPAN: PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS (DSA)
1.
The staff has updated its
assessment of Japan’s medium-term
public debt sustainability. The analysis
incorporates the authorities’ medium-term
expenditure plans and tax policy changes
announced in the FY2008 budget, but is
based on the staff’s macroeconomic
assumptions. The baseline scenario focuses
on the net debt of the general government
including social security.
2.
The analysis suggests that the
authorities are likely to fall short of
achieving their goal of a primary balance
by FY2011. The primary deficit (excluding
social security) would be at 0.3 percent of
GDP in FY2011. This will not be enough to
stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio over the
longer term.

2/ Authorities' growth scenario.

The DSA underscores the sensitivity of the debt dynamics to underlying
macroeconomic assumptions and the benefits from a faster pace of consolidation. For
example, with a 100 basis points increase in interest rates or a 1 percentage point decline in
GDP growth from 2011 onwards, the debt-to-GDP ratio would reach around 130 percent by
2025, while under the staff’s proposed scenario, the debt ratio would remain at about the same
level as in FY2009 (at around 100 percent).

Article IV Consultation:

The 2007 Article IV consultation discussions were held during May 14–24, 2007; the
Executive Board discussed the Staff Report (IMF Country Report No. 07/280) and concluded
the consultation on July 27, 2007. The concluding statement, staff report, staff supplement,
selected issues paper, and PIN were all published.

Statement by the Staff Representatives on Japan
July 21, 2008
1.
This statement contains information that has become available since the Staff Report
was circulated to the Executive Board on June 30, 2008. This information does not alter the
staff’s broad assessment of policy issues and recommendations contained in the staff report.
That said, the recent renewed volatility in global markets slants the balance of risks to the
growth outlook more firmly to the downside, while the continued strength of commodity
prices underscores upside risks to inflation.
2.

Financial markets have weakened in Japan in July, in line with global trends.
•

CDS spreads for Japanese financials have risen across the board, especially for
nonbank lenders (such as consumer finance companies) that rely on wholesale
funding, and Japanese equities have suffered losses. However, money markets
have remained stable, with the 3-month LIBOR-OIS spread steady at about
40 basis points. Despite the recent uptick in inflation, JGB yields have declined
slightly, while the yen has fluctuated in line with volatility in global risk appetite.

•

In light of the recent market developments, concerns have been raised about the
exposure of Japanese institutions to U.S. agency bonds, particularly those issued
by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. According to the U.S. Treasury data, total
holdings of U.S. agency bonds by Japan’s private and public entities (including
official reserves) amounted to $231 billion as of end-2007. Of this amount, the
three largest banks, major insurers and securities firms reportedly account for
about $80 billion; for individual banks, exposures range from 5 to about
40 percent of Tier 1 capital.

3.
As expected, recent indicators point to a slowdown of economic activity after a
surprisingly strong GDP outturn in the first quarter. Sentiment indices (including from the
Bank of Japan’s June Tankan survey) continue to deteriorate as the negative impact of higher
commodity prices and somewhat weaker external demand are felt. On balance, high
frequency data seem broadly consistent with our projection of a soft landing to 1½ percent
growth in calendar years 2008 and 2009. Headline inflation reached a 10-year high of
1.3 percent (y-o-y) in May on higher food and fuel prices, but underlying inflation (excluding
food and energy) remains close to zero. Owing to continued commodity price pressures, our
inflation forecast for 2008 (1.1 percent) is subject to upside risk and, in light of the incoming
data, may be raised in the context of the ongoing World Economic Outlook exercise. The
possibility of permanently higher commodity prices than assumed in the staff report would
also imply some downside revision to our forecast of Japan’s current account surplus and
some narrowing of the estimated degree of yen’s undervaluation relative to longer-term
fundamentals.
4.
At its monthly monetary policy meeting on July 14-15, the Bank of Japan (BoJ)
decided to keep its target rate unchanged at ½ percent, citing a slowdown in the domestic

2
economy, rising energy and material costs, and downside risks from the global economy. The
median growth forecast of Policy Board members was downgraded from 1.5 percent to
1.2 percent in FY2008 (fiscal year begins April)—slightly below staff’s projection of
1.4 percent—and from 1.7 percent to 1.5 percent in FY2009. Board members now forecast
markedly higher inflation, with the median FY2008 forecast increasing from 1.1 percent to
1.8 percent and possible upside risks from changing inflation expectations of households and
price-setting behavior of firms. In order to further enhance its communication strategy, the
BoJ has decided to start releasing the assessment of economic and price developments from
“two perspectives” after each monetary policy meeting and also plans to publish the Risk
Balance Charts for the outlook more frequently.
5.
The government released its FY2008 Basic Policies on June 27. The policy program
reaffirms the government’s commitment to achieving primary balance (excluding social
security) by FY2011 and to comprehensive tax reform including raising the consumption tax
and abolishing road tax earmarking. As expected, the document calls for measures to further
open the Japanese economy (by increasing trade with EPA partners, liberalizing aviation, and
revising FDI rules); improve labor market participation; and enhance productivity in services
and SMEs. The program also aims to reduce regional disparities and cut CO2 emissions.
Meanwhile, an expert panel at the Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy has released its
recommendations for medium-term structural reforms. The main priorities set out by the
panel include greater labor market flexibility and competition in the corporate sector; reform
of the social security system; and better integration of Japanese regions into global markets.
The staff considers that structural reforms in the areas highlighted by Basic Policies and the
expert report would be very desirable. The challenge, however, is to translate these broad
reform intentions into specific actions.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 29, 2008

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with Japan
On July 21, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Japan. 1
Background
The Japanese economy has shown resilience to the U.S. slowdown and global financial turmoil.
GDP grew by 2.1 percent in 2007 (above potential), down from 2.4 percent the previous year,
mostly owing to lower private consumption growth and a regulatory-induced slump in
construction activity. In the first quarter of 2008, activity continued to be led by robust export
demand from non-U.S. destinations, while the recovery in residential investment provided
additional support to growth. CPI inflation was 1.3 percent (y-o-y) in May, mainly driven by rising
food and energy prices. Core inflation, which by staff’s definition excludes both fuel and food
prices, fell by 0.1 percent (y-o-y). Wage pressures are limited and unit labor costs continue to
fall on a year-on-year basis.
Japan’s external position remains strong. The current account surplus rose to 4.8 percent of
GDP in 2007 on the back of strong external demand and a further surge in investment income.
However, in Q1, the trade balance narrowed substantially owing to the large deterioration in the
terms of trade, while income inflows continued apace. The yen appreciated against major
currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar through March, supported by an unwinding of carry
trades and the large current account surplus. Outflows by Japanese investors continued to

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

provide an offset. The yen remains market determined and the authorities have not intervened
since March 2004.
The fallout from the global market turmoil on the financial system has been limited. Money
markets remain relatively stable owing to the banking system’s lower exposure to subprime and
other securitized products and the increased amounts and frequency of the Bank of Japan’s
(BoJ) liquidity operations. Subprime-related losses for banks have risen to $8 billion, but still
remain well within banks’ operating profits and capital. Financial conditions for nonbank lenders
relying on wholesale financing and low-rated corporates have tightened somewhat, while
bankruptcies have edged up led by small and medium-size enterprises.
Fiscal consolidation has paused this year and the authorities’ medium-term plans fail to build on
recent progress. The FY2008 budget targets a broadly unchanged primary deficit (excluding
social security) with a slight increase in total expenditures due to higher social security costs
and lower tax buoyancy, while the net public debt ratio is estimated to rise to 94 percent of
GDP, up from about 85 percent of GDP three years ago. The authorities’ revised fiscal plans
continue to target a primary balance by FY2011. Under staff’s lower growth projections, the
authorities’ plans would be insufficient to prevent net public debt from continuing to trend up.
Monetary policy is accommodative. The BoJ has kept the policy rate unchanged at 50 basis
points since February 2007, implying a drop in real interest rates given the uptick in inflation.
The near-term economic outlook is for a soft-landing, although there remain risks from the
global economy. GDP growth is expected to moderate to 1½ percent (slightly below potential) in
2008-09 in line with lower global demand and the less favorable terms of trade. Headline CPI
inflation is expected to rise, but inflation risks appear contained. Risks to the growth outlook
have become more balanced in recent months, but considerable uncertainty remains.
Over the medium term, growth is expected to converge to potential (about 1.7 percent) and the
current account surplus to narrow. This scenario assumes continued efficiency gains in the
corporate and financial sectors and a shrinking labor force.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities on the resilience thus far of the Japanese
economy to the U.S. slowdown and global market turmoil. Timely liquidity provisions by the
Bank of Japan have helped to buffer the effects of global financial pressures, while generally
buoyant exports to emerging markets, strong household and corporate balance sheets, and
limited financial sector subprime exposure have helped to underpin the economy’s strength. At
the same time, given the terms of trade deterioration and weakening domestic confidence,
Directors considered the Japanese economy to be headed for a modest slowdown. While the
headline inflation rate has risen in recent months, core inflation—stripped of food and fuel
prices—remains around zero, and is expected to stay contained.

3
While welcoming the prospect of a soft landing, Directors emphasized that the outlook remains
subject to considerable uncertainty, with the recent renewed volatility in global markets tilting
the risks to the growth projection more notably to the downside, and high commodity prices
underscoring the upside risk to inflation. In these circumstances, Directors agreed with the
authorities that monetary policy should remain accommodative—and backed by continued
efforts to strengthen the financial sector—while fiscal policy should remain focused on mediumterm challenges. Structural reforms should also be reinvigorated to boost productivity and
Japan’s medium-term growth prospects.
Directors recognized the recent progress made with fiscal consolidation, and welcomed the
authorities’ continued commitment to achieving primary balance, excluding social security, by
FY2011. As the downturn in the current fiscal year is expected to be modest, Directors
encouraged the authorities to meet the budget deficit target even if revenues fall short. Some
Directors noted that automatic stabilizers could be allowed to work in the event that growth
slowed sharply.
Most Directors considered that, beginning in FY2009, larger fiscal adjustments than currently
envisaged by the authorities will be required to stabilize the high public debt and make room for
the fiscal costs of population aging. The limited scope for further expenditure cuts suggests that
the future fiscal consolidation will need to involve steps on the revenue side. In this context,
Directors saw the merits of a comprehensive tax reform, and most Directors supported
consideration of an increase in the consumption tax. They regarded the government’s intention
to increase its contribution to the basic pension during FY2009 as a good opportunity to raise
the consumption tax rate, as this could be viewed as a step supportive of the intention to ensure
the funding of social security. At the same time, Directors acknowledged that accelerating the
pace of adjustment at this juncture will be challenging, and some stressed the importance of
fulfilling the government’s present fiscal commitments in the first instance. Directors welcomed
the authorities’ plans to end earmarking of gasoline tax revenue for road-related spending from
next year.
On monetary policy, given the low underlying inflation and the uncertain economic outlook,
Directors saw little risk in delaying monetary tightening. They supported the Bank of Japan’s
approach of adopting a “wait and see” attitude and standing ready to respond flexibly should
downside risks to economic activity materialize, or should inflation expectations worsen.
Directors welcomed the Bank of Japan’s enhanced communication strategy, which should
strengthen public understanding of the authorities’ policy intentions and help guide inflation
expectations. Directors looked forward to a gradual normalization of interest rates once
downside risks to growth recede.
Directors supported the authorities’ policy of a market determined exchange rate. Noting that
the authorities have not intervened in the foreign exchange market since March 2004, Directors
supported the authorities’ policy of limiting intervention to counter excessive fluctuations and
disorderly movements of the exchange rate. Directors noted the staff assessment that, although
the focus of macroeconomic and structural policies is appropriate, the yen remains undervalued
relative to its longer-term value in real effective terms. They also recognized that capital

outflows related to Japanese investors’ international diversification of assets might continue to
contribute to the yen’s weakness in the near future. Directors generally noted that, over the
longer term, the yen could be expected to appreciate on the back of policy reforms that are
expected to yield widespread productivity gains. A number of Directors underscored the
importance of incorporating structural capital account factors into current account-based
analyses of the equilibrium exchange rate.
Directors welcomed the steps taken by the Financial Services Agency to enhance transparency
and support market confidence, in line with the recommendations of the Financial Stability
Forum. They commended the Bank of Japan for its flexible liquidity management that has
helped to keep money markets stable. Directors welcomed the proactive steps taken by the
authorities to monitor and disclose the exposure of the subprime losses, and underlined that
greater disclosure and transparency can only serve to strengthen market confidence and
discipline. Looking ahead, Directors encouraged the authorities to remain vigilant to risks from
further global market disruptions. Steps to bolster capital cushions and improve risk
management will further strengthen the financial system and enhance financial intermediation.
Directors also welcomed the progress toward privatizing the Japan Post Bank, and supported
the authorities’ emphasis on achieving a level playing field.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to press ahead with their structural reforms
outlined in the Multilateral Consultation, and incorporated in the authorities’ recently released
FY2008 Basic Policies program. Further reforms to increase labor market flexibility, enhance
product market competition, and encourage inward foreign direct investment will lift mediumterm growth prospects and contribute to the orderly resolution of global imbalances.
