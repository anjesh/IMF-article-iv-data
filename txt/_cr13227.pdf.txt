STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. In March, the government of Belize completed the exchange of its
―super-bond‖ for new U.S. dollar denominated bonds. While the debt exchange is
expected to bring substantial cash-flow relief, the public sector debt-to-GDP ratio will
remain high. The government may face large financing needs over the medium term,
largely associated with potential compensation to the former shareholders of
nationalized companies.
Focus of the consultation. The discussions centered on how to take advantage of the
breathing room provided by the debt exchange. Staff urged the adoption of a fully
articulated macroeconomic framework to address vulnerabilities and emerging risks.
Such framework should include robust fiscal consolidation, active debt management,
steady financial sector reform, and measures to buttress external sector resilience. These
efforts need to be complemented with structural reforms to enhance competitiveness
and growth prospects.
 Near-term policies. Policy should give priority to raising the primary surplus to at
least 2 percent of GDP in the current fiscal year, while sustaining the momentum of
financial sector reforms.
 Medium-term strategy. Staff urged the authorities to strengthen fiscal
consolidation by gradually raising the primary balance to 3 percent of GDP and attain a
sustainable debt path. Priority should be given to the implementation of a strategic tax
reform with a view to attaining growth, promoting fairness, and ensuring sustainable
revenues. On growth and employment, staff recommended enhancing structural
competitiveness by tackling major impediments to doing business.

OVERVIEW
1.
The general elections of March 2012 resulted in a sharply reduced parliamentary
majority for Prime Minister Dean Barrow’s United Democratic Party (UDP). The UDP won
17 seats in the 31-seat parliament, a thin 3-seat majority and 8 seats less than in the previous
parliament. Mr. Barrow, who called the elections almost a year earlier than anticipated, made the
restructuring of Belize’s 2029 bonds (―super-bond‖, with a face value of US$546 million or
30 percent of GDP) a key electoral issue.
2.
On March 20 of this year, the government of Belize completed the exchange of its
“super-bond” for new U.S. dollar denominated bonds (“2038 bonds”) (Annex I). While the
external public debt restructuring is expected to bring needed cash-flow relief in the near term
(about US$130 million over the next 5 years), public sector debt will decline only marginally upfront
as the ―net‖ face value haircut is 3 percent. Staff’s calculations suggest that the NPV loss to
bondholders ranges from 29 to 31 percent (measured with 9 and 10 percent discount rates). In the
end, the government achieved 86 percent of creditor support, which exceeded the 75 percent
threshold for the exercise of the collective action clause.1
3.
The debt restructuring took place against the backdrop of prolonged legal disputes
over the nationalization of two public utility companies and the enforceability of several
arbitration awards (Annex II). Belize faces significant additional claims in relation to the 2009
nationalization of Belize Telemedia Limited (BTL) and the 2011 nationalization of Belize Electricity
Limited (BEL). No agreement has been reached yet on the amount of compensation; and the legal
dispute may take a few years in court. In addition to these claims, several arbitral awards related to
land acquisition, overpayment of taxes, and non-observance of tax agreement have been delivered
against the government and are pending enforcement.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Macroeconomic developments in 2012 were underpinned by robust output growth
but clouded by uncertainties surrounding the debt restructuring and growth prospects of
major trading partners.


Economic activity accelerated thanks to a rebound in agriculture and tourism, despite a
sharp decline in oil production (Figure 1). In 2012, output growth is estimated at 5.3 percent,
led by a recovery from the 2011 effects of weather-related damages in commodity exports.
Inflation averaged 1.3 percent in 2012, as commodity price pressures abated.

1

S&P upgraded Belize to non-default rating (B-) on March 20 given expected completion of the debt exchange,
followed by an upgrade by Moody’s from Ca to Caa2 on April 15, reflecting an improvement in the government’s
liquidity position.



The external current account deficit widened to about 1.7 percent of GDP up from
1.1 percent of GDP in 2011 due to a steep drop in oil exports and higher imports of fuel and
electricity. Notwithstanding this deterioration, international reserve coverage is estimated at
3.4 months of imports (up from 3 months in 2011), thanks in part to strong FDI inflows in the
sugar sector (Figure 2).



The fiscal primary surplus for FY2012/13 is expected to deteriorate to 1.3 percent of GDP
compared to 2.3 percent of GDP in 2011 (Figure 3). This deterioration largely reflects the
continued decline in oil-related revenues and an increase in the wage bill, despite robust growth
in General Sales Tax (GST) revenue. In addition, the government was able to partly offset the loss
of its BTL dividends with a one-off early repayment of an old loan by the company.2



After two years of decline, credit to the private sector recovered modestly in 2012
(Figure 4). Loan write-offs and high non-performing loans (NPLs) continue to hold back private
sector credit growth, estimated at 1.1 percent, and are eroding banks’ net earnings. Broad
money grew by 5 percent, mostly driven by expansion in net foreign assets. Persistently high
liquidity in the system—albeit unevenly distributed across banks (one bank holds about
75 percent of the excess liquidity over the liquid asset requirement)—combined with limited
investment opportunities have driven T-bill rates below 2 percent. Despite an unchanged
monetary policy stance,3 there were across-the-board cuts in lending rates on new loans,
notably for residential construction and personal loans, with rates dropping to single digits early
this year.



The banking system continues to come under stress. New provisioning and loan classification
standards implemented by the central bank at end-2011 have resulted in declining NPLs in the
banking system and improving

below the poverty line measured 41 percent in 2009, up from 34 percent at the beginning of the
last decade, reflecting increasing unemployment, widening income disparity, lagging
educational attainment, and rising crime.4 Unemployment remains high at 16 percent in
September 2012, affecting particularly the young (30 percent) and women (22.4 percent). Belize
may miss half of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015, including reduction of extreme
poverty, women’s share of paid employment, and universal primary education.5

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
5.
Staff prepared a baseline scenario to anchor discussions. The scenario assumes a
continuation of current policies and real GDP growth of 2½ percent over the medium term. After a
peak in oil production in 2009, oil reserves are estimated to last through the end of this decade,
barring new discoveries. Commodity exports, tourism, and construction are expected to balance the
decline in crude oil production. Despite persistent high liquidity in the banking system, inflation is
expected to remain low in line with those of the main trading partners, reflecting subdued
commodity price pressures. The current account is expected to deteriorate owing to the decline in
crude oil exports, which could put pressure on international reserves.

Despite the significant cash flow relief from the debt exchange, the public debt-toGDP ratio will remain high over the medium term and could become a drag on growth. Under
the baseline scenario, the debt associated with the nationalization of the two public utility
companies is recognized at mid-valuation at end-2015 and compensation to previous shareholders

to start in 2016.6 Accordingly, financing needs could rise to above 6½ percent of GDP, starting in
2016, and to more than 7 percent of GDP after 2018, as compensation to former shareholders falls
due as contemplated in the nationalization legislations.
7.

Risks to this scenario are tilted to the downside:

Short term


Spending pressure. The prospective savings associated with the debt exchange have intensified
spending pressure. In addition to the automatic salary adjustment already in place (average
annual increase of 3 percent in nominal terms), the government is under pressure to introduce a
more generous wage and salary increase, which appears likely to occur and could further tighten
the already limited fiscal space. Staff advised the government to resist this pressure, and offer a
more realistic remuneration package.



Banking sector vulnerabilities. NPLs remain high, although concentrated in a few domestic and
international banks. Further loan write-offs in the near term could impair the capital base of
some weak banks, which would require recapitalization. This could entail significant fiscal cost
should the government intervene. However, this risk has been somewhat mitigated by the more
collaborative approach between the central bank and weak banks and the recent recapitalization
of one small bank. This notwithstanding, continued intensive supervision is warranted to contain
remaining vulnerabilities.

Medium term


Refinancing risk. The amortization of the 2038 bonds starts in 2019 and poses a refinancing
challenge to the government, as the associated debt service is projected to increase by
1 percent of GDP. This reinforces the case for building a strong fiscal buffer well ahead of the
rise in financing needs.



Additional liabilities. While there remains uncertainty about the size, modality, and timing of the
possible compensation payments to the former owners of the two nationalized utilities
companies, additional liabilities will materialize with a very high likelihood. Should the
compensation payment turn out to be closer to the upper valuation of the claimants, gross
financing needs could soar and debt could climb up to 100 percent of GDP, threatening fiscal
sustainability. Further, nonresidents, who account for a significant portion of the compensation
claims, would likely not roll over their debt holdings, aggravating government-refinancing risk
going forward. To mitigate refinancing risks, the authorities need to intensify fiscal efforts and
promote the development of domestic capital market.

6

This assumption is based on the advice of the authorities regarding the expected timeframe for the legal process,
but it is not prejudging the outcome of the legal claims.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

BELIZE



Pressure on foreign exchange reserves. The former shareholders of nationalized companies may
try to move out of Belizean dollar-denominated assets once compensation actually takes place.
While this may entail capital losses for them, given the thin market for domestic debt securities,
there is a high possibility that foreign exchange reserves may come under pressure. With
international reserves already below risk-weighted benchmarks and projected further
deterioration, more robust fiscal consolidation would help mitigate pressures on the exchange
rate peg and buttress external sustainability.



External vulnerabilities. Belize’s share of exports to the U.S. (about 46 percent of total exports of
goods and services) and to the EU (31 percent) is high. Staff also notes that growth in Belize is
highly sensitive to tourist arrivals from major source markets, the U.S. in particular. Thus, a
weaker-than-expected U.S. recovery and lingering slow growth in Europe could have potential
direct and indirect effects via trade and tourism channels that could undermine growth potential
and restrain public finances. Therefore, as this risk has medium likelihood to occur, the
authorities should intensify diversification efforts to strengthen Belize’s capacity to weather
external shocks.

8.
However, there are also moderate upside risks, mainly associated with intensified oil
exploration. In April, a company drilling in the northwest part of the country announced an oil
discovery, and is currently conducting further tests to determine whether the find has commercial
potential. To build fiscal buffer, staff recommends saving any revenue windfall.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Staff encouraged the authorities to use the breathing room provided by the debt exchange to adopt a
fully articulated macroeconomic framework addressing existing vulnerabilities and emerging risks. In
staff’s views, this framework should include robust fiscal consolidation (while protecting flagship social
programs), active debt management, steady financial sector reform, and measures to buttress external
sector resilience. These efforts need to be complemented with structural reforms to boost
competiveness and growth.

A. Policy Framework to Contain Fiscal Risks and Enhance Debt
Management
9.
The 2013/14 budget seeks a primary surplus target of only 1 percent of GDP, reversing
the previously announced commitment to adhere to a 2 percent of GDP target. Total revenues
and grants are projected to increase by 3.2 percent, primarily on account of an expected
improvement in tax administration. Wages and salaries and goods and services will be the main
drivers of the 4 percent increase in primary current spending. The overall deficit is projected to
deteriorate slightly to 1 percent of GDP from a deficit of ½ percent of GDP in FY2012/13, due to
higher current spending including interest payments, as the country returns to a full-year debt
service payment on the new 2038 bond, despite the lower coupon resulting from the debt
exchange.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELIZE

10.
In staff’s view, the adoption of a lower primary surplus weakens the momentum
toward fiscal consolidation and debt sustainability (Annex III). Over the medium term, while the
authorities expect to offset the projected loss of oil revenues by higher tax revenue from ongoing
tax administration reforms and expenditure restraint, the baseline scenario illustrates that policy
management could become increasingly challenging. In light of the growing financing obligations,
which are likely to double in 2016 relative to 2013, staff stressed the importance of a strong fiscal
adjustment effort to avoid jeopardizing macroeconomic stability. In particular, with limited access to
international capital markets, the authorities could face a challenge to tap an undeveloped domestic
capital market to cover such rising financing needs.
11.
The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment that additional fiscal effort may be
necessary to address rising financing needs and reduce public debt. They view the new primary
balance target as a base case to be raised back to 2 percent of GDP in 2014, subject to consultations
with stakeholders on revenue measures. At the same time, as they assess the impact of the debt
associated with the nationalization of the two utility companies based on their own
valuation—substantively lower than the mid-point valuation used in staff’s baseline scenario—the
authorities feel that the staff’s debt sustainability analysis may be on the pessimistic side. In
addition, to ameliorate financing pressures in the domestic debt market, the authorities plan to use
the proceeds from previous and future sales of shares, along with annual dividends, to finance the
eventual payment of compensation to the shareholders of nationalized companies. Furthermore, the
government left the door open to issue a maximum of US$75 million of 2038 bonds to partially
cover the payment of compensation.
12.
Staff encouraged the authorities to adopt a stronger fiscal policy package to ensure
debt sustainability. In line with previous staff assessments, the primary surplus should be raised
further to place debt level and financing needs on a

financing needs are likely to soar. To that end, staff
recommended the authorities to make progress in the following areas:

In the short term, the focus of fiscal policy should be on raising the primary surplus to at least
2 percent of GDP in the current fiscal year. This could be achieved by spending
restraint—especially moderating wage pressures—and reversing the erosion of the tax revenue
base by bringing back many currently zero-rated GST items of domestic consumption into the

tax base.7 In addition, the government should consider implementing the recommendations of
the Auditor General’s 2012 report, to enhance accountability and transparency in the use of
public funds.8
Over the medium term, priority should be given to the implementation of a strategic tax
reform to boost growth, promote fairness, and ensure sustainable revenues, in line with the IMF
recommendations (Box 1). These reform efforts need to be accompanied by stepping up the
modernization of tax administration, as advised by CARTAC. There is also scope for a significant
strengthening of fiscal discipline, capitalizing on reforming the Public Financial Management
(PFM) system by enhancing budget analysis and forecasts, removing automatic wage and salary
increases, and ensuring that fixed-term project contributions do not become recurrent spending.
In addition, in light of the uncertainties surrounding the timing and size of additional liabilities,
staff recommends saving any revenue windfall (i.e., associated with new oil discoveries).

While the authorities agreed with a number of staff’s policy recommendations, they
are yet to set a fiscal policy anchor. The prolonged negotiation over the debt exchange and the
uncertainty surrounding the additional liabilities provided little room to decide an appropriate policy
anchor. Going forward, as the additional liabilities are firmed, the authorities plan to calibrate a set
of fiscal anchors, including the public debt-to-GDP target, together with the Medium-Term Debt
Strategy (MTDS), which is underway. Further, they re-iterated that, the need to combat crime, tackle
rising poverty, and address infrastructure deficiencies could limit the scope for more aggressive

fiscal consolidation in the medium term. In this context, they are supportive of a gradual
implementation of the IMF tax policy recommendations, particularly because the recentlyintroduced measures, such as a higher threshold for personal relief from income tax and the
elimination of taxes on commissions and royalties paid by nonresidents, have won much political
support and thus reversing them may be considered as tax hikes9—something that Prime Minister
Barrow has promised not to do.
15.
The authorities are under intense pressure to grant more favorable wage adjustments
and other concessions to public officers and teachers. Staff cautioned against the government’s
proposal to public officers and teachers to allocate half of the revenues resulting from
improvements in tax administration (subject to an annual ceiling) to salary increases, as the plan may
be unsustainable under the current circumstances. In addition, the authorities recently announced
plans to set up a mortgage bank, to be financed with PetroCaribe funds,10 with the primary objective
of making residential mortgages affordable to public officers and teachers. Staff also cautioned
against earmarking funds toward particular spending categories, and the creation of a specialized
mortgage bank. However, should the authorities decide to go ahead with the plan, staff strongly
advised on the need for an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework to safeguard public
finances, to which the authorities agreed.

Staff welcomed the government’s plans to revamp the debt management framework,
in line with the recommendations of an IMF technical assistance (TA) mission (Box 2). As a first
step, the authorities have appointed a high-level debt management task force to produce a reform
plan to implement the TA mission’s recommendations. But, given the anticipated increase in gross
financing needs, an active debt management framework and a robust MTDS need to be developed.
Going forward, priorities should be to pass a comprehensive public debt management legislation,
which would include the debt management objectives and the government’s obligation to develop
an MTDS.

B. Financial Sector—Maintaining Reform Momentum and Addressing
Vulnerabilities
17.
Staff is of the view that continued intensive supervision and additional efforts are
required to address the vulnerabilities in the financial sector. The revised Domestic Banking and
Financial Institutions Act (BFIA), which became effective in January 2013, significantly expanded the
powers of the central bank in several areas. Among other things, the act established the legal basis
for consolidated supervision and strengthened the rules to prevent high loan concentration and
limit related party transactions. In staff’s view, operationalization and enforcement of some
provisions of the revised act are warranted, and may require further TA mostly from CARTAC. The

central bank has maintained weak financial institutions under intense supervision, and has adopted
a collaborative approach with the banking sector in addressing vulnerabilities.11 Further, staff
emphasized the need to establish a legal department at the central bank, including for effective
resolution practices. Staff also encouraged the authorities to take advantage of the available TA
from the Fund to update the crisis management plan for implementing the bank restructuring and
resolution framework established under the BFIA. In the meantime, there is a need for clarity about
the scope and modality of government’s intervention should a contingency materialize.
18.
The authorities highlighted that recent regulatory decisions are geared toward
addressing vulnerabilities, but agreed that continued close monitoring is warranted. They
noted that the provisioning requirements being enforced continue to yield positive results, and
most banks are on track to complying with them. In this regard, the central bank pointed out that,
excluding one bank, the NPLs of the domestic banking system would be around 6–7 percent.
Meanwhile, given the recent pickup in the mortgage market, the provisioning requirement for fully
secured loans was relaxed in January this year for domestic banks only, to help the recovery in
private sector credit.12 Although no progress has been made in setting up a legal department, the
central bank recognized the need to address this issue, possibly in the near term.
19.
The mission welcomed the authorities’ continued commitment to press ahead with the
remaining FSAP recommendations (Box 3). There has been continued progress in several fronts
on financial sector reforms. However, progress in improving insurance supervision and amending
the insurance act has lagged, while plans to improve the supervision of offshore nonbank financial
institutions have not progressed. Additional efforts in credit union regulation, Development Finance
Corporation supervision, and central bank autonomy, are required to further strengthen the financial
sector.
20.
The authorities noted the progress made on financial sector reforms. They are on
course to revising the credit union and insurance legislations, and plan to establish a credit bureau
by end-2013. The newly created Financial Stability Unit (FSU) is laying the foundation to produce its
draft financial stability report, which could cover the entire financial sector. In the next steps, the
central bank plans to revise the international banking act and the central bank act next year, while
the modernization of the national payment system will receive priority attention over the next three
years. They also intend to facilitate information sharing among the relevant agencies. The authorities
expressed interest to obtain technical assistance to further enhance regulatory and supervisory
capacity. With respect to credit unions, the central bank plans to begin publishing their individual
financial soundness indicators for the large credit unions.

21.
Staff encouraged the authorities to further strengthen the AML/CFT regime. The
central bank’s ongoing effort to introduce a risk-based approach to AML/CFT supervision, with
Fund’s technical assistance, is welcomed. However, weaknesses within the International Financial
Services Center (IFSC), particularly the lack of regulation and supervision of the international
business companies’ (IBCs) sector, raise significant concerns on their potential misuse for money
laundering and terrorist financing both in Belize and abroad. While the authorities shared these
concerns, given the private sector’s involvement in the management of the IBC registry, additional
actions in this field would require a wholesale change in the legal structure, which the authorities are
urged to undertake to further strengthen the overall AML/CFT regime of Belize.

C. External Stability—Exchange Rate and Competitiveness
22.
The fixed exchange rate regime continues to serve Belize well. The exchange rate, which
is pegged to the U.S. dollar, has provided an important anchor for macroeconomic policies.

This notwithstanding, Belize’s external
position needs to be strengthened in light of the
projected widening current account deficit and
limited options to obtain external financing. An
improvement in the highly negative net external
position (140 percent of GDP at end-2011), is desirable
to bolster the country’s resilience against potential
adverse external shocks. Fiscal consolidation would help
contain import growth and achieve the reduction in the
current account deficit needed to bolster external
stability. Further, maintaining the real effective
exchange rate close to its equilibrium level would help
boost export competitiveness and revive economic
growth. In addition, risk-weighted measures suggest
that international reserves stand below benchmarks
(Annex IV). The projected widening of the current
account deficit from 1.7 percent of GDP in 2012 to
5.4 percent in 2017, high net external liabilities, rising
financing needs, limited external financing, and low
international reserves pose risks to Belize’s external
stability. This could be even more challenging in the
context of a weaker-than-expected U.S. recovery and a
protracted period of slow growth in Europe, which
could take a toll on external trade volumes and
dampen the recovery in tourism.

While the exchange rate appears to be in line with fundamentals (Annex IV), a few
indicators suggest that competitiveness has deteriorated along regional trends.13 In 2011, the
current account deficit narrowed as the Belizean dollar depreciated significantly in real effective
terms. However, despite the recent surge in FDI flows, Belize’s market share of non-oil goods
exports and tourism have steadily declined over the last 10 years.
25.
Staff recommended using the space created by the recent debt exchange to advance
not only macroeconomic policies but also structural reforms. According to the 2013 World Bank

26.
The authorities emphasized the need to promote external stability, and pointed out
that Belize remains an attractive place for investment. However, they raised concerns that
additional fiscal consolidation could counter initiatives in key areas necessary to boost
competitiveness and mobilize international reserves. Further, they defended their continued
commitments to enhance transparency, contract enforcement, and land registration. In particular,
they noted that the currently operational ASYCUDA system has improved customs administration
and trade facilitation.
27.
Further efforts are underway to boost the tourism sector. The authorities are
implementing a National Sustainable Tourism Master Plan 2030, which aims to raise standards of
Belize’s tourism products, and develop new services sectors. The success of these initiatives hinges
on continued investments in capacity building and easing structural bottlenecks. Based on

preliminary cruise-ship bookings received so far this year, the tourism board is anticipating a surge
of about 40 percent in tourist arrivals in 2014.15

D. Data Provision
28.
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. In general, the quality, coverage, and
timeliness of statistics permit an adequate monitoring of economic developments.16 In the context
of the recent debt exchange, the authorities have committed to make their best effort to initiate
subscription to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard.

STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
Despite the acceleration in economic activity in 2012, output growth is expected to
moderate to about 2.5 percent in the medium term. Economic growth was boosted by a rebound
in agriculture and tourism, despite a sharp decline in oil production. Looking ahead, the main risks
to growth and financial stability arise from fiscal challenges and a potential weaker-than-expected
global recovery that could take a toll on external trade volumes and tourism.
30.
Progress in consolidating the public sector’s financial position needs to continue. The
adoption of a lower fiscal primary surplus of 1 percent of GDP, compared to the previous target of
2 percent, weakens the momentum toward fiscal consolidation and debt sustainability. The nearterm focus should be on maintaining a primary surplus target of at least 2 percent of GDP. This
could be achieved by spending restraint—especially moderating wage pressures—and reversing the
erosion of the tax revenue base by bringing back many currently zero-rated GST items of domestic
consumption into the tax base.
31.
Over the medium term, the fiscal strategy should aim at lowering debt ratios to a
more sustainable level. Gradually raising the primary surplus to 3 percent of GDP over the medium
term would help reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio to less than 60 percent of GDP a decade from now.
To achieve this, priority should be given to implementing a strategic tax reform with a view to
boosting growth, promoting fairness, and ensuring sustainable revenues. Furthermore, lower debt
ratios would reduce gross financing requirements, especially when potential pending liabilities for
nationalized companies and the amortization of the U.S. 2038 bond begin to fall due. An even
stronger fiscal adjustment may be warranted if additional liabilities turn out to be closer to the
upper-valuation claimed by the former owners, as government financing needs are likely to soar.
32.
Rapid progress in fiscal reforms would help ensure the viability of public finances.
Further progress on the reform of the PFM system will help establish fiscal disciplines by enhancing

The impact on the current account of this increase in cruise-ship arrivals is expected to be modest, as the greatest
contribution to the sector comes from the stay-over tourism.

budget analysis and forecasting, removing automatic wage adjustments, and ensuring that fixedterm project contributions do not become permanent spending obligations. In this context, staff
cautioned against earmarking funds toward particular spending categories, and the creation of a
specialized mortgage bank. In addition, the government needs to press ahead with actions to
enhance accountability and transparency in the use of public funds.
33.
A solid debt management program needs to be developed. Policy actions should include
strengthening the institutional framework, building capacity to operationalize a medium-term debt
management strategy, and developing the domestic debt market. To that end, the plan should
consider the scope and capacity to develop market-based financing instruments.
34.
Despite a significant increase in provisions, the banking sector remains vulnerable with
high, albeit gradually decreasing, NPL levels. Continued vigilance is warranted in monitoring the
strength of individual institutions and ensuring that their capital base remains adequate. The staff
welcomes the recent steps to press ahead with necessary reforms, in line with the 2011 Financial
Sector Assessment Program recommendations. Staff encouraged the authorities to take advantage
of the available TA from the Fund to update the crisis management plan, and bank restructuring and
resolution framework. In the meantime, there is a need for clarity about the scope and modality of
government’s intervention should a contingency materialize. In addition, staff encourages the
authorities to further strengthen the AML/CFT regime.
35.
Although the exchange rate appears broadly in line with fundamentals, some
compression of the projected current account deficits is needed to buttress external stability.
External stability will require a strategy to contain widening current account deficits, including by
fiscal consolidation and a comprehensive structural reform agenda to enhance productive capacity
and increase the country’s competitiveness and market share of non-energy exports. To that end,
the authorities need to improve the business environment by tackling major impediments to doing
business in order to better attract investment, expand exports, and bolster external sustainability.
36.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Box 1. Tax Reform for Growth, Fairness, and Sustainable Revenues
An FAD General Tax Policy mission visited Belize January 24–February 6, 2013. The mission undertook a diagnostic
review of the tax system, with special attention to business and income tax, GST and taxation of excisable goods. The
report identifies short-term measures and medium-term reform strategy to mobilize additional revenues from the
various taxes. Main findings and recommendations are summarized as follows:
Taxes on businesses. The current business tax system is Belize in narrow-based. The challenge is to convert the
system to taxation based on income for businesses, while expanding on the revenue base. To that end, the
business tax needs to be transformed into a minimum tax, at a uniform rate in the range of 1.5 percent for most
businesses to be credited against the excess of income tax over the minimum tax in future years. Staff also
recommends modifying legislation to broaden the base for the business income tax to include capital gains and
income from capital, taxed at 15 percent. Reforms should also target the elimination of many exemptions and
loopholes and constraining discretionary power to extend additional exemptions. A business tax should be
imposed on foreign residents in Belize in line with taxes on residents’ income.
Personal income tax. The current system entails serious horizontal inequities. To address them, staff recommends
aggregating more types of household incomes, including that of professionals and self-employed. More
progressivity in the tax system on labor and business income may be introduced by adjusting the level of personal
relief and reforming the rate structure. In addition, staff recommends phasing out deductions to be replaced by
tax credits.
General sales tax. Concerns are rising about continued erosion of the revenue base for GST. Broad zero-rating
creates distortions and is not well targeted to protect low income groups and small businesses. To that end, many
goods that are currently exempted, whether imported or consumed domestically, and including both output and
business inputs, should be taxed at the standard rate. In addition, staff recommends a thorough review of
requirements to make the system more conducive to new businesses, while protecting revenues.
Excises and customs duties. Reforms should seek to harmonize the tax system between domestic production and
imports. To mobilize more revenues, without increasing the cost of consumption and production, staff
recommends increases in excises on selected items, including cigarettes, beer, spirits, and soft drinks; introducing
an excise on wine; converting specific excises into guaranteed ad valorem excises; and introducing excises on
mobile airtime and gaming.
Special regimes. Staff recommends phasing out direct and indirect concessions for Commercial Free Zones (CFZ),
Export Processing Zones (EPZ), as well as those under the Fiscal Incentives Act (FIA). These concessions should be
replaced by best practices such as avoiding renewal of income tax holidays and dividends holidays for CFZ, EPZ,
and FIA. Tax incentives, instead, should target the business activity itself, through income tax credits, or
accelerated tax provisions in the income tax code.
Tourism. The report recommends bringing hotels into the GST net at the standard rate, instead of the current
Hotel Tax that should be eliminated. Other tourism services should also remain in the GST net at the standard rate.
To compensate for loss of revenues, other own-revenue source should be imposed on the tourism sector to
finance the Belize Tourism Board (BTB).
Extractive industries. To improve the revenue take, staff recommends two adjustments with respect to future
discoveries and existing operations. The bidding process should be improved in the oil sector to govern existing
and future exploration rights. Moreover, there is a scope to increase royalties in the minerals sector so that the
government captures a greater share from the windfall of existing and future production.
Property taxes. Staff recommends pressing ahead with the reform agenda to base taxes on market value countrywide, with assessments performed by a single, professional agency, for both municipal and rural properties.
Progress in these reforms will help ensure regular reassessments of property value and improve the reliability of
the tax system.

Box 2. Medium-Term Debt Strategy
An IMF technical assistance (TA) mission visited Belize City and Belmopan from November 1–16, 2012, to provide a
diagnosis on the institutional framework and to assist the authorities to build analytical capacity in developing a debt
management strategy and the domestic public debt market.
Currently, there is no comprehensive institutional framework for debt management. The legal basis for debt
management is fragmented among different sets of legislation, and the ministry of finance and economic
development lacks a debt management unit that ought to be responsible for strategy and analysis, and there is no
documented Medium-Term Debt Management Strategy (MTDS). While data are managed relatively well at the
central bank, the cost and risks of the total public debt portfolio is not systematically assessed.
As the public debt portfolio is highly exposed to various market and financial risks (Figure 5), the
authorities need to consider implementing more active debt management. Although the peg to the U.S.
dollar has historically worked well, a potential foreign exchange shock could significantly increase the debt levels
and debt servicing obligations, given the high share of foreign currency debt in the central government debt
portfolio (84 percent). Further, three-month treasury bills account for 52 percent of the domestic debt and require
frequent interest rate resetting, thus exposing the debt portfolio to significant rollover and interest rate risks.
Going forward, the commencement of amortization of the U.S. 2038 bonds in 2019 and the potential payouts to
the former owners of the nationalized companies will push up the future gross financing needs and exacerbate the
government refinancing risk.
An active debt management program should incorporate a policy-oriented strategy in order to achieve the
appropriate composition of the debt portfolio. Staff recommendations include: (i) formation of a high-level
National Debt Management Committee, with the robust middle-office function responsible for analyzing the cost
and risk of the public debt portfolio; and (ii) submission of a comprehensive Public Debt Management Act to the
parliament which would include the debt management objectives, the government’s authority to borrow, and its
obligation to develop a MTDS. Further, development of domestic public debt market is urgently needed, given
that pending potential additional liabilities to nationalized companies need to be paid in domestic currency.
Specifically, staff recommended that the authorities introduce a market-based auction system for treasury bonds
and establish a comprehensive capital market act that governs securities transactions and businesses.
The authorities are planning to revamp the debt management framework in line with the
recommendations of the TA mission. They are committed to reform the debt management framework and fully
implement the recommendations by end-2013. Staff welcomes the progress and stands ready to provide further
assistance upon request. Although the authorities do not envisage re-access to international capital markets in the
foreseeable future, robust debt management institutions and an investor relations program will help achieve
future market access as a long-term goal.

Box 3. Financial Sector Reform Agenda
The 2011 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) identified weaknesses and challenges in several areas of the
financial sector and recommended actions for a reform agenda. The authorities are using the FSAP recommendations
as bases for their financial sector reforms. While they have made significant progress in implementing the
recommendations in some areas, further implementation efforts are needed.
Banking sector. New provisioning and loan classification requirements adopted at end-2011 raised prudential
measures to international standards. The revised Domestic Banking and Financial Institutions Act (BFIA) became
effective January 2013, and among other things, established the legal basis for consolidated supervision and
strengthened the rules to prevent high loan concentration and limit related party transactions. Based on the BFIA,
the authorities plan to issue directives regarding: (i) corporate governance; (ii) internal controls; (iii) operational
risks; and (iv) valuation of collateral in the banking sector. In a next step, they plan to update the International
Banking Act next year.
Credit unions. The authorities have started to work on amending the Credit Union Act with further progress
expected in 2013. The resolution of troubled/insolvent credit unions has progressed and is expected to be
finalized by mid-2013.
Crisis management and bank resolution framework. The revised BFIA strengthens the bank resolution
framework, inter alia through allowing for the appointment of a statutory administrator. With assistance from the
Fund in early 2012, the authorities have established procedures for provision of Emergency Liquidity Assistance by
the central bank and solvency support by the government and prepared a Domestic Crisis Management Plan.
Financial infrastructure. Plans to establish a credit bureau are progressing well. A draft legislation to establish the
legal framework is expected to be passed by mid-year, while a bureau should be in place by end-2013, or early
2014. Plans are also underway to develop the capital market and modernize the national payments system, but the
implementation of the latter will span the next three to four years.
Financial stability. The central bank has established a Financial Stability Unit (FSU), which is comprised of
representatives of the Research and Financial Sector Supervision departments. The bank is currently developing
the framework to draft its first financial stability report, which will include macro prudential surveillance, enhancing
of its stress testing methodologies as well as developing a contagion matrix to track interconnectedness among
the sectors.
Insurance. A draft amendment to the Insurance Act to strengthen the autonomy of the Supervisor of Insurance,
improve corporate governance in the insurance sector and require insurance companies to publish financial
information, is expected to be passed this year. The authorities are preparing a draft legislation to regulate private
pensions. However, plans to improve the supervision of international insurance companies have not progressed.
AML/CFT. The central bank has developed and is in the process of implementing a risk-based offsite surveillance
of banks, which would later be adapted to other sectors.
Central bank autonomy. Future amendments to the Central Bank Act could consider the autonomy of the central
bank.

Annex I. Super-Bond 2.0
On March 20, the government of Belize closed the exchange of its ―super-bond‖ for new U.S. dollar
denominated bonds that will mature in 2038. The exchange offer was launched on February 15,
following intense negotiations between the authorities and the Creditor Committee representing
investors holding more than 62 percent of outstanding bonds. Significantly more bonds were tendered
than the 75 percent required for restructuring the entire stock of old bonds. This exchange took place
outside the framework of a Fund program, and was characterized by close collaboration with the
Creditor Committee.
1.
The government of Belize announced the successful completion of the exchange offer.
On February 15, Belize launched the offer to exchange its sole external bond (―super-bond‖), which
had final maturity in 2029 for new U.S. dollar denominated bonds (―2038 bonds‖). Following the
launch of the offer, the chair of the Creditor Committee said that "The Committee appreciates the
[Belize government's] willingness to negotiate in good faith and to adhere to what was in the end a
fair and transparent process." The Creditor Committee represented investors accounting for more
than 62 percent of the original super-bond’s face value. In the end, the government achieved
86 percent of creditor support, which exceeded the 75 percent threshold for the exercise of the
collective action clause. The exchange was closed on March 20, 2013 with the issuance of the new
bonds and retirement of the old bonds.
2.
For creditors, the exchange offer represented a substantial improvement from the
government’s original proposal. In August 2012, the government published a first set of
―indicative scenarios‖ that entailed a face value 100

authorities and the committee. Finally, in late
December 2012, Prime Minister Barrow announced that a framework agreement had been reached
with the Creditor Committee. This led to a recovery in the price of the ―super-bond‖ to

its pre-August level. Staff calculations suggest that the NPV losses to bond holders will be around
29–31 percent (assumed exit yield of 9 to 10 percent).1 2
3.

The restructuring financial terms are the following:



Principal haircut. Approximately US$530 million of new 2038 bonds will be issued. The original
―super-bond‖ (approximately US$546 million) will be subject to a 10 percent face value haircut,
but overdue interest will be added to the face value of the new bond (approximately 7 percent
of the original principal).3 As a result, the ―net‖ face value haircut is about 3 percent.



Coupon rate reduction. The new bond will pay a step-up coupon of 5 percent through 2017
(for 4.5 years) and 6.767 percent thereafter, compared with the original 8.5 percent through
maturity.



Maturity extension. The final maturity will be February 2038 (instead of 2029 under the original
―super-bond‖ terms), with the first amortization falling due in August 2019.

4.
The new bonds include several new legal terms, which were agreed between the
government and the committee. In particular, the new legal terms include bondholders’
committee engagement provisions, a contingency account for trustee indemnification, principal
reinstatement in the event of a future default, and a most favored creditor provision. In addition, the
government has committed to improved data transparency, including its ―best effort‖ to begin to
subscribe to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).
5.
The deal will provide
substantial cash-flow relief. The
principal haircut and reduced coupon
would result in debt service relief of
US$47 million (including the missed
interest payments) in 2013 (2.9
percent of GDP) and about US$20
million (1.1 percent of GDP) per year
from 2014 to 2017. Over the
remaining 16-year life of the superbond, total cash flow relief will be
US$384 million.

The NPV haircut is calculated as 1- (present value of new debt/present value of old debt), using the same discount
rate (exit yield).
2

Additionally, when using a discount rate equal to Belize's projected medium-term nominal GDP growth rate of
4.5 percent, the NPV reduction in public debt is only about 20 percent.
3

Following the announcement of the debt exchange, the government missed one-half coupon payment in August
2012 and one payment in February 2013 for a total value of about US$35 million.

6.
Despite the significant cash-flow relief, debt sustainability concerns remain. Preliminary
calculations suggest that the debt exchange would reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio by around 8
percent in 2018. Although the debt path would be ceteris paribus more favorable after the
restructuring, the debt burden would likely remain high, on account of compensation to the former
owners of the two nationalized utilities companies and continuing slow fiscal adjustment. Adherence
by the authorities to an active fiscal adjustment will help contain growing financing needs and
achieve a faster downward debt trajectory.

Annex II. Additional and Contingent Liabilities
The compensation resulting from the nationalization of BTL and BEL constitutes the largest share of
the additional liabilities. While Fund staff has not assessed or verified the amounts presented by the
government nor by the former owners (―claimants‖), staff has adopted the mid-point valuation of the
nationalized companies for debt sustainability analysis, and the authorities’ projections for the
schedule of compensation. Staff does not take a view on the merits of the court cases, the timing or the
amount of compensation.
Nationalized Companies’ Valuations Cover a Wide Range
1.
The different valuations for BTL and BEL commissioned by the government (from
NERA Economic Consulting) and by the claimants result in a wide range of additional debt
values. The valuation of the companies ranges from about 6 percent of GDP (government valuation)
to about 30 percent of GDP (claimants’ valuation). Further, the compensation would entail the
accrued interests since the nationalization, in accordance with the national legislation (See below
―Rules for Compensation‖).
2.
The government made compensation offers to the former shareholders of BTL and BEL
in October 2011 and January 2012, respectively, based on NERA Economic Consulting
valuations. A formal response to the government’s offers is still awaited. The authorities are of the
view that between the offer dates and the settlement dates the accrued interests should be applied
only to the amount that exceeds the government’s offered value, on the grounds that the claimants
cannot benefit from tactically delaying the process.
3.
If no agreement on compensation is reached, the amount of compensation will likely
be settled by either the court system or international arbitration. The timing of such settlement
is also unclear. The Court of Appeal is expected to make a decision by end-June 2013 on the
constitutionality of the nationalizations, then likely followed by the proceeding in the Caribbean
Court of Justice (CCJ) that may take another 12 months. To settle the compensation amount, the
former owners or the government may turn to the Supreme Court. Alternatively they may resort to
international arbitration in accordance with the U.K.-Belize Bilateral Investments Promotion and
Protection Treaty (Figure).
Rules for Compensation
4.
According to Belize Telecommunications (Amendment) Act, the compensation to the
former owners of BTL may be paid either in cash or by issuing the claimants Treasury Notes,
for an amount that equals the ruled compensation to be redeemable within a period not exceeding
five years from the date of issue. Compensation shall bear interest at the rate paid by commercial
banks in Belize on fixed deposits on the date of acquisition.

36

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5.
In the case of BEL, the Belize Electricity (Amendment) Act does not specify explicitly
the period of compensation. Although, similar to the rule for BTL, the compensation may be paid
either in cash or by the issue of Treasury Notes, the authorities hold a view that the court’s ruling will
be guided by the precedent of BTL. In which case, the compensation period will not exceed five
years and the compensation shall bear accrued interests.

1 Either party automatically can and is likely to appeal the decision of the Court of Appeal to the CCJ.
2 This ruling could have various outcomes, including: (i) return 100 percent of the shares previously owned by claimants; (ii) return a
portion of the shares previously owned by claimants up to the limit set in the Belize's Constitution; (iii) return 100 percent of the shares
previously owned by the claimants of only one of the two companies; or (iv) reacquisition by the government cannot be ruled out as it
happened in 2011.
3 Valuations for BTL and BEL go from about 6 percent of GDP (government valuation) to about 30 percent of GDP (claimants’ valuation).

6.
To alleviate the financing pressure in the domestic debt market, the government may
opt for other sources for the payment of compensations. Currently, the government has
accumulated BZ$75 million from the sale of the BTL shares in 2011. In addition, the government may
further sell the BTL and BEL shares up to the constitutional limit of 51 percent majority. Furthermore,
the U.S. 2038 bond indenture recognizes the government’s option to issue maximum US$75 million
of the new bond if the former owners agree to receive it. Finally, the authorities estimate that BTL
and BEL could pay BZ$7 million and 0.4 millions of annual dividends, respectively. In aggregate,
mobilization of these financing sources could add up to approximately 11 percent of GDP.
7.
The authorities are of the view that the entire compensation amount (including
accrued interests) will be settled by the legal system in 2015, at the earliest. Hence, staff

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELIZE

undertakes the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) based on the assumption that the debt is
recognized at end 2015, followed by the compensation in equal installments over 2016–2020. The
DSA also uses mid-point valuation for the outstanding BTL/BEL nationalization compensation
(approximately 17 percent of 2015 GDP including accrued interests) and adopts the authorities’
assumptions regarding accrued interests, use of other financing sources, and amortization schedule
of domestic debt.
Other additional liabilities and contingent liabilities
8.
Also included in the additional liabilities is the estimated amount of about 3 percent of
GDP as the result of land acquisitions for public purposes since 1980—for which the
authorities claim to have been making interest payments. A small arbitration award of about
0.3 percent of GDP due to the termination of an airport concession is also included in the additional
liabilities.
9.
Finally, the government faces several arbitration awards that are pending to be
enforced. These arbitration awards, estimated at about 4 percent of GDP, are primarily associated
with claims for damages related to overpayment of taxes, nonobservance by the government of an
accommodation agreement, and guarantees issued by the government. These claims are currently
being contested in courts.1

Annex III. Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
Although the recent debt exchange provided a near-term liquidity relief, its impact on debt stock
reduction was modest. Coupled with the recognition of the additional liabilities and weak fiscal efforts,
the debt level will remain high. The high public debt burden will highlight the need for further fiscal
consolidation, a more robust debt management, and the development of the domestic debt market.

A.

Macroeconomic Framework

1.
The debt exchange provided cash flow relief, but the impact on the current debt stock
was modest. Fiscal balance would be slightly more favorable than the pre-exchange projection,
thanks to reduced coupon rate from 8.5 percent to 5–6.8 percent. However, because the past
overdue interest payments were added (―clawed-back‖) to the face value of the new 2038 bond, the
net haircut was only 3 percent of the face value of original super-bond.
2.
Despite the 2012 rebound, economic growth is projected to remain subdued over the
medium term. Commodity exports, tourism, and construction, coupled with low inflation will
support real output growth around 2.5 percent over the medium term. However, growth is still
vulnerable to external shocks (including weather related) and could contribute to deterioration of
future debt trajectory. Enhancing the business environment will be critical to improving growth
prospects.
3.
The recognition of the additional liabilities would push up the level of debt stock by
17 percent of GDP in 2015. The amount of compensations to the former owners of the
nationalized companies is still unsettled. For illustration, the DSA assumes that the government
recognizes the additional liabilities at end 2015 with a mid-point valuation between the authorities’
assessment and the former owners’ claims, plus accrued interests. Staff also assumes that the
government fully utilizes its potential financial resources for reducing the debt burden, including:
(i) the proceeds from the sale of BTL shares (BZ$75 million); (ii) proceeds from potential sales of the
companies’ shares to up to the constitutional floor of 51 percent; and (iii) annual dividends of
BZ$7.4 million.
4.
The country will need to rely heavily on domestic financing in the medium term,
pushing up nominal debt service burden. While it is assumed that the authorities may opt to issue
new U.S. 2038 bonds of maximum US$75 million as part of the compensation, the bulk of projected
financing needs would be covered by domestic borrowing, as official disbursement is projected to
gradually decline and no external commercial borrowing is expected within the projection horizon.
Nominal interest of domestic borrowing could be high (assumed 5 percent) and even higher should
the supply of debt stock continue to rise. Further, increased domestic financing warrants policy
actions to develop the domestic public debt market; otherwise, illiquidity in the market with captive
investors could distort the market pricing and effective credit intermediation.

B.

Assessment

5.
Under the baseline scenario, public debt would experience a hike to 90 percent of GDP
in 2015, and remain high during the projection horizon. Despite the positive effects of the
steady economic growth, the debt reduction is projected to be slow, owing to weak fiscal efforts
under the baseline (1 percent of primary surplus in the medium term). Liquidity condition would
gradually deteriorate, as public sector gross financing needs could increase to 7.6 percent of GDP in
2019 mainly due to maturing principal of the additional liabilities and high interest rate charged on
domestic financing. Moreover, beyond the projection horizon, financing needs would increase even
more from 2019, when the amortization of the new bond starts.
6.
Further fiscal consolidation efforts are warranted to bring back the debt to the longrun level. The repeated debt exchange episodes may indicate that the country’s current debt level is
over the maximum sustainable debt level. Such a maximum sustainable debt level is derived in a
country-specific matter but can be given as a range of 63–78 percent of GDP.1 Going forward, in
order to have a sufficient fiscal space and mitigate adverse impacts that could stem from the debt
overhang, Belize is encouraged to go beyond the maximum sustainable level and try to achieve the
long-run debt level, which can be as low as 49–58 percent for emerging market economies.2
7.
Bound tests highlight that the public debt trajectory is vulnerable to various shocks.
Since more than 80 percent of total public debt was denominated in foreign currency in 2012, the
debt profile is particularly sensitive to an exchange rate shock—with a 30 percent real depreciation
in 2014, total debt would climb to nearly 120 percent of GDP in 2015, combined with the realization
of additional liabilities. The debt ratio is also highly sensitive to shocks in growth, interest rate, and
the primary balance. Further, contingent liabilities shocks (19 percent of GDP) would cause a
proportional increase in debt levels. The contingent liabilities shock include (i) an additional amount
in 2015 equivalent to the difference between the mid-point and the upper bound valuations of the
additional liabilities associated with nationalized companies;3 (ii) other ongoing disputes; and
(iii) potential recapitalization needs of a few banks, stemming from the generic/migration shocks in
the authorities’ bank stress test.

2

The maximum sustainable debt level is the level beyond which a debt distress event is likely or inevitable. The longrun debt level is the level to which the debt-to-GDP ratio converges over the long run, a long as the actual debt-toGDP ratio does not rise above the maximum sustainable level.
3

Of which (i) represents close to ¾ of the total contingent liabilities shock.

Annex IV. Reserve Adequacy, Exchange Rate, and
Current Account Assessment
Reserve Adequacy
1.
The reserve adequacy is assessed based on traditional measures and two recently
introduced risk-weighted metrics. Gross international reserves in Belize have more than tripled
since 2000, and stood at around US$286 million at end-2012. Over the first half of the last decade,
reserves were depleted pronouncedly on account of natural disasters and ensuing subdued tourist
arrivals. Upon discovery of oil in 2005 and recovery in tourism activity, reserves accelerated as of
2007, boosted by the 2009 SDR allocation, with estimated peak in 2012. Against the backdrop of
declining production and exports of oil, and limited scope to mobilize non-oil exports, reserves are
projected to decline by about 40 percent over the next five years to US$172 million at end-2017.

cover of broad money in 2016 to reach
57 percent and 69 percent, respectively, of the adequate level by 2017.
3.
New metrics point to a shortfall in reserves with the gap projected to widen over the
medium term. The first risk-weighted measure suggests that reserves stood at 86 percent in 2012,
below the lower bound of adequacy threshold of 100–150 percent, and are expected to decline to
46 percent by 2017. The second risk-weighted measure, adjusted for Small Island Developing States
(SIDS) metric signals a similar trend––with current 57 percent ratio below the lower benchmark and
projected decline to 30 percent by 2017. In light of expected widening of the current account deficit
and limited access to external financing, the low level of international reserves and projected

depletion over the medium term poses a risk to Belize’s external stability.
Exchange Rate and Current Account
4.
Under alternative approaches, the exchange rate on balance appears to be broadly in
line with fundamentals. External stability in Belize was assessed by applying the standard
approaches:

Macroeconomic balance (MB). The MB approach points to a need to align the projected
external current account deficit (-5.4 percent of GDP) with its estimated medium-term norm level of
-5.1 percent of GDP. Fiscal consolidation, coupled with maintaining the exchange rate at its
equilibrium level entailing some moderate real depreciation, would help curb import growth and
boost non-oil export competitiveness towards sustaining external stability and confidence in the
exchange rate peg.

External stability (ES). The widening current account deficit has been financed by record
inflows that have increased Belize’s negative net foreign assets (NFA) position to nearly
-140 percent of GDP at end-2011. To ensure external stability and adequate financing, staff
calculated the external current account deficit (-2.7 percent of GDP per year) that would reduce the
required NFA for financing to below -110 percent of GDP by 2023. A narrower deficit would be
consistent with a gradual real depreciation of up to 9.2 percent. Sensitivity analysis supports this
assessment, as the deviation from equilibrium will remain moderate under the alternative scenarios.

Equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER). The ERER approach finds that the exchange rate is
broadly in line with its fundamentals, as it suggests moderate (5.3 percent) undervaluation of the
Belize dollar at end-2012.

1/ Equilibrium external current account corresponds to a CA level that is consistent w ith a specific set of economic fundamentals.
The external sustainability approach assumes the medium/long-term real grow th rate of 2.5 percent and inflation of 2 percent.
2/ External current account in 2017 for MB approach and in 2013-23 for ES approach.
3/ This elasticity is computed using the standard long-run real exchange rate elasticities for imports (0.92) and exports (-0.71),
as w ell as the medium-term values of Belize’s exports and imports of goods and services (in percent of GDP).

5.
An assessment of external debt sustainability highlights vulnerabilities to Belize’s
external position (Annex III). While the external debt ratio is projected to gradually decline over
the medium term (to around 54 percent of GDP by 2018), the debt trajectory is vulnerable to shocks.
Bound tests suggest that external debt is mostly sensitive to nominal exchange rate devaluation and

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELIZE

current account shocks. In particular, under a 30 percent depreciation of domestic currency, external
debt would surge to 88 percent of GDP in 2014 and remain elevated at 79 percent of GDP in 2018.
Further vulnerability stems from a non-interest current account shock that would boost the external
debt to around 68 percent of GDP over the medium-term horizon. In light of limited options for
external financing, high gross financing needs—6.8 percent of GDP on average annually over the
next 5 years—pose additional risk.24 The projected widening of the current account deficit highlights
vulnerability in the medium term and beyond, as the reserves coverage would dwindle below
2 months of imports by 2017 and pose a challenge to maintaining the exchange rate peg.

24

Over the period 2013-2017 loan repayments of commercial banks and other private sector are assumed to exceed
new disbursements, reversing in 2018 and thus explaining improvement in non-debt creating capital flows.

BANK-FUND COLLABORATION UNDER THE JMAP
AND RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK2
A. Bank-Fund Collaboration Under the JMAP
1.
The World Bank’s program in Belize is guided by a new four-year Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) for FY2012–2015. Under the CPS, the focus is on assisting Belize to achieve
inclusive and sustainable natural resource-based growth and enhanced climate resilience. The CPS
builds on lessons learned from the implementation of the Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for
FY2009–2011.
2.
The overall size of the envelope during the new CPS period is around
US$20–28 million. Activities include a US$15 million municipal development loan, approved by the
World Bank Board on September 16, 2010, and a non-lending technical assistance on Belize’s
BOOST Conditional Cash Transfer and Human Development Program. Under the CPS, an investment
lending operation is planned to support the improvement and/or development of climate resilient
infrastructure.
3.
The IMF and World Bank teams agree that Belize’s main macroeconomic challenges
are to enhance the economy’s resilience to shocks and strengthen growth and social
prospects. In particular, the teams agree on the need to enhance banking system stability and debt
sustainability, and to strengthen the policy framework, while reinforcing the implementation
capacity of the Belizean authorities.
4.
The teams of the Fund and the World Bank meet on a regular basis to coordinate the
work on Belize. Going forward, the work of the teams will be organized along the following
lines:


Public Financial Management (PFM). The Fund is assisting in the reform of PFM processes and
institutions by optimizing the use of available information technology to ensure that future ICT
is geared to sound and best practice business processes.



Medium-Term Debt Management. The Fund will continue assisting the authorities in building
analytical capacity for developing a debt management strategy and enhancing the domestic
public debt market.



Banking Sector. The Fund, through CARTAC, plans to continue assisting the authorities in the
preparation of guidance on corporate governance, internal controls, operational risks, and
valuation of collateral. CARTAC also plans to assist the central bank to develop its financial

stability framework and preparation of its first financial stability report. The Fund is ready to
assist the authorities in updating the crisis management plan, as well as bank restructuring and
resolution framework. The Fund is also assisting in the enhancement of the regulatory and
supervisory framework of the central bank to support the proper adoption, development, and
implementation of a risk-based approach to AML/CFT.


Social Protection. The Bank is assisting in the design of a conditional cash transfer program
that targets urban and rural vulnerable groups by providing cash conditional on active
engagement of the beneficiaries in certain activities such as immunization, school attendance,
and health and family education.



Infrastructure. Through the ongoing Municipal Development Project, the Bank supports
improved access to basic municipal infrastructure and enhanced municipal management in
selected town and city councils of Belize.



Natural Resource Management. The Bank will support Belize in adopting a sustainable natural
resources based economic model while enhancing its resilience to climate change and natural
hazards. A range of potential activities include: i) policies and strategies for mainstreaming of
natural resources and climate resilience; ii) institutional capacity strengthening for natural
resource management and climate change; and iii) investments to strengthen climate resilience.

Country Strategy with Belize (2008–2012). The Country Strategy has four development
objectives: (i) Ensure sound fiscal management and public sector transparency; (ii) Create conditions
for and restore sustainable, private sector led growth; (iii) Improve human resource development
and social protection; and (iv) Rehabilitation of basic infrastructure. Approvals to date under this
strategy have reached US$72 million (nine projects). The approved program includes 6 investment
loans that will contribute towards tourism, agriculture, land management, infrastructure
development, and citizen security. A US$15 million policy-based loan targeting reforms in the
education, health, and fiscal policy sectors was concluded in April 2011. Preparation of a new
Country Strategy for the period 2013–2017 is underway, with approval expected in the fourth
quarter of 2013.
2.
Technical cooperation operations (grants) in execution include efforts to support fiscal
transparency and responsibility, pension reform, teacher training, credit unions, cocoa farmers,
competitiveness and investment promotion, and natural disaster risk management.
3.
Strategy results to date include the introduction of a medium-term fiscal framework in the
2010/11 budget; approval of an amendment to the Education Act establishing the creation of the
National Teaching Services Commission; the formulation of a tourism master plan and infrastructure
improvement of tourist destinations; and reconstruction and localized repairs of the road network,
replacement and repair of culverts, and replacement of bridges and crossings damaged by the
floods of 2008.

7.
To support the government of Belize (GOB) in achieving its development objectives, the
Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) has continued to provide financing for a number of important
projects, and the implementation of the Bank’s country strategy for Belize for the period 2011 to
2015 is now well underway.
8.
To support the environment of growth, the CDB has been supporting efforts to expand,
rehabilitate or reconstruct critical road and water infrastructure. In that regard, work has progressed
on the US$8.8 million project for the reconstruction of the Kendall (Sittee River) and Mullins River
bridges, which were destroyed by floods generated from the passage of tropical storm Arthur. The
reconstruction of these strategically important bridges started in 2010 and work has already been
completed on the Kendall bridge. In recognition of the importance of infrastructure to the economic
development of Belize, a fourth road loan of US$24.7 million was approved in 2010 for a bypass
road through the twin towns of Santa Elena and San Ignacio and a new road and bridge crossing the
Macal River. The project, on which construction activity is anticipated to commence by late 2012, is
expected to contribute to sustaining and increasing economic activity in and through the area which
is important for tourism, the transportation of crude oil, and for trade with Guatemala. To continue
addressing needs in the road sector, the CDB approved a loan of US$5.4 million in 2012 to assist
GOB in enhancing road safety along a demonstration corridor on the Western Highway from Belize
City to Belmopan. Further, a loan of US$0.4 million was approved to conduct a feasibility study and
detailed designs for the upgrade of the Northern Highway—an economically important road.
9.
In 2012, the CDB approved a loan of US$0.7 million to enable GOB undertake detailed
designs for the expansion of water and sewerage on Ambergris Caye. This builds on a 2010
feasibility study that was funded by the CDB. Ambergris Caye is an important area of concentrated
tourism activity for Belize. The improvement of the water and sewerage system is thought to be
important to sustain and boost tourism activity in the area and to protect the sensitive environment.
10.
To support private sector development in 2009, the CDB approved a line of credit of
US$10 million to the GOB, for the financing of projects in agriculture, industry, housing, and
education sectors. The funds are being managed by the Development Finance Corporation (DFC) on
an agency basis. The CDB also provided a TA grant for institutional strengthening of DFC, and
implementation of recommendations from the consultant’s report is ongoing.
11.
With respect to critical social sector investments, approximately US$3.3 million was
approved by the CDB in 2010, for GOB to establish a potable water supply system in Belize River
Valley, to serve nine villages, by installation of pipeline, storage tanks, pumps and boreholes and
connect the system to BWSL mains. The project is expected to contribute to a reduction of risks to
food and water-borne diseases and, in general, will facilitate the reduction of poverty and general
living conditions of residents. Construction activity is expected to commence by early 2013.
12.
Additionally, through a US$15 million loan, approved in 2010, the CDB has made resources
available to the Belize Social Investment Fund (BSIF), which was established by legislation in 1996, to

10

BELIZE

appraise, finance, and supervise small and medium-sized sub-projects in underserved poor
communities. This is the second loan approved by the CDB to fund project through the BSIF. The
first loan of US$7 million was approved in 2003. Belize was the beneficiary of grant funding from the
CDB through the Basis Needs Trust Fund Sixth Programme (BNTF 6) in the sum of US$3 million. As
of September 30, 2012, all resources under the BNTF 6 have been committed and implementation of
interventions is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2013. Interventions under the BSIF and the
BNTF are community-based, and are usually concentrated in the areas of water and sanitation,
education, and health. Interventions under these programmes are an integral component of Belize’s
poverty reduction strategy and action plan. Sub-projects financed through loan and grant resources
are expected to help improve living conditions and enhance social capital in poor rural communities
in Belize. The CDB funds will also allow for the development of a comprehensive results-based
monitoring and evaluation system.
13.
With grant assistance from the CDB in 2010, GOB formulated a policy and strategic
framework for the education sector. This involved the development of a comprehensive education
sector strategy. Based on this work, in 2012, the CDB approved a loan to GOB of US$2.0 million
(Education Sector Reform Project). The objective of the project is to enhance learning outcomes
across all levels of the education sector in the country. The project will address institutional
strengthening processes to underpin the success of the Education Sector Strategy. These include the
development of a comprehensive school location plan, which will guide infrastructural development
in the short to medium term.
14.
The CDB, in 2011, approved a grant of US$280,000 to the GOB, to undertake a feasibility
study with respect to a proposed Youth and Community Transformation Project. The aim of the
project is to contribute towards building a human capital particularly among youth and children
from poor communities in Belize City, as part of an attempt to reduce socially deviant behavior. In
accordance with the priority that GOB has given to strategies to reduce crime and improve citizen
security, and based on the findings of the feasibility study, the CDB may consider providing further
support to implementation of the project.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Belize—Statistical Issues Appendix
As of May 2, 2013
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Most affected areas are:
national accounts, labor, and fiscal sector statistics.

Real sector: The accuracy and reliability of the data are affected by inadequate source data. The Statistical Institute
of Belize (SIB) continues to face human and financial limitations for undertaking surveys and processing the data.
Lack of reliable data on expenditure components hampers estimation of national savings and domestic investment.
To address these shortcomings the SIB is planning to conduct a comprehensive business census in 2013, which will
provide the basis for the completion of the Statistical Business Register and the conduct of annual surveys of
establishments; strengthening capacity in the use of administrative data sources from the tax authorities and
Customs Department; and rebasing GDP series.
Price and labor statistics: Labor market statistics are scarce and available at irregular intervals, the SIB plans to
conduct the labor force survey twice a year going forward. The SIB is in the process of developing its new website,
with plans to make metadata on the CPI as well as other statistics available online.
Fiscal accounts: Data on the consolidated operations of the public sector are unavailable. Priorities for the period
ahead include preparing a comprehensive list of institutions that comprise the central government, general
government, and the public sector including extra budgetary units. Also, difficulties persist in the compilation of
capital expenditure as a number of Capital II (government-funded capital and project expenditures) items that
started life as fixed-term project contributions have become permanent funding allocations. Authorities are aware of
this shortcoming and are advising ministries to examine the continuing need and authority for such expenditures. In
addition, the current accounting practices follow neither a cash basis nor an accrual basis of accounting, which
contributes to an inconsistent accounting and reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Finally,
domestic debt data recording is weak and often prone to errors; thereby further verification effort is needed.
Monetary and financial statistics: Data on financial soundness indicators of individual banks are available on
quarterly basis. However, there is very limited data on non-bank financial institutions, especially the insurance sector.
There is need to classify offshore banks as part of Other Financial Corporation’s (OFC) subsector. Also, the Social
Security Board (SSB) is not treated as part of the general government in contrast with the standard. Plans are
ongoing to improve the availability of statistics. The central bank would start to publish the FSIs of the large credit
unions soon.
Balance of payments: Official grant and loan disbursements and repayments are generally well recorded, but
strengthening inter-agency coordination in information sharing between the MOF and CBB would be warranted. The
authorities have compiled preliminary International Investment Position (IIP) statistics, which excludes off-shore
financial sector. The compilation of FDI data remains a challenge, as survey responses are very low. Frequency could
be improved.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS) since September 27, 2006.

No data ROSC is available.

III. Reporting to STA
No fiscal data are being reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook or in the IFS.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 15, 2013

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Belize
On June 21, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Belize.1
Background
In March 2013, the government of Belize completed the exchange of its “super-bond” for new
U.S. dollar denominated 2038 bonds bringing substantial cash-flow relief (about US$130 million
over the next 5 years). The debt restructuring took place against prolonged legal disputes over
the nationalization of two utility companies, Belize Telemedia Limited (BTL) and Belize
Electricity Limited (BEL).No agreement has yet been reached over compensation payments;
and the legal dispute may take a few years in court.
In 2012, output growth is estimated at 5.3 percent, led by a recovery from the 2011 effects of
weather-related damages in commodity exports. Inflation averaged 1.4 percent, as commodity
price pressures abated. The external current account deficit widened to about 1.7 percent of
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) due to a steep drop in oil exports and higher imports of fuel and
electricity. Notwithstanding this deterioration, international reserve coverage is estimated at 3.4
months of imports up from 3 months in 2011, thanks in part to strong FDI inflows in the sugar
sector. Unemployment remains high at 16 percent.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares
a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can
be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

The fiscal primary surplus for FY2012/13 is expected to deteriorate to 1.3 percent of GDP
compared to 2.3 percent of GDP in 2011. This deterioration largely reflects the continued
decline in oil-related revenues and an increase in the wage bill, despite robust growth in
General Sales Tax (GST) revenue.
After two years of decline, credit to the private sector recovered modestly in 2012. High nonperforming loans (NPLs) in the banking system—20 percent of total loans at end-2012—and
loan write-offs continue to hold back private sector credit growth, estimated at 1.1 percent, and
are eroding banks’ net earnings. Broad money grew by 5 percent, mostly driven by expansion in
net foreign assets. New provisioning and loan classification standards implemented by the
central bank at end-2011 have resulted in declining NPLs in the banking system and improving
provisioning.
Despite the acceleration in economic activity in 2012, output growth is expected to moderate to
about 2.5 percent in the medium term. The primary surplus is projected at 1 percent of GDP in
FY13/14, with public debt expected to decline to about 75 percent of GDP at end-2013,
reflecting, in part, the net face value haircut of 3 percent from the recent debt exchange. The
government may face large financing needs over the medium term largely associated with
compensation to the former shareholders of nationalized companies, pending legal rulings. The
external current account deficit is projected to widen to about 1.9 percent of GDP owing to the
continued deterioration in crude oil exports and rising imports. The reserve coverage would
remain at around 3 months of imports by end-2013.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors congratulated the authorities on the strong economic performance last year and the
successful completion of the external debt exchange. These positive developments
notwithstanding, Directors noted that Belize’s economy still faces substantial challenges and
vulnerabilities. They encouraged the authorities to take advantage of the existing breathing
space to rebuild policy buffers, pursue active debt management, accelerate financial sector
reform, and buttress the economy’s resilience to external shocks.
Directors underscored the need to sustain the momentum of fiscal consolidation while
protecting spending in such priority areas as infrastructure, internal security, and social
programs. They stressed that raising the primary surplus to levels consistent with debt
sustainability would require strong adjustment efforts, including moderating wage increases and
broadening the base for the general sales tax. Over the medium term, it will be important to
strengthen public financial management and implement a tax reform that promotes growth and
fairness. Directors recommended that the authorities avoid the earmarking of funds, and put in
place appropriate safeguards for public resources should they be used for the creation of a
specialized mortgage bank. Given uncertainties surrounding the potential liabilities associated
with the nationalization of public companies and other contingent liabilities, Directors

3

encouraged the authorities to take additional measures as necessary, with a view to ensuring
fiscal sustainability.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans to revamp the debt management framework. They
encouraged continued efforts to develop a more robust debt management, strengthen the
institutional framework, and build capacity to operationalize a medium-term debt management
strategy. Options to develop the domestic debt market should also be explored to mobilize
domestic financing.
Directors welcomed progress on financial sector reforms. However, given the remaining
vulnerabilities, including the still high nonperforming loans, they called for continued vigilance,
close monitoring of individual institutions, and intensified efforts to implement the remaining
recommendations of the 2011 FSAP. It will also be important to update the crisis management
plan and the bank restructuring and resolution framework, making use of technical assistance
from the Fund. Directors also saw a need to further strengthen the AML/CFT framework.
Directors concurred that, while the fixed exchange rate has provided an important anchor for
macroeconomic policies, efforts are needed to tackle Belize’s widening current account deficits
and relatively low international reserves. They called on the authorities to advance structural
reforms, focusing on removing impediments to private investment, boosting competitiveness
and jobs, and promoting inclusiveness and the diversification of exports and energy sources.

Statement by Thomas Hockin, Executive Director
and Trevor Lessard, Advisor to the Executive Director
June 21, 2013

Our authorities thank the staff for their report, frank dialogue, and the mission chief’s emphasis on
providing value-added presentations, etc., during staff visits. This type of outreach is particularly
useful for small states that are committed to steady progress on their reform agenda and we hope this
template for staff visits continues to be the norm going forward. Similarly, we welcome past and
upcoming Technical Assistance (TA), which continues to assist in overcoming certain policy
weaknesses and building financial and macroeconomic resilience. Although we may not agree on
every policy recommendation we are firmly of the belief that this open dialogue has been mutually
beneficial.
After prolonged and extensive negotiations with its external creditors, our authorities successfully
negotiated a mutually agreeable debt restructuring that will provide Belize with substantial debt relief.
As staff calculations indicate, the restructuring of the Super Bond has resulted in an NPV reduction of
approximately 29-31percent, assuming an appropriate discount rate. Moreover, the restructured bond
has provided much needed fiscal space in the near term, allowing the authorities the flexibility to
tackle endemic barriers to growth resulting from high crime, security challenges, poverty alleviation,
and inadequate infrastructure, all of which require fiscal outlays.
Our authorities wish to emphasize and reiterate their steadfast commitment to servicing the
restructured Super bond, exemplified by their willingness to include a clause of principal
reinstatement in the highly unlikely event of a future default, and their commitment to improving debt
management. In this regard, the authorities are thankful for the TA provided by the Fund and, led by
senior officials who are members of the debt management task force, have already embarked upon the
process of improving their debt management capacity. The multi-pronged reform strategy will
improve back-office (e.g. recording of debt obligations), mid-office (e.g. forecasting and scenario
analysis) and front-office (e.g. strategic direction from senior officials) debt management and will
complement parallel reforms in the financial sector and public financial management.
We note that even under what we would perceive as relatively pessimistic projections, Belize’s debtto-GDP ratio continues to decline in the medium term. This is in spite of the challenges of a weak
global economy and the difficulty of maintaining a primary surplus while oil revenues sharply
decline. The report rightly highlights the contingent liabilities and our authorities are mindful that the
resolution of these liabilities will result in some level of compensation. We appreciate staff’s clarity
that they have not assessed or verified the amounts presented by Belize or the former shareholders of
BTL and BEL, and have intentionally remained neutral by selecting the mid-point valuation for the
DSA. Nevertheless, my authorities remain of the view that the mid-point is more than what the fair
value compensation is expected to be. Also, staff correctly indicates that the authorities view
settlement through the legal system to be, at the earliest, end-2015, but we would mention that the
earliest is not the most likely. Although the authorities continue to bargain in good faith and desire a
quick resolution of the contingent liabilities, it is extremely difficult to forecast when a court
mediated solution could occur.

2
As a result of these two unknowns (e.g. the timing and the size of the settlement of the two contingent
liabilities), the DSA contains significant (and unavoidable) uncertainty. Moreover, the DSA does not
by its nature incorporate the dynamic effects of the authorities commitment to readjust the fiscal
stance should the compensation be larger (or sooner) than currently envisioned.
We have had engaging discussions with staff on the view that a more aggressive fiscal stance,
achieved through a significant increase in the primary balance, could make the debt trajectory more
downward sloping and lessen medium-term financing needs. Nevertheless, additional fiscal
consolidation carries with it considerable opportunity cost and may not necessarily achieve the
forecasted benefits. As staff rightly notes, the 2013 World Bank Doing Business Report emphasizes
security risks, poor infrastructure and high crime as the main impediments for doing business in
Belize. To unlock the growth potential of the economy it is imperative that fiscal expenditures be
undertaken to address these barriers to sustainable growth, and with oil revenues potentially coming
to an end soon, the authorities believe it is best to use some fiscal space to immediately tackle these
impediments. The authorities remain committed to a primary surplus that will result in a downward
sloping debt trajectory, and will adjust the fiscal stance once the liabilities resulting from the
nationalizations have crystallized, but do not agree that raising the primary balance immediately to 3
percent is economically or socially optimal at this juncture. With a weak global economy,
deteriorating social indicators, and the need to bolster non-oil exports, the right balance between
fiscal consolidation and growth-improving investments needs to be struck.
We agree with staff that although significant progress has been made in the financial sector and many
FSAP recommendations have been implemented, the task remains incomplete. We agree with staff
that NPLs remain at a level higher than desired, but it is important to keep in mind the achievements
made in recent years. NPLs have declined significantly from a very high level and provisioning
against these loans has also markedly improved. Moreover, with the exclusion of one bank, the
domestic banking sector’s NPL is approximately 6 percent, well below the average when the troubled
bank in included. With regard to that particular bank, the authorities have adopted an increasingly
collaborative approach to returning it to viability and have developed a pragmatic, case-specific, plan
to nurse it back to health. Extensive effort is also being made to improve the central bank’s crisis
management capacity and bank restructuring/resolution framework. Also, following up on the
April/2013 staff visit to Belize, the authorities are working on enhancing the regulatory and
supervisory frameworks to create a more effective, risk-based, approach to AML-CFT.
The fixed exchange rate continues to serve Belize well, resulting in low and steady inflation. The peg
to the US dollar provides an important policy anchor, macroeconomic stability and central bank
credibility. The authorities are aware that a widening current account deficit, mainly a result of
declining oil exports, and a decline in foreign exchange reserves, could threaten the peg. As a result,
the authorities are actively promoting the expansion of other export sectors, such as tourism,
agriculture, and sustainable import substitution via the diversification of energy production into
renewable sources, which will contribute to external stability and offset the loss of exports resulting
from declining oil production.
As has been their practice, our Belizean authorities intend to publish the staff reports.
