IMF Executive Board Completes Fourth PSI Review for Tanzania and Concludes 2016
Article IV Consultation
On July 18, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed the
fourth review of Tanzania’s economic performance under the program supported by the Policy
Support Instrument (PSI)1 and also concluded the 2016 Article IV consultation2 with Tanzania.
The PSI for Tanzania was approved by the Executive Board on July 16, 2014 (see Press Release
No. 14/350).
Following the Board discussion, Mr. Min Zhu, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair,
made the following statement:
“Tanzania’s macroeconomic performance has been strong under the Policy Support Instrument.
Growth has remained close to 7 percent and inflation is moderate. Most quantitative program
targets for end-2015 were met, while progress on structural reforms slowed due to the transition
to the new government.
“The macroeconomic outlook is favorable, supported by the authorities’ ambitious development
agenda, although risks are tilted to the downside. Sustaining high growth and implementing the
development agenda while preserving fiscal and external sustainability will require a range of
reforms. Somewhat higher fiscal deficits could be sustained for a few years while keeping a low
risk of debt distress. However, creating fiscal space for higher infrastructure investment through

The PSI is an instrument of the IMF designed for countries that do not need balance of payments financial support.
The PSI helps countries design effective economic programs that, once approved by the IMF's Executive Board,
signal to donors, multilateral development banks, and markets the Fund's endorsement of a member's policies
(see http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/psi.htm). Details on Tanzania’s PSI program are available
at www.imf.org/tanzania.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
sustained efforts to raise domestic revenue and increasing spending efficiency, particularly in
public investment, is imperative.
“The implementation of the 2016/17 budget will be a first test of the authorities’ capacity to
reconcile these various objectives. Careful prioritization and implementation of expenditures will
be required to ensure that spending does not exceed available resources and to avoid domestic
arrears accumulation.
“Despite significant progress in recent years, financial development remains low. Further
development would support higher growth, as well as improve the overall effectiveness of
macroeconomic policy. Beyond credit growth, financial development will require further
improving access, particularly for businesses, and reducing high borrowing costs. Further
development of the interbank and government debt markets is also desirable.
“Vigorous reforms will be required to foster further structural transformation of the economy.
The authorities’ focus on creating a better environment for business and job creation is welcome,
like the authorities’ strong drive against corruption. Improving the financial sustainability of the
public electricity utility, TANESCO, is critical for the development of the energy sector.
Tanzania could also benefit from the completion of the East African Community common
market.”
The Executive Board also completed the 2016 Article IV Consultation with Tanzania.
Tanzania has achieved strong growth and macroeconomic stability over the past two decades.
This performance was the result of market-oriented reforms and prudent macroeconomic
policies. Growth has been driven by construction, services, and basic manufacturing, and the
economy has become more diversified. Inflation, while still volatile, has remained moderate.
Poverty has decreased but remains high (at 28.2 percent of the population, based on the national
poverty line) with a large population of underemployed youth, and despite substantial progress
toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), Tanzania is likely to have missed about
half the 2015 targets.
Growth has remained strong and inflation moderate in the past two years. Real GDP grew by
7 percent in 2015, with activity particularly buoyant in the construction, communication, finance,
and transportation sectors. Inflation remained in single digits throughout 2015, averaging
5.6 percent, despite the significant exchange rate depreciation in the first half of 2015. Inflation
in April 2016 was 5.1 percent, close to the authorities’ target of 5 percent. The external position
recorded mixed developments. The current account deficit declined from 10.7 percent of GDP in
2013/14 to a projected 8.6 percent in 2015/16, mainly due to lower oil prices. The surpluses in
the capital and financial accounts, however, narrowed due to lower donor support and foreign
direct investment related to natural gas exploration. International reserve coverage is estimated to
have declined somewhat to 3.6 months of prospective imports of goods and services in June

3
2016. The banking system appears sound overall, but there is wide variation within the system.
The level of financial development has improved in recent years, though at a gradual pace.
Implementation of the 2015/16 budget has faced challenges. While the budget was built on
ambitious but realistic revenue projections, it still had to be adjusted for external financing
shortfalls and to make room for expenditures carried over from 2014/15 and some of the new
government’s priorities in education. The revised budget targets a lower overall deficit of about
3.25 percent of GDP (compared with 4.2 percent in the original budget and the program).
Available information (on a cash basis) for the first three quarters suggests that this target is well
within reach, reflecting a significant slowdown in the execution of capital expenditures. The
stock of expenditure arrears decreased during the third quarter of the fiscal year (January- March
2016), reflecting the partial clearance of construction arrears and reversing an increase during the
first two quarters.
While macroeconomic management has been able to deliver fiscal sustainability and
macroeconomic stability, the quality of fiscal management deteriorated until recently in some
areas (e.g., expenditure arrears control) and the pace of reform has abated in recent years. The
modernization of monetary policy has made only limited progress in the past two years. The
business environment remains challenging and the perception of corruption has increased
substantially. As a result, program performance under the PSI has been mixed. The government’s
second Five-Year Development Plan (FYDP II), published in June 2016, aims to address these
issues. It focuses on economic transformation through industrialization and human development.
To facilitate private sector-led growth, the government aims to provide critical infrastructure and
create a business environment that is conducive to job creation. The government also aims to
reduce poverty by improving social services (education, health, housing, water and sanitation),
enhancing income security, and promoting social protection. The plan will start being
implemented with the 2016/17 budget.
Executive Board Assessment3
Executive Directors commended Tanzania’s strong macroeconomic performance, with high
growth and low inflation, and noted that, notwithstanding some delays in the structural reform
agenda, the outlook remains favorable, although downside risks and challenges persist. Against
this backdrop, Directors considered the second Five Year Development Plan (FYDP II) as
appropriately focused on further reducing poverty and creating a business environment that is
conducive to job creation, including by addressing the infrastructure gap, improving access to
finance and land, and enhancing education and job training. They underscored that preserving
fiscal and external sustainability while implementing FYDP II is crucial and will require a range

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

of reforms.
Directors agreed that somewhat higher fiscal deficits could be sustained for a few years while
keeping a low risk of debt distress. Nevertheless, they stressed that creating fiscal space for
higher infrastructure investment through sustained efforts to raise additional domestic revenue
and streamline current expenditure is imperative. Directors were encouraged by the authorities’
plans to strengthen tax administration and to consider further tax policy reforms. Measures to
increase spending efficiency, particularly in the area of public investment, will also be needed.
Directors stressed that careful prioritization and implementation of expenditures would be
required under the 2016/17 budget to ensure that spending does not exceed realistic revenue and
financing projections and to avoid domestic arrears accumulation. In this context, they welcomed
the authorities’ intention to postpone the launch of two large investment projects until the next
mid year budget review confirms the availability of revenue. Directors noted the need to
strengthen fiscal risk and debt management, and welcomed ongoing efforts to better monitor and
manage state owned enterprises.
Directors welcomed the Bank of Tanzania’s strong commitment to monetary and price stability,
but emphasized that faster implementation of reforms aimed at modernizing the monetary policy
framework is needed. Noting that Tanzania could potentially enjoy large gains from further
financial development, Directors welcomed the recent impressive improvements in financial
inclusion among households, and encouraged increasing access to financial services for small
and medium enterprises. They also recommended further developing the interbank and
government debt markets, which would complement the modernization of the monetary policy
framework as well as fiscal and debt management reforms.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to keep the exchange rate flexible, and encouraged
them to rebuild international reserves gradually to counter the risks from rising recourse to
international capital markets, ongoing liberalization of the financial account, and volatility in
global commodity prices and financial conditions. Strengthening buffers would also bring
Tanzania closer to its commitments under the prospective East African Monetary Union.
Directors underscored that the targeted high growth and structural transformation of the economy
requires a rekindling of the reform agenda. In particular, they noted that improving the business
environment will be critical to spur long term competitiveness and job creation, and also
encouraged continued efforts to improve governance and combat corruption.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND FOURTH REVIEW UNDER THE POLICY SUPPORT
INSTRUMENT
KEY ISSUES
Recent macroeconomic performance has been strong. Real GDP grew by 7 percent in 2015
and inflation averaged 5.6 percent. Progress in implementing past Fund policy advice,
however, has been uneven. While macroeconomic management has been able to deliver fiscal
sustainability and macroeconomic stability, the quality of fiscal management deteriorated in
some areas until recently (e.g., significant domestic arrears accumulated up to end-2015).
The new authorities have an ambitious development agenda. It focuses on creating a
better environment for business and job creation, including through better infrastructure,
access to finance and land, and education and job training. The new authorities have also sent
strong signals on their determination to reform the government and fight corruption.
The macroeconomic outlook is favorable, but risks are tilted to the downside. Growth
would remain strong at about 7 percent in 2016 and the medium term, supported by the
planned public investment scaling up. Inflation would remain close to 5 percent, assuming a
tight monetary policy stance. Key risks include the tightening of global financial conditions,
continued challenges to raise the required revenue and financing for the budget and the
related risk of arrears, and in the medium term slow reforms that could affect potential growth.
Sustaining high growth and implementing the development agenda while preserving
fiscal and external sustainability will require a range of deep reforms. Somewhat higher
fiscal deficits could be sustained for a few years while keeping a low risk of debt distress.
However, creating fiscal space for higher infrastructure investment will necessitate first and
foremost sustained efforts to raise additional domestic revenue and streamline current
expenditure. Reforms to increase spending efficiency, particularly in the area of public
investment, will also be needed. More broadly, the targeted high growth and structural
transformation of the Tanzanian economy will require a rekindling of the reform agenda.
Performance under the PSI has been mixed. Most end-2015 targets were met and the
2015/16 budget was adjusted as expected. Progress on structural benchmarks, however, was
slowed by the transition to a new government. Understandings were reached on a fiscal stance
for 2016/17 that would allow investment scaling up while preserving stability and
sustainability.
Staff recommends completion of the fourth PSI review.

Data provision is adequate for surveillance and program monitoring.
The authorities improved the national accounts and inflation data with Fund technical
assistance (TA), including rebasing their benchmark years and expanding coverage.
The Accountant General is also making progress on preparing consolidated financial
statements for the wider public sector. The authorities intend to participate in the Enhanced
General Data Dissemination Standard (e-GDDS) initiative to further enhance data dissemination
practices. Staff encouraged them to expand the coverage of government finance statistics, as
well as adopt the latest standards in this area.

The external position recorded mixed developments. The current account deficit
declined from 10.7 percent of GDP in 2013/14 to a projected 8.6 percent in 2015/16, mainly
due to lower oil prices. The capital and financial account surpluses, however, have narrowed,
reflecting lower donor support and lower FDI related to natural gas exploration. International
reserve coverage has declined somewhat to a projected 3.6 months of imports of goods and
services in June 2016, reflecting no
accumulation in 2015/16 and the

Unrealistic budgets and weak commitment controls led to the accumulation of
large arrears to suppliers and pension funds in recent years. The overall cash fiscal deficit
remained relatively low in 2013/14 and 2014/15, at 3.3 percent of GDP. However, once
corrected for significant budget expenditure arrears accumulation, the fiscal deficit actually was

in the 4-4.5 percent of GDP range.1 Budget execution in recent years was affected by
unrealistically high revenue projections and financing shortfalls, which required inefficient
intra-year expenditure adjustment mostly falling on investment. Delays in adjusting the budget
and weak commitment controls were key factors behind the accumulation of arrears.

Implementation of the 2015/16 budget has also faced challenges. While the
budget was built on ambitious but realistic revenue projections, expenditures still had to be
adjusted for external financing shortfalls and to make room for expenditures carried over from
2014/15 and some of the new government’s priorities in education. The revised budget targets
a lower overall deficit of about 3¼ percent of GDP (compared with 4.2 percent in the original
budget and the program). Available information (on a cash basis) for the first three quarters
suggests that this target is well within reach, reflecting a significant slowdown in the execution
of capital expenditures. The stock of expenditure arrears decreased during the third quarter of
the fiscal year (January-March 2016), reflecting the partial clearance of construction arrears and
reversing an increase during the first two quarters.

1
As a result, program design was changed during the third review with an assessment criterion (AC) on the
overall cash fiscal deficit and a target of no accumulation of domestic expenditure arrears.

While central government debt
has increased to about 38 percent of
GDP, debt vulnerabilities remain
limited. This increase reflects both fiscal
deficits and the impact of the recent
depreciation of the shilling on dollardenominated debt. External borrowing
on nonconcessional terms has increased
rapidly in recent years, partly to make up
for dwindling aid.

successfully implemented its
monetary targeting framework, but
there has been little progress in moving to an interest-based framework. Average reserve
money growth has been kept within a 10–15 percent range and inflation at single digits.
Once exchange rate effects are accounted for, credit and broad money growth, respectively at
about 14 and 8 percent at end-April 2016, have picked up modestly.2 Progress on dedollarization, which stalled in the wake of the shilling’s depreciation, has resumed.3 The BoT is
building forecasting and policy analysis capacity, with IMF support, and started focusing more
on managing commercial banks’ excess reserves, leading to less volatile interbank rates.
However, the move to an interest-based framework has lagged behind, with repeated delays to
introduce required reserve averaging, which is a precondition to implementing additional
reforms.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
11.
The government’s second Five-Year Development Plan (FYDP II) focuses on
economic transformation through industrialization and human development. To facilitate
private sector-led growth, the new government aims to address the infrastructure gap, which
remains large in Tanzania (see table below for a cross-country comparison), and create a
business environment that is conducive to job creation. The government also aims to reduce
poverty by improving social services (education, health, housing, water and sanitation),
enhancing income security, and promoting social protection. The plan will start being
implemented with the 2016/17 budget.

The macroeconomic outlook is favorable. Growth is projected to remain strong at
about 7 percent in 2016, on the back of low oil prices (a positive shock for Tanzania), continued
strong growth in certain sectors (e.g., services) and the scaling up of public investment. For the
medium term, in the absence of a detailed quantitative macroeconomic framework for FYDP II

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

at the time of discussions, staff designed a baseline scenario assuming public investment
scaling up. Noting that many of the authorities’ priority investments would require several
years to be implemented, staff assumed that capital expenditures would remain high over a
few years. The investment effort would help keep growth at about 7 percent during that
period; growth would then revert to its 15-year average of about 6½ percent. Inflation is
expected to remain close to the authority’s medium-term target of 5 percent, provided that the
BoT maintains a tight monetary policy stance. The external current account deficit is projected
at around 9 percent of GDP in 2016/17 and to remain elevated the medium term, as the
implementation of FYDP II would lead to high capital spending and imports.

Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. Key external risks include the
tightening of global financial conditions, which could result in higher financing costs and/or
make external budget financing difficult, and a significant slowdown in China and other large
emerging markets, which could affect external demand and the financing of key infrastructure
investments and thereby growth (Annex II). Domestic risks include the possibility of fiscal
slippages due to spending pressures stemming from FYDP II’s implementation, continued
challenges to raise the required revenue and financing for the budget, and in the medium term
slow reforms that could affect potential growth.
Authorities’ views
14.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment of the economy and
outlook but were more optimistic about medium-term growth prospects, which would
be supported by the implementation of FYDP II. In light of large public investment needs,
the government plans to mobilize additional domestic revenue and utilize public-private
partnerships (PPPs) for large infrastructure projects to limit government borrowing and risks to
debt sustainability.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 9

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
15.
Discussions revolved around how to sustain high growth and implement the new
government’s priorities while preserving fiscal and external sustainability. This will require
mobilizing additional domestic revenue, realigning spending priorities, and creating fiscal
space for infrastructure investment, as FYDP II aims to do. At the same time, the targeted
transformation of the Tanzanian economy requires administrative and institutional reforms to
promote credible policy implementation, higher efficiency of public spending, deeper financial
intermediation, and an improved business environment.

A. Raising Public Investment While Mitigating Risks
Background
16.
The draft 2016/17 budget envisages a large increase in public investment and
revenue and targets a deficit of about 4.5 percent of GDP. The tax revenue to GDP ratio is
expected to increase by about 1 percentage point, through a strengthening of tax
administration and tax policy measures. The nontax revenue to GDP ratio would increase by
about 1.5 percentage point, owing to higher contributions of parastatals to the budget
(including a large one-off transfer on account of retained earnings) and higher efficiency in the
collection of various fees. On expenditure, the draft budget proposes a large change of the
composition of spending in favor of investment. Current expenditure would be contained
through a hiring and nominal wage freeze and efforts to significantly reduce the cost of
running the government. Capital expenditures would more than double as a share of GDP,
bringing development spending to about 11 percent of GDP in 2016/17.4 The budget sets
aside about 1.5 percent of GDP to clear budget expenditure arrears. Higher project financing
and external nonconcessional borrowing (ENCB) would help finance the investment effort and
higher fiscal deficit.

4

In the draft budget, most of the increase in the public investment to GDP ratio would be made possible by
higher revenue and current expenditure streamlining, with the higher deficit playing a more limited role.

Staff’s views
17.
To reduce the risk of further arrears accumulation and absorption capacity
problems, staff recommended basing the budget on lower revenue projections. Based on
available information, staff’s estimates for tax revenue and nontax revenue are below the
authorities’ targets by about ½ percent of GDP each.5 Most of the difference is explained by
the estimated impact of administrative measures. Staff underscored that excessively optimistic
revenue and financing projections were one of the main reasons behind the accumulation of
expenditure arrears in recent years. Staff suggested lowering revenue projections by 1 percent
of GDP in the budget and treating any excess revenue, should it materialize, in a
supplementary budget in the course of next year. Lowering revenue would require reducing
expenditure commensurately to stick to the deficit target. Staff also noted the importance of
subjecting large capital expenditures to proper cost-benefit analysis. In this regard, it expressed
concerns about the envisaged purchase of planes for Air Tanzania, at a time when a strategy
on what to do with the financially distressed airline has not been adopted yet. Staff otherwise
strongly supported the planned reorientation of spending toward capital spending, but noted
that the envisaged compression of current expenditure was very ambitious and would require
broad-ranging measures and sustained efforts. Staff also stressed that the external financing
assumptions were ambitious and would require overcoming the issues that have led to ENCB
shortfalls in recent years.
5
In staff’s projection, the tax revenue ratio increases by 0.4 percentage point, half of which on account of tax
policy measures presented in the draft budget, and the other half on account of tax administration measures.
The nontax revenue ratio increases by 0.9 percentage point: 0.3 percentage point comes from the recording of
revenue of the Tanzania Port Authority (with the corresponding spending on the expenditure side), which was
not previously recorded in the budget; the increase coming from parastatals proper is about 0.8 percentage
point, of which about 0.6 percentage point is the one-off contribution.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 11

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

18.
The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) suggests that Tanzania could afford a
somewhat higher deficit than programmed for a few years and still keep its low risk of
debt distress. In the baseline scenario designed by staff, the investment scaling up leads to
higher fiscal deficits for a few years (about 4.5 percent of GDP, as in 2016/17). The completion
of the main infrastructure projects would then lead to a reduction of capital expenditures, and
with it of the fiscal deficit to slightly below 3 percent of GDP by 2022 consistent with regional
commitments to converge toward the East African Monetary Union (EAMU). In line with its
medium-term debt management strategy and ongoing discussions with the concerned
creditors, Tanzania would rely more than assumed in the previous DSA on borrowing from the
regular windows of the World Bank and African Development Bank, whose terms remain much
more favorable than international markets’, and on domestic borrowing.6 Under these relatively
prudent assumptions, the updated DSA suggests that while debt vulnerabilities would increase
somewhat, the risk of debt distress would remain low.7
19.
Fiscal risks and debt management needs to be strengthened. Having realistic
budgets (including with regard to recurrent costs associated with capital expenditures) and
contingency measures should be the first line of defense against fiscal risks. Utilizing PPPs for
large infrastructure projects would reduce government borrowing but the related fiscal risks
need to be carefully evaluated and reported; this would also require a strengthening of the
capacity to manage PPPs. Staff supported the efforts of the authorities to better monitor and
manage parastatals and encouraged further disclosure of information in this area. The
publication of the Fiscal Transparency Evaluation and annual updating of the fiscal risks
statement would also be welcome.
Authorities’ views
20.
The authorities were confident that the projected revenue increase in the draft
2016/17 budget would materialize. They noted that the pickup in tax revenue collection
from December 2015 was a sign that taxpayers took the fight against tax evasion seriously, and
expected revenue buoyancy to continue. They also expected a number of tax administration
measures, including the implementation of an action plan following the recent Tax
Administration Diagnostic Assessment and the rollout of Electronic Fiscal Devices, to lead to a
significant improvement in compliance. On nontax revenue, they reported that the increased
contributions to the budget had been discussed and agreed with the concerned parastatals.

6
Discussions with these two multilateral creditors are well advanced, and significant project financing was
already contracted from the African Development Bank and will start disbursing in 2016/17.
7
The assumptions can be seen as prudent for the following reasons: (i) the authorities might target a lower
fiscal deficit than assumed in staff’s scenario beyond 2016/17; (ii) the scenario does not assume a significant
growth dividend from the investment scaling up; and (iii) the share of concessional financing is assumed to
further decrease.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

21.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to fiscal discipline and indicated that
some large projects would be started only after confirmation in the mid-year budget
review of adequate preparation and availability of revenue. This would be the case, in
particular, for the standard gauge railway for the “central corridor”8 and the renovation of the
Dar es Salaam port. They also underscored that some expenditures would be executed only if
the financing could be raised. This was particularly the case for certain capital expenditures,
which would be financed through project financing or PPPs. Actual spending might therefore
turn out lower than budgeted, which could lead to a lower fiscal deficit than envisaged in the
draft budget. The efforts to better monitor parastatals were also an attempt to better manage
public resources. The commitment to strengthen debt management capacity remained intact;
adoption by cabinet of the new policy and legal framework for debt management was
expected by end-July 2016, with the delay of a few months from original plans only due to
changes in the structure of the Ministry of Finance and Planning.

B. Mobilizing Additional Revenue
Background
22.
Tanzania’s tax revenue, at about 13 percent of GDP in 2015/16, is low by
international standards. This reflects to a significant extent poor VAT performance. Staff
analysis suggests that the tax revenue gap in Tanzania was about 4 percent of GDP in 2009–13,
and assuming an unchanged tax potential would still be about 2–3 percent of GDP presently
(Box 1).
Box 1. Tax Revenue Gap in Tanzania
Tanzania’s tax revenue performance lags behind that of comparable countries. Tanzania had a tax-toGDP ratio of 11.9 percent of GDP in 2011–13, well below the average of EAC countries (13.1 percent of GDP)
and that of LICs (14.7 percent of GDP). This reflects to
30

collection. While EAC countries collected an average
average LICs
average LMICs
20
of 4.4 percent of GDP in VAT revenue in 2011–13,
15
Tanzania only managed to achieve 3.3 percent of
GDP. The VAT revenue underperformance appears to
10
be driven by a low tax productivity associated with
5
administrative inefficiency, low taxpayer compliance,
0
and policy gaps.
The estimation of the tax capacity suggests that
there is a considerable scope to raise revenue in
the medium term. Using the peer analysis and the frontier approach on a sample of 32 LICs with data
during 1994–2013, Tanzania’s tax capacity is estimated at 15-16 percent of GDP in 2009–13, that is about
4 percent of GDP above the average tax revenue ratio during the same period. Assuming an unchanged tax
capacity, and in light of the increase in the tax revenue ratio in 2015/16, the gap has been reduced to 2–
3 percent of GDP.

8

The draft budget includes an allocation of close to 1 percent of GDP for the standard gauge railway project.
The latter is expected to be financed mostly through a public-private partnership, with a total cost reportedly
of about US$8 billion (about 16 percent of current GDP).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 13

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

Staff’s views
23.
Raising more revenue will be critical to reconcile the government’s investment
priorities with fiscal sustainability. Closing the tax revenue gap will require sustained and
deep reforms, both in tax policy and tax administration. Although the new VAT law
implemented from July 2015 is a good step forward, more needs to be done to further
streamline exemptions and improve the refund mechanism. There is also significant revenue
mobilization potential through the elimination of corporate income tax holidays and
exemptions, the regular adjustment of specific excise rates, and development of property
taxation. In the areas of tax administration, the need to step up reforms is pressing. Areas for
policy actions include cleaning up the taxpayer registration and accounting, upgrading the IT
system and strengthening compliance risk management.
Authorities’ views
24.
The authorities agreed with the need to raise revenue collection and pointed to
ongoing initiatives in this area. FYDP II aims to increase domestic revenue by fighting tax
evasion, streamlining exemptions, widening the revenue base, and strengthening the capacity
of revenue collecting agencies. In the area of tax administration, a plan was prepared following
the recent diagnostic mission. The authorities have also started considering tax policy reforms
in a broad range of areas (including VAT, corporate income tax, excises, and property taxation),
and discussions are expected to continue in the coming months before a strategy is adopted
by end-2016.

C. Enhancing Public Spending Efficiency
Background
25.
Weak revenue collection has affected the level of expenditure, and spending
efficiency has been low in certain sectors. Tanzania’s public expenditure was below the
average for LICs in recent years, with the gap being larger for investment spending.
As mentioned above, weak commitment controls and unrealistic budgets in recent years have
led to intra-year expenditure adjustments affecting investment and arrears accumulation. Staff
analysis suggests that Tanzania performs poorly in education and investment spending
efficiency while health spending efficiency appears to be in line with the average for LICs
(Box 2).9

9

Average efficiency does not mean that there are no issues with the quality and availability of services, which
may be affected by a range of factors. As Box 2 underscores, there is significant scope for progress, even in the
health sector.

An initial assessment of the public investment
management process suggests a need to strengthen project appraisal and implementation
capacity.

27.
Arrears prevention requires sustained reforms in public financial management
(PFM) in addition to credible budgeting. More realistic budgets, tighter commitment
controls, and improved cash management are critical to avoid arrears accumulation and
budget adjustments in the course of the fiscal year.10 Staff also urged the authorities to settle
arrears to pension funds as soon as possible.
Authorities’ views
28.
The authorities broadly concurred with the assessment and stressed that a
number of reforms were underway. They noted that expenditure efficiency during the
implementation of FYDP I was affected by inadequate prioritization and stressed that FYDP II
addressed this issue. The authorities also reported the recent launch of the comprehensive
public investment management manual, which is expected to help improve the efficiency of
capital expenditure. On expenditure arrears, they underscored that recent data suggest a much
better outcome so far than in past years. Arrears will continue to be settled next year, thanks to
significant budget allocations for this purpose. An expert has been hired to enhance the IFMIS,
which will enable to track multi-year commitments over the life cycle of the budget. This will
ensure proper budgeting of the required resources, and further improve the integration of the
medium-term expenditure framework into the annual budget process. A new public awareness
10

A recent TA mission recommended improving budget credibility by cabinet committing to the fiscal
framework early in the budget cycle, subjecting revenue forecasts to independent review, greater analysis and
debate on selected budget items, identifying all contract commitments for the budget year and period of the
medium-term expenditure framework, and presenting separately new and ongoing activities. The mission also
suggested strengthening the cash flow planning process using rolling three-month cash flows and quarterly
expenditure ceilings and monthly cash releases. In the area of commitment controls, the authorities should
initiate a public awareness campaign notifying suppliers that orders without a system-generated order number
will not be honored. A range of technical recommendations were also made to use IFMIS better and increase
its coverage, including the requirement for all orders to be processed through IFMIS, with a mandatory control
against commitment ceiling releases.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 15

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

campaign will be launched to warn suppliers that orders not generated through IFMIS will not
be honored. The settlement of arrears to pension funds has been postponed to end-2016 to
ensure the legitimacy of arrears to be cleared, in light of the very large amounts involved.
The principle of clearing these arrears, however, remains.
Box 2. Benchmarking and Efficiency of Public Spending in Tanzania
Public spending has broadly stabilized in the recent years and remained below the level of
comparator countries. A lackluster revenue performance, combined with declining donor assistance
and difficulties in securing external financing, has constrained public spending growth. Further, the
need to maintain fiscal discipline in the face of revenue and financing shortfalls led to expenditure cuts
that fell disproportionally on capital expenditure, thus weakening the composition of spending. Total
public expenditure in Tanzania stood at 19.5 percent of GDP on average in 2010–14, well below the
EAC average (24.5 percent of GDP), while capital expenditure was the lowest in the region.
There is a significant room to improve public spending efficiency. The latter was assessed using
the data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach on a sample of 34 LICs with data for the period
2010–14. The efficiency score of Tanzania for health spending is estimated at 0.86 close to the sample
average, using the health-adjusted life
expectancy (HALE) to measure the health
outcome. Eliminating remaining inefficiencies
(i.e., bringing the score to 1) could raise HALE
from 53 to 60 years with the same level of
spending. Using school enrollment rates as
the education outcome, the efficiency of
education spending in Tanzania is about a
third lower than in the most efficient LICs.
Similarly, Tanzania ranks low in the efficiency
of public investment, with the efficiency gap
estimated at about a third for overall
infrastructure quality.
Reforms to improve the allocation of resources in the health and education sectors and
strengthen public investment management institutions would help Tanzania improve public
spending efficiency. In the health sector, existing reports highlight the need to align staffing of
healthcare centers and the provision of drugs to demand and performance, address the shortage of
skilled staff, tackle low productivity of staff and the high degree of absenteeism, and strengthen the
information management system to better monitor health indicators and performance of healthcare
centers. In the education sector, reducing the large disparities of students to teacher ratios across
districts, improving the quality of primary education, and improving teachers’ skills are essential. It is
important that spending on tertiary education does not crowd out that of lower education levels,
whereas student loans should be better targeted and their repayment enforced. Strengthening public
investment management institutions would be critical to improve the selection, appraisal,
management and evaluation of projects.

D. Monetary and Financial Sector Policies: Promoting Growth While
Preserving Stability
Background
29.
The financial system in Tanzania is dominated by banks.11 Financial markets, on the
whole, are shallow and less developed though a few markets (the interbank and foreign
exchange markets) exhibit greater liquidity and depth. Banks are generally well-capitalized and
profitable. However, there is wide variation within the system: a few large banks have shown
strong financial performance but other banks, primarily smaller foreign-owned banks and
community banks, exhibit low profitability and poor asset quality. State-owned banks also have
relatively high non-performing loan (NPL) ratios. Tanzania stands out in its large number of
banks (57).
30.
The level of financial development has improved in recent years, though at a
gradual pace. A broad measure of financial development suggests that the development of
institutions has improved over time but that of markets has lagged. Among institutions, there
has been notable improvement in access, particularly for households. The expansion of mobile
money and banking is a key driver of this positive development.12 While nearly two-thirds of
adults now have access to formal financial services, the picture for firms is less positive: in the
2013 World Bank enterprise survey, almost 44 percent of firms in Tanzania claimed to face
difficulties in accessing finance, the highest proportion in the EAC, with small and medium
enterprises facing particularly acute challenges. Further, the level of financial development in
Tanzania is lower than might be expected for a country at its current level of income and
similar fundamentals, with market development particularly lagging. Finally, financial efficiency
is relatively low in Tanzania, with for instance high lending rates.
31.
Improving financial development would likely yield higher growth and greater
stability. Based on recent cross-country empirical work done at the IMF,13 Tanzania stands to
benefit substantially from greater financial development. By bringing the level of development
up to expected levels given Tanzania’s economic and demographic characteristics, empirical
estimates suggest that growth could be higher by up to 1 percent and less volatile.
32.
Improving financial market development in Tanzania would also facilitate
macroeconomic policy implementation. The monetary transmission mechanism is weak and
seems to have weakened, rather than strengthened, in recent years. There appears to be little
correlation between short-term (market) rates and longer-term retail rates, probably reflecting
11

See the Selected Issues Paper (SIP) on macro-financial issues.

12

Mobile money transactions have grown rapidly in Tanzania. They amounted to nearly 52 percent of GDP in
2015, up from just 0.2 percent in 2010.

interest rate volatility in the interbank market. The lack of market development also adversely
affects fiscal policy by reducing the authorities’ capacity to raise domestic financing at a
reasonable cost and run counter-cyclical policies in response to shocks, and raises risks such as
rollover risks.

Staff’s views
33.
Achieving further financial development supporting growth will require prudent
credit expansion and other measures. While the short-term relationship between economic
growth and credit appears relatively weak, the link may be stronger in the long run. Further, as
the financial system deepens, the link is expected to strengthen. Rapid credit growth, while

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

likely a needed ingredient of financial development, may lead to potential vulnerabilities in the
financial sector. So far, the recent rapid rise in credit appears to be well-supported by
economic conditions: The credit-to-GDP ratio, while rising, has not deviated from historical
trends. Nevertheless, there are developments in some sectors that bear monitoring.
In particular, lending to real estate (reflecting lending to activities related to commercial
properties), while small, has been growing rapidly. Further, some lending for property-related
activities is not adequately captured by the data as it is classified as personal loans by
commercial banks. Mortgages, which are a new and small part of overall lending, have
increased in recent years. While risks appear to be contained, the BoT should monitor the
situation closely and stand ready to take swift action, including imposing or adjusting
prudential limits.14 Beyond credit growth, financial development will require improving further
access, particularly for businesses, and reducing high borrowing costs, which reflect a range of
issues typically found in LICs (e.g., imperfect information and slow resolution of disputes by the
judicial system).
34.
Micro- and macro-prudential oversight needs to be further strengthened, in
parallel with the development of the financial system. Moving forward with the planned
increase in capital requirements may support a gradual consolidation amongst banks.
Some banks continue to have high levels of NPLs. A more proactive approach is required from
the supervisory authorities to work with commercial banks on reducing NPLs. The overall
stability of the banking system would be enhanced by the BoT tackling more forcefully the two
small banks reporting negative capital. Enhanced AML/CFT supervision of banks could help
address risks from potential loss of correspondent banking relations. With regard to mobile
money, the BoT should continue to work on achieving full pass-through of deposit insurance
coverage for individual mobile money accounts, addressing operational risks, and stepping up
contingency planning.
35.
A key first step to develop financial markets is for the BoT to further increase its
emphasis on short-term interest rates. By more directly focusing on stabilizing short-term
rates, including through open market operations and implementing structural reforms (e.g.,
required reserve averaging, ensuring that the Lombard window can always be accessed and at
a rate that does not follow short-term market fluctuations), the BoT could reduce interbank
rate volatility, foster the development of the interbank market, and strengthen the interest rate
channel of monetary policy transmission. The eventual move to an interest-based monetary
policy would complete this process. Forecasting and policy analysis capacity needs to be
further developed and integrated more systematically into the decision-making process.
Further work is needed to improve liquidity forecasting at the BoT and commercial banks, for
instance to better anticipate seasonal patterns in government flows, which would be helped by
reducing and eventually eliminating central bank advances to the government.

14

An option, for instance, would be to bring the loan-to-value ceiling on mortgages back to 80 percent (it was
recently raised to 90 percent).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 19

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

Communication also needs to be further stepped up and improved, both through the regular
publication of information and analyses and exchanges with market participants.
36.
Fiscal and debt management reforms could play an important role too. Budget
credibility needs to improve and to be accompanied by better cash forecasting on the part of
the fiscal authorities. This will also allow the authorities to announce and stick to a bond
issuance schedule, which ultimately would strengthen the government securities market.
Tap sales should be phased out while transparent rules that govern the bidding process in
primary auctions should be adopted. Arbitrary changes (changing or even cancelling offered
amounts) should be eliminated. Greater communication with financial market participants
would also help in setting the stage for a more effective government securities market.
Authorities’ views
37.
The authorities broadly shared these views and underscored that a number of the
recommendations were already being implemented. They noted that sustainable credit
growth and better SME access to finance would require better and more easily available
information to assess credit risks, as well as improved financial literacy, and they laid out their
plans in this area. Implementation of partial reserve averaging is about to be implemented, and
both the Lombard facility and the collateral framework will be reviewed with a view to
improving them. With TA from the Fund, forecasting and policy analysis capacity is being
strengthened. Communication with markets participants has improved significantly since mid2015. The recommendations made to improve the functioning of the government debt market
are being considered, together with the possibility of further IMF and World Bank TA to
implement them.
38.
Micro- and macro-prudential oversight is being strengthened. The BoT recently
concluded its pilot consolidated supervision exercise on a large domestic bank with some
cross-border operations, and additional pilot exercises are being planned. Work is underway to
develop a supervisory framework for community banks. The BoT intends to improve its stresstesting model and capacity. It will review the stringency of future stress tests to ensure that
both baseline assumptions and tail risks are adequately explored.

E. Growth-Enhancing Structural Reforms
Background
39.
The business environment remains challenging. In the 2016 World Bank’s Doing
Business survey, Tanzania ranks 139 out of 189 countries and lags behind its regional peers
such as Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. Getting credit, paying taxes, and trading across borders
are mentioned as the biggest issues. The perception of corruption has increased in recent
years, while the perception of government effectiveness has decreased. Corruption has directly
affected public finances: for instance, corruption at the Port of Dar es Salaam led to significant
tax evasion and lower revenue; corruption in the private placement of a bond in 2013 increased

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

financing costs to the government. In addition to the possibility of potential contingent
liabilities, the IPTL case and related court proceedings have also likely increased perception of
risk by investors. More broadly, corruption has negatively impacted the business climate, with
likely negative implications for investment and growth.15

40.
Tanzania could become a major producer and exporter of natural gas in the next
decade. Recently discovered offshore natural gas, assuming it is exploited, could lead to multibillion dollar foreign investment in the next 5–10 years and make Tanzania one of the largest
exporters of natural gas in the region by the mid-2020s. Potentially significant revenue from
natural gas (whose size is highly sensitive to a number of parameters, particularly gas prices;
see Selected Issues Paper) could play a critical role for the development of Tanzania, if well
managed.
41.
The financial sustainability of the public electricity utility, TANESCO, has not been
achieved yet, affecting its credibility as an energy purchaser. TANESCO still has a large
amount of arrears to gas and electricity suppliers (0.7 percent of GDP in early 2016). A large
independent electricity producer (SONGAS) recently decided to shut down partially its
operations as a result of TANESCO’s inability to clear its arrears; other investment decisions
could also be affected. Despite this context, TANESCO requested a small tariff decrease for the
spring of 2016, and a larger one for 2017, anticipating a significant improvement in its financial
situation reflecting favorable developments in its production mix.
Staff’s views
42.
A rekindling of reform efforts will be needed to foster further structural
transformation and sustain high productivity growth and investment (Box 3). Staff
supported the new government’s plan to play a facilitating role for private sector-led growth,
by creating a better environment for business and job creation, including through better
15

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 21

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

infrastructure (for energy and transportation in particular), access to finance and land, and
education and job training. Given that over 70 percent of the population is involved in
agriculture, modernizing this sector will help raise income, free labor resources for other
sectors of the economy, and could foster the development of certain industries, such as food
processing. Staff also argued that Tanzania could significantly benefit from the completion of
the EAC common market and urged the authorities to push for the removal of non-tariff
barriers in the region.
43.
Decisions will need to be made and implemented quickly to ensure the
sustainability and development of the energy sector. The investment decision has not yet
been made by potential investors in the offshore gas sector, as a number of critical issues
related to the legal, tax, and regulatory environment have not been resolved. Staff welcomed
the new authorities’ plan to re-engage with the investors to facilitate reaching the investment
decision. Further improving the financial sustainability of TANESCO is critical to provide
incentives for the existing producers of gas and independent power producers to expand their
activities. Staff urged the authorities to finalize and implement the strategy to address
TANESCO’s arrears and to reconsider the planned tariff decreases until TANESCO’s financial
situation allows it.
44.
Staff welcomed the new authorities’ strong drive against corruption.
Staff underlined that anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and their corresponding
penalties should be fully applied to any established corruption cases. Strengthening
transparency will also help reduce the incidence of corruption.

Box 3. Productivity, Growth, and Structural Reforms 1/
Tanzania experienced macroeconomic stabilization and significant structural change over the last three
decades, including two major waves of reforms, first in the mid-1980s and more importantly in the mid1990s. Staff analysis shows that both reform waves were followed by total factor productivity (TFP) and
growth spurts. Over the recent period, growth remained strong with high investments to address
infrastructure gaps, but TFP growth decreased.

The lower TFP performance coincided with a less strong reform drive in recent years. Certain indicators
suggest that recent progress has been limited in a number of priorities areas, with even a deterioration of
certain aspects of public governance (e.g., control of corruption) and overall government effectiveness.
The business environment is challenging, even by regional standards.
Vigorous reforms are needed to sustain high growth and foster further structural transformation of the
economy. While higher investment is welcome, particularly in a country with a low capital stock, a growth
model relying mostly on capital accumulation is less durable than one also underpinned by TFP
improvements. In emerging Asian countries which achieved sustained high growth, TFP growth contributed
more to GDP growth than in Tanzania in recent years. There seems to be considerable room for productivity
improvements through sustained structural and institutional reforms, which would support continued
diversification of the economy.

Authorities’ views
45.
The authorities stressed that the growth strategy laid out in FYDP II was broadly
consistent with staff’s recommendations, with its focus on further structural transformation
and a facilitating role for the government in this process. With regard to the EAC integration
process, they noted that the first implementation phase of the common market is currently
being assessed by the regional authorities, with a view to drawing lessons for the next steps.
The authorities reiterated their intention to maintain close engagement with potential investors
in the offshore gas sector.

F. Reducing External Vulnerability
Background
46.
The external current account deficit is expected to remain high. Tanzania has
recorded large current account deficits over the past decade, financed mainly by official flows
and FDI. High development and infrastructure needs are expected to continue to lead to large
investment-related imports and current account deficits.
47.
Empirical analysis suggests that the exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals and desirable policies and that international reserves are adequate.
The EBA-lite external sustainability and real exchange rate approaches indicate that the shilling,
which was last assessed in 2014 to be somewhat overvalued, is now close to equilibrium
(Annex III). The EBA-lite current account approach, however, suggests that Tanzania’s current
account deficit is larger than the level consistent with fundamentals and desired policies,
implying some overvaluation. This model, however, does not seem to capture well Tanzania’s
situation (including substantial imports financed by FDI), as indicated by a very large residual.
Moreover, the shilling has not been under significant pressure since mid-2015. According to
traditional metrics and a cost-benefit analysis, Tanzania’s reserves at about 3.6 months of
imports at end-June 2016 are adequate (Annex III).
Staff’s and authorities’ views
48.
Staff and the authorities agreed that the real effective exchange rate had moved
close to equilibrium and about the need to keep the exchange rate flexible.
However, efforts will be needed to expand the narrow export base to reduce external
vulnerability. Given other countries’ experiences, allowing exchange rate flexibility is critical to
keeping tradable goods and services competitive. Foreign exchange market interventions
should be used to smooth excessive volatility in the exchange rate, but not to resist sustained
depreciation pressures when they exist. The economy is expected to be increasingly exposed to
risks arising from rising recourse to international capital markets, the ongoing capital account
liberalization, and commodity price fluctuations, particularly oil prices. To address these risks,
further accumulation of reserves is desirable in the next few years; it would also help bring the
reserves level closer to EAMU’s convergence criterion of at least 4.5 months of imports.

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

PROGRAM AND OTHERS ISSUES
49.
Program implementation to date. Performance under the PSI has been mixed.
Most end-2015 and end-March 2016 quantitative targets were met, and the 2015/16 budget
was adjusted in line with the authorities’ commitment made at the time of the third review.16
Staff regretted, however, the absence of a supplementary budget to formalize it. Progress on
structural benchmarks was limited (see authorities’ memorandum). The delay in implementing
structural reforms reflects, to a significant extent, the transition to a new government, which
has involved reconsideration of a number of measures.
50.
Forward-looking part of the review. The fiscal program had to be amended
significantly from the previous review to accommodate the new authorities’ priorities, as
reflected in their draft 2016/17 budget (see table below). While staff would have preferred that
the 2016/17 budget be based on lower revenue projections, it can support the two-step
approach to its implementation, with some large projects not to be started before confirmation
of readiness and availability of revenue at the time of the mid-year budget review.
This approach will facilitate reaching the fiscal deficit target of about 4.5 percent of GDP while
reducing the risk of arrears accumulation.17 The 5th PSI review will provide an opportunity to
reconsider the broader fiscal outlook (revenue, financing, and pace of expenditure
implementation) and refine the medium-term scenario, based on a more detailed assessment
of large infrastructure projects. It is proposed to: reschedule to end-December 2016 the two
missed structural benchmarks on the clearance of arrears to pension funds, to allow for a new
verification of claims by the Internal Auditor General; and modify the assessment criteria on net
international reserves and the overall fiscal deficit for end-June 2016, to reflect the large
expected shortfall in ENCB. New benchmarks are also proposed in the authorities’
memorandum.

16

The situation with regard to the two private external creditors to whom payments have been suspended
while the authorities seek to establish the legitimacy of the claims remains unchanged since the 3rd review.
The audit of Air Tanzania Company Limited (ATCL), which will help determine the validity of Wallis Trading
Company’s claim on ATCL that carries a government guarantee, was not completed at the time of discussions
with staff. The authorities have not made yet a final determination on the validity of a loan contracted from
Belgium in the early 2000s. These disputed claims are not considered to give rise to external arrears for
program purposes at this time. Tanzania owes pre-HIPC Initiative arrears to non-Paris Club creditors which
continue to be deemed away under the revised policy on arrears to official bilateral creditors, as the underlying
Paris Club agreement is adequately representative and the authorities have made best efforts to resolve the
arrears.

17

In the proposed revised program, the main differences with the draft 2016/17 budget are that both revenue
and capital expenditures are lower by about 1 percent of GDP. There is still a large investment scaling up, with
the public investment to GDP ratio increasing by 4.5 percentage points from 2015/16. The required fiscal space
comes from current expenditure streamlining (about 1.5 percentage points) and higher revenue
(1.3 percentage points), with the remainder financed through a higher deficit (1.3 percentage points).

Safeguards assessment. An update safeguards assessment of the BoT was finalized in
November 2012. The assessment found a strengthened governance and safeguards framework
at the BoT. While the BoT has since implemented most of the recommendations, progress in
establishing a modern internal audit function has been slow.

STAFF APPRAISAL
52.
The macroeconomic outlook is favorable, but risks are tilted to the downside.
Growth is projected to remain strong at about 7 percent in 2016 and the medium term,
supported by the implementation of FYDP II. Inflation would remain close to the authorities’
medium-term target of 5 percent, provided that the BoT maintains a tight monetary policy
stance. However, there are significant risks. External current account deficits will remain high, as
higher investment boosts imports. Further external risks include the tightening of global
financial conditions and a significant slowdown in China and other large emerging markets.
Domestic risks include the possibility of fiscal slippages due to spending pressures stemming
from FYDP II’s implementation, continued challenges to raise the required revenue and
financing for the budget, and in the medium term slow reforms that could affect potential
growth.
53.
Sustaining high growth and implementing FYDP II while preserving fiscal and
external sustainability will require a range of deep reforms. The updated debt
sustainability analysis suggests that somewhat higher fiscal deficits could be sustained for a
few years while keeping a low risk of debt distress. However, creating fiscal space for higher
infrastructure investment, which staff fully supports, will necessitate first and foremost
sustained efforts to raise additional domestic revenue and streamline current expenditure.
26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

Staff is encouraged by the authorities’ plan to strengthen tax administration drawing on a
recent diagnostic mission and to consider tax policy reforms in a broad range of areas
(including VAT, corporate income tax, excises, and property taxation). Reforms to increase
spending efficiency, particularly in the area of public investment, will also be needed.
More broadly, the targeted high growth and structural transformation of the Tanzanian
economy will require a rekindling of the reform agenda, which lost some momentum in recent
years.
54.
The implementation of the 2016/17 budget will be a first test of the authorities’
capacity to reconcile these various objectives. To avoid the difficult experience of recent
years, characterized by expenditure adjustments in the course of the year and domestic arrears
accumulation, careful prioritization and implementation of expenditures will be required to
ensure that spending does not exceed realistic revenue and financing projections. In this
regard, staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to postpone the launch of two large
investment projects until the next mid-year budget review confirms readiness and the
availability of revenue. Fiscal risks and debt management also needs to be strengthened.
Having realistic budgets and contingency measures should be the first line of defense against
fiscal risks. Utilizing PPPs for large infrastructure projects would reduce government borrowing
but the related fiscal risks need to be carefully evaluated and reported. Ongoing efforts to
better monitor and manage parastatals are welcome.
55.
Further financial development is highly desirable. Significant progress has been
made in recent years, particularly with regard to household access to the financial sector, an
area where the spectacular development of mobile money has played an important role.
However, the level of financial development remains below what could be expected given
Tanzania’s income level and characteristics. Recent empirical work suggests that further
financial development would likely yield higher growth and greater stability. It would also
improve the effectiveness of macroeconomic policy. Beyond credit growth, financial
development will require improving further access, particularly for businesses, and reducing
high borrowing costs, which reflect a range of issues typically found in LICs (e.g., imperfect
information and slow resolution of disputes by the judicial system). The development of the
key interbank and government debt markets is desirable and could be helped by the
modernization of the monetary policy framework, fiscal and debt management reforms, and
better coordination between fiscal and monetary policies.
56.
Improving the business environment, which remains challenging, is also a
priority. Tanzania lags behind its regional peers in international surveys, with access to credit,
paying taxes, and trading across borders mentioned as the biggest issues. The perception of
corruption has increased in recent years, while that of government effectiveness has decreased.
FYDP II’s focus on creating a better environment for business and job creation, including
through better infrastructure, access to finance and land, and education and job training, is
therefore welcome, like the authorities’ strong drive against corruption. Decisions will need to
be made and implemented quickly to ensure the sustainability and development of the energy

sector. Finally, Tanzania could significantly benefit from the completion of the EAC common
market and the removal of non-tariff barriers in the region.
57.
Although program performance to date has been mixed, staff supports the new
authorities’ policy orientations and commitments, the proposed modification of two
assessment criteria, and recommends completion of the fourth PSI review.
58.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 24-month
cycle for program countries.

Annex I. Main Recommendations of the 2014 Article IV
Consultation
Recommendations

Status

Fiscal policy: Reduce the fiscal deficit to 3¾
percent of GDP in 2013/14 and to 3 percent
over the medium-term by mobilizing revenue
and containing expenditure. 1

While the cash deficits were below targets in 2013/14
and 2014/15, the deficits including arrears were
above targets.

Public financial management: Stepped up
efforts are needed, particularly in preventing
arrears accumulation and improving the fiscal
data. Improve the monitoring and
management of fiscal risks.

Progress has been made in improving the accuracy
and timeliness of the fiscal data, but domestic arrears
have been a recurring issue. Some progress was
made with more information published on parastatals
and a fiscal risk statement.

Monetary policy: Maintain a prudent policy
stance to contain inflation and modernize the
monetary policy framework. Continue to build
up reserves.

Inflation has been in single digits, with generally
prudent monetary policy. Limited progress has been
made in modernizing the monetary policy framework,
beyond building policy analysis and forecasting
capacity. The reserve cover ratio slightly declined,
despite the large improvement in the current account
balance, but remained close to 4 months of imports.

Financial sector policy: Strengthen banking
supervision and improve the functioning of key
financial markets

The banking supervision framework has been
strengthened. Key financial markets need to be
further developed and their functioning needs to
improve.

Competitiveness. Improve the business
climate and preserve international
competitiveness.

The shilling is now broadly in line with fundamentals.
The business climate has not significantly improved in
recent years.

Natural resource management. Set up the
appropriate institutional arrangements for
natural gas development and related revenue
management.

Progress was made with the adoption of the
Petroleum Act and the Oil and Gas Revenue
Management Act. A number of steps still need to be
taken, however, to allow investors to make a decision
on investment.

1The

targets are recalculated using the revised national accounts data released in 2015.

mobilization (tax reform) and
reprioritizing expenditure.

Medium. Development of the energy
sector is critical for reducing cost and
improving availability, and ultimately
to sustain high growth.

spending to accommodate
key infrastructure. Increase
revenue mobilization (tax
reform).

Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario
most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective
assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent,
“medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent).
The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions
with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Annex III. Tanzania: External Stability Assessment
This note assesses external stability of the Tanzanian economy. Tanzania has recorded large
current account deficits over the past decade, financed mainly by official flows and FDI. The real
exchange rate is broadly in line with economic fundamentals, and reserves are adequate. Some
further accumulation of reserves seems desirable to address risks arising from commodity price
fluctuations, the gradual capital account liberalization, and rising recourse to international
market financing.
Current Account
1.
Tanzania’s large current account
deficit reflects structural factors. High
development and infrastructure needs (roads,
railway, ports, water supply projects and
energy sector) lead to large investmentrelated imports, while the export base
remains narrow, despite the encouraging
development of non-traditional exports
(including light manufacturing) in recent years
(Text Figure 1).
2.
Over the past decade, the current account deficit has followed a V-shape
trajectory. In 2011/12 the current account deficit widened to about 13 percent of GDP mainly
because of a surge in FDI and the
increased imports of oil and thermal
power generation equipment to offset the
drought-related hydro capacity shortages.
The current account deficit declined from
10.7 percent of GDP in 2013/14 to a
projected 8.6 percent in 2015/16, as lower
oil prices and imports more than offset the
impact of the decline of gold prices on
exports. Also, with the completion of a gas
pipeline and new gas-fueled power plants,
imports of capital goods are projected to
decline. This trend, however, will be
temporarily offset by the planned public
investment scaling up under the Five Year Development Plan II, with the current account deficit
projected to increase a bit to 9.1 percent of GDP in 2016/17 (Text Figure 2).1
1

Until commercial viability of the potentially large off-shore natural gas deposits is confirmed, the projections
do not incorporate the impact of related FDI.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

41

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

3.
The current account deficit is financed mainly by grants, FDI and government
borrowing. Given the declining trend in aid, Tanzania is relying more on FDI, project loans, and
external non-concessional borrowing to
finance the current account deficit (Text
Figure 3). The recourse to international
market financing started in 2010/11 and
includes borrowing from commercial
international banks and semi-concessional
loans. The authorities are also considering
issuing a Eurobond and are in the process
of obtaining sovereign rating.
Exchange Rate Assessment
4.
The Tanzanian shilling depreciated sharply in 2014/15. The depreciation against the
U.S. dollar reached 25 percent in 2014/15 (Text
Figure 4). While the depreciation largely reflected
the global strength of the dollar, domestic factors
also contributed to the volatility, such as the
loosening of monetary policy in late 2014,
seasonal patterns in FX inflows, delays in
mobilizing external financing, and perhaps
uncertainty in the run up to the elections. The
situation in the FX market returned to normal in
July 2015 and has remained orderly since.
5.
The recent depreciation has brought the real effective exchange rate, which was
last assessed in 2014 to be somewhat overvalued, closer to equilibrium (see Text Table 1).
The results are based on the External Balance Assessment (EBA-lite) methodology2 which
includes three approaches: the current account model (CA), the real exchange rate model
(REER), and the external sustainability (ES)
approach. The current account and real
exchange rate models are based on panel
regressions. They provide estimated
current account and exchange rate
“norms”, which values are consistent with
fundamentals and desirable policies. External positions are represented by the gaps between
the actual current account and real exchange rate and their corresponding norms. The ES
approach calculates a current account norm that would stabilize the net foreign asset (NFA)
position at some benchmark level (in the present case, NFA is stabilized at its recent level).
2

See IMF, 2013, “The External Balance Assessment (EBA) Methodology”, IMF Working Paper, WP/13/272.

42

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

6.
The current account approach suggests some overvaluation of the real effective
exchange rate. The CA panel regression model includes variables that are grouped into three
categories: (i) policy variables that can be directly
affected by policy actions; (ii) non-policy
fundamentals are generally slow-moving in the
absence of structural reforms; and (iii) cyclical
factors capture the cyclical component in the
current account.3 The CA approach estimates a CA
norm of -6.9 percent of GDP and a CA gap of 1.9 percent of GDP in 2015 (see Text Figure 5).
The real effective exchange rate adjustment that
would eliminate this difference over the medium term is then calculated using an estimated
elasticity of the current account with respect to the real exchange rate. The adjustment is
calculated to be between 9 and 16 percent, or an average of about 12 percent, based on an
estimated elasticity between 0.12 and 0.22. 4
7.
The REER5 approach suggests some
undervaluation of the real effective exchange
rate. The real effective exchange rate depreciated
by about 8 percent in 2015 mainly due to the fall
in the nominal value of the Tanzania shilling
against the currencies of its main trading
partners. Based on REER model, the REER is
estimated to be slightly undervalued in 2015
(Text Figure 6).
8.
The ES approach suggests that real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with
its long-run equilibrium. The ES approach compares the projected medium-term CA with the
CA level that stabilizes the external position or the NFA at a specified benchmark, specified at

3

(i) policy variables include fiscal balance, foreign exchange intervention, private credit and capital controls,
(ii) non-policy fundamentals include NFA, productivity, oil and gas exports, demographic indicators, real GDP
growth forecast, country risk, financial center, aid and remittances, and (iii) cyclical factors include output gap
and terms of trade.

4

The average REER adjustment to eliminate the CA gap is based on the elasticity of the CA to the REER
estimated by Lee et al, 2008, “Exchange Rate Assessment CGER Methodologies”, IMF Occasional Paper No. 261
and Tokarick, S., 2010, “A Method for Calculating Export Supply and Import Demand Elasticities”, IMF Working
Paper No. 180. The Tokarick estimate of the trade balance elasticity for Tanzania is higher than CGER at 0.22.
5

The panel regression model for the REER index includes variables that would affect the REER directly and
indirectly though changes to the CA balance. These variables are: (i) policy variables include FX intervention,
short-term real interest rate, private credit and capital controls, and (ii) non-policy fundamentals include NFA,
productivity, financial home bias, terms of trade, trade openness, output gap, aid and remittances.

its recent level.6 With net foreign assets at -64 percent of GDP in 2021/22, the ES approach
yields an estimated current account norm of -6.8 percent of GDP and a slight overvaluation of
the shilling by 1.4 percent.
Adequacy of International Reserves
9.
The Fund has developed a new approach to Assess Reserve Adequacy in CreditConstrained-Economies”7 (ARA-CC). It is a useful complement to traditional approaches8 and
takes into account the nature of external drains on reserves and the degree of capital market
access.9 It assesses the adequacy of reserves for countries with limited or no access to
international capital markets. Reflecting this, it primarily focuses on shocks emanating from the
current account side (e.g., adverse terms of trade, remittance and aid shocks).
10.
The adequate level of reserves is derived from a cost-benefit analysis. An
algorithm is used that balances the absorption smoothing benefits of reserves in the event of
adverse shocks against the opportunity cost of holding reserves taking into account country
specificities. The absorption smoothing benefits of holding reserves are estimated by two
empirical regressions that capture: (i) the role that reserves play in reducing the likelihood of a
crisis, and (ii) the impact of reserves in reducing the severity of a crisis. To quantify the cost of
holding reserves, either the external funding cost, sterilization cost or the marginal product of
capital (all net of returns from holding reserves) can be used as proxies. The adequate level of
reserves is estimated as the level where the additional (marginal) utility to be achieved by
holding one more unit of reserves is equal to the additional (marginal) utility that must be
given up (cost) in order to obtain and maintain that level of reserves.
11.
According to this approach, Tanzania’s international reserves are adequate.
Reserves at end-June 2015 stood at about 4 months of next year’s imports. The reserve cover
ratio is projected to be lower at 3.6 months at end-June 2016, reflecting in part higher imports
in 2016/17 related to higher investment. However, a reserve cover ratio of 3.5-4 months is
higher than required by traditional adequacy measures but falls short of the 4.5 months of
imports used as a convergence criterion towards the East African Monetary Union (EAMU) (Text
Figure 7). Using the ARA-CC approach, a level of 2.4-3.2 months of next year’s imports is

Net foreign assets are obtained from the External Wealth of Nations database (Lane, P. and G. Milesi-Ferretti,
"The External Wealth of Nations Mark II: Revised and Extended Estimates of Foreign Assets and Liabilities,
1970-2004", Journal of International Economics 73, November 2007, pp. 223–250.) and extended through
2017/18 using flow projections for foreign assets and liabilities.

IMF Policy Paper, 2014, “Assessing Reserve Adequacy—Specific Proposals.”

8

Traditional approaches include the 3.8 months of import cover (LICs median), 42 percent broad money
coverage, and 100 percent short-term debt coverage. While these methods remain useful and are simple and
easy to apply, their theoretical basis may not be clear and they may not necessarily reflect country specificities
and/or properly capture multiple motives for holding reserves.

international financial markets and/or are on average rated as “less than investment grade”.

adequate for precautionary purposes in order to prevent and mitigate adverse shocks. This
somewhat counter-intuitive result reflects the high costs of holding reserves (assumed to be in
the range of 4-5.6 percent).
12.
This approach, however, does not capture well a number of recent developments
affecting Tanzania. One of them is the recent high volatility in commodity prices, particularly
oil. This suggests that reserve buffers should be higher than suggested by the ARA-CC
approach. Two other important recent developments are the ongoing liberalization of the
capital account and the increasing
recourse to borrowing from the
international capital markets, particularly
in a context of declining aid trends.
These developments will increase
Tanzania’s exposure to shifts in market
sentiment, which require a higher level
buffer of reserves. From these reasons,
staff is of the view that further increasing
the reserve cover ratio is desirable; it
would also Tanzania to get closer to the
convergence criterion under EAMU.

Attachment I. Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
June 28, 2016
MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PROGRAM PERFORMANCE
A. Recent Macroeconomic Developments and Outlook
Output and Prices
1.
Growth. The economy continued to register strong growth in 2015, estimated at
7 percent. The highest growth rates were recorded in information and communication, public
administration, construction, finance and insurance, and transport and storage. Growth was
supported by strong export demand for manufactured products and tourism, ample credit to the
private sector, and the positive income shock from lower global oil prices. In 2016, real GDP is
projected to continue growing by about 7 percent. Growth would remain strong in the medium
term, supported by large infrastructure investments in energy and transportation under the new
five-year development plan (FYDP II).
2.
Inflation. Headline inflation remained at single digit throughout 2015, despite the
significant exchange rate depreciation in the first half of the year. This performance reflected the
tightening of monetary policy in May 2015 and was helped by the general decline in global
commodity prices, especially oil prices. Headline inflation averaged 5.6 percent in 2015 and
stood at 5.1 percent in April 2016. Core inflation was contained at around 3 percent during the
period. Inflation is expected to decrease further in the coming months and remain around the
medium term target of 5 percent, helped by continued tight monetary policy, subdued global oil
prices, improvement in domestic power and food supply, and stability of the Tanzanian shilling
against U.S. dollar.
External Sector Developments
3.
Balance of Payments. During the first half of 2015/16, the current account deficit
narrowed to about US$1.1 billion, compared to about US$2 billion recorded in the corresponding
period in 2014/15. The improvement reflected both an increase in exports of goods and services
(gold, manufactured goods, transportation, and tourism) and a decline in imports by 12.5 percent
(oil products, but also building and construction equipment and food products). The stock of
gross official reserves amounted to US$4.1 billion at end-December 2015. The current account is
expected to improve further as the momentum of manufactured exports and receipts from
tourism and transportation services continue, and the oil import bill remains low on the back of
subdued global oil prices and a decline in import volumes due to usage of natural gas in power
generation.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 47

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

Fiscal Performance and Financing in the First Half of 2015/16
4.
Fiscal deficit and financing. After a few months of under-performance ahead of the
elections, revenue collection picked up starting in December 2015, particularly excises and
income tax revenue. The recent developments reflected renewed efforts to fight tax evasion
and strengthening of tax administration. As a result, the fiscal outturn in the first half of
2015/16 was broadly in line with the program. In light of financing shortfalls, the execution of
discretionary expenditure was slowed, resulting in a cash deficit of 1.7 percent of GDP.
Expenditures arrears further accumulated during that period, by about 0.3 percent of GDP on a
net basis.
Monetary Policy
5.
Monetary policy stance and exchange rate developments. Growth of broader
monetary aggregates remained broadly within the program targets, with broad money supply
(M3) and credit to the private sector growing at about 19 percent and 25 percent, respectively,
for the year ending December 2015, and about 13 percent and 19 percent for the year ending
April 2016. The shilling exchange rate experienced high volatility in the last quarter of 2014/15
but stabilized subsequently reflecting the tightening of monetary policy among other factors.
Consistent with the objective of improving the conduct of monetary policy, the Bank has
increased its focus on the stability of banks’ free reserves, as manifested in the active use of
reverse repos to prop up liquidity among banks. This has, in turn been mirrored in the stability
of interbank cash market rate in the second half of 2015/16.
Financial Sector and Capital Account
6.
Financial sector stability. The banking sector has remained sound and stable with
levels of capital and liquidity above regulatory requirements. At the end of March 2016, the
ratio of core capital to total risk weighted assets and off-balance sheet exposures was
18.0 percent compared with the minimum legal requirement of 10 percent, while the ratio of
liquid assets to demand liabilities stood at 36.6 percent which was well above the minimum
regulatory limit of 20 percent. The quality of the banking sector’s assets deteriorated, as
reflected by the increase in the ratio of non-performing loans to gross loans (NPLs) to
8.3 percent from 6.7 percent recorded at the end of March 2015. The majority of banks
continue to have low NPLs, i.e., below 5 percent of gross loans. The category with the highest
level of NPLs was the agricultural loan sector, followed by trade sector. It remains the BoT’s
medium-term goal to bring the overall ratio to below the 5 percent level. In response to the
increase, the BoT has directed banks with high NPL levels to formulate and implement
measures to bring the ratio down, and for large banks in this group to report on a quarterly
basis to the central bank on their progress. In addition, banks have been encouraged to
increase their use of the existing credit reference system to reduce credit risks going forward.

48 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

7.
FBME Bank. The bank continues to offer limited services under statutory management
of the BoT. A final rule was issued by FinCEN on 25th March 2016, and will take effect on 29th
July 2016. Further, liquidation proceedings against the FBME Bank’s Cyprus branch are awaiting
court approval following withdrawal of its license in December 2015 by the Central Bank of
Cyprus. The BoT is finalizing a review of the current state of affairs of FBME Bank in light of
these developments with a view of taking appropriate course of action.
8.
Financial sector development. Credit reference bureaus are in operation and help
reduce information asymmetries between lenders and borrowers, thereby enabling banks to
allocate risk efficiently. In a bid to improve the financial sector, the Bank of Tanzania
strengthened its supervisory and regulatory role through issuance of new Social Security
Investment Guidelines of 2015, the Banking and Financial Institutions (Mortgage Finance)
Regulations, 2015, and the Foreign Exchange (Bureau de Change) Regulations, 2015. The legal
and regulatory framework for the National Payment Systems was enhanced by operationalizing
the National Payment Systems Act 2015 in October 2015 and its accompanying regulations Licensing and Approval Regulations 2015 and the Electronic Money Issuance Regulations 2015
(licensing of banks and non-banks and electronic money issuers). The new law and regulations
are aimed at closing regulatory gaps and strengthening the legal and regulatory framework,
while taking on board new developments in the sector.
9.
Capital account liberalization. Efforts are underway by the government to lift capital
account restrictions and enable participation of the rest of the world. The process of liberalizing
capital account transactions was initiated in 2015 by reviewing the relevant regulations and the
circular which restricted capital movements. These include the Foreign Exchange Regulations of
2014 and Foreign Exchange Circular of 1998. Draft Regulations which will permit capital and
financial account transactions with the rest of the world have been prepared and are currently
at an advanced stage of being approved. Draft regulations contain safeguards measures,
including prudential rules like minimum holding period for debt flows to ensure orderly
conditions in the market. Based on the experience from the partial capital account liberalization
to the countries of the East African Community, the new regulations are expected to impose
fewer restrictions, particularly with regard to the prescribed holding periods and limits on the
share any issuance of government debt that can be held by any category of non-resident. The
plan is to have the regulations published in the Government Gazette before end of June 2016.

B. Program Performance
10.
Quantitative targets and structural benchmarks. All assessment criteria and
quantitative targets for end-2015 were met. The structural benchmark on producing a new
medium-term debt management strategy was met and the document was published on the
Ministry of Finance and Planning website by end-2015. The technical work to merge the
statutory minimum reserve and clearing accounts of commercial banks with the BoT, as well as
the necessary changes to the IT system required for that purpose are well-advanced. This is an
important step towards implementation of the reserve averaging. The next step is to familiarize

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 49

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

banks with the new system before the accounts are merged and required reserve averaging is
implemented. The indicative target on average reserve money for end March 2016 was met.

THE ECONOMIC PROGRAM FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2015/16 AND FOR
2016/17
11.
MKUKUTA II implementation cycle ended in 2015/16, with its unfinished agenda
integrated into the FYDP II. There is encouraging progress in some of the indicators. Poverty
is becoming more responsive to economic growth, with the poverty rate declining by
6.4 percentage points between 2007 and 2012 (at 28.2 percent). The Human Development
Index (HDI) value for Tanzania improved to 0.521 (2014) from 0.466 (2011). Outcomes in health
and education improved though at low levels. In health outcomes, for instance, the infant
mortality rate declined to 43 deaths per 1000 live births in 2015 from 51 recorded in 2010; the
under-five mortality rate declined from 81 deaths per 1000 live births in 2010 to 67 deaths.
While the maternal mortality ratio is on the decline, it remains unacceptably still high, at 432
deaths per 100,000 live births recorded in 2012 down from 454 deaths in 2010. Access to
education at all levels is also improving, though quality remains a concern. On governance and
accountability performance targets, there have been improvements in the areas of public
finance management, access to justice, transparency, combating corruption, as well as wider
participation at local levels. Challenges remain in many aspects of access to quality social
services, nutrition and food, and income securities, as well as rural development including
access to affordable energy and roads. These concerns are integrated into the FYDP II agenda
as core elements of the transformation process.
12.
Economic development priorities. FYDP II, which will also be Tanzania’s third poverty
reduction strategy, is expected to be completed shortly and will start being implemented in
2016/17. It will focus on economic transformation through industrialization and human
development. On the latter, priority will be given to improving social services (education,
health, housing, water and sanitation), enhancing income security, and promoting social
protection. The industrialization strategy will rely on Tanzania’s comparative advantages,
particularly its agricultural and mining potential, its large labor force, and its geographic
location making it a natural trading and logistics hub for East Africa. The government will play a
facilitating role, for instance through the provision of critical infrastructure (e.g., the
rehabilitation of the central transportation corridor, the development of the ports of Dar es
Salaam and Kigoma, the creation of the new one in Bagamoyo, the provision of abundant and
affordable energy) and improving the business environment (including through special
economic zones). Costing of the plan, and its inclusion in a medium-term macroeconomic
framework closely related to the annual budget process, is still ongoing. It is expected,
however, that the financing of the plan will require creating fiscal space through higher
revenue mobilization and expenditure streamlining, to avoid excessive recourse to public debt.
The use of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) is also expected to implement some of the large
infrastructure projects.

A. Monetary, Exchange Rate, and Financial Sector Policies
13.
Monetary policy stance. The money multiplier has increased in recent years, possibly
on the back of financial innovations such as mobile money. It is projected to further increase,
leading to a relative decline in currency in circulation, replaced by access to the formal financial
system. Thus, M3 is projected to grow by 16 percent in the year ending June 2016, giving
significant room for growth of credit to the private sector. The Bank will continue pursuing a
prudent monetary policy during 2016/17 to keep inflation close to the 5 percent objective, with
average reserve money targeted to grow at 12.5 percent. M3 and private sector credit would
grow by about 15 percent.
14.
Modernizing the monetary policy framework. In an effort to improve the
functioning of the market and stability of interbank interest rates, the BoT will further enhance
information sharing with commercial banks to help them better manage liquidity. The BoT will
also review its collateral framework with a view to expanding the range of eligible collateral
needed to access the various central bank facilities by end-July 2016. The review will consider
steps that are needed to expand the range of eligible collateral from the current practice of
only accepting government securities with a remaining maturity of not more than 6 months.
The Lombard window will retain its role in providing emergency liquidity to banks against good
collateral at penalty rates. Steps will be taken towards making the Lombard rate more
predictable in order to enhance stability of the short-term interest rates. A study will be carried
out by end-September 2016 to determine an approach of setting the Lombard rate in a
manner that is consistent with the monetary policy stance while ensuring that the facility is not
abused (new structural benchmark). The BoT is taking initial steps towards using short-term
interest rate for implementation of monetary policy, which is in line with the ongoing initiatives
to harmonize monetary policy operations with other EAC member states. It is expected that
partial reserve averaging will be implemented by end-June 2016, which will further reduce the
volatility of the interbank interest rates.
15.
Exchange rate policy. Exchange rates will continue to be market determined, with the
BoT participating in the IFEM solely for liquidity management purposes and intervening
occasionally to smooth out excessive short-term volatility in the exchange rate. These
operations are undertaken while being mindful of ensuring international reserves remain
adequate.
16.
Financial sector development plans. Recognizing the importance of further financial
development in sustaining growth and promoting macroeconomic stability, the government
and the BoT are committed to addressing a number of gaps. Sustainable credit growth will
require improvements in a number of areas. Information to assess credit risks needs to be
made more reliable and widely available, which will contribute to better access to finance and
more efficient pricing of loans. The BoT will therefore continue to strengthen monitoring of
data submitted to the Credit Reference Databank with the aim of improving relevance and
reliability of information shared among lenders. To improve Small and Medium Enterprises’

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 51

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

(SME) access to finance, government is planning to review its SME policy, establish an SME
Access to Finance Framework, digitize all transactions of enterprises, explore financing
mechanism options for enterprises and establish collateral registration forSMEs. Meanwhile, an
internet-based information portal for SMEs was launched on 10th March 2016 to enhance
financial literacy and entrepreneurship skills among Micro and Small Medium Enterprises
(MSMEs) as well as improve access to financial services and markets. The information is
designed to be a one stop center for a wide range of information that small businesses require.
To improve access to finance, the government has initiated the drafting of microfinance
legislation that will ensure that the microfinance sector is adequately regulated and supervised.
The recent success in rolling out a mobile platform that allows users to participate in capital
market activities during a recent initial public offering was encouraging. A range of measures
will also be considered to foster the development of the government debt market, such as:
publishing a quarterly bond auction calendar including tenors (consistent with the overall
borrowing plan for the fiscal year); reopening bond series to provide the market with more
liquid instruments; and enhancing communication with market participants.
17.
Banking supervision framework. The BoT is drafting guidelines to ensure effective
implementation of Basel II/III requirements. Efforts are underway to review the existing
guidelines on corporate governance for banking institutions, business continuity management
in banking institutions, agent banking and physical security measures regulations. In addition,
plans are underway to develop guidelines on mergers and acquisitions as well as guidelines on
banking holding companies.

B. Fiscal Policies
Budget Implementation in 2015/16 and Budget Plans for 2016/17
18.
Budget implementation in 2015/16. The 2015/16 budget was revised in early 2016 to
make space for new expenditure priorities in the education sector, additional expenditures on
public infrastructure projects, and some expenditures carried over from 2014/15. In addition,
external financing shortfalls of about 1 percent of GDP require a downward revision to the
expenditure level and a reduction of the overall deficit target to about 3¼ percent of GDP. Tax
revenue projections in the revised framework are unchanged, in light of developments in the
first 9 months of the fiscal year. Expenditure savings come from delaying non-priority projects
and cutting goods and services spending. Parliament’s budget committee was informed in
April.
19.
Budget plans for 2016/17. The 2016/17 budget will be the first one reflecting fully the
new administration’s priorities, as laid out in FYDP II. It will strike a balance between raising
public investment to address various development needs and ensuring debt sustainability. The
budget thus assumes a higher deficit of around 4.5 percent of GDP. Given the multi-year
nature of the planned investments, the fiscal deficit is expected to remain elevated for a few
years, before gradually declining to about 3 percent of GDP in the medium term, which is
consistent with Tanzania’s commitments towards the East African Monetary Union and

52 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

maintaining a low risk of debt distress. Creating fiscal space for investment will require
ambitious but realistic revenue mobilization efforts. They will include a mix of tax policy and tax
administration measures (see below). In addition, nontax revenue is expected to increase
significantly: the annual contribution to the budget of 15 percent of revenue will be extended
to 10 more parastatals; in addition, following a careful analysis of their financial position, a
number of parastatals will make a one-off contribution to the budget on account of retained
earnings. Finally, efficiency gains are expected in the collection of various fees. The draft
budget is also built on a major shift in expenditure composition to increase the share
dedicated to investment. With regard to the latter, the government intends to scale up capital
expenditure to 48 percent of total expenditure compared to about 30 percent in 2015/16
budget. Consistent with our new MTDS, budget financing will increasingly rely on project
financing from multilateral development banks and export credit agencies, which is more
affordable than market terms. Prudent assumptions with regard to donor budget support have
been used, in light of the uncertainty in this area; significant amounts of donor project
financing are still expected, however. To reduce rollover risks, the government will aim at
lengthening the average maturity of domestic debt.
20.
Risks and contingency measures. The 2016/17 budget is built on the assumptions of
enhanced tax compliance as well as improved tax and non-tax policy. The Government is
confident that these measures will lead to much higher revenue mobilization. However,
consistent with its commitment to fiscal discipline, the Government intends to start some large
projects only after confirmation in the next mid-year budget review of adequate preparation
and availability of revenue. This will be the case, in particular, for the standard gauge railway for
the central corridor and the renovation of the Dar es Salaam port, whose combined budget
allocation in 2016/17 exceeds 1 percent of GDP. Similarly, projects for which external financing
has not been mobilized in the course of 2016/17 will be postponed. These measures will ensure
that the 2016/17 deficit does not exceed the budget target and limit the risk of expenditure
arrears.
Revenue Mobilization
21.
Tax policy reforms. Various analyses show that despite some improvements in recent
years, Tanzania’s tax revenue ratio remains relatively low, even when compared to other lowincome countries. As discussed earlier, significant improvements in revenue mobilization will
be critical to finance new investments and address the country’s development needs in a
sustainable way. Closing the revenue gap will require reforms in both tax policy and tax
administration. Efforts in the tax policy area have already started with implementation of the
new VAT law since July, 2015 which broadened the tax base by removing a number of
exemptions. However, more reform needs to be done in this area to bring VAT revenue yield
close to the regional average of about 4.5 percent of GDP in the medium term and more than
6.0 percent of GDP in the long term. The Government will prepare a tax policy strategy by end
December, 2016, which will among others, explore the scope to further removal of some VAT
exemptions, improvement of the VAT refund mechanism, streamlining a number of corporate
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 53

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

income tax holidays and exemptions, more regular indexation of specific excise duty rates by
the level of inflation, and modernization of mechanism for property taxation. The Government
will submit before the Parliament during the 2016/2017 Budget session a proposal to repeal
section 145 of the Income Tax Act Cap 332 and substitute it with new provisions that will deal
with taxation of extractive industry, including mining and petroleum taxation. The main issues,
among others, will be the introduction of ring-fencing clauses which will be applicable in the
extractive industry and the introduction of an additional profit tax for the industry.
22.
Tax administration reforms. The recent assessment using the Tax Administration
Diagnostic Assessment Tool (TADAT) identified a number of weaknesses, in particular in
voluntary tax compliance, the integrity of the taxpayer register, the IT system and its oversight,
the assessment and management of institutional risks, the processing of taxpayer accounting
transactions, audit case selection, the VAT refund process and its financing, and performance
monitoring practices. Our priority is to enhance TRA’s IT system to improve the integrity of the
taxpayer register, which is a precondition for more effective management of compliance. The
introduction of the new Tax Administration System (IDRAS) by end-October 2016 (new
structural benchmark) will improve the monitoring of timeliness of payments and taxpayer
account balances. Finally, risk management will be strengthened, with a focus on auditing
practices. Measures will also be taken to strengthen customs management, such as improving
the cargo control systems in the port of Dar es Salaam, reducing dwell times through effective
risk management, improving the transit management systems, and improving valuation and
classification practices.
Fiscal Aspects of Energy
23.
Power sector. Recent developments in the power generation mix are expected to have
a positive impact on TANESCO’s financial situation. Thanks to the replenishment of water
reservoirs in recent months and the completion of the gas pipeline and the Kinyerezi I power
station, most of the demand is currently met from gas-fired or hydro-electric generation units,
whose marginal production cost is below the average tariff. The government has also already
transferred this fiscal year close to TSh 200 billion to TANESCO to clear arrears on its electricity
bills. The government has also implemented a series of measures that have helped increase
TANESCO’s financial management and revenue collection including: installation of automatic
meter reading to big customers; curbing power ghost vendor machines by changing prepaid
meters coding; enforcing penalty and disconnection policy for non-paying customers; and
intensifying collection efficiency through increased use of prepaid meters (including for
government entities). TANESCO’s financial situation, however, remains difficult, and its arrears
to suppliers still stood at about US$300 million in April 2016. To address these arrears, the
government is considering engaging commercial banks that are willing and ready to pay
TANESCO’s creditors and convert the amount paid into a long-term loan. Due to TANESCO’s
limited creditworthiness, it is likely that those banks would require a government guarantee.

54 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

Fiscal Aspects of Pensions and Pension Reform.
24.
Arrears to pension funds. The Government has revisited its plan of issuance of noncash special bond for settlement of Pensions Funds debt by extending the timing for issuance.
The decision was made to allow the Internal Auditor General to conduct a thorough verification
of the total outstanding debts in order to ascertain their authenticity prior to the issuance of
the special bonds. The verification has started and the issuance of non-cash special bond is
expected by end-December 2016.
25.
Pension reform. The actuarial valuation exercise has been completed and discussions
with stakeholders on the needed parametric reforms and merging of pensions schemes are
ongoing. A special task force has been formed under the Prime Minister's Office to fast-track
the merging process.

C. Public Finance and Debt Management
Public finance and debt management
26.
Management of domestic expenditure arrears. As of end-December 2015, the stock
of verified and unverified expenditure arrears amounted to 2.1 percent of GDP. The settlement
of verified expenditure arrears (accumulated up to end-June 2014) has started. These arrears
will be fully settled by the end of the fiscal year. The verification of expenditure arrears
accumulated since June 2014 is well advanced in a few priority areas (e.g., ministry of works,
teachers’ remuneration). All arrears accumulated through end-2015 will have been verified by
end-June 2016, and their settlement will be implemented with the 2016/17 budget. The budget
for 2016/17 emphasizes the priority for accounting officers to clear existing arrears before
entering into new commitments. As an immediate priority, commitment and expenditure
control against the exchequer releases will be re-established in IFMIS by July 2016. A new
public awareness campaign will be launched by end-July 2016 to warn suppliers that orders
not generated through IFMIS will not be honored (new structural benchmark). The 2016/17
Budget Speech already made this point.
27.
Improving budget credibility and expenditure management. More realistic budgets
(both on the revenue and financing side) and tightening of commitment controls will be critical
to avoid arrears accumulation and reduce inefficient budget adjustments in the course of the
fiscal year. Expenditure and resource mobilization plans will be more closely aligned, with the
borrowing plan taking into account the seasonal pattern of revenue and the expected pace of
expenditure implementation. Predictability of cash releases has been a source of arrears
accumulation, as exchequers could be issued but not be paid due to unanticipated shortage of
resources. An expert has been hired to enhance IFMIS with a contract management module
that will enable to track multi-year commitments over the life cycle of the budget. This will
ensure proper budgeting of the required resources, and further improve the integration of the
medium-term expenditure framework into the annual budget process.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 55

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

28.
Public debt management. The approval of the National Debt Management Policy
and proposed amendments to the Government Loans, Guarantees and Grants Act Cap. 134
were deferred to incorporate changes in the structure of the Ministry of Finance and Planning.
Under the new structure the responsibilities of debt management rest with the Ministry of
Finance and Planning. The structure of debt management has remained the same and there are
no new responsibilities which have been transferred to the Bank of Tanzania. The Bank of
Tanzania remains as an Agent of the Government responsible for issuance of Government
Securities. The Policy and Act were prepared with a view to strengthening management of
public debt, including providing the legal underpinning for a new debt management
department to effectively discharge its responsibilities. The approval of the Policy and Act by
Cabinet are now expected by end-July 2016.
Monitoring and Management of the Public Sector
29.
The Office of the Treasury Registrar (OTR) will continue preparing and publishing
information on each Public Institution and Statutory Corporation’s (PISC) revenues,
expenditures, profits and losses. An information system is being put in place, which will
facilitate quarterly financial reporting by PISCs and consolidation and analysis of that
information by OTR. The system is expected to be operational in the coming months, with a
first quarterly report by OTR by end-September 2016 (new structural benchmark). In the
meantime, PISCs have been directed to open revenue accounts with the BoT, to facilitate
monitoring of their operations by OTR. An operating expenditure ceiling of 60 percent of
annual gross revenue applies to PISCs that are not receiving Government transfers. For those
receiving Government transfers, scrutiny of their budgets will continue. OTR is entering into
Performance Contracts with each PISC’s Chief Executive Officers and Board Chairpersons.
Capacity will continue to be built at OTR to perform all this functions.

D. Other Reforms
30.
Improving the business environment in support of economic diversification.
Establishing a conducive business environment and investment climate for the private sector to
participate competitively and efficiently in economic development has been one of the
Government’s key agendas. In this regard, the FYDP II underscores the importance of an
enabling environment for the establishment and operation of enterprises and set targets that
are to be achieved in the next five years. The planned targets and interventions include a
reduction in the cost of doing business through legal and regulatory reform, easing
registration and license requirements in order to promote both domestic and foreign investors,
enforcing property rights and legal instruments, and availability of reliable and affordable
energy.
31.
Improving governance. The Government of Tanzania recognizes corruption as a
serious problem affecting social economic development of the country and therefore a number
of initiatives have been taken to deal with this problem. They include the establishment of a
National Anti-Corruption Strategy (NACSAP), which focuses on building systems of integrity,

56 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

accountability and transparency in public institutions. The strategy provides the framework
within which public entities are required to initiate concrete measures to address corruption in
their areas of jurisdiction. Currently, the Government is preparing NACSAP III which has been
designed to strengthen coordination, monitoring and evaluation, devise strong ethics
promotion and to have a wider stakeholders’ participation in the fight against corruption. The
NACSAP will benefit from initiatives underway to enhance discipline in the public service and
step up the fight against corruption, including the establishment Corruption and Economic
Crimes Division of the High Court.
32.

Developing the energy sector. Further commissioning of gas-fired units in the

coming years will ensure a sustained reduction of power generation costs. The resolution of
TANESCO’s arrears and the overall improvement in its financial situation will make it a more
credible interlocutor for independent power producers, which will be required to develop
production capacity, and on-shore gas providers. This will facilitate the development of onshore gas resources, which are significant and could play a critical role in the development of
energy-intensive industries. The government has resumed discussions with international
companies involved in off-shore gas exploration, with a view to providing the conditions
allowing them to reach an investment decision.
33.

Fostering regional integration. Work is ongoing to implement the single customs

territory, with a focus on facilitating trade along the central corridor. Customs systems have
been connected, and customs officials from other EAC partner states are already present at the
port of Dar es Salaam and able to clear certain goods destined to their countries. Significant
progress has been made to reduce non-trade barriers, and efforts in this area will continue. An
assessment of the experience with the first phase of implementation of the common market is
currently undertaken at the EAC level; its conclusions will inform the next integration phase.
Tanzania remains committed to the full implementation of the common market, which is
consistent with the objective of making the country a trade and logistics hub for East Africa.
Work to harmonize a number of policies and data is also ongoing in the context of the
convergence towards EAMU.
34.

Improving Statistics. The Government will continue its efforts to improve data quality

and dissemination to facilitate economic analysis and policy making. Substantial progress has
been made in improving statistics over the past few years, including rebasing their benchmark
years and expanding coverage, with assistance from the IMF and donor partners. The
Government will soon participate in the Enhanced General Data Dissemination Standard (eGDDS) initiative to further enhance data dissemination practices. Fiscal data will continue to be
improved, including expanding coverage to general government, and moving to GFSM2001/14
standards. The NBS will continue to improve the national accounts data, including deflators,
and plan to release expenditure components of quarterly GDP later in 2016.

PROGRAM MONITORING
35.
Assessment criteria for end-December 2016, and indicative targets for end-September
2016, end-March 2017, and end-June 2017 are set as per Table 1. It is proposed to reschedule
to end-December 2016 the two missed structural benchmarks on the clearance of arrears to
pension funds, to allow for a new verification of claims by the Internal Auditor General. It is also
proposed to modify the assessment criteria for NIR and the overall fiscal deficit for end-June
2016, to reflect the large expected shortfall in external financing. The fifth and sixth reviews
under the PSI are expected to take place by December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2017,
respectively, on the basis of the assessment criteria and structural benchmarks indicated in
Tables 1 and 2, attached.

cleared during each fiscal year. The cumulative upward adjustment to the limits on the deficits in 2015/16 and 2016/17 will be capped by the total amount of arrears and loans that are recognized in the strategy to clear arrears to pension funds. The deficit
will be increased by any shortfalls in foreign program grants up to a cumulative ceiling of equivalent to US$200 million calculated at the program exchange rate.

Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding on
Selected Concepts and Definitions Used in the Monitoring of
the Program Supported by the PSI
June 28, 2016
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The purpose of this Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) is to describe
concepts and definitions that are being used in the monitoring of Tanzania’s program
supported by the PSI, comprising the quantitative assessment criteria, the indicative targets
and structural benchmarks monitored under the PSI.
2.
The principal data sources are the standardized reporting forms, 1SR and 2SR, as
provided by the Bank of Tanzania (BoT) to the IMF, and the government debt tables provided
by the Accountant General’s office.
3.

The program exchange rate is TSh/USD 2,179.60.

II. DEFINITIONS
Net international reserves
4.
Net international reserves (NIR) of the BoT are defined as reserve assets of the BoT
minus reserve liabilities of the BoT. The change in NIR is calculated as the cumulative change
since the beginning of the fiscal year. The BoT’s reserve assets, as defined in the IMF BOP
manual (5th edition) and elaborated in the reserve template of the IMF’s special data
dissemination standards (SDDS), include: (i) monetary gold; (ii) holdings of SDRs; (iii) the
reserve position at the IMF; (iv) all holdings of foreign exchange; and (v) other liquid and
marketable assets readily available to the monetary authorities. Reserve assets exclude assets
pledged or otherwise encumbered, including but not limited to assets acquired through shortterm currency swaps (maturing in less than one year) and other assets used as collateral or as
guarantee for a third party external liability (assets not readily available). The BoT’s reserve
liabilities include: (i) all foreign exchange liabilities except government’s foreign currency
deposits of residual maturities more than one year; and (ii) outstanding purchases and loans
from the IMF, as recorded in the financial position of Tanzania with the IMF by the Finance
Department of the Fund.
5.
NIR are monitored in U.S. dollars, and for program monitoring purposes assets and
liabilities in currencies other than U.S. dollars shall be converted into dollar equivalent values
using the exchange rates as of March 31, 2016 (as recorded in the balance sheet of the BoT).

Reserve money and reserve money band
6.
Reserve money is defined as the sum of currency issued by the BoT and the deposits of
Other Depository Corporations (ODCs) with the BoT. The reserve money targets are the
projected daily averages of March, June, September, and December within a symmetrical one
percent band. The upper bound of the band for June and December serves as the assessment
criterion and that for March and September, the indicative target.
Fiscal cash deficit of the Government of Tanzania
7.
The fiscal cash deficit of the Government (central and local governments only) will be
measured on a cash basis from the financing side at the current exchange rates. The deficit is
defined as the sum of: (i) net domestic financing (NDF) of the Government; (ii) net external
financing and (iii) privatization receipts. Any amounts in foreign currency will be converted into
Tanzanian shillings at the exchange rates as of the dates of the transactions.
i. NDF is calculated as the cumulative change since the beginning of the fiscal year in the
sum of:
a. loans and advances to the government by the BoT and holdings of government
securities and promissory notes (including liquidity paper issued for monetary policy
purposes), minus all government deposits with the BoT, which comprise government
deposits as reported in the BoT balance sheet, 1SR (including counterpart deposits in
the BoT of liquidity paper issued for monetary policy purposes) and foreign currencydenominated government deposits at the BoT (including the PRBS accounts and the
foreign currency deposit account).
b. all BoT accounts receivable due from the Government of Tanzania that are not
included under (i) above;

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 63

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

c.

loans and advances to the government by other domestic depository corporations
and holdings of government securities and promissory notes, minus all government
deposits held with other domestic depository corporations;

d. loans and advances to the government, and holdings of government securities and
promissory notes by other public entities (e.g. pension funds) not covered by the
central government accounts; and
e. the outstanding stock of domestic debt held outside domestic depository
corporations and other public entities, excluding: government debt issued for the
recapitalization of the NMB and TIB; debt swaps with COBELMO (Russia) and the
government of Bulgaria; mortgage on acquired sisal estates; compensation claims;
and debt of parastatal companies assumed by the government.
f.

NDF will be measured net of any accumulation of central government claims on the
Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC) as a result of the on-lending of
an external credit to finance a gas pipeline.

ii. Net external financing is measured on a cumulative basis from the beginning of the fiscal
year and is defined as the sum of disbursements minus amortization of budget support
loans, project loans, external non-concessional borrowing (ENCB) including project ENCB
directly disbursed to project implementers; and any other forms of Government external
debt. The term “external debt” will have the meaning set forth in Point 9 of the Guidelines
on Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt (Executive Board’s Decision
No. 6230-(79/140), as amended by Decision No. 14416-(09/91), effective December 1,
2009). Government external debt is understood to mean a direct, i.e. not contingent,
liability to non-residents of the Government of Tanzania.
iii. Privatization receipts consist of net proceeds to the Government of Tanzania in
connection with the sale/purchase of financial assets that are not included in NDF and the
sale of intangible nonfinancial assets, such as leases and the sale of licenses with duration
of 10 years or longer. For the 2015/16 budget, privatization proceeds will exclude TSh 212
billion from the sale of shares in Tanzania Breweries Limited and Tanzania Cigarette
Company, which were included in non-tax revenue projections.
Domestic expenditure arrears
8.
Domestic expenditure arrears are defined as unpaid claims that are overdue by more
than 30 days for goods and services and more than 90 days for contract works as set out in the
government’s Circular No 9 of 8th December 2014. These will include payments for tax refunds,
employee expenses (wages and salaries, staff claims for travel, transfer and other non-salary
allowances), utilities, rents, recurrent goods and services, and construction works. Accumulation
of domestic expenditure arrears is calculated as a cumulative change in the stock of
expenditure arrears at the end of each quarter from the stock at the end of the previous fiscal
year (June 30).

64 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

External payment arrears
9.
External payment arrears consist of the total amount of external debt service
obligations (interest and principal) of the government and the BoT that have not been paid at
the time they are due, excluding arrears on external debt service obligations pending the
conclusion of debt-rescheduling arrangements and arrears previously accumulated and
reported to the Executive Board. The ceiling on external payment arrears is continuous and
applies throughout the year.
Priority social spending
10.
Priority social spending comprises spending on agricultural inputs, and central
government transfers to local governments for health and education.
Tax revenues
11.
Tax revenues include import duties, value-added tax, excises, income tax, and other
taxes.
Arrears to pension funds
12.
Arrears to pension funds include government obligations to the Public Service Pension
Fund (PSPF) on pre-1999 reform pension benefits paid on government’s behalf and overdue
payments on loans made by pension funds to public entities.
Foreign program assistance
13.
Foreign program assistance is defined as budget support and basket grants and loans
received by the Ministry of Finance and Planning (MoFP) through BoT accounts and accounts
at other depository corporations and is calculated as the cumulative sum, since the beginning
of the fiscal year, of the receipts from (i) program loans and (ii) program grants. Program
assistance does not include nonconcessional external debt.

III. ADJUSTERS
Net international reserves
14.
The end-of-quarter quantitative targets for the change in the BoT’s net international
reserves will be adjusted downward by the amount in U.S. dollars of any shortfalls in (a) foreign
program assistance and (b) external nonconcessional borrowing (ENCB) financing of the
government budget, up to a limit of US$300 million.
15.
The shortfalls will be calculated relative to projections for foreign program assistance
shown in the table attached to the applicable Letter of Intent and Memorandum of Economic
and Financial Polices of the Government of Tanzania titled “Quantitative Assessment Criteria,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 65

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

and Indicative Targets under the Policy Support Instrument”. For purposes of the adjuster,
ENCB is measured excluding any non-concessional financing contracted for the gas pipeline.
Fiscal cash deficit
16.
The end-of-quarter limits in 2015/16 and 2016/17 will be adjusted upward by the
amount of arrears to PSPF on account of the 1999 reform cleared from the beginning of each
fiscal year and the amount of loans in arrears made by pension funds to government entities
and cleared by the government from the beginning of each fiscal year. The cumulative upward
adjustment to the limits on the deficits in 2015/16 and 2016/17 will be capped by the total
amount of arrears and loans that are recognized and taken over by the authorities at the end
of the verification and reconciliation process.
17.
The end-of-quarter limits will be increased by any shortfalls in foreign program grants
up to a cumulative ceiling of equivalent to US$200 million calculated at the program exchange
rate (para 3).
18.
The foreign program grant shortfalls will be calculated relative to projections for
foreign grants shown in the table attached to the applicable Letter of Intent and Memorandum
of Economic and Financial Polices of the Government of Tanzania titled “Quantitative
Assessment Criteria, and Indicative Targets under the Policy Support Instrument”.

Safeguards Assessments:
An update safeguards assessment of the Bank of Tanzania (BoT) was finalized in November 2012.
Previous assessments were completed in December 2003, August 2008, and November 2009.
The 2012 update assessment found a strengthened governance and safeguards framework at the
BoT. Its Audit Committee continued to provide an active oversight of the audit, financial reporting,
and control systems. The financial statements are prepared and audited in accordance with
international standards. While the BoT has implemented most of the recommendations, progress in
establishing a modern internal audit function has been slow.
Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The currency of Tanzania is the Tanzania shilling. Tanzania’s de jure exchange rate arrangement is
free floating and its de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The official
exchange rate is determined in relation to the rate established in the interbank market for foreign
exchange. The weighted average rate in the interbank market was TSh 2,193.43 per U.S. dollar as of
June 7, 2016. The exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers
for current international transactions.
Tanzania accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF Articles of
Agreement with effect from July 15, 1996.

The Executive Board concluded the last Article IV consultation on April 25, 2014 (Country Report

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As at May 31, 2016)
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance and program monitoring. The authorities – led by the
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) for the mainland and the Office of the Chief General Statistician (OCGS)
for Zanzibar – have articulated a 5-year strategy under the Tanzania Statistical Master Plan. The Plan—a
multipronged approach to improve collection and dissemination of statistics—is operationalized through a
series of Annual Work Plans. The authorities will be focusing on carrying forward a number of ongoing
initiatives, including ongoing efforts to update the legal framework governing statistical collection in
Tanzania; improving the quality of national accounts data, especially from Zanzibar; rebasing the producer
price index; and improving indicators of industrial production.
National Accounts: National accounts statistics for mainland Tanzania are prepared by the NBS. Separate
accounts are compiled for Zanzibar by the OCGS. The data sources for estimating national accounts by
expenditure category and the indicators used to extrapolate benchmark production levels suffer from
deficiencies that complicate estimation of saving-investment. The accounts are based on the 1993 System of
National Accounts (1993 SNA) and are published at current and constant (2007) prices.
Price Statistics: The NBS compiles a monthly consumer price index (CPI) for mainland Tanzania based on
consumer expenditure in 21 urban centers. A separate price index is compiled for Zanzibar. An updated CPI
with weights based on the 2011/12 HBS was released in February 2016. While the CPI basket has become
more comprehensive, the geographical coverage of the index remains fairly narrow, focused on urban
centers, whereas bulk of population live in rural areas. The producer price index (PPI) is compiled monthly
and published quarterly and draws from surveys of business establishments with over 50 workers, with the
basket based on the results of the 1999 Annual Survey of Industrial Production (ASIP). The NBS plans to
improve and update the PPI, including by providing data for 2000-2006 and moving from the ISIC Rev. 2
classification to the newer ISIC Rev. 3.1. One key concern is the representativeness of the basket as it is
based on a very old vintage of the ASIP.
Government Finance Statistics: The authorities provide Fund missions with monthly budgetary data on
central government revenue, expenditure, and financing on a timely basis. Although the underlying concepts
broadly follow the Government Finance Statistics Manual 1986, the reporting differs from international
standards in coverage and the treatment of lending minus repayments, and transfer payments. Coverage of
data on the budgetary operations of the central government refers to Tanzania mainland only –the Ministry
of Finance of Zanzibar established a unit tasked with developing a fiscal reporting framework for Zanzibar.
Data for general government are not available as no information is provided on the financial position of
extra-budgetary funds and local governments, although the authorities have stated their intention to
produce such reports over time.
Despite improvements in the recording of government transactions, discrepancies remain between data on
government operations and financing. These discrepancies are related to the lack of a fully integrated set of
accounts and inconsistencies in the delineation of the general government and its sub-sectors, differing
source data, and timing differences. In addition, there appear to be gaps in the IFMIS that allow exchequers

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

to be issued for work without corresponding entries in the Accountant General’s system, leading to arrears.
This primarily affects multi-year development projects, including in road construction.
The Ministry of Finance created a database of donor-funded projects in FY2001/02, the Aid Management
Platform (AMP) with donor assistance. Since then, the number of foreign-financed projects reported by and
channeled through the budget has increased significantly. The integrity of AMP data can be affected by late
entry of data by major donors, which gives rise to discrepancies.
The government has completed the computerization of its accounting system for budgetary units. The
authorities resumed reporting in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY); a relative consistent
time series of data has been reported for 2006-2014 for inclusion in the 2015 GFSY.
Monetary Statistics: The monetary statistics are broadly adequate for policy and analytical purposes. In
addition to monthly compilation of the Standard Report Forms (SRFs), which the BoT shares with the Fund,
the authorities have also been sharing daily developments in reserve money through the program period.
Key improvements going forward would be to complement the SRFs with more timely compilation of
statistics for non-banks and Islamic banking. The authorities have been publishing quarterly data on financial
stability, though with a lag, coinciding with the publication of the Financial Stability Report. These data are
made available on a more timely basis to Fund staff.
Balance of Payments: The BoP data, compiled by the Bank of Tanzania, are broadly adequate for
surveillance. Data for merchandise exports and imports are recorded on the basis of Customs returns and
supplemented by data from mining companies and crop boards. For services transactions, the chief data
sources are the financial records of depository corporations and foreign exchange bureaus, supplemented
with information on merchandise trade (freight and insurance), revenue data from the TRA (other insurance),
and other international service providers. Data on travel receipts are obtained from International Visitors’ Exit
Surveys. Current transfers, capital transfers and official financial flows are provided by donors and the
Ministry of Finance. Data for direct investment income are estimated based on information obtained from
the Private Capital Flow Survey (PSFS). East AFRITAC has provided assistance in international investment
position statistics, and developing price and volume indices for international trade. In 2015, a DFID project
was launched aiming to harmonize external sector statistics of five EAC countries over the medium term
focusing on goods, services, and reserves components.

CONSULTATION, AND FOURTH REVIEW UNDER THE
POLICY SUPPORT INSTRUMENT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
ANALYSIS
Approved By
Roger Nord and Catherine Pattillo
(IMF) and John Panzer (IDA)

Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary
Fund and the International Development Association

Risk of external debt distress:

Low

Augmented by significant risks stemming from
domestic public and/or private external debt?

No

The Debt Sustainability Analysis1 (DSA) indicates that Tanzania’s risk of debt distress is low.
Under the baseline scenario, which assumes a scaling up of infrastructure investment, all
external debt burden indicators are projected to remain below the policy-dependent thresholds.
The public debt outlook also remains favorable. However, stress tests highlight vulnerabilities to
exchange rate depreciation and lack of fiscal consolidation. These results highlight the need for
Tanzania to continue implementing a prudent fiscal policy, with an overall deficit of about
3 percent of GDP remaining a good long-term fiscal anchor. An appropriate financing mix is
also required. The increasing recourse to nonconcessional borrowing needs to be gradual and
accompanied by strengthened debt management capacity and sustained reforms to public
financial and investment management to preserve debt sustainability.

This full Debt Sustainability Analysis replaces the previous update prepared in June 2015 in the context of the
second PSI Review (IMF Country Report No. 15/181). The updated three-year average Country Policy and
Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rating for 2012-2014 is 3.76 and now breaches the 3.75 boundary for a strong
policy performer. However, narrow breaches less than 0.05 require two consecutive years of breach to qualify for
an upgrade in the policy performance category. Therefore, as in the June 2015 assessment this DSA uses the
policy-dependent thresholds for medium policy performers.

BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
The accumulation of new external public debt has been gradual but steady since debt
relief was provided under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative. Total public sector debt
(external plus domestic public debt) gradually increased from about 20 percent of GDP in 2007/08 to
an estimated 37.5 percent of GDP in 2015/16 (Text Figure 1). Most of the increase is due to public
and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt.
Text Figure 1. Tanzania Public Debt, 2004/05-2015/16
(Percent of GDP)

Sources: Ministry of Finance and Planning, Bank of Tanzania, and IMF staff calculations.

2.
While Tanzania’s PPG external debt is mostly concessional, borrowing on nonconcessional terms has increased recently, partly due to the decline in aid from development
partners. At end-2014/15, more than two-thirds of public external debt was owed to multilateral
institutions, primarily the International Development Association (IDA) and the African Development
Bank (AfDB). Government borrowing from commercial sources amounted to about 30 percent of the
public external debt stock at end-2014/15, against about 2 percent at end-2009/10.
3.
Domestic public debt totaled 8 percent of GDP at tend-June 2015. Domestic debt
remains dominated by medium and long-term instruments, with Treasury bonds accounting for over
50 percent of total domestic debt and an average maturity of 7 years. Commercial banks continued
to hold the largest share of government domestic debt.
4.
The coverage of public debt in this DSA is restricted to central government
obligations owing to data availability. Local government debt and public enterprise debt are not
captured due to lack of reliable and timely data. However, since these entities are often unable to
borrow externally without a guarantee from the central government, public debt data captures
partially their debt exposure. To get a comprehensive picture of government domestic debt, several
2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

outstanding government liabilities and other contingent liabilities2 currently not accounted for in the
debt stock are added to the first year of projection (2015/16). These are estimated at 7.6 percent of
GDP and mainly include arrears to pension funds and loans to government entities, budget
expenditure arrears, TANESCO’s arrears to its suppliers, and other actual or contingent liabilities.

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
5.
To address the country’s infrastructure gap, the authorities have formulated a new
Five-Year Development Plan (FYDP II) with large investment in a number of areas, including
hydropower plants, roads, a standard gauge railway, the Dar es Salaam Port, and the water and
transportation systems. While a significant share of this investment would be on budget, the
authorities also intend to resort to public-private partnerships (PPPs) to limit government borrowing
and risks to debt sustainability.
6.
The current DSA3 assumes an increase in the fiscal deficit over the medium-term on
account of public investment scaling up followed by gradual fiscal consolidation to maintain
debt sustainability. The baseline scenario assumes implementation of the authorities’ economic and
development agenda. In the absence of a detailed quantitative macroeconomic framework for the
FYDP II at the time of discussions, staff explored the sustainability of a plausible medium-term
investment scaling up scenario. Accordingly, the deficit is projected to increase to 4.6 percent of GDP
in 2016/17 and remain at about 4.5 percent of GDP over the medium-term, before returning to
slightly below 3 percent of GDP by 2022/23 consistent with regional commitments to converge
toward the East African Monetary Union (EAMU) protocol. Domestic revenues are projected to
increase in 2016/17 on account of expected gains from tax administration and policy measures and
nontax revenue owing to higher contributions of parastatals to the budget (including a large one-off
transfer on account of retained earnings) and higher efficiency in the collection of various fees.
The revenue ratio is projected to further increase gradually over the medium-term, reflecting
additional revenue mobilization efforts. Public investment would almost double in percent of GDP to
about 9½ percent of GDP in 2016/17 and would remain high for a few years.

2

Government guaranteed debt is included in total public debt stock.

The baseline macroeconomic framework underlying the current DSA does not yet factor in the potential impact of
possible future natural gas production from emerging offshore projects. Deep water exploration by major petroleum
companies has confirmed large natural gas deposits but final investment decisions to construct natural gas terminals
are still pending. Thereafter, the development phase would start, and it would take several additional years before
commercial production and exports of LNG could begin.

7.

The other main macroeconomic assumptions are:



Growth is projected to remain strong in the next few years (about 7 percent), reflecting the
scaling up of public investment, mainly in transportation and energy infrastructure. Over the
medium term, growth is assumed to revert to its 15-year average of about 6.5 percent; the
agriculture sector will remain important, and continued economic transformation through
industrialization, human development, and an improved business climate is expected to
support economic growth in the long-run.



Inflation is projected at about 5 percent consistent with the authorities’ inflation target and
assuming a tight monetary stance over the medium-term.



The current account deficit is expected to widen to 9.1 percent of GDP in 2016/17 and remain
high at an average of 8½ percent of GDP over the medium-term, reflecting high
development and infrastructure needs which will continue to lead to large investment-related
imports and current account deficits.



Aid and FDI flows. External grants and concessional loans are assumed to gradually decrease
as a share of GDP consistent with the declining aid trends from development partners. FDI is
assumed to partly finance some of the envisaged investment scaling up. Therefore, FDI
inflows are expected to remain high at over 4 percent of GDP over the medium-term and
then to stabilize at about 4 percent of GDP in the long-term.



External nonconcessional borrowing. In line with its medium-term debt management strategy
and ongoing discussions with creditors, Tanzania would rely more than assumed in the
previous DSA on borrowing from the regular windows of the World Bank and African

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA

Development Bank (whose terms remain much more favorable than available on
international markets) and on domestic borrowing.4 More than 50 percent of the external
financing in the long term would come from nonconcessional sources (see Text Figure 2).
Text Figure 2. Foreign Financing Assumptions

Sources: Ministry of Finance and Planning, Bank of Tanzania and IMF staff calculations.



Domestic borrowing. Net domestic borrowing would be maintained at moderate levels (about
1 percent of GDP) throughout the projection period. Real interest rate on new domestic debt
would be lower than current levels, but would remain relatively high while the average
maturity on domestic debt is assumed to be about seven years.

EXTERNAL DSA
8.
All external debt burden indicators remain below indicative thresholds in the baseline
scenario; however, under the most extreme stress test the external debt service-to-revenue
ratio slightly breaches its threshold. The three debt stock indicators (relative to GDP, exports and
revenue) all increase slightly in the medium-term before declining below initial levels by the end of
the projection period, and remain well below their policy-dependent thresholds under the baseline
and all shock scenarios. The debt service-to-revenue ratio, however, increases over the medium-term
and remains slightly above initial levels at the end of the projection period. Under the most extreme
stress test, external debt service as a ratio to revenue slightly breaches its threshold in 2020–23 in the
event of a one-time 30 percent depreciation in the nominal exchange rate. In such a borderline case
the probability approach is applied to assess the risk of debt distress.5 The results show that under
this approach, Tanzania’s risk of debt distress remains low for all external debt indicators.

4 Discussions with these two multilateral creditors are well advanced, and significant project financing was already
contracted from the African Development Bank and will start disbursing in 2016/17.
5 The probability approach is applied to a borderline case, which is defined as one where the largest breach or near
breach falls within a 10-percent band around the threshold. It incorporates a country’s individual CPIA score and
average GDP growth rate, whereas the traditional approach uses one of the three discrete CPIA values (3.25 for weak
performers, 3.50 for medium performers, and 3.75 for strong performers), and an average growth rate across LICs (for

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9.
A customized scenario assuming lower growth suggests limited additional debt
sustainability risks compared to the baseline scenario (Figure 2). The customized alternative
scenario assuming GDP growth of 5 percent, compared to 6.5 percent in the baseline, leads to higher
external debt burden indicators, but none of them breaches its threshold.

PUBLIC DSA
10.
Public debt and debt service ratios also suggest a low level of vulnerability. In the
baseline scenario, the PV of total public debt as a share of GDP is expected to increase modestly in
the next few years (to a peak of 34 percent of GDP in 2019) and then to decline gradually over time.
It would therefore remain well below the DSF benchmark level of 56 percent of GDP associated with
heightened public debt vulnerabilities for medium performers, and the EAMU convergence criterion
of 50 percent.
11.
Stress tests confirm the importance of continued prudent fiscal policy. Under the
historical scenario, the PV of public debt would keep gradually growing and breach the EAMU
convergence criterion of 50 percent of PV of debt-to-GDP ratio in 2033/34. The debt service to
revenue ratio would also reach much higher levels. The most extreme shock corresponds to a
10 percent of GDP increase in debt-creating flows in 2016. It highlights the sensitivity of debt
dynamics to contingent liabilities, a useful reminder in a context where the authorities plan to utilize
PPPs for large infrastructure projects. The simulations also suggest that an overall deficit of about
3 percent of GDP remains an appropriate long-term fiscal anchor for Tanzania to safeguard the low
risk of debt distress.

CONCLUSION
12.
Tanzania’s risk of external debt distress remains low with a baseline scenario assuming a
prudent scaling up of public investment and temporarily higher fiscal deficits than in the previous
DSA. However, creating fiscal space for higher infrastructure investment will necessitate sustained
efforts to raise additional domestic revenue and streamline current expenditure, to avoid excessive
recourse to debt. Reforms to increase spending efficiency, particularly in the area of public
investment and enhancing debt management capacity, will also be needed. More broadly, the
targeted high growth and structural transformation of the Tanzanian economy will require sustained
efforts to tackle structural reforms.
13.
Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed with the main results of the DSA, while stressing
the need to find the right balance between continued fiscal prudence and addressing Tanzania’s
large development needs guided by the FYDP II. The authorities’ own DSA (conducted in 2015)
points to the importance of improving domestic revenue collection and strengthening debt
management capacity to address new risks emanating from increased rollover of maturing domestic
debt, and financing public investment through external nonconcessional borrowing.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Statement by Ms. Kapwepwe, Executive Director for
United Republic of Tanzania
and
Mr. Odonye, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
July, 18, 2016
Introduction
The Tanzanian authorities appreciate the constructive engagement and quality policy advice
that they have received from the Fund, which has helped maintain overall macroeconomic
stability over the years. The economy has improved remarkably, benefiting from marketoriented reforms and prudent macroeconomic policies, which have helped support economic
diversification and boost growth. To anchor these achievements, the authorities have
developed a medium-term development program, defined by the second Five-Year
Development (FYDP II) Plan, whose formulation is expected to be completed shortly. The
plan focuses on creating a better environment for business and job creation through improved
infrastructure, access to finance and land, and education and skills development.
Our authorities broadly agree with the staff assessment and policy proposals, and request the
Executive Board’s support in completing the Fourth Review Under the Policy Support
Instrument (PSI) and in concluding the 2016 Article IV Consultation.
Macroeconomic Developments and Prospects
Growth remained robust in 2015, at around 7 percent, buoyed by construction, services,
manufacturing, and a more diversified economy. Inflation averaged 5.6 percent in 2015 and
was within single digits throughout 2015, reflecting tight monetary policy. The external
position strengthened, with a narrowing of the current account deficit, reflecting increased
exports of goods and services, notably gold, manufactured goods, transportation, and
tourism; and the positive shock from lower oil prices.
Going forward, growth is projected to remain unchanged at about 7 percent in 2016 and the
medium term, predicated on sustained high levels of public investment. Inflation is expected
to remain around 5 percent. The external current account deficit, projected at around
9 percent of GDP in 2016/17 is expected to further narrow in the medium-term, when the
Five- Year Development Plan (FYDP II) begins to yield benefits. Progress on governance
continues with the new administration’s clear signal of commitment to deliver on sound
public policies and governance.

Program Performance
The authorities continue to demonstrate their commitment to successful implementation of
the PSI program. All the assessment criteria (ACs) and indicative targets for end-2015 and
end-March 2016, except for the accumulation of domestic arrears, were met. While the
implementation of structural benchmarks slowed temporarily, as the country transitioned to a
new administration, significant progress was made in some areas, demonstrating the
authorities’ commitment to structural reforms. In particular, the structural benchmark on
producing a new medium-term debt management strategy was met and the document was
published by end-2015. In addition, the technical work to merge the statutory minimum
reserve and clearing accounts of commercial banks with the Bank of Tanzania (BoT), as well
as work on the necessary changes to the IT system, is well-advanced. Given the sound
progress, our authorities request that the Board approves the completion of the fourth PSI
review.
Medium Term Macroeconomic Policies
a) Growth-Oriented Fiscal Policy
The Tanzanian authorities remain committed to fiscal and debt sustainability as they support
growth and poverty alleviation. The draft 2016/17 budget has targeted a deficit of about
4.5 percent of GDP predicated on a large increase in public investment and domestic
revenue. The authorities are confident that the budget can be adequately resourced, so as to
avoid expenditure arrears.
To improve on revenue mobilization, the authorities will implement various tax policy and
administration reforms. In this regard, they are optimistic that enhanced policies and tax
compliance will boost additional revenues. Several tax administration measures are already
underway, in the context of the recent Tax Administration Diagnostic Assessment and the
rollout of Electronic Fiscal Devices. These measures are expected to significantly improve
tax compliance and therefore help combat tax evasion. Tax policy reforms are focused on
widening revenue base and streamlining exemptions. In addition, enhanced contribution is
expected from parastatals towards the budget due to higher efficiency in fee collections to
strengthen non tax revenue. To ensure adequate resources, large projects will only be
implemented upon confirmation of adequate preparations and availability of revenue, with
postponement of those for which external financing has not been mobilized.
On expenditure, going forward the plan is to support enhanced public investment. Capital
expenditure is expected to double, bringing domestic investment to about 11 percent of GDP
in 2016/17. Current expenditure is to be contained through a freeze on hiring and nominal
wage with efforts to reduce public sector overheads. The authorities will use public-private
partnership (PPP) for large infrastructure projects to limit government borrowing and support
debt sustainability. Higher project financing and external non-concessional borrowing
(ENCB) would also help finance the investment effort and higher fiscal deficit.

3
Efforts are underway to improve efficiency in public spending. In this regard, the authorities
have launched a comprehensive public investment management manual. An expert has been
hired to enhance IFMIS with a contract management module aimed to strengthen controls of
multi-year commitments. In addition, a new public awareness campaign has been launched to
warn suppliers that orders not generated through IFMIS will not be honored. In recent
development, TANESCO is receiving increasing attention to shore its financial situation and
ensure self-reliance. This includes the introduction of prepaid meters designed to enforce
subscriber payments and intensify collection efficiency. Earlier this year, the government paid
Tsh200 billion to clear its arrears on electricity bills.
In order to support debt sustainability, the authorities are committed to strengthen public debt
management regulatory and institutional framework. Despite delay in approving the National
Debt Management and Amendment of Government Loans, Guarantees, and Grants Act caused
by changes in the structure of the Ministry of Finance and Planning, the authorities are
confident of its passage into law by end-July 2016.
b) Monetary and exchange rate policies
The authorities are committed to prudent monetary policy to keep inflation close to objective
target of 5 percent and continue to improve monetary policy operations by pushing ahead
with modernization of monetary policy framework. To strengthen the Lombard facility, the
collateral framework is being reviewed with a view to expanding the range of eligible
instruments to access central bank facilities. In addition, measures are ongoing to make
Lombard rate more predictable to enhance stability of short term interest rates. Significant
progress has been made towards introducing partial reserve averaging. While the structural
benchmark in this regard was not met, technical work on merging the statutory minimum
reserve and clearing accounts of commercial banks with the BoT and required changes to the
IT system have advanced. The ongoing Fund’s support to building forecasting and policy
analysis capacity is expected to further strengthen the conduct of monetary policy.
The flexible exchange framework will continue to guide foreign exchange management.
Although the shilling depreciated significantly in 2014/15 on the back of lower inflows, the
situation has since stabilized. Going forward, BoT is determined to retain the flexible rate
and to intervene in the exchange rate market to smooth excess volatility while ensuring
international reserves remain adequate.
c) Financial sector stability and development
The banking sector remains sound and stable, with banks generally well capitalized, liquid
and profitable. The majority of the banks continue to record low NPLs of less than 5 percent
of gross loans, while the few others with high NPLs have been directed by BoT to take
immediate steps to lower them, with the larger banks required to report more frequently on
their progress. Banks are also encouraged to increasingly use the credit reference bureaus to
reduce their credit risks.

4
Further, the BoT continues to strengthen the supervisory and regulatory framework, and has
recently, concluded a pilot exercise on consolidated supervision of large domestic banks with
cross-border operations. In addition, BoT has started drafting guidelines to ensure effective
implementation of Basel II/III framework, and is working to improve stress test model and
capacity.
The authorities are aware that financial sector development remains crucial in sustaining
growth and promoting macroeconomic stability, and have resolved to further strengthen
financial inclusion. To this end, the authorities are drafting microfinance legislation to ensure
effective regulation and supervision of the microfinance sector. They have also rolled out
mobile platform to enable users participate in capital market activities. A range of measures
are also being considered to facilitate development of the government debt market.
d) Growth-Enhancing Structural Reforms
Implementation of structural reforms continued to rank high in the government’s development
agenda and is necessary to sustain the country’s strong growth momentum, and
promote economic diversification. In this regard, the authorities focus on establishing a better
environment for business and job creation, while providing durable infrastructure, and access
to finance.
To improve the business environment, government aims to reduce cost of doing business
through legal and regulatory reforms, easing registration and licensing requirement,
enforcing property rights and legal instruments. To sustain development of energy sector, the
authorities have resumed discussions with international partners involved in off-shore
exploration with a view to providing conditions to allow for investment decision. Further, to
enhance SME’s access finance, the authorities are establishing an SME Access to Finance
Framework, as well as exploring financing mechanisms for enterprises and establishing
collateral registry for SMEs. An internet based information portal for SMEs was launched in
March 2016, to enhance financial literacy and entrepreneurship skills for micro, small and
medium enterprises.
Further, the authorities have reiterated their commitment to deliver quality public policy and
governance. In this regard, the National Anti-Corruption Strategy (NACSAP) has been
established focusing on building systems of integrity, accountability and transparency in
public institutions.
e) Regional Cooperation
Additionally, the authorities are also intensifying efforts towards completion of the East
African Community (EAC) common market while evaluating the benefits of removing nontariff barriers in the region. This further demonstrates the commitment of government to the
cause of regional integration and need to accelerate free movement of people, goods and
services within the region.

f) Data Quality

5

Data quality is receiving priority attention. Considerable progress has been made in preparing
the consolidated financial statements for the wider public sector while plans are underway to
subscribe to the Enhanced General Data Dissemination Standard (e-GDDS). The completion
of these processes will enhance quality decision making for analysts and investors.
Conclusion
Tanzania’s economic performance has continued to be strong through the transition period to
a new administration, with growth projected to remain solid in the coming years, supported
by prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms. With the authorities’ commitment
to policy and structural reform implementation, the economic program under the Fund’s PSI
remains broadly on track. In this regard, they request Board support in approving the
completion of the Fourth PSI Review. Finally, with continued Fund engagement and support
from the international community, the authorities remain committed to implementing their
development agenda in order to support sustainable inclusive growth and macroeconomic
stability.
