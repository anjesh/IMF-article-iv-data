STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context: Despite the difficult global economic environment, limited external financial
support, and uncertainty surrounding national elections in November 2011,
macroeconomic performance in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) was
strong in 2010–11. An improvement in economic policies underpinned this
performance but recent shortcomings in the formulation of the 2012 budget and
potential slippages related to security spending could reverse hard-won progress in
reducing fiscal dominance and consolidating macroeconomic stability.
Buffers need to be strengthened: The DRC’s experience during the global financial
crisis in 2009 and the downside risks from the current weakness in the world economy,
argue for a further buildup of macroeconomic buffers. Although the fiscal position has
improved through consolidation and debt relief, it remains vulnerable to spending
pressures from the deteriorating security situation in the eastern provinces, which is
exacerbated by limited financing options and slow progress in mobilizing more
domestic revenue. Gross international reserves have also risen, however, they remain
below the level required to cushion the economy from the impact of external shocks.
Stronger institutional and administrative capacity is essential: The authorities’
recent efforts to improve macroeconomic stability under difficult circumstances must
be commended. To maintain this stability over the medium term will require a stronger
institutional setting with a well-defined fiscal framework targeting appropriate fiscal
anchors, supported by strong public financial management; an independent central
bank capable of effectively carrying out monetary policy; a deeper and adequately
supervised financial sector; and a business environment conducive to attracting
investment and diversifying export capacity to reduce external vulnerability.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

BACKGROUND
1.
In the past few years, economic
performance in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC) has improved markedly,
although progress in alleviating poverty
and meeting the Millennium Development
Goals has lagged. Prudent macroeconomic
policies and structural reforms have
underpinned this performance and led to the
DRC receiving debt relief under the enhanced
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
Initiative in mid-2010. This debt relief—the
largest amount to any eligible HIPC country—
reduced the DRC’s external debt burden from
about 136 percent of GDP in 2009 to about
35 percent at the end of 2010. Regrettably, the
level of poverty probably remains high—about
70 percent of the population—and the DRC is
unlikely to meet any of the MDGs.1
2.
In the November 2011 elections,
President Kabila was reelected and his
coalition partners won a majority in
parliament. This brought with it a measure of
political and social stability and expectations
that the thrust of economic policies would
continue. While some key reforms have been
pushed forward, poor performance in the
management of public finances, external debt,
and natural resources has emerged. Along with
the deteriorating security situation in the
eastern provinces, these weaknesses could
undermine recent progress and jeopardize the

completion of the fourth and fifth reviews of
the authorities’ Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
arrangement.2
3.
In the context of the Article IV
consultations, the authorities have been
receptive to the IMF’s advice, although they
have addressed the recommendations from
the previous discussions with varying
amounts of determination and vigor. The
cornerstone of their efforts has been fiscal
consolidation, where they have responded
positively to the IMF’s call for spending
restraint and the end to inflationary fiscal
financing from the Central Bank of the Congo
(BCC). Monetary and financial sector policies
have moved in the right direction but progress
has been slower than expected. Likewise,
structural reforms to enhance public financial
management (PFM) and natural resource
management are being undertaken, although
the political will to tackle the most difficult
issues has waned. The authorities are making
concerted efforts to implement the 2010
safeguards assessment recommendations,
including the BCC’s move to International
Financial Reporting Standards.
4.
The 2012 Article IV discussions kept
the focus on many of these same issues, but
shifted the timeframe from the short-tomedium term. The staff team exchanged
views with the authorities and stakeholders on

The most recent official money-metric poverty data is
from 2005; updated data is expected in early 2013. The
current IMF-World Bank joint staff assessment of
poverty and social indicators are contained in a Joint
Staff Advisory Note on the authorities’ Poverty
Reduction and Growth Strategy (PRS) paper (see also

The IMF’s Executive Board approved the DRC’s 3-year
ECF arrangement in December 2009 and the third
review was completed in April 2011. The fourth review
(planned for late 2011) was delayed because of lack of
progress in structural reform.

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

the following main issues: anchoring fiscal
policy to strengthen credibility and
sustainability; improving the efficacy of

monetary policy in the context of serious
constraints; and making the economy more
robust and less vulnerable to shocks.

CONTEXT, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
The economy shows remarkable resilience



5.
Macroeconomic performance in the
DRC was strong during 2010–11 even
though the global economy remained weak,
external financial support was limited, and
the national elections in November 2011
created significant uncertainty. Solid
progress was made toward meeting many of
the country’s medium-term economic
objectives.




The DRC’s weak financial linkages with the
euro area countries have largely shielded it
from the turmoil there. Strong trade and
investment inflows from non-European
countries, driven mainly by the mining
sector, have helped support economic
activity in the past few years. This activity
broadened to the manufacturing and
tertiary sectors (telecommunications,
beverages, construction) and real GDP
growth expanded by about 7 percent in
2010–11 (Table 1, Figure 1).
Inflation was above the BCC’s single-digit
target in 2011, mainly because of high
global food and fuel prices early in the
year but has since been on a downward
trend. Domestic prices bumped up at the
beginning of 2012 alongside the
introduction of the value-added-tax, but
inflation has regained its downward path
to just below 10 percent through July
(Figure 1).

The external sector improved significantly
as a result of HIPC debt relief but remains
vulnerable to the volatile terms of trade,
high import dependency on food and
capital goods, narrow export base, and
high level of dollarization of the banking
sector. The DRC also continues to be at
high-risk of debt distress because of the
inclusion of the public guarantee on
external borrowing under a SinoCongolese joint venture (Sicomines,
Annex I). The current-account deficit
widened in 2011 (about 11½ percent of
GDP) as commodity prices weakened from
their high levels in 2010 and the value of
imports increased, especially for food, fuel,
and capital goods (Table 2).

The rebuilding of macroeconomic buffers
supported recent developments
6.
These buffers were improved along
four of five dimensions (Figure 2).


Fiscal dominance has been reduced in the
past few years, owing to the government’s
expenditure restraint and commitment to
zero (net) financing of the budget from the
BCC (excluding the use of deposits from
HIPC debt relief and several grants saved
from 2010). This has helped break a vicious
inflation-exchange rate depreciation cycle
and brought the domestic fiscal deficit
down from 2½ percent of GDP in 2009 to
a projected deficit of 0.9 percent of GDP in
2012 (Tables 3a and 3b, Figure 3).



Expenditure control has been necessary to
address the limited external financial
support to the DRC—reflecting donors
concerns over governance, especially in
the natural resource sector—and slow
progress in raising more domestic revenue.
Recently, however, weaknesses in the
budget process, inflated revenue
projections, and a corresponding large
expenditure envelope point to the need to
bolster and better entrench PFM reforms
(Annex II).



The improvement in the fiscal situation has
also helped the BCC control liquidity and

fight inflation. The BCC contains inflation
through the issuance of central bank bills
but data and capacity problems, as well as
political pressures have made it hesitant at
times to proactively tighten monetary
policy. It has aggressively reduced its
policy interest rate faster than justified by
inflation developments, leading to
relatively low real interest rates (Figure 3).
More recently, the BCC’s own budgetary
constraints prompted it to reduce its stock
of central bank bills in order to reduce
interest costs, leading to an unwarranted
increase in liquidity.

External stability has been strengthened
through HIPC debt relief and a buildup of
international reserves (from about
6.3 weeks of import cover in 2009 to a
projected 8.8 weeks this year, Figure 3),

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

which provides a larger cushion against
external shocks. Notwithstanding this
progress, an even larger buffer is needed
to bolster the DRC’s external stability,
including from a projected widening of the

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

current account deficit and growing dollardeposits in the banking system. External
borrowing should be consistent with
maintaining external debt sustainability
and only on highly concessional terms. The
current account deficit has increased in the
past few years, reflecting the volatility of
the terms of trade (rather than
deterioration in the DRC’s international
competitiveness), high imports related to
mining sector and infrastructure
investments, and better accounting of
income flows. Export volumes (mainly
commodities) also expanded significantly
in the same period. But the recent
deterioration of the current account might
also be linked to the ongoing difficult
business environment, which influences
the DRC’s international competiveness
more than the level of the real effective
exchange rate (REER). Indeed, according to
the staff and authorities’ assessment, the
REER is probably in line with the
fundamentals (Annex III).
7.
Although progress in structural
reform has been mixed, some reforms in
key areas have been supportive of better
economic performance. In particular, the
authorities have been moving methodically, if
unevenly, to put in place their Strategic Plan
for Public Finance Reform with technical
assistance (TA) from the IMF, World Bank, and

development partners (Annex IV). Much of the
IMF TA focuses on the fiscal planning process,
helping to build tools for better macrofiscal
forecasting and moving toward a mediumterm budget framework with expenditure
priorities guided by a new Poverty Reduction
Strategy (PRS).
8.
The authorities implemented a large
number of measures supported by the
World Bank to strengthen governance in
the natural resource sector and they
recently submitted the instruments to
adhere to the Organization for the
Harmonization of African Business Law
(OHADA) in Dakar. The BCC intervened in
mid-2010 to address problems with a large
commercial bank to avoid a systemic crisis,
while extending its efforts toward bolstering
financial supervision and hastening the
development of the banking sector. The BCC
has also completed a pension reform and is in
the process of shedding non-core activities to
better focus on its mandate.
9.
Still, other reforms have lagged and
new issues have emerged, including
weaknesses in PFM (i.e., an unrealistic 2012
budget), external debt management
(emergence of external payments arrears) and
problems in ensuring accountability and
transparency in the operations of state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) in extractive industries.

A. Outlook and Risks
The short-term outlook appears relatively
benign
10.
Recent global and domestic
developments have not dampened
investors’ appetite for ramping up nearterm production, especially in the mining
sector. On present projections, mining-related

investments will continue to grow in 2012–16,
providing a major impetus to real GDP growth,
which could exceed 7 percent this year and
8 percent in 2013. While some of these
investment plans could be scaled back if
conditions worsen, any softening could be

partially offset by the Sicomines project whose
implementation has only recently begun.

year and slow down the increase in
international reserves.3

11.
The strong investment cycle will
invariably lead to a widening of the current
account deficit as a consequence of heavy
capital imports. The larger current account
deficit would also reflect the DRC’s rules on
accelerated depreciation of investments for tax
purposes, which allow for large tax deductions
of investments that, consequently, increase
income outflows in the current account.
Fortunately, the deficit should be adequately
financed over the medium term, by the strong
inflows of direct investment from these mining
projects (including Sicomes).

But downside risks are significant

12.
The prospects for an expansion of
mineral exports over the medium term
should lead to higher foreign-exchange
earnings and with them, opportunities for
the BCC to accumulate further international
reserves. The authorities’ objective of
10 weeks of import coverage therefore is
achievable, although the staff’s estimates using
the IMF template for reserve adequacy suggest
this objective should be set much higher to
ensure external stability (Annex V).
13.
Rising international food prices,
however, may also complicate the task of
the BCC. Although the magnitude will depend
on the price increases on crops most relevant
to domestic consumption, recent history
points to significant pass-through from
international food prices to inflation. If
realized, this may jeopardize the achievement
of the BCC’s single-digit inflation target this

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

14.
The outlook is subject to a number
of downside risks, a couple of which could
have a severe impact on the DRC. Some of
the risks stem from the potential for further
weakness in the euro area that spills over into
lower global growth, with adverse implications
for already weakening commodity prices.
Other risks could be homegrown; in particular,
those stemming from fiscal slippages given
expenditure rigidities if overly optimistic tax
revenue projections are not realized, spending
pressures from an escalation of the recent
conflict in the eastern part of the country, or a
reversal of governance reforms that put a
freeze on investment (Table 5).
15.
Although the DRC authorities have
made concerted efforts to rebuild the
macroeconomic buffers, there is a strong
rationale making them even bigger. A steep
drop in commodity prices comparable in scope
to the decline in 2009 and an escalating
conflict that requires a substantial increase in
security-related spending would have serious
implications. Together with the authorities, the
staff elaborated on these shock (or tail-risk)
scenarios.


Plunging commodity prices: A 40 percent
decline in commodity prices relative to the
baseline (equal to two standard deviations

The government does not provide food subsidies so
beyond the effect on inflation there would not be a
direct fiscal impact of rising food prices. If, however,
the government responded by cutting import tariffs or
the VAT rate on key food imports, it could reduce
revenue somewhat.

from the historical average) in 2013, with a
partial reversal toward the baseline in 2014
would lead to a sharp slowdown in mining
investment and production. In the first year
of the shock, this could knock
6 percentage points off real GDP growth
and cause the current account deficit to

balloon by more than 12 percent of GDP,
and lower fiscal revenue by nearly
4 percent of GDP (Figure 4). The exchange
rate would likely depreciate substantially,
which in turn could lead to a spike in
inflation.



DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

An escalation of conflict in eastern DRC,
similar to civil war in the mid-2000s. The
direct impact on growth from increased
insecurity could be muted because the
country’s major mines lie outside the
affected areas, though it is difficult to
gauge the impact on investment. Also, an
increase in security-related spending equal
to 3 percent of GDP financed by the
central bank in the absence of other
financing options likely would have a
smaller impact on growth and inflation
than a sharp fall in commodity prices,
assuming that the government cuts other
spending items. At the same time, large
cuts would likely have an adverse effect on
budget execution and the quality of
spending. In particular, sizable cuts to
infrastructure spending would have a
negative impact on growth over the
medium term.4

Authorities’ views
16.
The authorities appreciated the
staff’s candid assessment of the economic
outlook and agreed with the risk
assessment. Indeed, they noted that
rebuilding the macroeconomic buffers must be
a primary objective of their economic program.

They emphasized that the lessons learned
from the global financial crisis in 2009— when
commodity prices plunged, the exchange rate
depreciated rapidly, inflation accelerated, and
international reserves were nearly depleted—
were deeply ingrained. Having said that, they
did feel the economy is in a stronger position
today to absorb external shocks because of
better economic policy implementation and
reduced security risks, notwithstanding the
current problems in the eastern region.
17.
Overall, the authorities also agreed
with the staff’s analysis of the exchange
rate and international competitiveness, and
the need to accumulate more foreign
reserves. However, they argued that reserve
accumulation needed to be balanced against
the possible implications from foreign
exchange purchases on the exchange rate,
whose changes immediately affect inflation. In
light of the high cost of elections, debt service
due after HIPC debt relief, and the reduction in
balance of payments support, the authorities’
saw that building more reserves could have led
to adverse macroeconomic effects. On external
debt, the authorities felt that the risks related
more to the use of external financing in terms
of inefficient and wasteful public investment
than to debt distress.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
18.
How to position macroeconomic
and structural policies to further
consolidate stability and accelerate growth

with low and stable inflation, was the main
focus of the discussions. The staff relied
heavily on the experience across sub-Saharan
Africa and other low-income countries, in
providing its advice.

Fiscal restraint has already resulted in ad hoc
spending cuts that have adversely affected budget
execution and the quality of spending, with

items, compared with near 100 percent for some
others (including political institutions).

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

A. Anchoring Fiscal Policy
19.
After a few years of relatively good
performance, debt relief, and a change in
government, discussions focused on the
direction of fiscal policy. The staff expressed
concern about a shift in the fiscal policy
approach, as evidenced by the 2012 budget,
leading to considerations about how to
consolidate recent progress and sustain it over
the medium term. Establishing a credible fiscal
anchor would help.
20.
Over the short term, fiscal policy
must be aimed at maintaining expenditure
control—the foundation for the authorities’
program so far—while re-focusing
attention on the composition of the budget
and its priorities. Raising more domestic
resources by broadening the tax base is
essential in light of the time-profile of tax
revenue from the natural resource sector as a
result of mineral tax policies (Annex VI), and
limited external financial support. Targeting a
domestic fiscal deficit of about 1 percent of
GDP this year is appropriate and consistent
with medium-term fiscal sustainability
(Table 6).5

In this context, the overall resource

5

Although the “fiscal space” measure calculated for
the DRC is positive (about 1 percent of GDP over the
medium term), it probably does not accurately reflect
the government’s capacity to respond to shocks with
looser fiscal policy because the DRC lacks access to
international capital markets or other forms of
financing. The fiscal space measure is the difference
between the current primary balance and the
hypothetical balance that would have to be realized
every year for the next 20 years to achieve a particular
debt-to-GDP ratio target (30 percent of GDP in the
case of the DRC).

the government and approved by the
parliament is overly ambitious. The budget
contains domestic revenue projections about
3 percent of GDP higher than what can be
considered feasible in the absence of credible
tax policy measures or administrative reforms
to support them.6 Higher spending associated
with this revenue target—including for nondiscretionary items such as wages, and current
spending on political institutions that tend to
be fully executed—could affect the quality of
spending and, along with increased securityrelated outlays, raise the potential for
significant expenditure slippages. Although the
government’s desire to expand the budget
envelope is understandable, depriving the
budget of its disciplining role is not an
adequate response to the country’s substantial
development needs. Rather, it risks reversing
hard-won progress in consolidating the fiscal
position.
22.
Instead, the staff argued that the
authorities should publicly declare their
commitment to zero central-bank-financing
of the budget, while also targeting the
domestic fiscal balance as the preferred
measure of the fiscal stance. This would help
anchor expectations; support the BCC, whose
independence is still limited; and break the link
between fiscal policy and inflation. Also, the
staff indicated that it is premature for the DRC
to use alternative measures of the fiscal stance,
such as a non-resource primary balance, or
6

The budget also includes higher projections for
project grants but this does not pose a fiscal risk since
most of this spending is executed directly by donors. If
these grants do not materialize the spending is not
executed.

adopt a fiscal rule in its place. International
experience suggests that properly employing
more sophisticated measures of the fiscal
position or rules, in conjunction with a
medium-term fiscal framework or fiscal rule,
requires better quality statistics, especially for
the natural resource sectors and strong PFM.
Although the DRC is moving in the right
direction in this respect, progress across the
relevant parts of the government is uneven
and often slow. A number of weaknesses still
exist in public accounting, expenditure-chain
management, the budget framework, and
other aspects of PFM, which the new finance
law and related strategic plan supported by
significant TA aim to address.
23.
Anchoring fiscal policy with zero
central-bank-financing does not unduly
constrain public spending if domestic
revenue is increased. The introduction of a
value-added tax earlier this year is an
important step forward as are recent reforms
to tax and customs administration (one-stop
customs window, strengthening the capacity
of the large taxpayer unit, improving IT
systems). However, these measures can be
undermined by the lack of concerted effort to
close tax loopholes, eliminate exemptions and
preferential treatment, raise fuel taxes, and
collect more revenue from the natural resource
sector and from SOEs. The staff estimates (in

the baseline) that more than 1 percent of GDP
in additional revenue could be raised this year
through implementation of some of these
measures. Adopting an automatic fuel pricing
mechanism—a stated objective of the
authorities—could add even more, while at the
same time improve the quality of public
spending by eliminating the fiscal cost of the
current fuel pricing policy (Annex VII).
Authorities’ views
24.
While downplaying concerns about
short term fiscal risks, the authorities
agreed with the staff’s overall analysis and
viewed zero financing from the central
bank as an important disciplining device in
managing public finances. They stressed the
importance of IMF TA to help them realize the
full potential of the natural resource sector,
and they agreed that further domestic revenue
mobilization and PFM reforms are crucial for
scaling up spending and raising its quality.
They appreciated the staff’s analysis of fuel
pricing and reiterated their intention to reform
the current pricing regime. They did not
perceive the 2012 budget as a departure from
recent practice because it remained tied to the
program’s fiscal anchor, with a fiscal stance
only slightly more expansionary than the staff’s
baseline.

B. Enhancing the Efficacy of Monetary Policy
25.
Recent weaknesses in the financial
and operating performance of the BCC have
raised questions from the staff about the
direction of its reform. These questions have
been far reaching concerning central bank
independence, the cost of monetary policy
operations, and how to make it more effective.
In this regard, a regime change was not seen
as appropriate by the staff or the authorities.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

26.
The efficacy of monetary policy in
the DRC is hampered by the high level of
dollarization, institutional and
administrative weaknesses, and a lack of
central bank credibility. Recognizing these
constraints discussions centered on the
options to strengthen monetary policy and the
BCC, with improvements to the status quo—
supported by TA—being seen as preferable to

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

any switch in monetary or exchange rate
regime (Annex VIII). In taking this view, the
staff understood that improvements to the
current framework will take considerable time,
including reducing the level of dollarization
(Figure 5) and developing the financial market
to ensure that monetary policy becomes highly
effective and independent (Figure 6).7
27.
Several factors favor building on the
status quo. The bipolar view would suggest
considering a fixed exchange rate regime,
although the staff is not persuaded that the
DRC could import credibility this way. A hard
peg or full dollarization would require
significantly more international reserves to
back the local currency than the BCC currently
possess, on top of whatever level of reserves
the authorities consider necessary to fulfill its
lender of last resort function, and the DRC’s
highly concentrated export base makes full
dollarization or a fixed exchange rate a less
attractive option. Under the status quo, the
DRC maintains the option of a real devaluation
to help absorb the external shocks that the
economy frequently faces.
28.
To improve on the status quo, the
staff urged the authorities to accelerate the
implementation of ongoing reforms. These
reforms include recapitalizing the BCC and its
restructuring it to align its operations with its
core mandate; strengthening the BCC’s
institutional capacity through better data,
information, and analytical capacity; deepening
financial markets to enhance the monetary
transmission mechanism; and measures to

remains small and shallow: broad money as a share of
GDP is low by international and sub-regional
comparison as is access to banking services.

encourage de-dollarization.8 These reforms
would establish a more flexible and
modernized monetary policy framework,
anchored by a coherent forward-looking view
where monetary aggregates are monitored
and analyzed systematically along with a broad
array of other macroeconomic and financial
indicators, including inflation, output, interest
and the exchange rate. Because most of these
reforms will take time, the current constraints
to an effective and independent monetary
policy are likely to remain for some time.
Authorities’ views
29.
The authorities welcomed the timely
discussion on monetary policy reform
options in light of ongoing central bank
restructuring, and concurred with the staff’s
view on the desirability and necessity of
strengthening the current monetary and
exchange rate regime. While ascribing recent
weaknesses in the conduct of monetary policy
to lack of coordination with fiscal policy and
the financial constraints of the BCC, the
authorities stressed the other constraints on
the efficacy of monetary policy, especially high
dollarization, and they expressed concern
about moving further in that direction. In
addition to the staff’s analysis, they argued
that full dollarization would imply a loss of
sovereignty and seignorage. The authorities
intend to support and safeguard an
independent monetary policy regime that also
allows for a floating exchange rate, providing
an important instrument to mitigate the
impact of external shocks.
8

International experience shows that de-dollarization
takes years and even decades to reverse, so the DRC
authorities should encourage rather than force the
issue. Emphasis should, therefore, be placed on
market-based measures or so-called pull factors to use
local currency.

C. Making the Economy More Robust
30.
Despite the recent improvement in
economic policies and the buildup of the
macroeconomic buffers, the DRC economy
remains fragile and is vulnerable in two
important respects. The financial sector is
weak and underdeveloped, limiting growth
prospects and the effectiveness of monetary
policy; and governance and transparency must
be further strengthened if the country is to
maximize the benefits of its vast natural
resource wealth, or it will risk a slowdown in its
development.
Financial Sector Growth and Stability
31.
Staff noted that DRC’s limited
financial integration in the global economy
implied that it was largely unaffected from
the turmoil in the euro zone. Banks are
mostly foreign owned but their financing is
mainly domestic, and with a very modest scale
of foreign assets and liabilities the direct
effects of the turmoil are limited.
32.
More important for the stability of
the financial system is the challenges for
banks’ profitability posed by the rapid
entry of new banks. The 20 commercial banks
that are now operating in the DRC do so in a
high-cost environment that, even though
spreads between deposit and lending rates
remain at a relatively high level, squeeze profit
margins.9 Return on assets at end-2011 was
0.5 percent, which is low compared with banks
in neighboring countries, and amongst the
9

The spread between deposit and lending rates in
USD has remained around 15 percentage points, while
the equivalent in national currency has trended
downwards to just under 20 percentage points.

lowest in the sub region. Reported financial
soundness indicators show a highly capitalized
banking system, although compliance with
other prudential ratios remains mixed
(Table 7).
33.
The soundness of the banking sector
was significantly improved by the closure
and liquidation of a systemically important
commercial bank in mid-2010. In March
2012 all but two small banks (representing
2 percent of total assets) were in compliance
with the required minimum equity, which was
raised from US$5 million to US$10 million in
early 2010. All banks now exceed the capital
adequacy ratios in terms of risk-weighted
assets (33 percent at end-June 2012). The
share of non-performing loans (NPLs) of the
banking system declined to 8.3 percent of total
credits at end-June 2012 from 17 percent at
end-2009. Compliance with other prudential
ratios remains mixed; four banks, representing
a third of the banking system’s assets are in
violation of the liquidity requirement. The staff
advised the authorities to further strengthen
data quality, capacity for data assessment, and
financial supervision. Pronounced weaknesses
in regulatory oversight and prudential
enforcement could result in misleading
assessments of the state of the financial sector,
with adverse consequences for stability.
34.
Staff welcomed the authorities’
intention to introduce later this year a new
commercial bank and new central bank law
developed in line with IMF technical
assistance. These laws will help address
weaknesses exposed by the closing of the
problem bank, including the regulatory and
legal framework for liquidation and
shareholder rights, bank-resolution

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

procedures, and the legal regime for the
lender of last resort function. The new laws
also aim to strengthen the BCC’s ability to
coerce troubled banks to address weaknesses
in their financial situation and non-compliance
with prudential ratios.
35.
The staff also encouraged the
authorities to strengthen their analysis of
the risks to financial sector stability from a
sharp drop in commodity prices and an
abrupt exchange rate adjustment. Because
the mining sector is mainly externally financed
and banks’ exposure to the sector is small, the
risks to financial stability from a sharp fall in
commodity prices may be limited. However,
potential second-round effects from a sharp
fall in deposits, deteriorating credit quality,
and foreign currency shortage may be
substantial. Similarly, an abrupt exchange rate
adjustment may have adverse second-round
effects on non-collateralized credit in sectors
having liabilities in dollars but receiving their
revenue in local currency.
Authorities’ views
36.
The authorities concurred with the
staff’s assessment of the challenges and
main risks to the financial sector, and asked
for the IMF’s continued support in
identifying risks to strengthening
supervision. In particular, they requested an
FSAP and would like to pursue the use of
stress testing as a tool for assessing
vulnerabilities. The authorities also noted their
intention to submit to parliament later this
year a new payment systems’ law that should
be instrumental in further reducing

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

transactions costs and developing the banking
sector.10

Governance and Transparency in
Extractive Industries
37.
The implementation of governance
and transparency reforms in extractive
industries is generally moving forward, in
close collaboration with the World Bank
and IMF staff. A detailed set of measures is
now substantially completed, aiming among
other things to ensure the sanctity of contracts
and private property rights to enhance the
transparency of transactions in these
industries. A review of the mining code is also
in train, which could address some of the
current issues raised by stakeholders.
Implementation of a few measures require
greater efforts including accession to the New
York Convention on the Recognition and
Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards;
validation by the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative; and ensuring best
practice in the sale of public assets.
38.
The recent “commercialization” of a
number of SOEs operating in extractive
industries, however, has exposed gaps in
the policy framework. The transformation
from publicly run to commercial enterprises
(19 so far) has implied operational
10

The DRC maintains measures that give rise to one
exchange restriction and one multiple currency
practice subject to IMF approval. The exchange
restriction involves an outstanding net debt position
against other contracting members under the
inoperative regional payments agreement with the
Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries.
The multiple currency practice relates to a fixed
exchange rate set quarterly applying to transactions
through the bilateral payments agreement with
Zimbabwe.

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

independence and resulted in limited
accountability to the government (as the sole
shareholder). Although the staff of the IMF
(and the World Bank) supported this
transformation, it is deeply concerned about
the weakened accountability to the
government and the limited effort these
enterprises currently exercise in helping to
maximize the wealth of the state, and in
generating revenue that should accrue to the
Treasury. Equally important is the inability of
the government to ensure that SOEs follow
and implement national laws regarding
investment decisions, contracting external
debt, and the sale of public assets.
39.
To rectify this situation, the
government intends to enforce the
publication of all transactions in extractive
industries, including asset sales on the major
SOEs operating in this area (which is mandated
by law); call for these SOEs to prepare
government-endorsed business plans; review
the legal and regulatory framework concerning
the governance of these enterprises (with help
from the World Bank); establish a mediumterm strategy to address their financial and
social debt, and limit their external financing to
concessional sources; and require them to set
performance targets, for which these

enterprises will be held accountable by the
government. The objectives of these measures
are to (i) ensure the consistent implementation
and primacy of the 2008 law guiding the
divestiture of state assets; (ii) strengthen and
support the enforceability of actions related to
transparency and traceability of these
transactions, where none currently exists; and
(iii) establish clear accountability objectives
and compliance rules for the controlling
shareholder.
Authorities’ views
40.
The authorities confirmed their
commitment to the timely publication of
contracts in extractive industries, noting
that recent delays did not signal any
reversal of reforms or commitments in this
area. They reiterated their determination to
continue with recent efforts and discussions
with IMF and World Bank staff, stressing that
development of the natural resource sector is
fundamental to the DRC’s long-term
prospects. In doing so, they also noted the
difficulties they faced in implementing the laws
and regulations governing newly
“commercialized” enterprises, but that these
problems would be overcome.

STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
Recent economic performance in the
DRC has been surprisingly resilient over the
past few years, given weaknesses in the
global economy, food and fuel price shocks,
domestic security issues, and a protracted
election period. Strong ownership in
consolidating macroeconomic stability and
pursuing economic reform has no doubt

helped, and this is reflected in the buildup of
the macroeconomic buffers over time.
42.
Notwithstanding better economic
performance and policy implementation,
the economy remains vulnerable to external
shocks and home-grown risks. This speaks to
the importance of further strengthening

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

buffers and the institutions and capacity to
manage polices to mitigate these events.
43.
Consequently, weaknesses in
formulating the 2012 budget are
unfortunate. Until now, fiscal policy had been
the foundation for recent performance
underpinned by the government’s
commitment to zero budgetary financing from
the central bank, which has helped to bring
inflation largely under control. The risks of a
softening in the global economy with adverse
implications for commodity prices and
budgetary revenue, the likelihood of spending
overruns needed to address internal security
concerns, and lack of foreign financing are
cause for deep concern. Fiscal credibility in the
DRC has been difficult to earn but it could be
easily eroded.
44.
To safeguard the fiscal position, the
staff urges the government to rigorously
monitor budget execution and to reduce
non-discretionary spending if it appears the
(overly) optimistic revenue projections fail
to materialize. At the same time, it must use
more effort and make difficult political
decisions to raise more domestic revenue,
through pricing fuel efficiently and equitably,
eliminating ad hoc tax exemptions and
loopholes, tightening tax compliance, and
ensuring that the natural resource sector
contributes its share to the Treasury.
45.
Fiscal risks become even more
worrying in a weak PFM environment.
Sustained progress must be made in
strengthening the budget process, mediumterm fiscal planning, and the quality of public
spending.
46.
Similarly, monetary policy must not
be derailed. The BCC needs to tightly manage
liquidity to dampen inflation expectations and
20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

guard against the potential second-round
effects from the recent increase in food prices,
if it is to achieve its single-digit inflation
objective. To do so will also require greater
efforts on the part of the authorities to
strengthen the BCC’s independence, and
administrative and institutional capacity.
Completing the BCC’s recapitalization,
increasing the transparency of its operations,
and restructuring it to remove non-core
activities are essential.
47.
The current monetary and floating
exchange rate regime remains appropriate
to achieve the DRC’s broad policy
objectives, although a further buildup of
international reserves is warranted. The
external sector has improved significantly
mainly as a result of debt relief but it is
vulnerable to external shocks, the narrow
export base, and high dollarization, which
could tax the monetary authority’s ability to
act as lender of last resort in the event of a
deposit run. If the projected expansion of the
mining sector comes to fruition, there may be
opportunities to accumulate more
international reserves without disrupting the
foreign exchange market; and these
interventions should be sterilized to offset the
impact on the money supply if the inflation
target is endangered.
48.
The recent efforts to shore up
financial stability and develop the banking
sector are welcomed, especially as they may
open opportunities for closer regional and
global financial integration. The proposed
commercial and central bank regulatory
reforms will modernize the legal framework,
make the financial system more resilient, and
encourage financial deepening. A deepening
of the financial market would itself support

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

stronger growth, the efficacy of monetary
policy, and de-dollarization.
49.
Progress in other structural reforms
has also taken place, notably in public
financial management and strengthening
governance and transparency in extractive
industries, but delays in other areas point
to institutional weaknesses. Delays in the
implementation of some difficult reforms can
be explained by the lack of political leadership
and intermittent security concerns during the
protracted election period. However, failure to
take forward policy changes at a technical level
(including some other areas of PFM, revenue
mobilization, and restructuring the BCC) is
unfortunate. While more technical assistance
will be required, the political will to build
strong institutions is crucial for achieving
future reform ambitions and development
goals.

50.
Enhancing the business environment
and establishing a strong foundation for
the exploitation and development of DRC’s
natural resources will be critical. The recent
transformation of several SOEs into
commercialized entities has created new
challenges and highlighted some gaps in the
policy framework, which the authorities must
address as quickly as possible. Failure to do so
may be seen as a reversal of recent progress
with unintended consequences for further
development in this area.
51.
It is proposed that the next Article IV
consultation with the DRC be held in
accordance with the provisions of the Decision
on Article IV Consultation Cycles (Decision No.
14747-(10/96)(9/28/2010).

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

Annex I. Updated Debt Sustainability Analysis
1.
While the macroeconomic
fundamentals have improved, the DRC is
still considered at high risk of debt distress
with weaknesses in debt management
adding to vulnerabilities. The authorities
reported completing most debt rescheduling
agreements with bilateral and commercial
creditors in the context of HIPC debt relief, and
making good faith efforts to reschedule debts
with the remaining creditors on comparable
terms.
2.
As in the 2010 DSA, strong growth
over the medium term is supported by
large investments in mining and public
infrastructure projects, but with the latest
projections for mining production
substantially higher than before. Based on
developments over the last two years and
more detailed information for the mining
sector on prospective investment and
production, the projections for exports over
the medium to long term have been revised
upward substantially relative to the previous
DSA in June 2010 (e.g., the forecast for exports
in 2013 is almost 14 percent higher than in the
previous DSA) (TableI.1.).
3.
The mining investment for the SinoCongolese (SCCA) joint venture known as
Sicomines has been rephased and the
expected disbursement of the related
public infrastructure loans has also been
reprofiled. The period over which the loans
are expected to be disbursed has been
extended, with the last disbursement now
expected in 2019 instead of 2014, and the
amount of each disbursement is smaller than
initially projected.

30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

4.
The rephasing of the disbursements
for the SCCA infrastructure loans and the
delay in the mining project affect the
evolution of the public debt stock and
repayments in the baseline. The changes to
the disbursement schedule reduce the pace at
which the debt stock grows, while the mining
project delay pushes back the timing for the
repayment of the infrastructure loans, because
they will be repaid by the government’s share
of income from the mining project.
Consequently, although the government has
guaranteed the public infrastructure loans, the
guarantee on remaining debt can only be
called starting in 2034 if the infrastructure
loans have not been fully repaid. If it is not
called the repayment burden does not directly
fall on the budget. According to the feasibility
study for the project, the government’s share
of income from the mining project is
(conservatively) forecast to completely pay off
the infrastructure loans by 2025.

External DSA Results
5.
In the previous DSA the DRC was
rated as at “high risk” of external debt
distress; this conclusion is maintained in
this updated DSA. This is largely a reflection
of its poor CPIA rating and the application of
the lowest present value (PV) debt ratio
threshold levels. Under the baseline scenario
the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio is within a
percentage point of the threshold from 2014–
17, with the threshold breached in 2016

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

(Figure I.1.).1 In the historical scenario, the debt
ratios are consistently lower than the baseline.
In the medium term this is due primarily to the
historical average for the current account
deficit (6.7 percent of GDP) being lower than
the baseline projection (12.9 percent of GDP
average over 2012–17).

exports, and debt-to-revenue ratios is an
exports shock and in each one the threshold is
breached, with the PV debt-to-GDP ratio in the
exports shock scenario breaching the
threshold by 17 percentage points at its peak
and the breach persisting from 2013 until
2024.

6.
The “high risk” rating is justified
despite the improvement of baseline
projection for the PV of debt ratios relative
to the previous DSA. The previous DSA
indicated a larger and more sustained breach
of the threshold for the PV of debt-to-GDP
ratio over the medium term (Figure I.2.). This
stems in part from the revision of the
disbursement and repayment profiles for the
SCCA public infrastructure loans, as discussed
above. Without the inclusion in the public debt
stock of the guaranteed public infrastructure
loans the baseline would be well below the
thresholds (Figure I.3.). However, while these
loan guarantees cannot be called until 2034
and are not expected to be called in the
current baseline projection, the uncertainty
inherent in any mining project, particularly
owing to lower-than-expected commodity
prices or production and higher-than-expected
costs, translates into a risk that the
government guarantee may eventually be
called (at least in part).

Public DSA Results

7.
The DRC is vulnerable to adverse
exogenous shocks, especially shocks to
commodity prices. The most extreme stress
scenario for the PV debt-to-GDP, debt-to1

The residuals in the external DSA are consistently
large throughout the projection period reflecting weak
data, which may not appropriately capture certain
flows (e.g., private-sector external borrowing, income
outflows in the current account).

8.
The DRC’s (estimated) domestic
debt is primarily domestic arrears, most of
which were incurred prior to the elections
in 2007. The latest estimate for domestic
arrears potentially owed by the government at
end 2011 is based on a recent audit conducted
by the debt management agency, with the
assistance of two audit firms. These include
arrears owed to domestic creditors, “social
debts” (e.g., wages owed to past government
employees), arrears owed to state owned
enterprises (SOEs),2 arrears owed to suppliers
and contractors, and unpaid judgments and
awards stemming from judicial decisions. At
this juncture, not all of the arrears identified in
the initial audit have been certified and many
claims on the government may be at least
partly offset by liabilities owed to the
government. Based on the audit, out of
potential domestic liabilities outstanding at the
end of 2011 worth US$1.4 billion (7.9 percent
of 2012 GDP), the debt management unit
estimates that approximately US$900 million
(5.1 percent of 2012 GDP) would be valid after
2

Many SOEs also have outstanding tax arrears or
arrears to other SOEs. The government, with the
assistance of the World Bank, is in the process of
assessing balance sheets of key SOEs to determine
what offsetting liabilities can be eliminated and which
remain outstanding, including for the external debt
liabilities of SOEs.

further assessment; this is the value used for
this DSA. The baseline includes the expected
extinguishment of all arrears by 2023, with no
new domestic arrears or domestic debt
incurred between 2012 and 2032.
Consequently, while the PV of total public
debt-to-GDP ratio is 4.8 percent of GDP higher
in 2012 than that of the PV of external debtto-GDP ratio in the baseline scenario, the
difference declines quickly and disappears
after 2022 (Figure I.4.).3
9.
Although the fixed primary balance
scenario outcome is similar to the baseline,
the historical scenario leads to a substantial
fall in debt levels. Similar to the 2010 DSA,
the PV of the debt-to-GDP ratio declines in the
historical scenario and eventually becomes
negative after 2023. As in the analysis of the
external debt, the debt ratio in the historical
scenario is lower than the baseline partly as a
result of the average historical real GDP
growth rate exceeding the average projected
growth rate in the baseline. It is due also to the
smaller primary deficit (average of 0.5 percent
of GDP in 2002–11) used in the historical
scenario projections when compared to the
average projected primary deficit in the
baseline scenario (average 3.1 percent of GDP
over 2012–32). The lower primary deficit
results in a lower calculated gross financing
need and, given the mechanics of the LIC DSA
template, ultimately generates negative values
for the nominal debt values for the domestic

and even foreign currency debt. In other
words, on average, if real GDP grows as quickly
as it did over the last decade and the
government pursues a fiscal policy that
generates smaller primary deficits than those
forecast under the baseline, it could generate
sufficient savings such that the country’s net
debt (debt minus assets) becomes negative.
10.
The most extreme shock scenario
results in debt ratios that are higher than
the baseline, but less severe than in the
2010 DSA. The most extreme shock is the
shock with real GDP growth at the historical
average minus one standard deviation in 2013
and 2014. This implies annual real GDP growth
of 4.3 percent in 2013 and 2014 under the
shock scenario, compared to the baseline
scenario’s real GDP growth projections of 8.2
and 6.4 percent in 2013 and 2014, respectively.
Although the debt ratios under the stress
scenario are higher than in the baseline
scenario, the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio does not
exceed 35 percent at any point during the
projection period and after 2022 it is below the
30 percent threshold applied in the external
debt sustainability analysis.

Conclusion
11.
While the macroeconomic
fundamentals have improved in the DRC, it
is still considered at high risk of debt
distress because of its vulnerability to
exogenous shocks, especially drops in
commodity prices and production. It is
therefore important that the DRC continues to
take a cautious approach to external
borrowing with such borrowing only on highly
concessional terms. A significant portion of the
debt stock in the DRC is attributable to the
public guarantee on the SCCA infrastructure
loans and the baseline PV of debt ratios do

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

improve substantially if the debt covered by
public guarantee is excluded. However, not
only is the country still vulnerable to a drop in
commodity prices that would reduce growth
and drive the PV of debt ratios above their
thresholds, but a sizable enough price shock
could undermine the economics of the mining
project that is supposed to pay off the
infrastructure loans and lead to the repayment
burden for much or all of those loans falling
on the government.4 Furthermore, the
government’s debt management and debt risk

analysis capabilities remain weak, which
increases the risk that the authorities will
accumulate an unsustainable level of external
debt. Additional risks stem from debts of state
owned enterprises (SOEs) that suffer from even
greater problems in debt management
capacity than the central government; many
have outstanding external debts and are
incurring new debts (on a concessional basis),
though the scope of any (potential) contingent
liabilities is not clear at this time.

Even without the public guarantee on the SCCA
infrastructure loans included in the stock of debt, in an
exports shock scenario the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio
would still exceed the 30 percent threshold by a sizable
margin in 2014–22.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt-creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than, but with grace and maturity periods the same as, in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level
after the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

Annex II. Performance Under the Extended Credit Facility Arrangement
1.
In December 2009, the IMF’s
Executive Board approved a three-year ECF
arrangement for the DRC with access of
SDR 346.35 million (65 percent of quota).
The third review of the program was
completed in April 2011 (IMF Country Report
No. 11/190) but since then, program
performance has been mixed. The fourth and
fifth reviews (based on end-June and endDecember 2011 test dates respectively) could
not be completed at this time, due to
weaknesses in formulating the 2012 budget
and failure to implement structural
benchmarks on governance and transparency.
2.
Overall, the authorities have made
good progress in meeting the program’s
quantitative performance criteria at each
of the test dates, especially with respect to
the (zero) ceiling on net bank credit to
government and the floor on net foreign
assets of the BCC. Some external payments
arrears accumulated during last year (totaling
US$4.7 million), although all of these arrears
were promptly cleared.
3.
A sound fiscal position has been the
cornerstone of the authorities’ program,
with its focus on consolidation to reflect
limited external financing and the desire to
end central bank financing of the budget.
The 2012 budget adopted recently by
parliament departs from this position, with a
resource envelope that is considerably higher
than 2011, including a significant increase in
budgeted wage payments and overly

optimistic revenue projections (roughly
3 percent of GDP above the IMF staff’s
baseline) not supported by ambitious tax
policy or administrative measures. Fully
executing such a budget could lead to
sizeable fiscal slippages and undermine recent
progress, making it difficult to reconcile with
the IMF-supported program.
4.
Regarding structural reform, policy
implementation has been mixed. Progress
has been made in strengthening aspects of
PFM, the independence and operations of the
central bank, domestic revenue mobilization,
and banking sector regulations. However, the
budget process and expenditure execution
still exhibit considerable shortcomings, the
central bank still faces political pressures that
can inhibit monetary policy independence,
and efforts to further strengthen governance
and transparency in extractive industries
(forestry, mining, oil) is lagging in the
publication of contracts for the sale of stateowned assets. Better governance and
transparency in extractive industries is
essential to improve the business climate,
maximize the benefits to the country
generated by its natural resource wealth, and
garner donor support for the DRC’s economic
development, without which, the objectives of
the IMF-supported program may not be
achievable.

Annex III. International Competitiveness
1.
The recent improvement in
macroeconomic stability and the fiscal
position have had a positive impact on the
business climate, although a number of
factors still make it a difficult
environment to operate in, inhibiting
economic development. Factors beyond
the level of the real effective exchange rate
(REER) play a prominent role.


While the REER has appreciated over the
past several years—largely reflecting
terms of trade movements—it is
probably not overvalued (Figure III.1).
The Consultative Group on Exchange
Rate (CGER) methodologies suggest the
REER could be about 3–6 percent above
its equilibrium value but with wide
margins of uncertainty surrounding these
estimates—given data limitations for the
DRC—it is reasonable to assume it is
probably not out of line with the
fundamentals.



The DRC continues to rank near the
bottom in cross-country comparisons of
the ease of doing business because of
administrative complexities (red tape),
concerns over governance and
corruption, and inefficient and distorted
tax policies (Figure III.2). Moreover, the
lack of reliable energy supply,
transportation networks, social services,
and a low level of human capital are
significant impediments to developing
the non-resource oriented export sector.



The absence of credit information, a
weak judiciary, and poor legal rights
seriously limit the capacity of the
banking system to provide credit to the
economy. In addition, the available credit
comes at a relatively high cost and shortterm maturity, further constraining the
optimal allocation of resources to
medium- to long-term investment
projects.

Annex IV. Technical Assistance to the DRC
1.
During the past few years, the DRC
has received extensive technical assistance
(TA) from the IMF to strengthen its
institutional and administrative capacity
and will continue to do so in the coming
few years.
2.
The focus of TA to the central bank
and financial sector is on (i) strengthened
banking supervision, by means of improved
collection and validation of data, and
subsequent reporting (including training in on
site inspections of banks and financial crisis
prevention. i.e., stress testing);
(ii) strengthened internal audit and
accounting, notably through the migration of
accounts to IFRS; (iii) enhanced capacity for
monetary operations and liquidity
management through forecasting and
improvement of the monetary instruments
and their usage; and (iv) improved cash
management, through improvements to the
infrastructure for the production and
distribution of banknotes.
3.
These efforts are complemented
with TA to enhance the legal framework
for the banking sector, notably through
support in drafting a new central bank law
and a new commercial bank law, to be
presented to Parliament later this year.
4.
In fiscal policy, the authorities have
been moving methodically, if unevenly,
forward to put in place their Strategic Plan
for Public Finance Reform with TA from
the IMF, World Bank, and development
partners. Supporting the new finance law and
in concert with the strategic plan, significant
TA has been provided to address a number of
weaknesses in public accounting,

expenditure-chain management, the budget
framework, and other aspects of PFM. A key
element includes efforts to improve the fiscal
planning process by moving towards a
medium-term budget framework, with
expenditure priorities guided by the new
PRSP.
5.
A three-year IMF TA program
covering different aspects of the
management of the natural resource sector
began in the first half of 2012, financed by
the Managing Natural Resource Wealth
Topical Trust Fund. This program will assist
the authorities in improving macrofiscal
management and modeling over the
medium-term, including revenue
administration and tax policy reforms. The
initial advice includes establishing an
independent macrofiscal forecasting unit,
centralizing collection of taxes from extractive
industries, simplifying and clarifying the tax
code, and developing modeling tools to
improve fiscal projections. These tools will
also feed into the broader macroeconomic
framework and could be used to gain a better
understanding of the growth and revenue
vulnerabilities the DRC faces because of
commodity price volatility.
6.
The IMF is also providing TA to
improve the quality of statistics, in
particular national accounts and balance of
payment data.

Annex V. Reserve Adequacy Estimates from the IMF Template
1.
A statistical analysis conducted
across sub-Saharan Africa suggests the
adverse impact of external shocks is larger
in resource exporters than others, and
confirms the effectiveness of reserves in
preventing and mitigating the effect of
these shocks. Ninety-six percent of its
exports come from the extractive industries,
mainly copper, cobalt, diamonds, gold, and
oil. As a large resource exporter, the DRC
should hold above-average levels of
international reserves.

against their carrying cost. It estimates both
the likelihood and the scale of a drop in
domestic demand in a country and compares
the benefits of holding additional reserves in
containing declining demand with the costs of
holding additional reserves (the potential
returns on foregone investment less the
returns earned on liquid foreign assets).
3.
In the staff’s view, the DRC might
be encouraged to target reserves above
the range for two reasons: (i) the price
movements of the country’s mineral exports
are highly correlated thus making terms-oftrade shocks potentially more severe, and
(ii) total U.S. dollar deposits in the banking
system are currently larger than gross
reserves, so the coincidence of a sudden run
on the banking system and external shock,
would constrain the BCC in its ability to act as
a lender of last resort (Figure V.1).

2.
Using the IMF’s reserve adequacy
template for resource-exporting lowincome countries, the staff estimates that
the DRC should hold gross reserves equal
to between 10 and 24.7 weeks of non-aidrelated imports, compared with the end2011 level of 7.7 weeks as shown in
Figure V.1. This estimate is based on 2012
data and applying an unconditional
probability of shocks of 0.5. The methodology
balances the risk-reducing effects of reserves

Annex VI. Fiscal Implications of Current Mining-Sector Tax Policies
1.
The Fiscal Analysis of Resource
Industries (FARI) model developed by the
IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department helps shed
light on the fiscal implications of the DRC’s
tax policies in the mining sector. For a large
copper-cobalt project that began in 2006–07
(the project is not identified for reasons of
confidentiality), the model demonstrates how
these policies result in a non-linear profile for
fiscal revenue generated by the project.
2.
In the early stage of development,
accelerated depreciation allows the
company to deduct 60 percent of capital
expenditures in the year the investment is
made, which typically leads to large losses
for tax purposes in the first few years. The
firm can then carry forward losses for up to
five years that offset taxable income, with the
result that it has not paid any profit-based
taxes (i.e., corporate income tax, dividend

withholding tax, and the state’s participation
share) up to this point, though it has
contributed to the treasury through royalties,
customs duties, and payroll taxes.
3.
However, beyond the initial
development phase, profit-based taxes
increase significantly, with the total
revenue collected by the state only
reaching its peak—possibly as high as
US$900 million a year—a couple of
decades after the start of the project. Given
that many of the largest mining projects
began investing heavily only in the past
five years this highly non-linear profile helps
to explain why the mining sector’s
contribution to fiscal revenue in the DRC is
relatively low, when compared with its share
of GDP.

Annex VII. Improving Domestic Fuel Pricing
1.
Under the current fuel pricing
regime in the DRC, retail prices of gasoline,
diesel, and kerosene are administratively
determined and should be adjusted
according to a fuel pricing mechanism, but
the issue is politicized and adjustments
subject to political interference. This results
in an ad hoc approach to adjusting fuel prices,
leading to volatility in domestic fuel prices
and tax revenue. The adoption of an
automatic pricing mechanism is intended to
reduce this volatility and prevent a sustained
decrease in revenue, should international fuel
prices continue to increase over a prolonged
period.
2.
The current pricing formula
determines retail prices for the main fuel
products as the sum of fuel import costs,
storage and distribution margins, and net
fuel taxes. Less than full pass-through of
increases in world oil prices has been
achieved by varying the excise tax
component, which is derived from the “fiscal
price” (or PMFF) rather than the import price
(PMFC).1 Revenue volatility arising from the
application of this price structure has been
significant over the past several years. Net
taxes, measured as the difference between
the retail price and the sum of the CIF import
price and margins (including distribution
costs), were about 1.1 percent of GDP in 2006
and only 0.6 percent of GDP in 2010, before
1

Under the current law, a rule specifies fuel prices
should be adjusted whenever a key variable (i.e.,
exchange rate, import price, margin costs) changes by
more than 5 percent. However, often when the rule
requires a price adjustment, there is political
resistance and prices are not adjusted according to
the rule.

50

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

rising to 0.8 percent of GDP in 2011 after
several retail price increases.
3.
Another way to view the revenue
impact of the current fuel pricing policy is
to measure it relative to a (hypothetical)
target. For example, we can calculate the
target net taxes by setting the target excise
rate for gasoline and diesel at 7.5 percent of
the import price and for kerosene at
4.5 percent.2 We can then estimate the fiscal
cost as the difference between the target net
taxes and the actual net taxes collected. This
implies the fiscal cost of the current pricing
regime rose from approximately zero in 2006
to over 0.8 percent of GDP in 2008; a year
when the government’s total revenue was
18.5 percent of GDP. Although the estimated
fiscal cost was lower in 2009 (relative to GDP)
as prices were adjusted, it rose again in 2010
and 2011 to roughly the 2008 level
(Figure VII.1.).

Automatic Fuel Pricing Mechanisms
4.
The trade-off between retail price
volatility and fiscal cost is a fundamental
concern when designing an automatic fuel
pricing mechanism because policymakers
2

Target net taxes = customs duty + sales tax + target
excise tax. The target excise tax = statutory rate*fiscal
price (PMFF) and fiscal price = 0.3*import price
(PMFC), for effective target excise tax rates of 7.5
(gasoline and diesel) and 4.5 percent (kerosene).
Statutory rates for the excise (or consumption) tax are
25 percent of the fiscal price (PMFF) for gasoline and
diesel, and 15 percent for kerosene. The target for the
PMFF at 30 percent of the PMFC was discussed as a
possible structural benchmark in the context of the
DRC program, thus it is used here for illustrative
purposes.

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

in many countries attach great importance
to shielding poor households from price
hikes. Consequently, while an automatic fuel
pricing mechanism should ensure full pass
through of international price changes over
the medium term to limit the fiscal cost of
fuel pricing policy and its distortionary effects,
it can also be designed to smooth short-term
price movements.
5.
Agreement on the appropriate level
of taxes, distribution margins, and how
import price fluctuations are passed
through to retail prices is essential for the
implementation of an automatic pricing
mechanism. Several elements are needed
here including specification of the price
structure (or formula) for each product, the
frequency of parameter adjustments, and a
rule that determines the magnitude and
timing of retail price changes.
6.
Two popular options for short-term
price smoothing are moving average (MA,
based on the average of past prices) and
price band mechanisms (PB, using an
upper limit or cap on price adjustments).
Regardless of type, any price smoothing
mechanism should work symmetrically to be
effective and credible. Simulations can
provide insights into the inherent trade-offs in
the (2, 4, and 6 month) moving averages and
(3, 5, and 10 percent) price band mechanisms.
7.
We compare the simulations of the
MA and PB mechanisms to the simulation
of the full pass-through case, where there
is no short-term price smoothing, and to
the DRC’s historical fuel pricing policy. The
historical series reflects the actual evolution of
import prices, margins, and net taxes. The
initial margins and taxes for the simulations
correspond to the actual price structure in

January 2006. Additionally, the simulations are
based on the assumption that margins are
adjusted semiannually and that net taxes are
adjusted semiannually but not at the same
time as the margins, to account for the impact
of inflation in eroding the real value of the
initial nominal (per liter) tax level.
8.
The simulations show that both
types of smoothing mechanisms can
reduce the volatility of domestic retail
price changes relative to full pass-through
and also prevent the large and sudden
price increases experienced under the
current approach to fuel pricing. Table VII.1
shows that rankings of volatility measures for
retail prices are lower for the price smoothing
mechanisms than for the full pass-through
and historical (actual) regimes.3 Figure VII.2
further illustrates the point that price
smoothing mechanisms can reduce retail
price volatility relative to full pass-through
and the historical fuel pricing policy,
especially for temporary sharp increases in
import prices: full pass-through in mid-2008
would have resulted in a much higher price
level than under a smoothing mechanism. In
addition, most smoothing mechanisms also
avoid the sharp price increases experienced
under the historical regime.
9.
Smoothing mechanisms can also
generate higher, though not necessarily
less volatile, tax levels compared with the
current fuel pricing policy. Some of these
mechanisms can generate relatively low retail3

The rankings for each individual volatility measure
(e.g., standard deviation of prices or taxes) are relative
to the other mechanisms and the overall ranking is
based on the sum of rankings across volatility
measures.

price volatility but at a cost of higher tax
volatility. For example, the 3 percent price
band (PB3) and 6-month moving average
(MA6) mechanisms are the best two for
minimizing price volatility, but the worst two
for minimizing tax volatility (Table VII.1).
However, more volatility does not necessarily
come at the expense of lower revenue: the
simulations indicate that the net tax per liter
from smoothing mechanisms is higher than
that of the historical realizations in almost
every month of the sample period
(Figure VII.3).

the total fiscal cost of the current policy
exceeds 2.8 percent of GDP, whereas the PB3
mechanism’s total fiscal cost is less than
0.8 percent of GDP, meaning revenue under
the current policy is 200 billion CGF lower
than it would have been if the government
had employed the PB3 mechanism in
2006–11.5

10.
When considering the most
appropriate smoothing mechanism, it is
important to balance price and tax
volatility concerns. Table VII.1 presents the
price and tax volatility rankings of each
mechanism and an overall ranking of the
mechanisms (see footnote 5). The 3 percent
PB mechanism scores the best overall rank
while the historical realizations of the current
policy score the worst. Notably, the full-passthrough mechanism is also demonstrably
superior to the status quo.
11.
Relative to the current policy and
given the assumptions for generating the
simulations, the PB3 mechanism
substantially reduces retail price volatility
(one of the government’s stated priorities),
and has a lower fiscal cost during the
sample period (Table VII.2).4 Over 2006–11,
4

The monthly fiscal cost per liter of each mechanism
is calculated as the difference between the monthly
net tax level for the mechanism and the full passthrough net tax level. The fiscal cost for the historical
series therefore depends in part on the margin and
net tax target assumptions made for the full passthrough simulation. These assumptions differ from
those used to estimate the fiscal cost by fuel type
shown in Figure VII.1.

influence money demand through marketbased instruments is impaired because
they affect mainly small balances in local
currency in the formal banking system.
Dollar deposits as share of total deposits
exceed 90 percent—a very high level even
compared with other dollarized
economies—with a formal banking system
that is itself small. Less than 1 percent of
the population has access to a commercial
bank (World Bank, 2010). Excluded from
the banking system the population is by
and large insensitive to changes in interest
rates. The dominant sectors of the
economy (export-oriented industries of
which extractive industries account for
98 percent of total exports) and financial
services are largely immune to exchange
rate fluctuations, and the BCC’s policy rate
does little to affect dollar-denominated
credits to the economy. The formal localcurrency economy is relatively small and
dominated by the public sector.
Consequently, the fiscal stance has a
disproportionately large influence on
monetary developments, and fiscal policy
is outside the control of the central bank.
The lack of financial and operational
independence of the BCC leads to multiple
and conflicting objectives. The BCC’s
reliance on government resources exposes
it to political interference, and politicizes
its decision-making, especially in periods

of high inflation when interest rates on
central bank bills and thus the cost of open
market operations increase. The financial
situation is further exacerbated by the slow
progress in the BCC’s structural reforms to
reduce its structural deficit and to focus on
its core mandate. Furthermore, poor and
infrequent economic data inhibits
monetary policy to accurately fine-tune
monetary interventions and to be proactive to changes in inflation. Finally,
shallow financial markets slow the
monetary transmission mechanism and
delay the impact on inflation.1
2.
Among options to improve the
effectiveness of monetary policy,
improvements to the current monetary
policy regime are preferable to changing
the monetary policy regime altogether. The
institutional reforms required to improve the
effectiveness of the current monetary policy
framework are significant, and it will take years
if not a decade or more before dollarization
declines and financial markets develop to such
an extent that monetary policy becomes highly
effective and independent. Nonetheless, staff
argues that this is still the most viable option
for the DRC for several reasons:


Seeking to borrow the credibility of a
foreign central bank through a fixed peg in
the context of weak institutions and a
short track record of macroeconomic
discipline makes the currency vulnerable to

countries (48 percent of GDP).

speculative attacks. Abandoning a peg
would further harm the weak credibility of
the central bank.


By opting for a stronger fixed peg—a
currency board or full dollarization—the
DRC would require US$2–4 billion, or the
equivalent of the domestic currency and
whatever level of international reserves the
authorities consider necessary to fulfill its
lender of last resort function. Under the
current circumstances of a tight budget
and closed international financial markets,
the DRC does not seem to be able to raise
such large amounts of capital.



The DRC’s exports are concentrated in a
few commodities with historically volatile
prices. Under the current monetary policy
regime the DRC keeps the option of a real
devaluation to partially absorb external
shocks and thus limit the adverse impact
on growth and employment. This option
would be lost with any type of fixed
exchange rate regime.



A fixed exchange rate can conflict with a
low inflation target if the real exchange
rate appreciates as a result of a rapid
productivity growth in the tradable sector.



Finally, the DRC is undergoing profound
structural changes. Its economy will
eventually diversify and its export markets
will develop. A fixed exchange rate would
lock the country into a currency which may
not be optimal at future stages of
development.

3.
To improve the effectiveness of
monetary policy in the long run, a number
of reforms will be needed to strengthen the

58

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

independence of the central bank and its
focus on its core mandate, improve the
central bank’s data availability and research
capacity, deepen financial markets, as well
as to encourage de-dollarization. These
improvements would enable a more flexible
and modernized monetary policy framework,
anchored by a coherent forward-looking view
where monetary aggregates are monitored
and analyzed systematically along with a broad
array of other macroeconomic and financial
indicators, including inflation, output, interest
rates, and the exchange rate. As most of these
reforms will take time, the current constraints
to an effective and independent monetary
policy are likely to remain for some time.
4.
Measures that encourage rather
than force de-dollarization are likely to be
the most effective. Even with continued
macroeconomic stability international
experience shows that dollarization will take
years or decades to reverse. The preferable
market based de-dollarization measures (socalled pull factors) could include strengthening
liquidity management and instruments
through the introduction of medium term
paper in local currency; and shifting most
government transactions into local currency;
issuing bank notes with higher denominations
to reduce transactions costs and ease the
physical use of local currency for larger
transactions. Forced de-dollarization measures
(push factors), such as mandatory use of local
currency or regulations against the use of
foreign currency should be avoided because
they may result in capital outflows rather than
de-dollarization. Along the same lines, reserve
requirements that match the currency
composition of deposits may be needed for
prudential reasons, even though they further
reduce the use of the local currency.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The currency of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is the Congo franc. The
de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating, although the IMF classifies the Congo
franc as an “other managed arrangement”. At end-June 2012, the rate was
US$1=CF 919.32.
Effective February 10, 2003, the DRC accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2 (a), 3, and 4, of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement; however, the
DRC maintains measures that give rise to one exchange rate restriction and one
multiple currency practice subject to Fund approval. The exchange restriction involves
an outstanding net debt position against other contracting members under the
inoperative regional payments agreement with the Economic Community of the Great
Lakes Countries. The multiple currency practice relates to a fixed exchange rate set
quarterly applying to transactions through a bilateral payments agreement with
Zimbabwe.
Last Article IV Consultation:
Consultations with the DRC are held in accordance with the provisions of the 2010
Decision on consultation cycles approved in September 2010. The last Article IV
consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on December 11, 2009.
Safeguards Assessment:
An update safeguards assessment of the Banque Centrale du Congo (BCC) was
completed in April 2010, which found that while most of the 2008 recommendations
had been implemented, significant risks remained. The BCC continued to lack
autonomy from the government and was in need of recapitalization, and the absence

of an independently defined financing reporting framework continued to impair
transparency. The BCC agreed broadly with the priority recommendations of the
assessment, and has since initiated important reforms. In March 2011, the Ministry of
Finance completed the first phase of the BCC’s recapitalization, bringing its net worth
to zero. Additionally, the BCC believes that they are still on target to issue their 2012

III. STATISTICAL ISSUES
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision to the Fund is broadly adequate for surveillance and program monitoring
purposes, but upgrades to the national accounts, balance of payments, and government finance
statistics would be helpful. In spite of difficulties, the authorities have continued to produce an array
of economic and financial statistics, most of which are published in the annual report of the Central
Bank of the Congo (BCC) or its monthly statistical bulletin.
National accounts: Annual national accounts are compiled in constant and current prices by the
Directorate of Research of the BCC and published yearly. The compilation methodology conforms to
the System of National Accounts 1968 (1968 SNA) and is based on the balance sheets of enterprises
and surveys of public and semipublic enterprises and agencies, most of which date from the late
1980s. The activities of the traditional sector (including the informal sector) are estimated with
extrapolation techniques using industry-specific data that are outdated. As a result, GDP is likely to be
underestimated.
With assistance from AFRITAC, work on the national accounts is underway to update the base year to
2005, incorporate the results of the 2004/5 1-2–3 household survey, as well as implement the
methodological recommendations of the 1993 SNA. While outputs of this work remain to be
validated and officially published, as expected, the 2005 GDP estimates show a considerable upward
revision compared to previously published estimates.
Price statistics: Consumer price indices (CPI) are calculated for Kinshasa by the BCC, the National
Statistics Institute (INS), the Institute of Economic and Social Research (IESR), and the Economics
Section of the U.S. Embassy in Kinshasa. In December 2010, the BCC adopted a new harmonized-CPI
index for Kinshasa based on the 2004/05 1-2-3 household survey. In 2012, the INS began publishing
a national CPI index, based upon the 2004/05 1-2-3 household survey and prices prevailing in
provincial capitals .
Government finance statistics: The BCC produces aggregated monthly statistics on a cash basis
based on its own accounting for the government cash operations. The treasury produces two sets of
monthly statistics based on its own records: one relates to the transactions executed through the BCC,
the other set attempts to consolidate operations through commercial bank accounts and off-budget
operations. These statistics do not rely on an integrated double-entry public accounting system and
do not provide sufficient details about the nature of expenditures owing to problems in the
expenditure chain. However, the treasury has started to produce quarterly expenditure data reports
by ministry and institution.
The current work on tax administration and expenditure control is expected to improve the quality
and timeliness of fiscal statistics. In parallel with technical assistance on public expenditure
management, a STA multisector statistics advisor has been advising on government finance statistics,
producing improvements in the quality of the statistics. Furthermore, adoption of a simplified doubleentry bookkeeping system should significantly improve the availability of data on government
financial operations.
In 2003 the DRC reported annual data up to 2002 for the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook in the format of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 but has not reported
subsequently. However, work is underway to resume submission of data to the GFSY, beginning with
data for 2010.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

Monetary statistics: The BCC Directorate of Statistics regularly produces timely monetary statistics.
These statistics are now generally reliable but some minor problems remain with the classification of
accounts.
Since STA money and banking statistics mission of June 2000, BCC reporting of data for publication in
the IMF’s International Financial Statistics (IFS) has improved and monetary data are currently
reported on time. A 2003 multisector statistics mission recommended a new chart of accounts for the
BCC and other deposit-taking institutions, including the information needed for improved
sectorization of economic units and classification of financial assets. The new chart of accounts for the
central bank was applied beginning in 2007 and the new chart of accounts for commercial banks was
applied in January 2011. The August 2009 MFS mission developed the new standardized report form
(SRF) 1SR on central bank data. The December 2010 MFS mission developed the SRF 2SR on
commercial bank data based on the past chart of accounts up to December 2010. The August 2011
mission developed and almost finalized SRF 2SR on commercial banks data based on the new chart of
accounts. At this stage, source data from commercial banks are not fully reliable as respondents do
not completely master the new sectoral chart of accounts yet. Also, some inconsistencies in reciprocal
claims and liabilities between SRF 1SR and SRF 2SR must be reduced. An MFS mission, scheduled in
FY2013, should occur by end-2012 and will help finalize the official migration to the SRFs format for
data on central bank and data on other depository corporations, commercial banks at least.
Balance of payments: Annual balance of payments statistics are compiled with information on the
exports and imports of large public and semipublic enterprises, BCC payment records, and a survey of
the foreign operations of residents. The estimates also take account of information on the informal
sector and foreign aid flows provided by the World Bank and the local UN Development Program
office, which collects the data from the European Union, embassies, and nongovernmental
organizations. In effect balance of payments statistics are compiled using data from different sources,
supplemented by estimates. However, in September 2010, the authorities took decision to create an
interministerial committee, lead by the central bank and also including representatives from customs,
and the National Statistics Institute and key sectors, to improve the collection and the validation of
balance of payment data and ensure its regular publication. No external sector data are reported to
STA for publication.

Data Standards and Quality

Since April 24, 2004, the DRC participates in the General Data Dissemination System. The metadata
needs to be updated.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with the
Democratic Republic of the Congo
On September 24, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the 2012 Article IV consultation with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).1
Background
In the past few years, economic performance in the DRC has shown marked improvement
although progress in alleviating poverty and meeting the Millennium Development Goals has
lagged. Prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms have underpinned this
performance and led to the DRC receiving debt relief under the enhanced Heavily Indebted
Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative in mid-2010.
The DRC’s weak financial linkages with the euro area countries have largely shielded it from the
turmoil there, allowing real gross domestic product (GDP) growth to expand by about 7 percent
in 2010–11. Strong trade and investment inflows from non-European countries, driven mainly by
the mining sector, have provided the main impetus to growth. Inflation was well above the
single-digit target of the Central Bank of the Congo (BCC) in 2011 largely because of external
factors, but has recently slowed to about 10 percent through July 2012.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

The external sector improved significantly as a result of HIPC debt relief but the DRC remains at
high risk of debt distress because of its vulnerability to the volatile terms of trade, high import
dependency on food and capital goods, and a narrow export base. Weak debt management
also increases the risk of again accumulating an unsustainable level of debt. The current
account deficit widened in 2011 to about 11½ percent of GDP as commodity prices weakened
from their high levels in 2010 and the value of imports increased, especially for food, fuel, and
capital goods.
Macroeconomic policies have provided strong support to recent performance, with the DRC
having rebuilt many of its buffers. In particular, fiscal dominance has been reduced over the
past few years, owing to the government’s expenditure discipline and commitment to zero (net)
financing of the budget from the BCC. This has helped break a vicious inflation-exchange rate
depreciation cycle and brought the domestic fiscal deficit down from 2½ percent of GDP in 2009
to a projected deficit of 0.9 percent of GDP in 2012. Strong expenditure discipline has been an
essential element in the authorities’ efforts to achieve consolidation, which was necessary in the
context of the limited external financial support to the DRC—reflecting donors concerns over
governance, especially in the natural resource sector—and slow progress in raising more
domestic revenue. Recently, however, weaknesses in the budget process, inflated revenue
projections, and a corresponding large expenditure envelope pose a risk to fiscal credibility and
point to the need to bolster and better entrench public financial management reforms.
The improvement in the fiscal situation has also helped the BCC control liquidity and fight
inflation. The BCC aims at containing inflation through the issuance of central bank bills but data
and capacity problems as well as political pressures have made it hesitant at times to
proactively tighten monetary policy.
Although progress in structural reform has been mixed, some reforms in key areas are
supportive of better economic performance. These include efforts to improve public financial
management, strengthen governance and transparency in the natural resource sector, and
enhance the BCC’s independence and financial stability and development of the financial sector
more generally. Still, other reforms have lagged and new issues have emerged, including
weaknesses in external debt management (emergence of external payments arrears) and
accountability and transparency in the operations of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in
extractive industries. These weaknesses could undermine recent progress and have contributed
to the delay in completing the fourth and fifth reviews under the authorities’ Extended Credit
Facility arrangement.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the authorities’ improved macroeconomic management, which
contributed to higher growth, lower inflation, and a stronger external position. However, poverty
remains widespread, the economy is vulnerable to domestic and external risks, and program

3
delays are cause for concern. Directors called for steadfast efforts to preserve fiscal credibility,
strengthen the monetary policy framework, and improve the governance of extractive industries.
Directors commended the authorities’ progress in consolidating the fiscal position, supported by
the commitment to forgo financing of the fiscal deficit from the central bank. They encouraged
the authorities to maintain this fiscal anchor but expressed concern that the 2012 budget
threatened hard-won credibility gains. Accordingly, they called for monitoring budget execution
rigorously, reducing discretionary spending if revenue projections fail to materialize, and making
further efforts to increase domestic revenues, particularly from extractive industries. Directors
also encouraged the authorities to strengthen debt management and consider external
borrowing only at highly concessional terms.
Directors encouraged the central bank to manage liquidity tightly to further dampen inflation
expectations and guard against second-round effects from the recent increase in global food
and fuel prices. They also agreed that completion of recapitalization, divestment of non-core
activities, and greater operational transparency would strengthen central bank independence
and improve the effectiveness of monetary policy.
Directors considered that the current monetary framework and floating exchange rate regime
remain appropriate. However, given the high level of dollarization and the central bank’s limited
ability to act as lender of last resort in the event of a deposit run, a further build up of
international reserves is warranted. While the external sector has improved recently, the country
remains vulnerable to external shocks due to its narrow export base and lack of access to
international capital markets.
Directors noted that the financial sector is underdeveloped, limiting financial intermediation and
the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. They advised the authorities to improve bank
supervision, enforcement of prudential requirements, data quality, and the central bank’s
analytical capacity. Directors welcomed the authorities’ request to participate in the Financial
Sector Assessment Program.
Directors emphasized that efforts to improve governance and transparency in extractive
industries, and the business climate more generally, must be stepped up if the country is to
maximize the benefits of its vast natural resource wealth. In particular, the authorities must
move quickly to address gaps recently exposed by the commercialization of state-owned
enterprises in the natural resource sector.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Kossi Assimaidou, Executive Director
for the Democratic Republic of the Congo
September 24, 2012
The authorities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) highly appreciate the
strong cooperation with the IMF and are thankful to the Executive Board, Management
and Staff for the continued assistance provided to their country. In particular, Fund’s
technical assistance to the DRC has been of critical importance to the improvements in
macroeconomic performance. They look forward to continued assistance to help them in
their efforts to further strengthen the country’s institutional and administrative capacities.
Significant progress in macroeconomic and structural policies has been achieved since
the last Article IV consultation. Macroeconomic stability has been enhanced, notably
through continued fiscal consolidation, a significant decline in inflation, and continued
buildup of international reserves, despite a challenging external environment. In addition,
strong efforts have been made in the area of governance and transparency in extractive
industries (e.g., over hundred of contracts in the mining sector have been published)
albeit few delays related to security concerns. Enhancing the central bank (BCC)’s
capacity to meet its core mandate—where advances have also been made—remains in the
authorities’ structural reform agenda.
The authorities welcome and broadly agree with staff’s assessments and analyses. This
Article IV consultation—which focuses more on medium-term challenges—comes at an
opportune time when the DRC is moving from urgent post-conflict policies to more
sustainable economic development. In this vein, the authorities, in consultation with
various stakeholders, have prepared a second-generation poverty reduction strategy
document (PRSP-2) which, while building on the first PRSP, places more emphasis on
growth, employment and the impact of climate change. The strategy seeks to achieve,
among others, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2020.
RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK

The assessment that macroeconomic performance in the DRC has been strong during
2010–11 amid a weak global economy and limited external financial support should be
recognition of the authorities’ sound macroeconomic policies and efforts made in
meeting their program objectives. Their actions in ensuring adequate macroeconomic
buffers have been underpinned by favorable commodity prices and translated into broadbased activity as the mining sector but also the construction and services sectors have
largely contributed to growth since 2010. Inflation continues to be reigned in despite high
prices of imported food and fuel. The external sector remains vulnerable due to a number
of factors, including high imports of food and capital goods.
On the fiscal front, significant progress has been made. Fiscal consolidation has been the
main objective, with strong measures taken to restrain spending. At the same time,
structural reforms to enhance public financial management and natural resource
management have been undertaken and are being pursued. The steps taken, including the

2
commitment to zero (net) financing from the BCC has brought the fiscal deficit down
from 2½ percent of GDP in 2009 to a projected deficit of 0.9 percent of GDP in 2012,
and has been instrumental in lowering inflation and stopped the inflation-exchange rate
depreciation cycle. For 2012, the budget has been elaborated by the authorities to respond
to the tremendous needs facing the Congolese economy and population. Nevertheless, for
the rest of 2012, the authorities will execute spending only as revenue becomes available
in accordance with clearly set priorities.
Technical support from the IMF, the World Bank and other partners has been
instrumental in the progress made on some structural fronts, notably public finance
reforms (through the Strategic Plan for Public Finance Reform), fiscal planning,
macrofiscal forecasting, steps toward a medium-term budget framework, and governance
measures in the natural resource sector. Efforts by the BCC are also underway to
strengthen financial supervision, deepen banking sector development, enhance its own
financial situation through a recently completed pension reform, and eliminate non-core
activities such as the management of a hospital center and real estate.
Despite a relatively positive short-term outlook, the DRC authorities recognize that the
tail risks facing this economy—weaker global demand, falling commodity prices, and
even an aggravated conflict in eastern provinces—argue for further strengthening
macroeconomic buffers. They have drawn lessons from the experience of the global
financial crisis that hit the country’s economy in 2009, and continue to build a stronger
position to absorb external shocks. On the external front, the DRC authorities will strive
to eliminate inefficient public investment financed by external resources and which
accentuate the high debt risk.
MEDIUM-TERM POLICIES
Poverty Reduction Strategy for 2011–15
The authorities’ actions over the medium term will be guided by their new PRSP.
Building on macroeconomic stability and good economic performance of recent years,
the authorities will implement a poverty reduction strategy based on an ambitious
medium-term framework that would be underpinned by greater expansion of the natural
resource and agriculture sectors as well as efforts to enhance infrastructure, notably in the
transport, energy and telecommunication sectors.
Employment is at the core of the country’s strategy. In implementing this strategy,
particular emphasis is being put on demographic, education, health and social protection
issues, with the view to strengthen human capital. At the same time, actions to further
improve governance and the business environment are needed to attract private sector
investment.
My authorities are appreciative of the encouragements from Fund and World Bank staffs,
and welcome their recommendations to strengthen the PRSP-2, including in the areas of
macroeconomic policies, institutional capacities, sectoral priorities, resource allocations,
and implementation risk.

3
Establishing a Fiscal Policy Anchor
The authorities view the zero central bank financing of the budget as a key objective in
managing public finances. They will continue to control expenditures and make full use
of the recent fiscal reforms (value-added tax, strengthened capacity of the large taxpayer
unit, one-stop customs window, improved information technology systems) to raise
highly needed domestic revenue.
The DRC authorities look forward to continued Fund technical assistance to help them
realize the potential of the natural resource sector, further improve public financial
management and enhance the quality of spending. Regarding the fuel price mechanism,
they intend to reform it, fully cognizant of its propensity to be subjected to political
pressures and to generate volatile fuel prices and tax revenue. They are reflecting on the
automatic price-smoothing mechanisms proposed by staff, which have significant
advantages over the current policy in terms of retail price volatility and fiscal costs.
Enhancing the Effectiveness of Monetary Policy
The authorities welcome staff’s assessment of the factors that hamper the efficacy of
monetary policy, and share such evaluation. They confirm their commitment to the
current monetary and exchange rate regime which is better adapted to the country’s
circumstances and necessary ability to absorb exogenous shocks. They share the
recommendations detailed in Annex VIII of the report, aimed at strengthening the
independence of the central bank, enhancing its data and analytical capacity, deepening
financial markets and encouraging de-dollarization.
Structural Reforms to Bolster Economic Resilience
The DRC economy remains vulnerable to external shocks but also to internal
developments. The authorities agree on the need to enhance both the resilience of the
financial sector and the business environment. They welcome staff’s recommendations in
this regard and they intend to implement them with technical assistance from the Fund
and other partners. In particular, regarding the financial sector, the authorities requested a
financial sector evaluation under FSAP and will pursue stress testing to assess
vulnerabilities. They will also submit to parliament a new payment systems law aimed at
reducing transaction costs and developing the banking sector.
On extractive industries, the authorities have already implemented a number of measures
supported by the World Bank to strengthen governance in the natural resource sector, and
they have submitted the instruments to adhere to OHADA (Organization for the
Harmonization of African Business Law). The authorities will continue to build on the
good progress made in ensuring the sanctity of contracts and private property rights and
reviewing the mining code, to complete the governance and transparency agenda. They
remain committed to the timely publication of natural resource contracts. They have
expressed their intention to put in place measures to make commercially-run SOEs
accountable to the government as their sole shareholder, strengthen the legal and
regulatory framework applicable to the governance of those enterprises, and limit their

4
external financing to concessional resources with the view to safeguarding public debt
burden.
In conclusion, I would like to reaffirm my DRC authorities’ determination to pursue
steadfastly policies that are conducive to macroeconomic stabily, poverty reduction and
inclusive growth. They will continue to work closely with their development partners and
the Fund in the achievement of the objectives spelled out in their PRSP.
