STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 8, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context: Moderate growth is continuing; however credit and wage growth are weak.
The level of nonperforming loans (NPLs) remains high and public debt has risen sharply
in recent years.
Fiscal policy: Medium-term funding needs to roll over existing debt and to fund budget
deficits are large. A new highway, budgeted to cost about one quarter of GDP, will cause
deficits to widen and add to public debt. The draft 2015 budget shows appropriate
restraint on other spending, but a long period of strong fiscal discipline will be needed
to manage fiscal risks. Laying out clear long-term plans for managing the public finances
would boost credibility and reduce risks to market access. Fundamental expenditure
reform, especially of the pension system and the public sector wage bill, would be an
essential part of such plans.
Financial sector: The banking system’s liquidity appears comfortable; however,
profitability is low and lending spreads are high. Regulatory provisioning is set higher
than that reported under international accounting standards, but a wide range of
provisioning levels across banks and weak incentives to take losses remain concerns. A
more transparent and comprehensive reporting environment would be beneficial.
Reforms to ensure better enforcement of contracts and collateral would help bring down
structural lending risk premia.
Structural reform: Higher levels of labor participation and employment are needed to
boost potential growth and safeguard the public finances. Ensuring that wages adjust in
line with productivity alongside reforms to achieve better employment outcomes and
boost productivity would enhance the economy’s ability to respond to macroeconomic
shocks, and are even more important in a country that lacks its own currency and with
decreasing fiscal buffers.

CONTEXT
1.
Montenegro’s economy is highly dependent on tourism and FDI. It is suffering from
relatively high public debt, unprofitable state companies, high levels of NPLs, and ongoing bank
deleveraging. It faces challenges from an aging population and low employment. It is euroized and
therefore lacks independent monetary policy, while flexibility is weak owing to a relatively rigid labor
market. During the past two years, the government has implemented significant fiscal consolidation
measures. But it has also committed to a highway investment project, of which the first phase is
budgeted to cost EUR 809 million (24 percent of 2013 GDP) (Box 1).1 In December 2010,
Montenegro received official candidate status for EU accession; negotiations are ongoing.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
2.
Moderate growth is continuing. After contracting by 2½ percent in 2012, real GDP
rebounded by 3¼ percent last year, supported by increased hydro electricity production, growth in
tourism, and the commencement of several tourism-based investment projects. Preliminary data
indicates a sharp growth slowdown beginning in the second quarter of 2014. Construction activity
has decelerated, associated with delayed infrastructure projects (including the highway project).
Manufacturing production has contracted over the year to date, while electricity production has
slowed to more normal levels (Figure 1).
3.
The nominal side of the economy is weak. The CPI decreased steadily in 2014 through
October, mainly because of low international energy and food prices and weak inflation pressures in
the euro area. Average net earnings have been broadly flat since 2011 and bank credit has
retrenched through the first three quarters of 2014.

Box 1. Montenegro’s Highway Project
The Bar-Boljare Highway is a project to connect Bar, Montenegro’s main seaport, to the border of Serbia.
The authorities see major economic and non-economic benefits arising from the project, including regional
development, trade, road safety, and national security.
The authorities selected China Road and Bridge Cooperation (CRBC) and China ExIm Bank as the main
partners for the first stage of the project, to link the capital city Podgorica with the northern municipality
Kolašin. The agreement signed with CRBC stipulates a construction period of four years and 30 percent of
the investment to be subcontracted to domestic companies. Construction was to start in 2014, but is now
expected to begin in the spring of 2015.
ExIm Bank will provide 85 percent of the financing (EUR 688 million) as a 20 year loan, denominated in
dollars, with a fixed 2 percent interest rate and a six-year grace period. The government will provide the
remaining 15 percent of the project’s financing, from revenue over-performance, cuts in non-highway capital
spending, and/or additional borrowing. The government also intends to rely on tolls once the highway is
completed.

4.
Laudable fiscal adjustment was achieved in 2013, but public debt continues to increase
(Figure 2). Personal income tax (PIT) and value-added tax (VAT) rate hikes, a freeze on pensions,
efforts to increase tax compliance, and recovering economic activity contributed to a fiscal
adjustment of nearly 3 percent of GDP in 2013, despite large repayments of guarantees to the
aluminum producer KAP. This reduced the overall deficit to 3.3 percent of GDP and the primary
deficit to 1.1 percent (an overall balance of 0 and a primary surplus of 2.1 percent excluding the
repayment of loan guarantees). Nonetheless, public debt increased to 58 percent in 2013, double
the level of five years ago. Revenues in 2014 are expected to be higher than (conservatively)
budgeted; however, so are expenditures. Balances for the year as a whole will depend on
expenditure restraint in the last quarter.
5.
Underlying vulnerability in external balances remains. The economy has a narrow
production base and very high import penetration—the trade imbalance was 40 percent of GDP in
2013. The current account deficit has widened in the first nine months of 2014 by 1.2 percent of
GDP, mainly as a result of a worsening income balance, which deteriorated by about 1¼ percent,
and transfers, which fell by ½ percent. The deterioration of the net exports of goods was more than
offset by net increases on the service side. Net FDI inflows, which historically cover about 70 percent
of the deficit, decreased by 7 percent in the first nine months of 2014.

6.
The effects of the weakening Russian economy on the Montenegrin economy are as
yet unclear. Russians comprise almost ¼ of total foreign tourists, yet tourist arrivals have increased
by 1¼ percent through 2013:Q3.2 However, capital inflows associated with real estate—the bulk of
which historically originate from Russia—have fallen by 11 percent in the first ten months of 2014.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
7.
Growth momentum has slowed, but is
expected to pick up over the medium term.
Growth is projected to be only 2 percent in 2014,
but converges to an underlying growth rate of
3¼ percent by 2019. The expenditures on the
highway add more to growth in the near term.3
Inflation pressures will likely remain negligible
given low international commodity prices and
subdued EU inflation. The current account is
expected to widen as the base effects of strong
electricity exports last year dissipate.

Montenegro faces a number of external and domestic risks (see Risk Assessment Matrix):

2

Tourist numbers were down in June and July, but recovered in August, suggesting the downturn might have had
more to do with poor weather.
3

The highway is assumed to add about 2 percentage points to GDP growth in 2015, with corresponding base effects
as work finishes in 2018. The increase reflects the assumed domestic value added from the extra spending on the
highway, with a small contemporaneous spillover to aggregate demand. As this first stage of the project does not
connect the coast to the Serbian border, and population density is low in the area of construction, significant effects
on potential growth are not assumed.

But they could also signal even weaker external
demand that could counteract terms of trade benefits. If very persistent, they could also drive
down electricity prices (on which Montenegro is highly dependent). Reliance on inward capital
flows, and substantial public financing needs (even in the absence of the highway project),
expose Montenegro to shifts in risk aversion and disruptions to global financial markets. Public
debt will increase substantially as a result of the highway spending, and could escalate
substantially in the event of negative growth shocks, and cost overruns on the highway could
generate higher financing needs (see also ¶14 and Appendix I). External private debt is also large
and projected to increase further, making the country vulnerable to growth and terms of trade
shocks (Appendix II).



There are upside and downside domestic risks: Growth could be substantially higher if some
large-scale investment projects start earlier than anticipated and their spillovers to the domestic
economy are greater. Conversely, delays to the highway and an undersea power connection with
Italy could undermine growth. Demands for higher pensions and public sector wages have so far
been resisted, but there is a risk that fiscal discipline could relax (¶14).

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
9.
Major policy challenges include: (i) confronting significant risks to fiscal sustainability,
(ii) addressing the ongoing problems in the banking sector, and (iii) accelerating structural reforms
to boost growth potential and economic resilience.

4

Oil imports are substantial, at around 10 percent of total imports by value. Staff estimates that a persistent
25 percent reduction in oil prices would improve the current account deficit by about 2¼ percent of GDP relative to
the baseline projection. Energy accounts for 13 percent of the CPI basket.

A. Fiscal Policy: Safeguarding Debt Sustainability Amid Mounting Fiscal
Pressures
10.

The draft 2015 budget shows spending restraint. Compared to the 2014 budget:



nominal (central government) non-highway capital spending is reduced by 23 percent (around
EUR 24 million, which would result in a 0.8 percentage point improvement in the overall
balance), with cuts focused on non-essential spending (e.g., sports centers rather than
infrastructure);



transfers for social protection fall as a share of GDP by 0.4 percentage points (0.3 percentage
points from the fall in pension and disability, 0.1 percentage points from redundancy payments),
though they increase in nominal levels; and there are increases in transfers to institutions,
individuals, NGOs and the public sector (0.1 percentage points), and reserves (0.1 percentage
points);



no new revenue measures are introduced, although the authorities intend to continue measures
against the informal economy.5 Planned VAT changes are revenue neutral, but an additional tax
bracket makes the system somewhat more complicated.6

Staff estimates that the expenditure measures would result in a 0.9 percent improvement in the
overall balance when excluding highway spending (and assuming revenues stay constant as a share
of non-highway GDP).7,8
11.
However, the highway places a large burden on the public finances, more than
undoing the improvement in the fiscal balances over the past two years. Assuming that
revenue and non-highway expenditure policies in the 2015 budget are maintained through to 2019,
staff projects public debt to increase to around 69 percent of GDP in 2017, and to gradually decline
thereafter.9,10 The debt profile is particularly sensitive to the timing of expenditures—if highway
spending were to be more back-loaded, the peak debt ratio would not only be later but lower.

5

Tax revenues increased by 1ppt of GDP in 2013. The effects of administrative measures intended to reduce
informality, a VAT rate hike, and the post-crisis recovery are difficult to separate.
6

The current system has a standard 19 percent rate, a discounted 7 percent rate, and a full-exemption bracket. The
planned changes add two intermediate rates of 5 and 10 percent instead of the current 7 percent rate.
7

The highway will be exempt from VAT payments, fuel excise will apply at the lower rate, there will be no excises on
the import of machinery, and there is no requirement to pay PIT or contributions for foreign employees.
8

Note that rounding means that these numbers do not add up to the contribution of 0.9.

9

The profile of highway expenditures has not been finalized. Staff projections are based on the latest announced
schedule (EUR 206 million in 2015, EUR 253 million in 2016, EUR 303 million in 2017, and EUR 47 million in 2018).
10

In the absence of the highway, a primary surplus of 2.7 percent would have been expected from 2015; with the
highway, deficits of around 3 to 5 percent are incurred through 2015–2017.

12.
Medium-term funding needs are large. Substantial repayments of Eurobonds and
commercial bank loans to the state are due over the next five years, peaking at 8–9 percent of GDP
a year in 2015, 2016 and 2019. Demand for domestically-issued debt has been increasing, but
Montenegro will remain highly dependent on external funding. With the additional burden from
the highway, gross financing needs exceed 15 percent.
13.
Important progress in divesting from state-owned industries has been made, but is
not yet complete. Consistent with Fund advice, the authorities have finished payments arising
from KAP guarantees (amounting to 0.8 and 3.2 percent of GDP in 2012 and 2013), and have sold
the loss-making aluminum producer, KAP, but privatization payments have not been fully
received.11 The state is still involved in a number of smaller companies that it has tried, as yet
unsuccessfully, to sell, and other guarantees amounting to almost 10 percent of GDP remain.
14.


Hence, the public finances are subject to numerous risks:

Growth: Real GDP growth has historically been highly volatile, a particular concern for a
unilaterally euroized economy (Box 2). The accompanying DSA shows that debt would increase
to 86 percent of GDP following a one standard deviation shock to growth. The historical sample
includes the boom and bust; hence, the shock is large—4.9 percentage points—and arguably
not useful as a guide to likely future shocks. A 1ppt shock—as seen over the past year—would
increase debt to 72 percent of GDP.

11

Local company Uniprom signed a contract to buy KAP for EUR 28 million in June, and took over in July. However, it
received a two-month extension on payment at the time, and another six-month extension in September when it
paid EUR 4 million and provided a guarantee from BNP Paribas Bank for the remainder.

Box 2. Fiscal Policy in a Unilaterally Euroized Economy
Using another country’s currency provides for a strong monetary anchor and reduces administrative costs
associated with running an own currency. However, the arrangement puts a premium on disciplined fiscal
policies and flexibility to adjust to external shocks. With this in mind, some stylized facts of economies that
have unilaterally adopted another currency1 are notable:

First, Montenegro, along with other euroized and dollarized economies, has benefited from relatively
favorable interest rate-growth differentials. However, it has also experienced greater volatility of growth
rates. This is of particular concern as even brief, one-off growth shocks can erode much-needed fiscal
buffers and can have a lasting negative impact on debt sustainability.

Note: Averages over 2000-2013. The real interest rate is calculated from the effective nominal interest rate on gross government debt, deflat ed using the GDP deflator.

Second, public revenues are more volatile in dollarized economies than in their non-dollarized peers.
Regression analysis suggests that primary balances have typically not responded to debt or economic
conditions in dollarized economies. As boom years were not used to build sufficient buffers, these countries
often had to resort to pro-cyclical cuts, for instance in reaction to difficulties in market access. Hence,
dollarized and euroized economies have faced large increases in debts since the crisis.

These economies differ greatly in many respects, so caution should be exercised when drawing inferences
about policy. Nonetheless, their experiences suggest that they should aim for larger fiscal buffers than their
emerging market peers. Fiscal policy should also become more responsive to the business cycle, in particular
by using boom years to create policy space.



Financing: The successful issuance of a Eurobond earlier in 2014 alleviated short-term
pressures.12 However, Montenegro’s high reliance on foreign financing makes it vulnerable to
changes in market conditions as it rolls over existing loans. Financing needs for the highway are
mostly met by the ExIm loan.



Political economy: The government is coming under increased pressure to relax the freeze on
pensions and increase public sector wages.



Highway costs: Experiences of other highway projects show that delays are common and that
cost overruns can be sizeable.13 The dollar denomination of the ExIm loan creates exchange rate
risk that will be costly to hedge.

The offsetting measures in the
draft 2015 budget are appropriate, given
still-fragile growth, but a long period of
strong fiscal discipline will be needed.
The measures should be at least maintained
through the highway construction period, as
assumed in the Staff projections. This would
result in a primary surplus of 2.7 percent of
GDP in 2019, after highway construction is
finished (if no downside risks eventuate).
Staff advises maintaining current spending

A EUR 280 million Eurobond was issued in May 2014, at a coupon of 5½ percent, of which EUR 195 million was
used for budget financing and EUR 85 million to retire Eurobonds from 2010 and 2011. Domestic issuance of
Treasury bills totals EUR 180 million so far this year. Hence, estimated financing needs of EUR 343 million in 2014 are
covered. However, staff estimates financing needs to be higher in 2015, even aside from the highway.
13

For example, the Albanian section of the Albania-Kosovo highway cost more than double its initial estimate.

highway spending ends, while restoring the non-highway capital budget, to allow for other
essential infrastructure projects. This would imply a surplus of 1.9 percent of GDP, to reduce debt
below 60 percent within ten years.
16.
To reduce risks and improve funding conditions, the authorities should lay out longterm fiscal plans. A credible and reliable consolidation requires fundamental expenditure reform,
especially of the pension system, which is persistently underfunded, and the public sector wage bill,
which is high by regional standards (Figure 3). Elements of a long-term plan would include:


Further pension reform, to show how pension costs can be contained over the near term.14



Further cuts in the public sector wage bill (including through rationalizing employment), which
would also reduce the relative reservation wage and help improve competitiveness.



Identification of and budgeting for essential non-highway capital budget items.15

17.
Staff does not favor substantial and permanent increases in taxes, but there is
potential to raise VAT revenues in the near term. Revenues are relatively high for the region, a
low PIT rate is appropriate to avoid further disincentives to formalization, and a much higher CIT
rate risks deterring investment. However, there is potential to raise more revenues from VAT, for
instance by eliminating exemptions, and unifying rates, which could increase compliance and
yields.16

14

The 2011 pension reform increases the pensionable age to 67 only by 2025 for men and 2041 for women.

15

Key needs include infrastructure to support the sustainable development of the tourism sector and investment in
the energy sector, as losses in energy distribution are significant.
16

The current top rate of 19 percent is lower than many peers, and exemptions bring the average effective rate to
12–13 percent.

Additional measures would be needed in the near term if risks eventuate. The
authorities should also lay out additional consolidation plans that would be applied in the event of
unanticipated shocks to growth or refinancing and highway costs. The first recourse should be to
cut or delay spending on the highway.
19.
The fiscal framework should be bolstered. A fiscal rule was approved in April to embrace
the Maastricht 3 percent of GDP deficit and 60 percent of GDP debt limits. Enforcement is,
however, weak: there are no automatic spending caps, no deadlines for implementing fiscal
measures, and the exception for “strategically important projects” undermines its credibility.17 The
authorities should also strengthen controls in the broader public sector and refrain from providing
more support to enterprises, whether direct or indirect.

Authorities’ views
20.
The authorities acknowledged the risks to the public finances from the new highway
and aim to manage them through a combination of revenue gains and expenditure restraint.
17

If the deficit or debt exceed the 3 and 60 percent, respectively, the government has to submit a proposal of
corrective measures to the parliament within 60 days, but there is no deadline by which the deficit/debt has to be
below the limit again.



The authorities pointed to conservative revenue estimates in their budgets, and further gains
from on-going efforts to address informality (mainly through administrative measures, such as
changing the criminal code to treat the payment of wages without corresponding payment of
taxes and contributions by employers as a criminal offense, and similarly, treating the payment
of wages in cash as a criminal offense).



They pointed to the strong demand for the Eurobond issuance in May 2014 (which was heavily
oversubscribed), and saw good prospects for continued market access at favorable terms.



The authorities expect large growth benefits from the highway to tourism, transport, trade and
regional development, which in turn would boost social cohesion. They consider the highway
loan’s terms to be very attractive, despite the exchange rate risk. The authorities hope to raise
toll revenues of EUR 17 million (0.4 percent of projected 2018 GDP) per year on completion of
the highway in 2018, increasing to EUR 60 million in 2047, based on expectations of high traffic
flows.

B. Monetary and Financial Sector Policies: Strengthening Credit Conditions

Financial conditions remain tight.
Lending rates remain high and have increased in
real terms. Interest rate spreads are around
7½ percentage points, near their historical peak,
despite deposit rates falling to around 2 percent.
Notwithstanding a modest increase in lending to
households, overall credit contracted by
3 percent (yoy) through October.



Banks’ capitalization has improved, although it is relatively low compared to those in the rest of
Eastern Europe.18



In terms of funding, deposits continue to grow, and liquidity appears sufficient, at 30 percent of
short-term assets. On average, banks have reduced the ratio of loans to deposits since the crisis
to a more sensible 100 percent, although this figure conceals wide heterogeneity across banks.

Asset quality remains a problem. Over the
course of 2011–12, some EUR 600 million in
NPLs were shifted to the balance sheets of
factoring companies. A change in
classification at the end of 2012 further
reduced reported NPLs, but the level remains
high at 17 percent of total loans for the
banking system as a whole. Banks with high
levels of NPLs are naturally more risk averse
and hesitant to lend and/or charge high

Regulatory provisions exceed the required levels under IFRS accounting standards but
do not necessarily lead to losses being recognized. System-wide regulatory provisioning is
68 percent. The regulatory environment is reinforced by annual onsite reviews, coupled with stress
tests. However, regulatory provision levels exhibit a wide range across banks, from 33 percent to
85 percent. Given that banks in Montenegro have very similar business models and have
experienced the same lending environment, this raises questions about whether all banks follow
classification rules properly (e.g., whether they have been “evergreening” loans). Further, banks
report significantly lower levels of provisioning in their IFRS financial statements than under the
regulatory provisioning rules, which might reflect overly optimistic collateral valuations used to
offset loan impairment. Hence, banks might be understating losses implied by regulatory
provisions in their income statements and avoiding writing off bad loans.
24.

Greater transparency, simplicity, and oversight could bring useful benefits.



Reporting: Currently, Montenegro misses potential benefits from its relatively strict regulatory
provisioning environment, as the provisions are not reported publicly (only the provisions per
IFRS standard are published). Quarterly Reports on banks are prepared but not published. Nor
does there appear to be a published policy on collateral valuations. An enhanced reporting
regime could expose problems and increase incentives to resolve bad loans. External asset
quality reviews could be considered as an independent assessment of banks’ financial health
and a means for boosting confidence.



Regulatory classifications: The regulations specify seven categories of loan performance for
provisioning purposes, but data on the values of loans in the “B1” and “B2” and “C1” and “C2”
subcategories are not available. Simplifying to five categories (A, B, C, D, and E) would make
corroboration easier, and greater automaticity of classifications might prevent evergreening
practices.



Oversight of factoring companies: The supervisor lacks any oversight over factoring companies,
which further reduces the transparency of the financial system as around EUR 600 million have
been effectively transferred out of the oversight of regulators but remain in the system. Staff
urged progress on the draft law on factoring companies, which should grant the supervisor

powers of direction over the use of factoring companies and create transparent and verifiable
standards for recording assets held by such vehicles.
25.

The authorities are considering a number of measures:



The authorities have tabled a law before parliament on voluntary restructuring—the “Podgorica
Approach”—that aims to encourage out-of-court workouts to resolve impaired loans. The
approach is potentially useful for solvent firms with temporary cash flow or liquidity problems.



In response to what the authorities perceive as lack of competition in lending rates, new bank
licenses have been approved, bringing their number to 12, and the authorities have indicated a
willingness to grant more.19

26.
Policies are needed to address credit risk. Staff analysis suggests that lending spreads
reflect structural lending risk premia, which commends reform of legal processes and enforcement.


The Montenegrin banking system does not show typical signs of lack of competition: the
number of banks is high, and profitability is relatively weak. Widening spreads could reflect the
wish to rebuild profitability. Going forward, lending spreads could remain high to cover lending
risks arising from difficulties in reliable credit information, securing collateral, and inconsistent
application of regulations (e.g., tax administration) (Box 3).20



The recent introduction of dedicated public enforcement officers could facilitate the resolution
of some claims, but further progress will depend on more timely court decisions, with penalties
for delays, and improved administration.

27.
Reserve assets appear adequate. Montenegro is euroized. Hence, traditional reserve
metrics normally applied to countries with fixed exchange rate regimes—such as the coverage of a
certain number of months of imports or a percentage of short-term external debt—are not very
useful. As an economy without lending of last resort operations, a better metric is to look at
reserves as a ratio to deposits. On these terms, Montenegro ranks fairly well against other
dollarized or euroized economies, and the ratio has been broadly stable.

19

The authorities also discussed lending rate caps as a measure to boost credit growth but have opted not to pursue
such measures, which would risk reducing credit availability to newer and smaller enterprises.
20

Although net lending has been contracting, household lending has been expanding, which might be due in part to
lower lending risk: the law allows creditors to directly garnish wages for past due debts.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONTENEGRO

Box 3. Interest Rate Spreads
High lending spreads over funding rates could be explained by large operational costs, weak
profitability, and high credit risk, the last in turn reflecting structural factors such as institutions,
legal frameworks, and the rule of law and its outcomes. To look at which of these could be
significant for Montenegro, lending spreads in a sample of central and eastern European
economies are correlated with a range of indicators.1
For example, nominal GDP—a proxy for economies of scale—is inversely and significantly
correlated with lending spreads, suggesting that smaller economies might face inherently higher
borrowing costs. (However, spreads are uncorrelated with the level of bank concentration.)
Contract enforcement is cited as a key risk to

for which data are available, these latter correlations are not significant at conventional levels.
The results suggest that policy measures that address the time and cost of securing collateral and
the predictability of legal outcomes would help lower borrowing costs. Such reforms will have
long run effects in lowering the structural risk premia being paid by borrowers.

The authorities have undertaken measures to increase oversight of AML/CFT issues.
Banks are responsible for identifying politically exposed persons and beneficial owners. In practice,
there are problems with data issues, owners of foreign firms can be difficult to trace, and banks
might be reluctant to jeopardize relations with clients. The authorities are thus encouraged to
closely monitor the implementation of risk management systems that identify politically exposed
persons and ultimate beneficial ownership. A new law in 2014 shifted the responsibility for initiating
violation procedures to the central bank. However, fines appear low, being limited by law to
EUR 25,000.

Authorities’ views
29.
The authorities regard the large stock of NPLs and high prevailing interest rates as key
policy challenges. They expressed confidence that the set of policy initiatives underway hold the
potential to make progress in both these areas. In particular, the authorities indicated that:


The draft law on restructuring will help align incentives and facilitate a substantial reduction in
NPL levels. The authorities also indicated that a law granting the supervisor oversight of
factoring companies was imperative to enhance transparency and the smooth functioning of the
financial system.



Ensuring adequate competition in the banking sector is essential, as lending premiums reflect a
broader market failure.



The recent introduction of public enforcement officers marks an important step to strengthen
contract enforcement, but it is pre-mature to assess the effectiveness of the program at this
stage.



There is scope to increase penalties banks face for breaches of AML/CFT regulations, and the
authorities are currently reconsidering the laws governing the limit on bank penalties.

Indicators of Montenegro’s competitiveness are mixed. The CPI-REER has been roughly stable
relative to regional comparators, largely reflecting a modestly appreciating euro balanced by weak
price pressures. Wage growth has moderated substantially, but unit labor costs remain relatively
high, potentially pointing to competitiveness issues. Although Montenegro’s share in world trade
improved a little in 2013, the share is substantially lower than in previous years.

Staff analysis using the Macroeconomic Balance and External Sustainability approaches indicates
the current account balance is around 9–11 percentage points below its norm, possibly pointing
to weak cost competitiveness. However, data uncertainties (related to errors and omissions in the
balance of payments, which amount to about 7½ percent of GDP), the short length of the time
series, and the volatility associated with small countries make point estimates from a CGER-type
analysis highly imprecise.1

Staff’s preferred metric is to look at relative unit labor costs, which in Montenegro are slightly
above the average for the Western Balkans, which in turn is above the level of New Member
States. In the absence of an independent currency, this suggests ongoing wage restraint and/or a
boost to productivity will be required to restore competitiveness.

Box 4. External Competitiveness (continued)
Montenegro generally ranks well on business
indicators compared with regional peers.
Nonetheless, reforms to improve competitiveness
remain important. For example, continued
external stability will hinge on sustained tourism
development and attracting diversified FDI flows.
Priorities in this area include improving
infrastructure, enhancing the quality of services,
and reducing administrative burdens that could
undermine future diversified investment
opportunities.

Note: A rise in the ranking indicates improvement.

A significant share of the current account balance is

related to imports funded by FDI, reflecting large investment needs, especially for large-scale infrastructure
projects; conversely, in a small economy such as Montenegro, a surge in investment-related imports can result in
large swings to the current account balance.

31.
Improving the functioning of the labor market is crucial. The labor market does not
appear efficient at allocating labor: unemployment rates are persistently high—registered
unemployment is around 18½ percent (youth unemployment 32½ percent) of which 91 percent is
long-term—while seasonal and low-paid employment is mostly provided by foreign workers. The
system appears rigid: a multi-tiered collective bargaining process applies a standard wage across
sectors. This includes public and private employment, which adds to the importance of public sector
wage setting for competitiveness. Further, non-wage costs are relatively high. Although the law
provides specific criteria for dismissal, in practice the burden of proof is placed on employers, and
outcomes are frequently over-turned by the courts. Hence, the risk premium for employment is
high. Private sector employers appear to respond by placing new workers on short-term contracts
and avoiding extending employment,21 which prevents development of human capital and inhibits
productivity.
32.
The authorities have responded with a mix of structural reform initiatives and
temporary government-funded hiring programs. Substantial labor market reform was
undertaken in 2011. Lay-off costs were reduced, by restricting severance packages to “in-firm” as
opposed to “lifetime” years of service, thus reducing an important disincentive to hiring. Fixed-term
contracts were limited to a maximum of 24 months, which effectively tightened employment
21

Redundancy costs amount to 6½ weeks of salary after 5 years of continuous employment and increase to
13 weeks of salary after 10 years. This puts Montenegro’s ranking at around 73 out of 187 countries in terms of
redundancy costs (with 1 being least costly) according to World Bank indicators.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

protections. Despite these changes, unemployment remains high and labor participation low. In
recent years, the authorities have favored selective subsidy programs to boost employment, such as
financial incentives to hire “hard-to-employ” individuals and youths and a temporary (9-month)
government-sponsored internship program for recent university graduates. The effectiveness of
these programs, however, is not clear: youth unemployment has only decreased modestly since the
introduction of the internship program, and anecdotal information suggests that employers tend to
hire only around 10 percent of participating interns.
33.
Social benefits are not the primary driver of labor informality. Although there is
potential scope to lower the opportunity costs of formal employment for people eligible for social
assistance (e.g., by shifting to a gradual withdrawal of benefits and/or earned income tax credits),
social benefits are not generally seen as a key source of labor market distortions.22 The authorities
plan to implement a “social card” system by the end of 2014, which will consolidate all benefits in a
single system. Staff welcomed this initiative, which is expected to significantly increase transparency
and deter fraudulent claims.
34.
But the efficiency of the labor market will need to increase. Flexibility in wage
bargaining should be encouraged to allow wages to evolve with productivity. Measures are likely
needed to reduce informal employment incentives, such as onerous dismissal procedures. Subsidy
schemes constitute “stop-gap” measures.23 Outcome-oriented active labor market schemes, such as
where financial incentives are linked in some fashion to improved labor outcomes, are therefore
preferable.
35.
Concentration is also a problem. Montenegro lacks domestic economies of scale, and the
lack of diversification makes it vulnerable to external shocks. Infrastructure failings—such as the
dependence on seasonal energy, and

There is scope to further address structural impediments to investment. Staff
encourages efforts to further: i) rationalize and ensure the consistent application of regulations;
ii) facilitate property registration and streamline administrative procedures; iii) improve the
efficiency of the judicial system, particularly as regards collateral enforcement, and, iv) clamp down
on unregulated and informal businesses that hinder high-quality investments and fiscal revenue
intake, and v) fight corruption.

Authorities’ views
37.
Efforts are underway to formulate a strategy to combat labor informality and increase
the transparency of the social benefit system. The authorities consider that the multi-tier
collective bargaining framework is well-understood and sufficiently flexible to avoid distortionary
labor market outcomes. They see ongoing merit in targeted employment programs, such as the
internship scheme which is a key initiative to bridge skills mismatch. A study of the underlying
causes of the informal economy is underway (to be completed by July 2015) and is regarded as a
pre-requisite to developing a broader policy strategy to improve labor market outcomes.
38.
Initiatives to further improve the business environment are moving forward. The
authorities see FDI as critical to boosting long-term growth and promoting economic diversification,
particularly in tourism and energy. The government has recently introduced important business
environment improvements, notably establishing a one-stop shop for construction permits, strict
time limits for the issuance of approvals, and a decrease in procedures required for obtaining a
permit. In addition, nearly 60 percent of recommendations endorsed in a 2013 Action Plan to
improve the regulatory environment have been implemented; full implementation is expected by
end-2015. Amendments to the Law on Enforcement and Security are also being considered to
improve the enforcement of claims.

STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
Montenegro is continuing its economic transition but confronts policy challenges
associated with a rising public debt burden and the fallout of the lending boom. The economy
is relatively undiversified and relies heavily on external financing. The rapid rise in public debt has
increased vulnerabilities and the large stock of bad loans has likely constrained lending. The
highway project should provide a short-term boost to economic activity but exacerbates debtrelated vulnerabilities.
40.
Growth is expected to pick up, but risks weigh on the downside. Growth is projected to
increase to 4½ next year as the highway project gets underway. But Montenegro is vulnerable to a
downturn in external demand, especially from the euro area and Russia, and substantial financing
needs expose the country to shifts in risk aversion and disruptions to global financial markets.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

MONTENEGRO

41.
Sustained fiscal restraint over the medium-term will be needed, with an emphasis on
fundamental expenditure reform. The authorities have undertaken bold fiscal adjustment over the
past two years that constitutes an important step to addressing imbalances. These efforts, along
with a recovery in economic activity, helped deliver fiscal adjustment of nearly 3 percent of GDP in
2013. The authorities are to be commended for ceasing repayments of guarantees to the aluminum
producer, KAP, and addressing longstanding issues at KAP that have facilitated its sale. A timely
completion of the KAP transaction would be welcome. The measures in the draft 2015 budget that
partly offset the impact of the highway on the deficit are welcome, as are the authorities’ efforts to
restrain the public sector wage bill. Going forward, laying out clear long-term plans for managing
the public finances would boost credibility and reduce risks to market access. Fundamental
expenditure reform, especially of the pension system and the public sector wage bill, would be an
essential part of such plans. In addition, the authorities should define contingency measures to
address unforeseen fiscal shocks, with the first recourse being a delay or cut in highway spending.
Efforts should continue to reduce support, directly or indirectly, to risky and/or loss-making
state-owned enterprises.
42.
Addressing NPLs and improving credit conditions are priorities. The “Podgorica
Approach” has the potential to facilitate debt workouts. This effort should be complemented by
reforms to address problems with contract enforcement and securing collateral that have impeded
timely NPL resolution and likely contribute to high interest rate margins. Although provisioning
coverage for the banking system as a whole appears sizable on a regulatory basis, the wide variation
across banks may warrant enhanced supervisory scrutiny. There is scope to improve regulatory
transparency, including by publishing quarterly banking reports with information on the level of
regulatory provisions and a summary of all stress test results.
43.
Structural reforms are essential to raise potential growth and improve flexibility and
competitiveness. Measures to ensure that wages adjust in line with productivity developments and
to reduce disincentives for employment (such as onerous dismissal procedures) would improve
labor market outcomes. Sustaining recent policy momentum to strengthen the business
environment and spur investment is also critical. Priorities include simplifying the regulatory
environment, eliminating burdensome administrative procedures, improving the efficiency of the
judicial system, and combating economic informality, including by effectively implementing the
AML/CFT regime.
44.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Montenegro be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Figure 5. Montenegro: Risk Assessment Matrix
(Scale – high, medium, or low)
Source of Risks
1. A protracted
growth
slowdown in
advanced and
emerging
economies

Relative Likelihood2
High
Delays by advanced economies
to address legacies of the
financial crisis and persistently
low inflation threaten the global
recovery. This could be
compounded by failures on the
part of emerging market
countries that have struggled
with inefficient investments and
incomplete structural reform.

2.

Spillovers from a
deterioration of
global financial
market
conditions

High
A surge in global financial market
volatility could be triggered as
investors reassess risks.

3.

Heightened
geopolitical risks
associated with
Russia/Ukraine
tensions and
ongoing Middle
East conflicts

Medium
Geopolitical events could disrupt
global financial flows, trade and
commodity markets, as well as
lead to a sharp increase in oil
prices.

4.

Weakening of
fiscal discipline

5.

Delays and
withdrawals
from capital
investment
projects

Low
The authorities have
demonstrated a commitment to
fiscal consolidation. But the
planned highway is a source of
concern. And pressure to raise
public sector wages and
pensions will remain.
Medium
Ongoing geopolitical tensions,
weak administrative procedures
on land development, and
concerns regarding public fiscal
sustainability could threaten
capital investments in tourism
and industry.

Impact if Realized
High
A protracted slowdown in
the EU and neighboring
countries could adversely
impact the appetite for
external and public
financing (especially FDI
flows and tourism
infrastructure
developments). Further
“lowflation” could be
imported from the euro
area which, if protracted,
would adversely impact
debt dynamics,
consumption, and bank
profitability.
High
Montenegro is highly
reliant on external
financing. Gross public
financing needs range
from 10-20 percent of
GDP during the next five
years.

Policy Response
 Let automatic fiscal stabilizers
work, within limited fiscal space.
 Accelerate structural reforms to
increase competitiveness and
reduce structural bottlenecks that
impede credit to the private
sector.

 Let automatic fiscal stabilizers
work, within limited fiscal space.
 Put in place a credible mediumterm fiscal consolidation plan that
puts debt on a sustainable
trajectory.

Medium
Given important tourism
and real estate links, a
deterioration in Russia’s
growth prospects could
undermine FDI inflows to
and growth prospects in
Montenegro.
Medium
Given high and increasing
public debt, a loss of fiscal
discipline could raise
concern over the
sustainability of the fiscal
position.

 Let automatic fiscal stabilizers
work, within limited fiscal space.
 Speed up structural reforms to
improve the business environment
and competitiveness.

Medium
Construction and activity
associated with large-scale
investment projects (both
tourism and infrastructure
based) are key drivers of
growth.

 Put in place a credible strategy to
safeguard fiscal sustainability and
implement structural reforms to
improve the business environment
and strengthen mechanisms to
fight corruption.

 Sustain fiscal consolidation;
maintain public wage discipline
and pension freezes, and further
recent efforts to boost tax
revenues.
 Curtail subsidies to loss-making
public enterprises.

Sources: Central Bank of Montenegro; and IMF staff estimates.
1/ Balance of payments data were revised in late 2012 to correct for unrecorded tourism receipts, resulting in an average annual
improvement in the current account balance of 1.7 percent of GDP in 2009-2011. The revision also lowered the estimate of other
investment outflows, with a corresponding reduction in errors and omissions.
2/ Sovereign Eurobond issuance is classified under Other Investment rather than Portfolio Investment in this presentation.
3/ Financing for the highway is included under general government flows (including the ExIm loan as well as the remaining 15
percent); unidentified financing is a residual, including all remaining financing needs for which specific sources have not been
identified yet--however this does not constitute a financing gap.
4/ This includes only estimates of private external debt as private debt statistics are not officially published.

1/ Includes republican budget and local governments.
2/ According to GFSM 1986, payments of loan guarantees or related to court rulings are recorded as government expenses.
3/ Financing for the highway is included under foreign financing (including the ExIm loan as well as the remaining 15 percent);
unidentified financing is a residual, including all remaining financing needs for which specific sources have not been
identified yet--however this does not constitute a financing gap.

Appendix I. Montenegro: Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Despite last year’s sizeable fiscal adjustment, public sector debt has increased and is projected to rise
further to 69 percent of GDP in the baseline. The projected debt trajectory is highly susceptible to
various shocks, especially a negative real GDP growth shock. Gross financing needs are high, a
particular concern as Montenegro is highly dependent on external financing.

Baseline and Realism of Projections


Macroeconomic assumptions. Growth momentum is projected to slow in 2014 on account of
base effects, as well as delays in several large infrastructure projects. Growth picks up gradually
through the projection period—in the absence of the highway project, it would reach
3.3 percent. The expenditures on the highway are assumed to add EUR 206 million,
EUR 253 million, EUR 303 million, and EUR 47 million to the nominal level of GDP in the years
2015–2018, less import content (assumed to be 70 percent), with an additional
contemporaneous multiplier on aggregate demand of 5 percent, resulting in additional growth
of 1.9, 0.3, 0.3, -2.2, and -0.4 in the years 2015–19. Inflation pressures are expected to remain
negligible given low international agricultural prices and subdued EU inflation.



Fiscal adjustment. A sizeable fiscal adjustment was achieved last year on account of a pension
freeze and PIT and VAT rate hikes. In staff’s baseline projections, the primary balance worsens
significantly in 2015–17 on account of highway expenditures. This assumes that non-highway
non-interest expenditures remain at their 2015 budget levels as a share of non-highway GDP in
2016-2019 as well, implying continued pension restraint and significant cuts in other capital
spending.



Heat map and debt profile vulnerabilities. Risks from the debt level are deemed high as debt
approaches the 70 percent of GDP benchmark under the baseline and exceeds it under several
shock scenarios. Gross financing needs are also well above the 15 percent benchmark, even
under the baseline. Public debt held by non-residents also constitutes a vulnerability. Growth
shocks have a very large impact on the debt profile.



Realism of baseline assumptions. The median forecast errors for real GDP growth and inflation
(actual minus projection) in 2005–2013 suggest on average an upward bias in staff’s past
projections. The median forecast error for the primary balance suggests that staff projections
have been too pessimistic on average. While the projected CAPB adjustment is small, the key
risks are high dependence on external financing and vulnerability to macro shocks.

Shocks and Stress Tests
Stress tests indicate that in particular growth shocks, but also fiscal shocks and cost overruns and
delays related to the highway project, would have a major impact on fiscal sustainability.
Montenegro-specific stress tests


Highway shock. In this scenario, the construction of the highway is assumed to cost 20 percent
more (in 2018). Debt increases to 70 percent of GDP, while financing requirements far exceed
those under the baseline in 2018.

Standard stress tests


Growth shock. Under this scenario, real output growth rates are lowered during 2015 and 2016
by one standard deviation (4.9 ppt), also affecting inflation and interest rates. The public debt
ratio increases to 86 percent by 2018, while the gross financing needs ratio in 2016 increases
9 percentage points relative to the baseline. (Even half a standard deviation shock pushes debt
to 77 percent of GDP).



Interest rate shock. This scenario examines the implications of an increase in interest rates on
new debt by 200 basis points (relative to the baseline) in 2015–19. The deterioration in the ratios
for debt and gross financing needs are back loaded as old debt gradually matures. However, by
2019, the impact on financing needs is significant.



Combined macro shock. This scenario comprises a recession in 2015 and 2016, a 200 basis
point increase in interest rates, and a sharp rise in expenditures. It pushes the debt to GDP ratio
up to 89 percent of GDP, and has a very large impact on gross financing needs.



Financial contingent liability shock. The noninterest expenditure shock is equivalent to
10 percent of the size of the banking sector and is combined with a shock to GDP and interest
rates. The shock results in a sharp increase in the debt ratio to 85 percent of GDP. Meanwhile,
gross financing needs would rise to over 28 percent of GDP in 2015, and stay higher over the
medium term.



Primary balance shock. This scenario assumes a revenue shock and a rise in interest rates
leading to a 2 ppt of GDP deterioration in the primary balance in 2015 and 2016. The combined
shocks lead to deterioration in the debt ratio and gross financing needs, but the impact is more
muted than in other scenarios under consideration.



Real exchange rate shock. The scenario assumes a 13 percent devaluation in the real exchange
rate in 2015. As the ExIm loan is dollar denominated, debt increases to 70 percent, though the
impact depends critically on the extent of exchange rate pass-through to inflation.

Appendix II. Montenegro: External Debt Sustainability Analysis
External debt has increased by nearly 60 percentage points of GDP since 2007 to an estimated
133 percent of GDP in 2014. This was driven in part by the sharp increase in public debt, which more
than doubled over this period and comprises about 45 percent of total external debt. Under the
baseline, external debt is projected to increase to 157½ percent of GDP. The projected debt trajectory is
highly susceptible to various shocks, particularly a depreciation of the euro. Montenegro’s heavy
dependence on external financing reinforces the importance of fiscal and structural reforms to
safeguard market access.

Shocks and Stress Tests
Standardized stress tests indicate that external debt is particularly sensitive to currency
depreciation. Current account shocks—possibly related to highway project cost overruns—and a
combined deterioration in the macroeconomic environment would also impact external
sustainability, with significant implications for gross financing needs.
Standard stress tests


Growth shock. Under this scenario, the baseline real GDP growth profile is permanently
reduced by a one-half standard deviation calculated over the recent 10-year period (2.5 percent)
effective in 2015. This corresponds to an average growth rate of 0.6 percent of GDP over
2015–19, compared with baseline average growth of 3 percent. Under this scenario, the external
debt ratio increases to 172 percent of GDP in 2019.



Interest rate shock. This scenario examines the implications of an increase in nominal external
interest rates on new debt (relative to the baseline) by a one-half standard deviation in
2015–2019. Stable average external interest rates historically imply only a modest average
increase in interest rates of 27 basis points in this scenario and, consequently, a relatively small
increase in the external debt profile to 160 percent of GDP by 2019.



Non-Interest Current Account shock. This scenario permanently increases the non-interest
current account by one-half standard deviation in 2015–2019. Given historically-high current
account deficits, this amounts to an increase of 6¼ percentage points. In the absence of
offsetting debt creating flows, external debt increases to 189 percent of GDP by 2019.



Combined macro shock. This scenario comprises a permanent ¼ standard deviation shock
applied to the real interest rate, the growth rate, and the current account deficit effective
2015–19. The combined shock pushes the external debt ratio to 182 percent of GDP and
increases gross financing needs by 26½ percent of GDP cumulatively over the shock period.

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONTENEGRO



Real exchange rate shock. The scenario assumes a one-time 30 percent devaluation in the real
exchange rate in 2015 applied to the stock of external debt. Second round impacts (in terms of
potential increases in competitiveness and improved trade balances) are not taken into account.
Given the large stock of external debt, the shock increases the external debt-to-GDP ratio by
62½ percent of GDP in 2015. Gross financing needs are correspondingly higher, by about
17½ percent of GDP on average over 2015–19 relative to the baseline.

WORLD BANK GROUP RELATIONS
1.
Montenegro joined the World Bank Group (WBG) as an independent country in
January 2007. The Bank had implemented a program of lending and analytical work for
Montenegro for most of the period since the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro joined the WBG
in 2001. Six projects are currently active, with 1½ years before the end of the Montenegro’s second
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for the fiscal years 2011–15. The CPS was prepared at a time
when the country was striving to recover from a sharp economic contraction associated with the
2008 global and Eurozone crisis. In the wake of the crisis, the initially-envisaged total IBRD lending
of US$215.7 million was increased by nearly US$100 million. The lending program was
complemented by a mix of analytic and technical support aligned with the CPS pillars.
2.
The Board approved the CPS in January 2011 and the CPS Progress Report in May
2014 extending the CPS by one year through FY15 as both CPS pillars—(i) strengthening institutions
and aligning them with European Union (EU) requirements in areas critical for longer-term
competitiveness in global markets; and (ii) improving environmental management—remain highly
relevant, and the additional year facilitates the delivery of the planned lending program. Also, with
uncertainties in the fiscal framework and public investment program, an additional year was deemed
helpful in gaining greater clarity on the likely medium-term macro-fiscal framework that would
underpin a new Country Partnership Framework (CPF) and influence planned lending volumes and
instruments.

Within the CPS FY11–FY15, the IBRD Board approved five IBRD loans to provide
selective support to two key CPS priorities. The CPS originally envisaged a series of two financial
sector development policy operations (DPOs). In light of post-crisis needs, the second DPO was
converted into a larger financial sector policy-based guarantee (PBG) that supported a
comprehensive program of measures designed to strengthen the banking sector, address its
vulnerabilities, and bolster its resilience to possible future shocks. This support also led to advisory
work on nonperforming loans (NPL) resolution. Additional countercyclical stimulus was considered
through a Public Expenditure DPO, but did not materialize in FY13–14 given the remaining

weaknesses in the medium-term fiscal framework. New investment lending was approved for a
Higher Education/R&D project (US$16 million), Energy Efficiency Additional Financing
(US$6.8 million) and an Industrial Waste Management and Clean-Up Project (US$69 million). The
committed portfolio has doubled since to US$137 million in 2014. About 71 percent of these
commitments remain to be disbursed.
4.
Pipeline projects include (i) a Revenue Administration and Modernization Project building
on the recent tax administration assessment that aims to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of
tax administration as well as reduce the cost of compliance for the taxpayer; (ii) a Fiscal and Debt
Management technical assistance operation that aims to support strengthening the institutional
capacity of fiscal resources and public debt management; (iii) a Trade and Competitiveness project
that aims to provide support to the business environment, enterprise development and skills and
labor market development interventions; (iv) a second Health Improvement project that aims to
provide a support for financing reforms and governance for quality in the health sector.
5.
Cooperation with the IMF has been good, particularly in the areas of macroeconomic
and financial sector policies. Bank and Fund teams coordinated closely during the preparation of
the Financial Sector DPL and Policy-Based Guarantee in 2011 and 2012 and the TA on NPL
resolution. The World Bank Group, through its ongoing and planned operations, as well its
complementary economic and sector work, will continue to provide input to the IMF on issues such
as (i) public expenditure, including pension and health reforms; (ii) business climate and
competitiveness, including labor market reform and the resolution of nonperforming loans;
(iii) public sector institutions and fiduciary reviews, (iv) agricultural assessments; and (v) statistical
capacity building and poverty monitoring. The Fund and Bank staff have sought each other’s input
in internal review processes.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
MONTENEGRO—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
As of December 2014
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The most affected
areas are labor market indicators, and government finance statistics.
National Accounts: The Statistical Office of Montenegro (MONSTAT) compiles annual production and
expenditure accounts in current and previous year’s prices. The production GDP estimates are reconciled with
the expenditure GDP estimates through the supply and use framework (i.e. reconciling supply and use). The
quality of the annual GDP is good.
Montenegro started disseminating quarterly GDP by production using an indirect method in 2012, but the
methodology has room for improvement. The estimates are compiled at an aggregated level (mostly NACE
section level). The accuracy of the short term statistics needs to be improved, mostly for agriculture, and
construction. The latest national accounts TA mission in September 2014 continued working on developing
quarterly GDP. estimates by expenditure approach. Experimental estimates have been compiled; the official
dissemination will be in March 2015.
Price Statistics: MONSTAT compiles and disseminates a monthly consumer price index that broadly follows
international standards. MONSTAT continues to implement improvements to the producer price index.
Improvements include developing a total output PPI; expanding index coverage to include services and
construction; and updating index calculation methods. MONSTAT began compiling and disseminating the EU
harmonized consumer price indices, beginning in 2011. An export price index has been published since 2009,
and an industrial import price index since 2011. There is need to improve the industrial production index.
Labor market statistics: MONSTAT reports labor and wage statistics based on data from the labor force
survey (LFS) and administrative sources. The unemployment rate from the LFS is computed according to the
ILO definition. The quality of wage indicators is relatively good, but information on foreign employment
remains limited. The presence of a large informal sector impedes the accurate assessment of the
unemployment rate. Frequent methodological revisions also impair time series analyses.
Government Finance Statistics: Fiscal data are compiled by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) based on a new
GFS institutional classification, and, since early 2006, includes data on local governments and social security
funds. The latter was merged with the treasury account in 2010. The charter of accounts introduced in 2001 has
been implemented at the local level from mid-2005. Fiscal data reporting suffers from frequent reclassifications. The MOF has established a unit responsible for data collection for state-owned enterprises, but
a satisfactory compilation of the public sector fiscal balance requires significant further effort. Data on
enterprises owned by municipalities are rarely available. Data on the stock of local government arrears need to
be significantly strengthened and disseminated. Data on stocks of financial assets and liabilities are incomplete.
The latest GFS TA mission in March 2013 recommended updating the table on the institutional structure of the
public sector to facilitate consistency among producers of official statistics. It was also recommended to
establish a migration plan to phase in the GFSM 2001 framework and to start publishing quarterly budgetary
central government data in the IFS.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONTENEGRO

Monetary and Financial Statistics: Monetary and financial statistics are compiled by the Central Bank of
Montenegro (CBM), broadly following the institutional coverage, classification, and evaluation methodology
set forth in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (2000). However, the monetary data are not reported
in IMF recommended Standardized Report Form format. Dissemination practices meet the recommendations
of the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) with respect to the periodicity and timeliness for financial
sector data.
Beginning in early 2006, the CBM has published detailed monetary statistics in its monthly Statistical Bulletin,
which includes tables on monetary statistics, balance sheets and surveys for the CBM and commercial banks. At
the beginning of 2013, the CBM adopted new financial reporting requirements for banks in line with IAS 39; as
a result, monetary data for 2013 are not comparable with data from previous years.
Montenegro does not report Financial Soundness Indicators to the IMF.
External sector statistics: Balance of payments statistics are compiled by the CBM and follow international
reporting standards. External sector statistics have benefited from improvements undertaken by MONSTAT to
improve coverage, valuation, and classification of merchandise trade statistics. Data on imports and exports in
the BOP are compiled according to the special trade system. The CBM adjusts export and import data from
MONSTAT from CIF to FOB basis. The biggest challenge to the BoP statistics is the coverage of transactions
through the informal economy. As with many euroized economies, difficulty in estimating currency and
deposits and large errors and omissions continue to be an issue in the balance of payment statistics. Although
current account statistics have been revised recently, errors and omissions are still large and with a persistent
positive sign, largely due to an underestimation of the export of tourism services. The CBM has made progress
in improving the recording of transactions via the ITRS by refining the transactions coding system and
increasing interaction with commercial banks. However, the ITRS remains inadequate for recording a broad
range of balance of payments transactions such as reinvested earnings and trade credits. Further, the ITRS
records transactions on a cash basis, whereas balance of payments transactions should be recorded on an
accruals basis. The CBM still needs to undertake a small number of direct surveys of enterprises to supplement
the data received through the ITRS, and prepare comprehensive documentation on compilation methods and
data sources. The CBM has expressed its interest in reporting BoP statistics under the presentation of the sixth
edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Statistics Manual (BPM6).
The CBM has received TA on International Investment Position (IIP) statistics, but does not yet disseminate
these data. More recently, the CBM has conveyed to STA continuous difficulties with compiling and
disseminating IIP statistics.

The latest BoP TA mission in January 2013 concluded with the following action items: (i) the compilation and
regular dissemination of the IIP and external debt statistics; (ii) the revision of the compilation of the flows in
currency and deposits assets by other sectors; and (iii) the improvement of the currently estimation procedure
for the item Compensation of Employees (credit).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Montenegro
On January 23, 2015 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Montenegro.1
Economic momentum slowed in 2014, but growth is expected to accelerate in 2015, aided by
expenditures on the highway project. Nonetheless, Montenegro is vulnerable to a downturn in
external demand, and substantial financing needs expose the country to shifts in risk aversion
and disruptions to global financial markets.
The authorities have undertaken bold fiscal adjustment over the past years, reflecting a
combination of tax hikes, pension freezes, and efforts to increase tax compliance. Measures in
the draft 2015 budget that partly offset the extra spending on the highway are welcome, but a
sustained period of fiscal discipline will be needed nonetheless. Laying out clear and credible
long-term plans for managing the public finances, including savings on pensions and the public
sector wage bill, would boost credibility and reduce risks to market access. In addition, the
authorities should define contingency measures to address unforeseen fiscal shocks, with the first
recourse being a delay or cut in highway spending.
Addressing non performing loans and improving credit conditions are priorities. The “Podgorica
Approach” has the potential to facilitate debt workouts; this effort should be complemented by
reforms to address problems with contract enforcement and securing collateral. Although
provisioning coverage for the banking system as a whole appears sizable on a regulatory basis,
the wide variation across banks may warrant enhanced supervisory scrutiny. There is scope to
improve transparency, including by publishing quarterly banking reports with information on the
level of regulatory provisions and all stress test results.
Structural reforms are essential to raise potential growth and improve flexibility and
competitiveness. Bolstering the economy’s ability to respond to macroeconomic shocks is
especially important in a country lacking its own currency and with decreasing fiscal buffers.
Measures to ensure that wages adjust in line with productivity developments and to reduce

disincentives for employment would improve labor market outcomes. Sustaining recent policy
momentum to strengthen the business environment and spur investment is also critical to
broaden the economic base.
Executive Board Assessment2
The directors noted that moderate growth continues, but the outlook remains challenging, and
risks weigh on the downside, including from external spillovers. Against this backdrop, Directors
underscored the need for continued fiscal discipline, further efforts to strengthen the banking
sector, and comprehensive structural reforms to address macroeconomic vulnerabilities and spur
growth.
Directors commended the authorities’ efforts to address fiscal imbalances in recent years. While
recognizing the potential impact on economic growth, they noted that the Bar-Boljare highway
project places a large burden on public finances and exacerbates debt and financing risks.
Directors underscored that the underlying fiscal restraint embedded in the 2015 budget needs to
be sustained to contain fiscal risks and ensure debt sustainability. In this context, they
encouraged the authorities to lay out a clear long-term consolidation strategy, including further
measures to reform the pension system and reduce the public-sector wage bill. Directors stressed
that contingent fiscal measures should be identified to address unanticipated shocks. They
welcomed ongoing efforts to reduce support to state-owned entities, and called for the timely
completion of the sale of the aluminum producer KAP.
Directors observed that banking system health indicators are mixed. Capitalization has improved
and liquidity appears sufficient, but profitability has been weak and the large stock of nonperforming loans burdens balance sheets and impedes lending. They agreed that improving credit
conditions is a top priority, and welcomed the draft law on voluntary financial restructuring.
Reforms to bolster contract and collateral enforcement are also needed. Directors agreed that the
wide variation of provisioning coverage across banks warrants a strong supervisory scrutiny over
banks’ classification and collateral valuation practices. They saw merit in taking steps to enhance
regulatory transparency and reporting.
Directors underscored the importance of reforms to boost competitiveness and economic
flexibility. They emphasized that improving labor market outcomes is necessary to boost growth
potential and help contain long-term fiscal pressures. Lasting improvements require measures to
ensure wages adjust in line with productivity and to reduce informal employment incentives.
Directors also encouraged the authorities to sustain progress in improving the business and
investment environments so as to promote economic diversification and boost long-term growth.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

Statement by Menno Snel, Executive Director for Montenegro
and Andrijana Cudina, Advisor to Executive Director
January 23, 2015

The Montenegrin authorities thank staff for the very constructive dialogue during their
mission in Montenegro. They appreciate staff’s comprehensive analysis and broadly agree
with their assessments and policy recommendations. Discussions have helped the authorities
to frame the policy measures needed to boost growth and resilience of the economy, and
safeguard the fiscal sustainability going forward.
Economic developments and outlook
The Montenegrin economy continues to grow against a challenging background. Real GDP
rebounded by 3¼ percent in 2013, but has weakened in 2014 and looks likely to be close to
2½ percent for the year. The slowdown is attributable to the weakened external demand and
the floods in the region. However, positive developments have been registered in tourism,
construction, forestry and the retail trade. Although employment is on the rise, the
unemployment rate is persistently high. Inflation has fallen sharply but remains in positive
territory. Credit growth has still not recovered. The external position remains vulnerable,
although the ongoing political uncertainties in the region so far have had only limited effects
on the foreign direct investments and tourism performance.
The medium-term growth is expected to converge to about 3 percent backed by a number of
ambitious, large-scale investment projects, including the start of the first stage of the BarBoljare highway (costing a quarter of the national product), as well as projects in the energy
sector and tourism. The authorities expect positive spillover effects from these projects to
the rest of the economy. The highway is especially critical in this regard, not only in
economic terms, but also for safety reasons, regional development and broader integration.
However, there are clear risks to the outlook, given the country’s high dependence on
foreign capital inflows and substantial refinancing needs, and it’s vulnerability to downturns
in external demand.
Fiscal policy
The fiscal consolidation continued with laudable adjustments in the last two years,
narrowing the overall deficit from -5.9 in 2012 to -0.9 percent of GDP in 2014. Important
steps including higher taxes, a freeze on pensions, and measures to fight the grey economy
contributed to such significant consolidation. Nonetheless, the public debt is on the rise
reaching 58 percent of GDP in 2014.
The authorities agree with staff that, given the cost of the highway, strong fiscal discipline
will be needed to preserve the sustainability of public finances. The recently adopted budget
for 2015 envisages appropriate measures which are expected to result in further
improvement in the budget balance (excluding the highway spending). Apart from better

2
revenue collection, the focus is on rationalization of the current expenditures, while the
capital expenditures will be limited to essential infrastructural projects. The wage and
pension bill as well as social transfers will be contained. Although staff expressed concerns
about non-renewing of the pension freeze in 2015, the expenditure adjustment to the
pensions is likely to be on the downside since they will follow the cost of living and the
average wages in the economy which are both on a declining path.
As for the fiscal rule, the authorities agree with staff that there is room for further
strengthening of the framework. They have also made progress in divesting from state-owned
companies. A positive example is the long-lasting issue of the aluminum plant (KAP) which
was successfully sold to a new owner. However, full payment is still pending due to a
prolonged court procedure. Privatization of the shipyards is also expected to start soon.
Public debt sustainability
Staff’s public debt sustainability analysis (DSA) indicates serious vulnerability of the
Montenegrin public finances in different scenarios. In the authorities’ view, the underlying
drivers of the debt trajectory presented in the Staff Report are not fully capturing the
spillover effects from the infrastructural projects on growth and inflation, which will likely
mitigate the debt dynamics. Also, caution is warranted when interpreting the results of the
shock-to-growth scenario, given the high volatility of domestic growth in the past.
As staff points out, the medium-term financing needs are considerable. In the authorities’
view, the financial burden to the budget from the repayment of the highway loan may be
somewhat overstated. The terms under which the loan for the first stage was signed with the
Chinese partners are rather favorable. The annual installments of about EUR 50-60 million
(taking into account the revenues from tolling, the net fiscal burden would amount to about
EUR 25 million annually) are manageable. If the construction is finished as planned by 2019
the budget would have two years of receiving tolls before the first installment is due.
Regarding the exchange rate risks, the authorities are prepared to consider a swap
arrangement.
In the event of shocks to public finance and unanticipated highway cost over-runs, the
authorities are prepared to lay out a contingent consolidation plan. Cutting or delaying
spending on the highway in the middle of the construction process would be
counterproductive in their view. Instead, they would focus on tackling the current budget
expenditures and boosting revenues, possibly through stronger taxation of goods like
alcohol, tobacco and oil derivatives.
Monetary policy and financial system
The Montenegrin banking sector is sound and liquid, as indicated by the liquidity and
solvency ratios. However, the banks are operating in a challenging environment which is
reflected in their tight lending policy, weak credit activity and low profitability. Despite
recent improvements, the level of non-performing loans is still high at around 17 percent.

The authorities are taking comprehensive measures to address these challenges. The new
regulatory framework on voluntary financial restructuring (Podgorica Approach) will be an
important step to elevate the debt burden for solvent but illiquid companies and gradually
facilitate the reduction in NPLs. From a financial sector perspective, closer monitoring of
factoring companies would also have positive effects, given their important role in this
process.
The high level of lending interest rates is another major concern, as it hampers the resolution
of NPLs and holds back new lending. Given the complexity of the underlying factors that
contribute to such financing conditions, efforts are being made to reduce market
inefficiencies stemming from the lack of competition and limited business opportunities.
Despite the limitations of a small market, addressing structural credit risks will be the key to
revive lending activity. Strengthening the institutions and legal framework as well as the rule
of law, especially contract enforcement, is the priority in this regard.
Competitiveness and structural reforms
The authorities recognize that structural reforms remain essential to raise potential growth
and improve the flexibility and competitiveness of the economy. Their priority areas are the
labor market, the pension system and the business environment. Labor market reforms are
crucial given the high unemployment and low participation rate. Several reform initiatives
have been implemented to increase the labor market flexibility by reducing dismissal costs
and simplifying hiring. A temporary government-funded program for graduates is also in
place with the aim to help integrating the young into the labor market. Efforts are made to
better match the educational system and the labor market needs. Streamlining of the social
benefits through the introduction of “social cards” will increase the transparency of the
system and reduce the disincentives to work. With regard to the pension system, the ongoing
reforms aim to reduce the deficit of the Pension Fund to a sustainable level, through better
collection of contributions and stricter retirement rules.
The Montenegrin business environment stands relatively well in a regional context. The
latest improvement, from the 42nd to the 36th position on the World Bank’s Doing business
2015 list, is mostly due to the improvements in obtaining construction permits, which is
critical for the upcoming tourism projects. However, the procedures for starting a business,
enforcing contracts, registering property, and tax collection remain very challenging. In
addition to focusing on these priorities, the authorities also focus on attracting FDI, which is
essential to promote economic diversification. Along with efforts to simplify the investment
procedures, they are considering new incentives for foreign investors.
