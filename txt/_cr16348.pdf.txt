IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Brazil

On October 31, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Brazil.
The government that took office in May 2016 has announced a series of measures to address
long standing fiscal imbalances and budget rigidities. A strong push to implement the proposed
measures on the expenditure side would go a long way towards restoring policy credibility and
market confidence with positive effects on investment and growth. Early implementation of key
fiscal policy measures would also help moderate inflation expectations and facilitate monetary
policy easing.
Brazil is poised to emerge from a deep recession. The economy has contracted markedly in 2015
and 2016, reflecting mostly long-standing domestic issues, although terms of trade changes and
weak global demand also played an important role. Tighter financial conditions and slowing
credit and uncertainty surrounding the political scene have been the main factors behind the
declining investment and consumption, and the ratcheting unemployment. A sharp realignment
of regulated prices and monetary policy tightening also represented a drag on growth.
Headline and core inflation have been above the central target and around the upper limit of the
central bank’s tolerance range for several years. Monetary policy has correspondingly remained
at its current tight level for over a year. But in 2016, some price increases have begun to
moderate although disinflation proceeded slowly due to above target, albeit declining, inflation
expectations and rising food prices.
The central bank has intervened in the foreign exchange market less frequently than in the past
and broadly symmetrically, limiting corrective action to containing short-term excessive
volatility. Taking advantage of the market rally started in March 2016, the central bank has

lowered the net notional value of outstanding FX swaps to about US$35 billion (from a high of
about US$110 billion) by issuing reverse swaps and failing to roll over maturing swaps.
International reserves are above most IMF adequacy and other standard indicators and FDI fully
financed the current account deficit which narrowed from 4.3 percent of GDP in 2014 to
3.3 percent in 2015. Brazil’s external position remained, however, moderately weaker than the
level consistent with fundamentals reflecting the recent reversal of exchange rate depreciation
that occurred in 2015.
The health of the banking sector deteriorated somewhat but remains solid: the system wide
capital ratios fell in 2015, but remain well above the regulatory minima; liquidity risk increased
in 2015, but the overall funding profile of the system remained strong; external funding
exposures are low and foreign exchange risks are largely hedged; profitability declined owing to
a spike in provisions for loan losses and higher funding costs; non-performing loans (NPLs) have
gradually increased, but remain moderate at 4.1 percent. Banks have remained well provisioned
with loan loss reserves covering 150 percent of NPLs. However, nonfinancial corporates are
leveraged and vulnerable.
Fiscal outcomes have been disappointing. In 2015 the non-financial public sector primary deficit
reached 1.9 percent of GDP and the overall deficit was 10.4 percent of GDP. The primary deficit
in 2016 is expected to reach 2.7 percent of GDP, and the overall balance would be close to that
observed in 2015.
Since May 2016, the government announced a series of measures to strengthen macro policies
and restore credibility. Notably, the government has sent to Congress a constitutional amendment
limiting the growth in federal noninterest spending to the rate of consumer price inflation of the
previous year for the next 20 years. The government has also announced a reform of the social
security system, needed in its own right and also necessary to make the expenditure limit viable.
Fund staff expects activity to start to recover gradually, but remain weak for a prolonged period.
Staff project output growth of -3.3 percent in 2016 and about ½ percent in 2017. The projection
is predicated on the assumption the fiscal spending cap and social security reform are approved
in a reasonable timeframe, and the government will meet the proposed fiscal targets for 2016 and
2017. With these improvements on the fiscal front, and assuming uncertainty continues to
decline, investment is projected to continue to recover, supporting a gradual return to positive
sequential growth beginning in late 2016. The outlook is subject to downside risks, including the
re-intensification of political uncertainties (e.g., as a result of developments in the corruption
probe) and risks related to a protracted period of slower growth in advanced and emerging
economies, especially China, further declines in export commodity prices, and tighter financial
conditions.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors agreed that Brazil’s difficult economic situation had resulted from several
factors, including past policy missteps, policy uncertainty, and external shocks. The recession
has lowered growth, raised unemployment, and undermined public and private balance sheets.
However, the economy appeared to be stabilizing and near term prospects were for a gradual
resumption of economic growth. Looking forward, Directors strongly emphasized the need for
fiscal consolidation to ensure macroeconomic stability and comprehensive structural reforms to
raise potential growth.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ announced fiscal strategy noting that it had helped boost
confidence and market sentiment. They supported the focus on controlling expenditure growth,
including through the proposed federal spending cap. This expenditure restraint may need to be
complemented with revenue measures to achieve fiscal targets if revenue collections disappoint
in the future. Most directors noted the potential positive effects of a front loaded fiscal
consolidation strategy on borrowing costs, savings, confidence, debt sustainability and medium
term growth. While recognizing the necessity of consolidation measures, a number of other
Directors cautioned against more front loaded measures until growth is on a strong recovery
path.
Directors underlined the need for reform of social security schemes, including those for civil
servants at all levels of government, in view of unfavorable demographic trends and large
actuarial imbalances. They emphasized the centrality of this reform for the viability of the
federal spending cap. Directors also expressed concern over subnational finances, and
encouraged the authorities to continue to develop durable solutions in coordination with the
states.
Directors noted that monetary policy had been appropriately calibrated, with the tight stance of
the last two years warranted by strong inflation pressures. While conditions for a gradual easing
cycle are taking shape now, with inflation expectations converging toward the target, Directors
recommended that monetary policy should remain relatively tight until more tangible progress in
fiscal adjustment and reforms is made and inflation expectations move closer to the central
bank’s inflation target. Directors welcomed the intention to strengthen Brazil’s inflation targeting
framework by enhancing the central bank’s autonomy and improving its communications.
Directors underscored that the floating exchange rate system and reserve buffers were two main
sources of strength for Brazil and should be preserved. They welcomed the reduction in foreign
exchange intervention, and recommended that market intervention be limited to smoothing
excessive volatility.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors highlighted that the financial system has remained sound amidst the recession and low
credit growth and see scope for making the financial system even more robust by enhancing the
financial safety net. Directors underscored the need for continued vigilance and close monitoring
of the health of the corporate sector and its links to the banking sector.
Directors strongly recommended that the authorities step up their structural reforms efforts to
raise long term growth, including in the areas of tax policy, labor markets, and infrastructure.
They also underscored the importance of trade reforms to increase competitiveness and
efficiency.
Directors commended Brazil for the effective implementation of AML/CFT measures and
encouraged the authorities to pursue further reforms. They noted the need for strengthened
reporting of fiscal statistics of SOEs, public banks, and states’ finances, and encouraged the
authorities to monitor and enforce subnational fiscal rules.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
October 14, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context. The economy is still in its deepest recession in decades, partly the result of the failure of
past policies. The recession has been aggravated by a political crisis, which had, until recently,
paralyzed policymaking and further damaged confidence. President Rousseff was impeached for
responsibility crimes related to fiscal practices on August 31, and the government that took office
in May will remain in charge until January 1st, 2019. Markets have responded positively to the new
government’s reform agenda, bolstering asset prices and confidence and helping the country ride
a positive wave of sentiment toward emerging economies. However, while some high-frequency
indicators suggest the recession may be nearing its end, the implementation of much-needed
reforms to durably restore policy credibility is subject to risks.
Outlook and Risks. Growth is projected to resume gradually, but will remain weak for a
prolonged period. Uncertainty related to the political situation and the corruption probe at
Petrobras is likely to diminish, contributing to a recovery in investment and a gradual return to
positive quarterly growth in late 2016. Staff’s financial conditions index loosened significantly
following the government change, but these gains may understate the policy and economic
challenges ahead. Brazil’s macroeconomic prospects hinge on the new government’s ability to
successfully implement the ambitious structural fiscal reforms underpinning its medium term
consolidation strategy. Failure to implement such reforms is the most immediate risk, and would
jeopardize debt sustainability. In the baseline scenario, fiscal consolidation proceeds at a gradual
pace, and gross debt only stabilizes past the end of the standard 5-year projection period.
Policy Recommendations. Focus should be on rebuilding credibility and regaining long-term
fiscal sustainability through reforms that address unsustainable expenditure mandates, including
in the social security system, reduce the fiscal deficit, and boost potential growth in the medium
term. The government has put forward a strategy for fiscal consolidation based on keeping
noninterest expenditure constant in real terms and pursuing social security reform; these reforms
are welcome, but they will bear fruit over many years, and carry significant risks, including large
public gross financing needs for a considerable period. Thus, there is merit in undertaking
additional actions to achieve a more frontloaded fiscal consolidation. Monetary policy should
remain tight until inflation expectations converge closer to the center of the tolerance band.
Tangible progress on fiscal consolidation would expedite convergence of inflation and inflation
expectations, allowing more room for monetary easing to support the recovery. The exchange
rate should remain the main external adjustment variable and the gradual reduction in the stock
of FX swaps should continue, consistent with market circumstances, while further intervention
should be considered only to fend off market dysfunction. The resilience of the banking sector
should be bolstered through enhanced monitoring and improved financial safety nets.

CONTEXT: DEEPEST RECESSION IN DECADES
1.
Brazil is still in the grip of a deep recession. Led by plummeting confidence that triggered
sharp declines in investment and consumption, the contraction in output has been one of the
largest in memory. Since the beginning of 2015, the unemployment rate has almost doubled and
2.7 million formal jobs have been lost; youth employment has been particularly hard hit (Box 1).
Household income fell and inequality increased during the recession, bucking a decade-long trend.1

The increase in the youth unemployment rate
was even sharper, rendering nearly 1 in every
4 Brazilian youngsters (18 to 24 years old)
unemployed. Youth unemployment climbed from
14.1 percent in 2014Q4 to 24.5 percent in 2016Q2.
There are significant differences between adult and
youth labor dynamics. For adults (25 to 59 years
old), the labor force has been growing at a steady
pace, but since the end of 2014 the decline in
employment growth has led to an increase in adult
unemployment. By contrast, since early 2015 the
youth labor force, which had been declining, has
been rising again while youth employment has
collapsed, causing youth unemployment rates to
increase by more than 10 percent.

The effects of the recession on youth employment are exacerbated by a high minimum wage. In Brazil,
youth employment is significantly more sensitive to increases in the minimum wage (holding the average
wage constant) than adult unemployment.2 Although real average earnings dropped by more than 4 percent
year-over-year in 2016Q2, the real minimum wage increased, likely pricing younger workers out of the labor
market.
Since the beginning of the recession the Brazilian economy lost 2.7 million formal jobs. Facing of
decreasing industrial production, retail sales, and real wages, most sectors of the economy experienced
negative job creation, but the bulk of the formal job destruction (about 1.8 million) has come from industry
and construction.

Formal job destruction is likely to continue for a few more quarters. The Brazilian formal job market is
historically highly correlated with the business cycle. This suggests that, under Staff’s forecast for Real GDP,
cumulative formal job destruction during the recession can ammount to as much as 3.1 million jobs between
2014Q1 and 2017Q4. 3

We regress quarterly net formal job creation numbers (1999Q3‒2016Q1) on year-on-year percent changes of real GDP

values of future net job creation and cumulate the result from 2014Q1.

Domestic factors largely explain the
deterioration in growth, although terms of
trade changes and weak global demand also
played an important role. Activity has
contracted in 7 out of the 10 quarters through
2016Q2. The weakness reflects the confluence of
long-standing domestic issues and other factors.

extractive sector. These firms have faced difficult financing conditions and have scaled down
their traditional bond issuance abruptly, especially in 2015. The infrastructure concessions
program has had difficulties making progress.


Consumption contracted as well, owing to deteriorating labor market conditions and a
tightening of credit conditions (see Selected Issues Paper).



On the positive side, net exports have begun to support growth, reflecting both a demandrelated contraction in imports and strong exports on the back of the depreciation of the real in
2015. Also, commodity export volumes expanded strongly owing to increases in capacity
resulting from investment initiated during the boom years (e.g. in mining). However, the
currency appreciation since March this year raises doubts about the momentum of net exports
going forward.



A sharp realignment of regulated prices and monetary policy tightening also represented a
drag on growth in 2015.



Fiscal policy was broadly neutral over 2015‒16 (not counting the reduction in quasi-fiscal
activity) despite cuts in discretionary spending introduced in early 2015. The government started
2015 promising rising fiscal surpluses, and took early adjustment measures, such as the
discontinuation of policy lending to BNDES, the modification of some excesses in entitlement
programs, and the realignment of electricity tariffs, which staved off the expected flow of
subsidies to the sector. However, momentum was not sustained, and policies, including those
originating in Congress, were at times expansionary. Policies under the new government have
shifted focus toward the pursuit of medium-term reforms and away from meeting tight primary
balance objectives in the near term.



Additional factors hampering growth related to uncertainty surrounding the political situation
and the corruption probe at Petrobras. The corruption investigation has broadened to include
more firms in the private sector and high-ranking politicians. Some of these effects are hard to
disentangle from economic factors: for example, some large construction firms involved in
corruption were banned from competing for new projects at Petrobras, but Petrobras has been
cutting investment in any case in response to the new realities in the oil market.

The recent worsening of the economic environment has contributed to a deterioration in mediumterm growth expectations, but these have fallen by more, and for longer, than the recession can
explain. Between 2002 and 2012, expectations of annual growth (3 years ahead) were broadly stable,
averaging around 4 percent. Since then, growth expectations have deteriorated, falling to about 2 percent by
end-2015. As of 2016Q2, the change in current conditions helps to explain roughly one quarter of the recent
decrease in medium-term growth expectations, with the remainder of the decrease explained by other, ‘noncurrent’ factors. These factors in essence represent an autonomous reassessment of Brazil’s growth potential
over the medium term, above and beyond the impact of contemporaneous growth.

Box 2. Investment and Growth Expectations (Concluded)
What explains the rapid drop in investment? Estimates suggest that developments hampering investment
over this period include a rise in costs (chiefly a sharp increase in regulated prices, such as energy prices),
falling terms of trade—impacting prospects for commodity exporters—and tighter financial conditions
(through both higher real interest rates and lower equity prices).1 The “autonomous” part of the
deterioration in the medium-term outlook for growth has been a significant drag to investment over the
past 2 years, reducing investment by more than 10 percent since beginning of 2014.

What does this imply for investment going forward? The results suggest that stabilization of regulated-

price inflation, the terms of trade, equity prices, and real interest rates should improve both investment
growth and growth expectations. In particular, the large, necessary, tariff increases of 2015 corrected past
policy mistakes, and need not be repeated; subsequent increases can be more moderate and thus are not
expected to represent large headwinds. Interest rates are expected to be eased as disinflation allows, also
removing another important headwind. While stabilization of these factors is expected in the short term,
reducing some of the drag on investment, the prospect of a return to investment growth crucially depends
on an alleviation of other sources of weakness, such as a reduction in uncertainty related to the political
situation, improvements in policy credibility, and addressing impediments to potential output. The analysis
also suggests that if medium-term growth expectations remain subdued, the recovery in investment may be
incomplete.

___________________________________________________

Results are from the joint estimation of two equations. The first regresses mid-term (3-years ahead) growth expectations
on contemporaneous yearly percent changes in GDP, regulated prices, terms of trade, and equity prices. The second
regresses quarterly changes in real gross fixed capital formation on lagged quarterly percent changes of regulated prices,
terms of trade, real interest rates, equity prices and on the lagged residual of the first equation (i.e., the part of mid-term
growth expectations which is orthogonal to current conditions). To account for correlation of residuals, Seemingly
Unrelated Regressions is used, estimated with a two-step Generalized Least Squares method.

Tentative signs point to the end of recession. The rate of output contraction has slowed
and the economy appears to have regained some footing, with industrial production and business
confidence improving since early 2016. Indicators related to international trade and the labor market
are also showing signs of stabilization, and staff’s financial conditions index (FCI), a leading indicator
of real activity, has improved significantly since end-February 2016 (Figure 5).

4.
Inflation is normalizing slowly. The policy rate has been on hold for more than a year now.
To prevent second round effects from the large increases in regulated prices and exchange rate
depreciation, the monetary policy rate (SELIC) was hiked by 250 basis points to its current level of
14.25 percent between January 2015 and July 2015. The interest rate on subsidized loans (known as
“TJLP”) was increased by 250 basis points to 7.5 percent between late 2014 and early 2016.
Consistent with previous Staff advice, the central bank’s inflation tolerance range was reduced from
2.5 percent to 6.5 percent to 3 percent to 6 percent for 2017. However, headline and core inflation
have been above the central target and around the upper limit of the central bank’s tolerance range
for several years. In 2015, inflation spiked to 10.7 percent (e.o.p.), largely because of much needed
relative-price adjustments (Box 3). But in 2016, some price increases have begun to moderate and
12-month inflation has fallen back to single digits. Yet, disinflation proceeded slowly due to inflation
expectations that were higher than the target, and rising food prices owing in part to drought in the
Northeast (Figure 2).
Box 3. Relative Price Realignment
Two sharp relative-price realignments occurred in
2015, contributing to a spike in inflation. Headline
inflation rose to 10.7 in December 2015, more than
6 percent above the center of the central bank’s
tolerance range. Regulated prices were a key
contributor, rising by almost 18 percent over the year.
Over this time, the exchange rate also depreciated by
around 20 percent in real effective terms, putting
further pressure on tradables’ prices.
While boosting inflation in the short term,
adjustments were necessary. In the several years
prior to 2015, regulated prices had been contained by
government policy, creating distortions, and
contributing to rising inflation expectations. In the
electricity sector, a policy to subsidize electricity
prices was introduced in 2012, increasing demand
despite early signs of drought, and driving companies
to borrow to cover higher generation costs. In an
attempt to protect consumers from rising
international prices, Petrobras was directed to sell
fuel at a loss from 2012 to early 2014, contributing to
rising debt levels at the company and a deterioration
in its share price. The recent increases in regulated
prices have alleviated these distortions. Likewise, the
depreciation of the currency has moved it towards
levels more consistent with fundamentals, improving
Brazil’s competitiveness.

Box 3. Relative Price Realignment (Concluded)
The impact on inflation has been large and
broad based.1 Regulated prices currently have
a significant weight in Brazil’s CPI (around
25 percent of the basket), making the direct
effect of regulated-price increases on inflation
particularly large; the impact of an exchange
rate depreciation is much smaller in
comparison, but still significant. Many regulated
goods and services are direct inputs into
production (gasoline and electricity, e.g.), which
leads to second-round effects that can broaden
the impact of any price changes. Moreover,
price- and wage-indexation perpetuate price
shocks and spread their impact across the
economy.

Fiscal policy outcomes have been disappointing. In 2015 the non-financial public sector
primary deficit reached 1.9 percent of GDP (a far cry from the original target of a surplus of
1.2 percent of GDP), and the overall deficit was 10.4 percent of GDP. The key driver was a fall of
4.8 percent in real revenue collection,2 which was partially offset by a decline in real expenditures.
Interest payments also increased substantially, including as a result of the FX swap program, which
had losses of 1.5 percent of GDP. The targets for the 2016 primary balance were repeatedly revised,
with a final large downward revision introduced mid-year. The new government reduced the 2016
federal primary balance target to -170 billion reais, or some -2.7 percent of GDP, reflecting the
growth in items indexed to past inflation and the minimum wage and continuing revenue weakness.
As of September 2016, meeting this target appeared feasible, but the outcome may depend on the
yield of the repatriation tax. The strengthening of the currency has generated profits on the FX
swaps in 2016, helping avoid an increase in the overall deficit. Financing the large deficits and falling
maturities became significantly more expensive throughout 2015, with the rise in borrowing costs
starting ahead of the loss of investment grade which took place between September and December
2015. But no difficulties arose in the placement of new debt, in part owing to the favorable
composition of public debt by instrument and creditor (see Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) Annex
and the Balance Sheet Analysis (BSA) matrix in Appendix III). Borrowing costs have fallen significantly
in the course of 2016 with the change in government and the prospects of fiscal reforms. For

example, the yield on the 5-year bond fell from 16.5 percent at end-December 2015 to 11.7 percent
at end-September 2016.
6.
Many subnational governments have been crippled by a confluence of the recession
and unsustainable expenditure mandates. The recession has caused states’ revenues from all
sources to fall sharply in 2015−16, making financing of their rising mandatory spending, chiefly on
salaries and retirement pensions, increasingly difficult (see Selected Issues Paper). Many states have
raised tax rates and sold assets to cope with fiscal stress. Since late 2015, several states have been
paying salaries late and/or have been using third-party funds held in escrow to make ends meet.3
Rio de Janeiro defaulted on federally guaranteed loans from IFIs in 2016, and obtained emergency
federal transfers that helped it to host the Olympics (Box 4). The dire situation of the states is
understated by fiscal statistics, which are compiled on a cash-basis (Table 3) and do not show all
extra-budgetary operations and new arrears, and are subject to classification problems (the
significance of data problems is illustrated by S&P’s recent decision to stop issuing ratings for Rio de
Janeiro’s debt owing to data gaps). To provide states with relief, the federal government (the states’
main creditor) agreed to a temporary standstill in the servicing of federal loans, and many states are
lobbying the federal government for additional support.
Box 4. Fiscal Crisis in Rio de Janeiro
The state of Rio de Janeiro epitomizes the subnational fiscal crisis in Brazil. In July 2016, Rio de Janeiro
declared a “state of calamity” over public finances and received a R$2.9 billion transfer from the federal
government to guarantee the payment of security forces during the Olympic Games. This episode put the
state on the spotlight and increased the media attention towards a subnational fiscal crisis that affects some
of the largest states in the country. At the end of 2015, Rio Grande do Sul had already breached the debt
limit established by the Fiscal Responsibility Law (at 200 percent of net current revenues) and Rio de Janeiro
and Minas Gerais were rapidly approaching the limit. A number of states have been able to avert such rapid
deterioration of public finances and find themselves in better fiscal shape.
Rio de Janeiro has been running arrears due to cash shortages. In 2015, faced with falling revenues and
a federally-imposed tight credit constraint, Rio de Janeiro prioritized its payroll. Like other states, it obtained
cash-flow relief from the suspension of debt service payments to the Federal government in 2016, but this
was not enough. Cash shortages led Rio to increase payment deferrals and Despesas de Exercicios Anteriores
(DEAs), which are exceptional expenditures not included in the budget and postponed to the following year.
These payment delays included electricity, water, gas, phone, security and cleaning services. In 2015, 24
states accumulated R$15.4 billion (0.3 percent of Brazil’s GDP) in DEAs (an increase of 44 percent from 2014),
and Rio de Janeiro was the state with the largest increase (185 percent). Rio de Janeiro also failed to service
debt to international financial institutions, triggering federal guarantees. By August 2016, Rio de Janeiro
accumulated a 4-month delay in transferring to commercial banks the amounts withheld from state
employees’ paychecks to service their personal loans. In response, banks stopped payroll loans to state
government employees in Rio de Janeiro.

These are the “judicial deposits” constituted by private parties with disputes against the states (or against other
private parties) awaiting resolution by the courts. The temporary use of these resources has been allowed by law, but
the funds will need to be made up.

Box 4. Fiscal Crisis in Rio de Janeiro (Concluded)
The fiscal crisis in Rio de Janeiro stems largely from structural fiscal imbalances. The decline in
revenues in Rio de Janeiro has both a cyclical component (the recession reduced tax collection, especially
from ICMS) and a structural component (the oil price slump which dramatically reduced revenues from
royalties and accentuated recessionary conditions in Rio de Janeiro, where Petrobras is headquartered and
was building a large petrochemical complex, now cancelled). The increase in expenditures is also structural
in nature and has been building up over a long period of time. In 2015, payroll expenditures (R$17 billion)
and pensions for inactive workers and retirees (R$11 billion) represented 32 and 20 percent of total primary
expenditures respectively. Between 2009 and 2015 these two expenditures increased 70 percent in real
terms, driven largely by salary increases, putting Rio de Janeiro in the leading position in this spending
category (see Selected Issues Paper). While its economy was growing and oil was booming Rio de Janeiro
managed to keep up with this structural increase in spending, but as soon as the downturn hit the region,
the decline in revenue made it very hard to finance its spending: in 2016 monthly payments of both salaries
and pensions consumed 90 percent of monthly revenues.
Structural fiscal reforms are required to solve the fiscal crisis. Despite the savings from the federal debt
rescheduling program (equivalent to R$2.5 billion) and a large number of ad-hoc measures, the state still
faces a gap in its finances of R$16 billion in 2016 (2.4 percent of the state’s GDP and ¼ percent of Brazil’s
GDP). Structural fiscal reforms are urgently needed. The subnational fiscal crisis requires a reform of public
employment rules and a pension reform at the national level to alleviate the pressure coming from growing
mandatory expenditures. In Rio de Janeiro and possibly some other states, new sources of recurrent revenue
also need to be considered.

7.
Financial markets have been volatile. Major market movements through the last 12–18
months can often be traced to political and policy shocks, such as the successive loosening of fiscal
targets and the impeachment of President Rousseff. The real depreciated by around 50 percent
against the U.S. dollar over the year to December 2015, and by around 20 percent in real effective
terms. Over the same period, stock prices lost 10 percent of their value and domestic government
bond yields rose by more than 300 basis points. Over the course of 2016, these indicators have
regained lost ground amid expectations of improved economic policies and growth prospects, and a
more generalized reduction in risk aversion among global investors. This has been reflected in a
sharp reversal in the FCI in 2016Q2, and in renewed bond placements abroad by corporates.
8.
The central bank has intervened in the foreign exchange market less frequently than in
the past. Intervention in 2015 was appropriately limited to containing short-term excessive volatility,
broadly symmetric, and continued to rely on the use of FX swaps and, to a lesser extent, FX repos.
Taking advantage of the market rally that began in March 2016, the central bank has lowered the
net notional value of outstanding FX swaps to about US$32 billion (from a high of about
US$110 billion) by issuing reverse swaps and not rolling over maturing swaps.
9.
The external position has improved (Appendix II). The current account deficit narrowed
from 4.3 percent of GDP in 2014 to 3.3 percent in 2015, but Brazil’s external position remained
moderately weaker than the level consistent with fundamentals according to the External Balance
Assessment (EBA). Due to the depreciation in the second half of 2015, the real effective exchange
rate was only slightly overvalued at the beginning of 2016 but given the currency appreciation this

year, earlier competitiveness gains have been eroded. The real depreciation in 2015 was reflected
largely in improvements in the current account in 2016 owing to lagged effects on exports
(Appendix III).
10.
International reserves remain a source of strength and capital flows are stable,
although their composition has changed. At US$365 billion, reserves are above the IMF’s
adequacy metric. Over 2015-2016, equity liability flows (both direct investment and portfolio
accounts) remained strong as foreign investors pursued private equity deals made attractive by the
weaker real. But debt liability flows fell sharply, especially in 2015, reflecting the hardening of market
access for Petrobras and other large corporations. Net direct investment fully financed the current
account deficit in both 2015 and 2016. After rising sharply over 2014, the share of intercompany
loans in direct investment liability flows fell to about 25 percent in 2015 as proceeds from overseas
borrowing by foreign incorporated subsidiaries of Brazilian parent companies, notably Petrobras,
dropped sharply (Appendix III). Net portfolio debt liabilities fell to close to zero in 2015 from
1 percent of GDP in previous years. So far in 2016, firms have enjoyed greater market access relative
to 2015 and FDI has remained strong, including as a result of intercompany loans by foreign
companies to their Brazilian subsidiaries, but portfolio flows have remained subdued.
11.
Brazil is in the downturn phase of the financial cycle, which warrants enhanced
monitoring. Corporates are significantly bank dependent, and the expansion of bank credit for
many years contributed to rising leveraging among firms (see Appendix III, where balance sheet
matrices for 2007 and 2014 are analyzed). The credit cycle has turned, however, as banks
(increasingly including public banks) have been slowing credit supply while leveraged corporations
and households face unfavorable income prospects. In fact, contracting domestic demand and a
negative output gap have been reflected in a reduction in demand for credit, including for
subsidized lending extended by BNDES. Facing withdrawals of savings deposits in 2015, Caixa
Economica reduced the supply of mortgages by tightening LTV requirements. The LTVs were
reversed in 2016 as the bank compensated for lower deposits with alternative, albeit more
expensive, funding sources.4 Nominal credit growth was negative (-0.6 percent year over year) in
August 2016, for the first time since 2002, reflecting a decline in demand, tighter underwriting
standards, and the authorities’ decision to reduce the rate of expansion of public banks. Until about
Q1-2016, financial conditions (measured by the FCI) had been tightening amid higher foreign
funding costs, monetary policy tightening and the depreciation of the real (see Selected Issues
Paper).5 Since March, however, the FCI reversed course with the prospects of government change.
12.
Macro-prudential policies have been used appropriately. The central bank relaxed
reserve requirements on deposits for small- and medium-sized banks in an effort to support

Financial, credit, and business cycles are estimated using a variety of commonly-used statistical methods and a
semi-structural model of the Brazilian economy (see Selected Issues Paper). In the model-based approach financial,
credit, and business cycles are jointly estimated and can be projected in a consistent way. Staff’s baseline output and
credit forecasts benefit from this approach.

liquidity and bolster certain types of loan (housing, agricultural and infrastructure). This move was
consistent with macro-prudential principles, as it helped soften a declining credit cycle and alleviate
liquidity risks, and reversed the previous tightening of reserve requirements.
13.
After deteriorating in 2015, the health of the banking sector improved in the first half
of 2016 as shocks to funding dissipated. In particular:


Solvency. The system-wide capital ratios fell in 2015, but have since increased and are well above
the regulatory minima. However, capital ratios of public banks, which are much lower than those
of private banks, have continued to drop mainly due to higher Basel III deductions from capital.
In an effort to bolster capital ratios, the two largest public banks have already cut dividends and
are planning to sell assets, including by issuing initial public offerings of part of their operations.
The decrease in capital in 2015 largely reflects higher unrealized losses on fixed income
securities, an expansion of balance sheets from exchange rate depreciation, and a significant
increase in deferred tax assets following an increase in the tax rate. The increase in capital ratios
of private banks in 2016 was mainly driven by reduction of balance sheets (also due to exchange
rate appreciation) and higher unrealized gains on fixed income securities as government yields
plunged following the government change.



Liquidity. Liquidity risk increased in 2015 due to withdrawals of funding, especially saving
deposits. This partly reflects a search for yield through the purchase of mutual funds shares and
banks’ deposits-like instruments. However, the overall funding profile of the system remains
strong and improved in the first half of 2016 as banks increased holdings of liquid assets in an
environment of low credit supply. External funding exposures are low (at around 12 percent of
total funding) and foreign exchange risks are largely hedged.



Profitability. While banks’ net income after taxes increased in 2015 reflecting higher tax credits
and higher deferred tax assets following the tax change, net income before taxes dropped
significantly in 2015, owing to a spike in provisions for loan losses and higher funding costs
following the sovereign downgrade. On the other hand, net incomes after taxes fell in the first
half of 2016 pushing profitability indicators below 2015 levels. However, profits before taxes
surged significantly during the first half of 2016 primarily due to higher spreads as a result of
higher credit risk. The poor performance of the stocks, especially Petrobras shares, has impacted
BNDES’ equity portfolio with the damage being recognized in its mid-2016 income statement.



Asset quality. Banks’ non-performing loans (NPLs) have gradually increased over 2015 and
reached 3.6 percent of total loans in July 2016 (4.1 percent if restructured loans are added to the
stock of NPLs). To further limit increases in NPLs, banks have been renegotiating the terms of
some loans and writing-off delinquent loans. Banks have remained well provisioned with loan
loss reserves covering 150 percent of NPLs.

15.
The change in government has brought a change in the design and orientation of
several key policies.


The government has sent to Congress a constitutional amendment limiting the growth in federal
noninterest spending to the rate of consumer price inflation of the previous year for the next 20
years, with an opportunity for a revision in the tenth year.7 This reform seeks to overcome the
effect of political fragmentation on Brazil’s budgetary process by imposing a hard budget
constraint at the constitutional level.8 Also, the government has accepted a large primary deficit
in 2016, and proposed a primary balance target for 2017 in line with the operation of the
expenditure ceiling. The proposed 2017 budget also includes some ½ percent of GDP in one-off
revenues from the auctioning of concessions and asset sales. Under these policies, there would
still be significant real spending growth in 2017 (if inflation falls, as expected); the harder part of
the adjustment would start in 2018, once inflation has broadly stabilized, preventing further real
growth in spending. The government has also announced a reform of the social security system,
much needed in its own right and also necessary to make the expenditure limit viable.



Against the background of a marked drop in interest rate futures, the Central Bank has made a
return of inflation to the central target by end-2017 a priority, and indicated that an easing of
policies can be considered once visible progress in fiscal reforms has been secured. The BCB has
also stepped up its communication practices and the new government announced the intention
to grant the central bank operational autonomy through a constitutional amendment that
provides immunity to board members from lower-court prosecution, while removing the
ministerial status that is now conferred on the BCB governor.



The infrastructure concessions program has had difficulties gaining momentum in an
environment marked by uncertainty, low growth, and tight financing conditions, especially for
large construction companies implicated in the Petrobras corruption scandal. However, a newly
announced institutional framework and forthcoming changes in regulatory agencies may
stimulate a pick-up in private sector participation (see Appendix III).

16.
While recent corruption investigations signal a welcome move towards greater
transparency, they have also added to political and economic uncertainty. The authorities have
been implementing strong mechanisms to oversee public expenditure and recover losses to the
state due to budgetary irregularities. This has been notably achieved through the work of the
Federal Court of Accounts, the Federal Public Prosecutors Office, the Financial Intelligence Unit and
the ENCCLA9. Steps taken to strengthen the anti-corruption (AC) and anti-money laundering (AML)
frameworks, such as the revisions to the AML Law in 2012, and the 2013 AC law have provided
additional tools to investigate and prosecute corruption. Nevertheless, high-level enforcement

The reform, with minor changes, passed its first vote in the lower house on October 10. It still needs another vote in
that house and two votes in the Senate.

actions have added uncertainty to the existing negative impact that large-scale corruption has on
investment, growth, and political stability.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
A. Returning to Growth
17.
Activity is expected to start to recover gradually, but will remain weak for a prolonged
period. The near-term outlook is for a gradual recovery to start in the second half of 2016,
assuming that political uncertainty diminishes and that other downward economic shocks (such as
the large administered-price adjustments of 2015 and the major investment cuts by Petrobras) run
their course. A sharper recovery is difficult because of the excess leverage and slack among firms,
and weakened income and balance sheets of households. Monetary policy is expected to remain
relatively tight and credit growth is projected to fall further as a share of GDP in 2017. While
deteriorating economic conditions are expected to affect the quality of banks’ assets, the largest
banks have enough capital to absorb possible losses (see Selected Issues Paper). The baseline
assumes that the proposed fiscal target for 2016 will be met, and that the authorities’ proposed
structural reforms on the public expenditure side will be approved and implemented. Over the
medium term, inflation is expected to slowly converge toward the target midpoint as output growth
reaches its potential rate of 2 percent (which does not assume the adoption of any major structural
reforms on the supply side beyond the implementation of the authorities’ infrastructure concession
program); the current account deficit is expected to stabilize around 2 percent of GDP. Credit is
expected to recover broadly in line with activity, albeit with a lag (the credit to GDP ratio will begin
to edge up in 2018).10 In this context, BNDES is expected to rely on its own balance sheet and to
prioritize lending for infrastructure. The health of the banking sector is expected to improve as the
economy picks up and funding costs decline. Government spending is assumed to continue growing
in real terms in the near term, albeit at reduced rates, consistent with the gradual tightening implicit
in the expenditure ceiling. The gradual recovery of growth will have positive spillovers on other
economies in the region, notably those of Brazil’s Mercosur partners.

Downside risks continue to dominate the outlook, but upside risks are emerging
(Appendix I).


A key domestic risk is that the new government fails to deliver on its fiscal consolidation strategy
and provide a durable boost to confidence. Re-intensification of political uncertainties (e.g., as a
result of developments in the corruption probe) could also exacerbate downside risks resulting
in a “sudden stop” of capital inflows, a sharp asset price adjustment and widening of credit
spreads, and a defensive tightening of the monetary policy stance. In this financial stress
scenario, higher risk premia would also trigger losses on fixed income securities for banks, while
a “double dip” recession could further impact private agents with weakened balance sheets,
resulting in larger loan losses and capital shortfalls for some banks; this would further dampen
credit supply and economic activity, and damage the fiscal position with recapitalization costs
and the realization of deferred tax credits (see Selected Issues Paper). 11 Petrobras’ balance sheet
may be subject to risks from unfunded contingent liabilities, as is the case for other SOEs,
(Eletrobras and Caixa Economica).



External downside risks relate to a protracted period of slower growth in advanced and
emerging economies, especially China, further declines in export commodity prices, and tighter
financial conditions.



Upside risks have also emerged. Recent policy pronouncements have boosted confidence and
asset prices which, if sustained, could foster a sharper turnaround in investment and growth.
Faster-than-envisaged progress in the approval of the authority’s fiscal reform agenda could
spark a more vigorous recovery in sentiment, boosting foreign interest in Brazil in the context of
an external environment marked by low interest rates. This would result in stronger investment
and growth in Brazil, although a possible surge in capital flows may pose challenges, notably for
sectors that have benefitted from the recent currency depreciation.

19.
The authorities have been responsive to some of Staff’s past recommendations. In
particular, monetary policy was tightened in 2015, and the National Monetary Council narrowed the
inflation tolerance range from 4.5 percent +/- 2 percent to 4.5 percent +/- 1.5 percent for 2017, and
raised the long-term lending rate (TJLP) from 5.5 to 7.5 percent over the past year and a half. The
net FX swaps position was also lowered significantly over the past year, in line with Staff’s advice. The
ongoing push for reforms that address structural sources of fiscal pressure, including the announced
plans of the government to pursue social security reform, are also consistent with past advice from
Staff.

11

These results, obtained independently by Staff, are broadly consistent with the results of the central bank’s own
stress test published in their April and September 2016 Financial Stability Reports. In the SIP it is also noted that a
sharp slowdown in credit can be harmful to growth. Such a situation could be provoked, for example, by a greater
need to strengthen balance sheets as buffers reach critical levels in a financial stress scenario.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Policymaking in recent years has failed to address long-standing structural problems and proved
counterproductive, contributing to an erosion of policy credibility and worsening growth
prospects. Greater progress at addressing medium-term structural issues—particularly pertaining
to the fiscal framework, at both national and subnational levels—would go a long way toward
restoring policy credibility and boosting confidence, necessary for the return to strong, inclusive,
and sustainable growth. Early implementation of key measures would also help moderate
inflation expectations and facilitate an easing of monetary policy. Given the current environment
and risks, the resilience of the banking sector should be bolstered and efforts to boost
infrastructure investment scaled up.

A. Restoring Credibility Through Fiscal Sustainability
20.
The government’s focus on controlling fiscal spending growth is an imperative and
welcome. Unsustainable fiscal dynamics are being driven by unfunded and increasingly onerous
mandates on the expenditure side, which increase government financing needs, raise borrowing
costs for all agents in the economy, and slow down economic growth, contributing, in turn, to a
further worsening of the public debt dynamics. The approval and steadfast implementation of the
spending cap could be a game changer—it would help improve the long term trajectory of public
spending and permit the stabilization and eventual reduction of public debt as a share of GDP. In
addition to the spending cap, the draft budget law before Congress contains a series of one-off
revenues arising from the granting of concessions and the sale of some assets. Together with
revenue projections based on the authorities’ macroeconomic assumptions, this yields a primary
balance target (floor) of -2.1 percent of GDP for 2017.
21.
Credible implementation of the spending cap, and more generally restoring
sustainability of the public sector finances, requires addressing the structural drivers of public
expenditure growth and increasing flexibility in the allocation of public monies. The main
areas for reform include:


20

Social security. The success of the expenditure rule would depend on reforming the social
security system—which is necessary in its own right, and would be a priority even in the absence
of a spending cap. Pension and other benefits represent nearly one half of federal noninterest
spending and at least 13 percent of states’ noninterest spending. These outlays have strong real
growth momentum as a result of demographic trends and benefit indexation rules (see Selected
Issues Paper). The reform of the pension system should be comprehensive, bearing upon the
rules governing retirement age, replacement rates at retirement, the growth of benefits postretirement, and the duplication of benefits. The retirement benefits system has been providing
support for persons who should instead be covered by targeted social assistance programs;
these programs should be ready to step in as the retirement system is reformed. Bringing civil
servants’ pension schemes closer to that of the private sector would be fiscally prudent and also
fair and equitable.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BRAZIL



Ending revenue earmarking. Revenue earmarking needs to be eliminated to create the flexibility
in the allocation of budgetary resources the expenditure cap will demand. In this context, an
important feature of the expenditure cap legislation is that it aims to remove the obligation to
dedicate an increasing share of net federal revenues to spending in education and health. This
provision will need to be supplemented with measures to control the growth of spending per
capita on public health, which is set to rise as Brazil’s population ages (see Selected Issues
Paper).



Containing payroll growth. Payrolls represent a large share of spending, especially in subnational
governments. Ensuring prudent hiring and remuneration decisions will be essential. In this
context, reforms to make exit from civil service feasible and to rationalize automatic career
progression are also needed.



Subnational governments: Strengthening institutional relationships across levels of government
and enacting legislation enabling states to make difficult expenditure adjustments should be
part of the strategy to help states regain control of their finances. The recommendations on
social security and payroll control apply fully to the case of states. A firm commitment by states
to increasing transparency is also key.



Minimum wage and indexation. The current formula for minimum wage revisions affects the
growth in pension and other benefits, and is thus a source of fiscal pressure over the medium
term. Severing the automatic link between benefit payments and the minimum wage is
advisable, as would be limiting minimum wage increases to cost of living adjustments.



Spending efficiency and composition. The spending cap will make it imperative for government
agencies to make better use of their resources to prevent a decline in the quality of their
services. Also, decisions over the composition of expenditure should preserve programs with a
positive impact on growth, including investment, and social safety nets for the most vulnerable
members of society.

22.
By itself, the expenditure cap could take several years to stabilize and reduce debt. As
designed, the cap would give the government one and possibly two more years of positive real
spending growth, before freezing real spending when inflation stabilizes. In staff’s baseline scenario,
the expenditure cap is implemented fully and one-off revenues like those in the 2017 budget
proposal are assumed to be collected each year. Given staff’s macroeconomic assumptions, this
policy combination would keep the overall deficit high for many years, during which the government
would continue to crowd out private agents from scarce funding (Tables 1 and 3, and DSA). Public
debt (GFSM definition) would reach 93.5 percent of GDP in 2021, and would peak around two years
later before beginning to decline.
23.
Against this backdrop, a more frontloaded adjustment which results in a faster
regeneration of the currently exhausted fiscal space has merit. The eventual trajectory of debt
ratios will depend on the evolution of growth, real interest rates, and primary balances—with the
last of these elements being most closely under the government’s influence. Frontloading fiscal

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

BRAZIL

consolidation may be a headwind to growth in the near term, but it can boost confidence and
reduce pressures on funding markets, bolstering growth in subsequent years.12 Staff’s
recommendation is to gradually raise the primary balance to about 3 percent of GDP by 2021; with
this, public debt would start declining from a peak of 86 percent of GDP already in that year (see
DSA). Beyond that point, the primary surplus would have to remain at a similarly high level for debt
ratios and borrowing costs to decrease to more comfortable levels. The additional adjustment,
which would rise gradually, would require a mixture of efforts to undershoot the spending cap and
mobilize quick-acting revenue gains, over-performing on the government’s own primary balance
targets by 0.3 percent of GDP in 2017 and 2018, and by larger margins in subsequent years (text
table). Moreover, these efforts may be even more urgent if one-off revenues cannot be sustained at
the 2017 level going forward. Some revenue measures should be temporary, remaining in effect
only while debt is still rising, and could include, in addition to asset sales, increases in fuels taxes
(CIDE) and federal turnover taxes (PIS/COFINS), an increase in the IOF tax on new loans, and the rollback of payroll tax cuts and other tax expenditures (including the SIMPLES program). Expenditure
measures should include the extension of the spending cap to subnational entities, and an
additional reduction of inefficient discretionary expenditures. Given concerns over the short run
effects on output of adjustment, these actions should proceed as economic growth firms up.

In the period 1999–2014, fiscal multipliers in Brazil were around 0.3–0.5 percent (Selected Issues Paper for the 2014
Article IV Consultation). The text table reflects this adverse effect on growth in 2017, but assumes that tailwinds from
faster restoration of fiscal sustainability will more than offset this “multiplier” effect in the following years, with this
boost tapering toward the end of the projection period. The scenario does not assume additional supply side
structural reforms that would lead to a permanently higher rate of real GDP growth.

22

B. Monetary and Financial Stability Policy
24.
The stance of monetary policy should remain unchanged until inflation is more certain
to converge to the central target. In the current context, marked by uncertainty about the output
gap, approval of key reforms, and related movements in the exchange rate, maintaining current
monetary policy settings would be broadly appropriate. The spike in inflation caused by regulatedprice and exchange-rate adjustments over 2015, as well as inflation persistence related to the more
recent drought-related food price shock, are expected to wane soon, while the effects of weak
demand and the recent exchange rate appreciation are expected to increasingly put downward
pressure on inflation. This would allow an easing cycle to begin in 2017. Nevertheless, there is a risk
that second-round effects of high inflation in 2015 contribute to an increase in inflation persistence.
Monetary policy should, therefore, remain tight until inflation expectations settle closer to the midpoint of the central bank’s tolerance range. In this context, tangible progress in fiscal adjustment
and reforms would create space for easing monetary policy. The intention to strengthen the inflation
targeting framework by enhancing the autonomy of the central bank and improved central bank
communication are welcome. These steps will boost institutional credibility and may contribute to
faster disinflation (see Selected Issues Paper).
25.
The exchange rate should remain the key external adjustment variable. Intervention
should remain limited to episodes of disorderly market conditions. Reserve buffers should be
preserved, resisting pressures to use them for ad-hoc purposes or for defending the currency in the
event of sustained capital outflows (see RAM). Continuing gradually to reduce the net notional value
of FX swaps, including by issuance of reverse FX swaps, is advisable. If improved market sentiment
from the swift implementation of structural reforms or more generally as foreign investors search for
yield in an environment of low interest rates leads to increased capital inflows with potentially
unwarranted appreciation, the options available would be to tighten fiscal policy (as in Staff’s
recommended path, for example, provided growth remains positive), issue more reverse FX swaps
(involving some fiscal cost), further reserve accumulation (with higher sterilization costs), and an
easing of the policy rate while raising the TJLP (with tradeoffs concerning the disinflation effort).
26.
While the health of the banking system remains largely sound, the resilience of the
banking sector should be bolstered. The health of the banking system remains largely sound,
although the recession has affected profitability and asset quality. The mission welcomes the
moderation in the growth rate of credit by public banks, their plans to reduce direct financing of
large corporations with market access, reducing credit market distortions, and the intention of the
two largest public banks to strengthen their capital position. To make the banking sector more
resilient to shocks, financial safety nets should be improved by strengthening the procedures for use
of the deposit insurance fund (for example, by securing adequate funding for the fund), enhancing
the central bank’s emergency liquidity assistance, and modernizing the resolution regime. To
strengthen transparency and accountability and reinforce the authorities’ ability to identify and
respond to future risks, an explicit mandate with clear responsibilities should be given to a
committee comprising all financial regulators, the deposit Guarantee Fund, and the Ministry of
finance, for macro-prudential oversight. Also, a mandate should be given to a separate entity that

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

BRAZIL

should set up a coordination framework to support timely and effective decision-making in a crisis
situation, and periodically test the capacity of the authorities to respond to crisis scenarios. The
authorities are also urged to follow through on their plans to strengthen private insolvency
frameworks, with the aim of expediting the bankruptcy process and reducing default losses incurred
by creditors. Risks arising from high private sector leverage underscore the need for continued
vigilance and close monitoring of the health of the corporate sector and its links to the banking
sector.

C. Policies to Boost Potential Growth
27.
Structural reforms targeted at reducing costs of doing business, enhancing efficiency,
and fostering investment are essential to strengthen growth over the medium term. While
some of these reforms are difficult politically, they come at very little economic cost and would
hasten a return to growth and bolster it beyond the current projection of 2 percent over the
medium term—although quantifying the precise impact on growth of these reforms is difficult. Key
areas to consider are:


Infrastructure bottlenecks. The infrastructure concessions program is critical to alleviating supplyside constraints and boosting competitiveness. Following through on recently announced
enhancements and regulatory reforms would help make the program more attractive to
investors, while maintaining high standards of governance and program design.



Tax reform. Brazil’s tax system is complex and burdensome. One important way to reduce the
cost of doing business would be to simplify the federal PIS/COFINS and the State Tax on the
Circulation of Goods and Services (ICMS).13



Opening the economy. Tariffs and nontariff-barrier reductions, a revision of the policy on
domestic content requirements, and pursuing free-trade negotiations outside Mercosur would
help increase competition and efficiency.



Efficient allocation of savings. A review of credit earmarking rules and other distortions would be
advisable to ensure that national savings go to their most productive uses.



Labor reform. Reforms aimed at facilitating productive employment and reducing incentives for
informality would promote job-creation, investment, and growth. Reforms should be mindful of
first-time entrants in the labor market, a segment composed largely of young people and
relatively sensitive to cyclical fluctuations. The moderation of the minimum wage indexation rule,
proposed earlier on fiscal grounds, would also contribute to restoring youth employment.

13

The PIS/COFINS is an indirect levy earmarked for the funding of social security, and is thus considered a
“contribution” instead of a tax.

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BRAZIL

28.

Fiscal statistics should be made more comprehensive. In particular:



A full balance sheet for general government should be published. Although balance sheets are
published by the federal and other governments, the published balance sheet for general
government includes only debt and financial assets. Among the missing items are accounts
payable, including floating debt (restos a pagar), and liabilities related to civil servants’ pensions.



Given the importance of state-owned enterprises and public banks in the analysis of fiscal policy,
the government should also publish fiscal statistics for the entire nonfinancial public sector (i.e.,
including Eletrobras and Petrobras) and for the entire public sector (including BNDES, Caixa
Econômica Federal, and Banco do Brasil). However, these entities should not be included in the
calculation of fiscal targets (as including them would introduce new distortions).



Strengthening fiscal transparency in states’ fiscal reporting (including by adopting standard
accounting practices) and timely monitoring and enforcement of fiscal rules are key challenges.

29.
The effective implementation of transparency, anti-corruption and AML measures
would contribute to enhancing predictability for businesses and ensure a greater perception
of fairness. Authorities’ commitments to make data on public procurement open by default,
implement the recent legislation on conflict of interest, and strengthen whistleblowing mechanisms
should be implemented. To further strengthen the effectiveness of the anti-corruption and AML
frameworks, the authorities should eliminate regulations that provide opportunities for bribes.
Additionally, the authorities aim to improve access to and sharing of banking and fiscal information,
and prevent the abuse of appeal provisions and statutes of limitations in legal proceedings, in line
with Supreme Court jurisprudence. Authorities should also strengthen provisional measures and
confiscation, effectively pursue a larger number of significant corruption, money laundering and
illicit enrichment cases, and enhance the AML/CFT supervision of banks’ obligations regarding
politically exposed persons.

AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS
30.
The authorities see evidence that economic activity has stabilized recently. They
indicated that growth is likely to turn positive in the fourth quarter of this year, driven by rising
confidence and a recovery in investment. The authorities agreed with staff that the weak labor
market is likely to hamper the recovery in private consumption. Nevertheless, they were more
optimistic than staff about the prospects for investment, especially if deleveraging is accelerated
through equity issuance and M&A activity. In their view, swift passage of the two main fiscal reforms
would provide additional support for the recovery. Thus, the Ministry of Finance projects GDP
growth of 1.6 percent in 2017 and 2.5 in 2018, and considers that there is the potential for upside
surprises.
31.
The authorities were also positive on Brazil’s medium-term growth prospects, subject
to steady progress with a deliberate sequence of reforms. They are of the view that the recently
revamped infrastructure concession framework and the associated regulatory changes would

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

BRAZIL

facilitate private sector participation in the existing pipeline of priority investment projects, helping
raise potential growth over the medium term. They also indicated that their agenda included a
number of structural reforms, such as tax simplification, labor reform, and negotiation of new
international trade agreements. However, they explained that these reforms would most likely wait
till after key fiscal reforms are secured.
32.
The authorities stressed that regaining control of public expenditure must be at the
front and center of the fiscal reform strategy. They explained that expenditure growth has
structural causes, and that their proposed constitutional amendment (which they see as having a
high probability of approval) would help address these problems at the root. The cap would force
Congress to make tough choices in the annual budget. They also see the expenditure cap as a
commitment device that would support the negotiation and approval of other necessary reforms in
the fiscal area, including the social security reform.
33.
The authorities agreed with staff that fiscal consolidation would need to go beyond
the expenditure cap, but stressed the need to tackle challenges in a sequence. They noted that
a stronger macroeconomic environment will contribute to the stabilization and eventual reduction in
debt. They indicated also that the government would aim to accelerate the reduction of gross debt
through asset sales and other operations, including the negotiation of an early repayment of debt
by BNDES, amounting to R$100 billion over three years. They noted that additional measures,
including rolling back tax exemptions, could be considered once the expenditure ceiling was
approved, the social security reform was well advanced, and the recovery in economic activity had
started. Tax measures would also be considered if the primary balance target for 2017 were at some
point to appear at risk (they felt confident that the 2016 target would be met, noting the expected
contribution from the repatriation tax).
34.
The authorities concurred that pension and social benefits reforms are urgent, but will
involve difficult negotiations. The authorities see the current juncture as a historical opportunity
to push for a reform that can stabilize the trajectory of the finances of the social security for the next
three decades or so. They felt that the discussion of retirement age increases was mature, but other
aspects of the social security system would need to be reformed as well. They indicated that Brazil’s
finances preempted consideration of reforms based on the adoption of a defined contribution
scheme as a main pillar. They explained that the reform they envisage would aim to cover the
various key parameters of the system, and reach a variety of participants in the system (including
contributors and beneficiaries, and people in various age and employment groups) to distribute the
effects of the reforms broadly. They stressed that the reform would respect constitutional
constraints and rights. They finally noted that the final form of the reform, including its transitional
clauses, would reflect the outcome of ongoing discussions with many stakeholders and the
congress.
35.
The authorities were concerned with fiscal problems in many subnational
governments, and elaborated on their strategy to help them. The authorities agreed that stress
in the finances of many states reflects both cyclical and structural factors. They also acknowledged
that the steps taken so far, largely involving rescheduling of debt service payments to the national
26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BRAZIL

treasury, are insufficient to deal with the most difficult cases. They see the need to include states in
key structural reforms (such as social security reform and the expenditure cap) and to promote
national reforms that can enable states to address their employment and employee remuneration
problems. They underscored that greater transparency in the disclosure of state government
finances is necessary to better diagnose the specific situation of each state (they vary significantly)
and for monitoring purposes. The National Treasury is also organizing missions to those states
experiencing the most severe strains to help them devise programs to address both their immediate
needs and their structural problems.
36.
The central bank emphasized that ensuring convergence of inflation to the target in
the relevant horizon for monetary policy was a priority. The relevant horizon involves the years
for which the National Monetary Council (CMN) has set targets, including 2017. They noted that
disinflation is ongoing, but its pace is still uncertain. Their models had been pointing to falling
inflation over the projection horizon; but inflation has shown persistence, partly due to successive
food-price shocks and perhaps also due to inertial mechanisms. They also explained that the start of
an easing cycle would depend on factors that allow the Monetary Policy Committee (COPOM) to
have greater confidence in meeting the inflation targets. They emphasized the following factors:
limited persistence of the effects of food-price shocks, an appropriate pace of disinflation of the
components that are most sensitive to monetary policy and economic activity, and a reduction in
uncertainty regarding the approval and implementation of fiscal reforms. Additionally, the
authorities agreed that the monetary policy framework could be improved in a number of ways,
some of them under consideration, including bolstering central bank autonomy, and increasing the
effectiveness of monetary policy by changing various credit policies that involve earmarking and
credit subsidies.
37.
The central bank’s views on foreign exchange interventions are broadly consistent
with those of staff. They thought that the exchange rate has proven to be good shock absorber
and that their interventions through FX swaps and repos have preserved the direction of movements
determined by the market while smoothing excess volatility. They noted that the FX swaps also have
a strong macro-prudential component, inasmuch as they shelter corporates, and consequently their
creditors, against adverse exchange rate movements. They also stated that, as the end of the current
benign period for emerging market economies approaches, there will be less room to reduce the
stock of FX swaps. The authorities did not rule out future interventions using different instruments,
only if needed and when market conditions allow.
38.
The authorities emphasized the resilience of the banking system and the
demonstrated effectiveness of their tools for monitoring and management of risks. The
authorities acknowledged staff’s concern about the health of the corporate sector, but noted that
they are monitoring the system closely and that banks remain well capitalized and have significantly
increased provisions for corporate exposures. The authorities indicated that they already have a
comprehensive and timely stress testing framework, which they will continue to enhance, consistent
with the staff’s recommendations, such as the “bottom-up” approach. They also expect that the new
resolution framework, consistent with the FSB’s key attributes of effective resolution regimes, will

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

27

BRAZIL

include the backstop for the deposit insurance fund from the central bank, and will be implemented
in 2017. The authorities agreed that providing mandates for macro-prudential oversight and crisis
management with clear objectives and division of responsibilities would enhance implementation of
macro-prudential policies and crisis preparedness. They also noted that there is no room for easing
of macro-prudential policies as most of tools are, or were already loosened up to the microprudential limits.
39.
The authorities acknowledged the need to open up the economy and improve the
business environment. They saw merit in reducing tariffs and domestic content requirements and
committed to pursuing free-trade negotiations outside Mercosur to help increase competition and
efficiency. They agreed that increasing labor market flexibility by allowing collective agreements to
stand above general regulations would foster investment and promote economic activity in general.
While some actions on the structural front are already ongoing, legal reforms will need to be taken
up after higher priority reforms are concluded.

STAFF APPRAISAL
40.
Brazil must revamp its policy framework to restore fiscal sustainability, rein in
inflation, and open up the economy, in the context of a still uncertain recovery from a
prolonged recession. Policymaking in recent years has failed to tackle long-standing structural
problems and proven to be counterproductive, contributing to the erosion of policy credibility and a
large contraction of output. Fiscal sustainability is at risk.
41.
Efforts aimed at capping the growth of fiscal spending and reforming the social
security system are well founded steps to restore fiscal sustainability; but more will be
required to address budgetary rigidities. The approval and steadfast implementation of the
spending cap would help improve the long-term trajectory of public spending and permit the
stabilization and eventual reduction of public debt as a share of GDP. Similarly, putting the social
security system on a sound footing for future generations is a key part of restoring fiscal
sustainability and preserving the social contract. The credibility of reforms will be bolstered if
attention is also placed on the link between minimum wage indexation and benefit payments,
revenue earmarking, and rigidities and lack of transparency in subnational budgets.
42.
To guard against risks emanating from prolonged fiscal adjustment, there is merit in
considering a more frontloaded consolidation strategy once growth has firmed up. Through a
combination of expenditure and revenue measures, the government can contain the growth in
public debt and reverse the trajectory of public debt earlier. This would alleviate the onerous burden
of high borrowing costs on the private sector, and enable a more rapid and sustainable recovery.
Revenue measures can begin once economic growth is underway, and some of them should be
temporary.
43.
Monetary policy should remain on hold until inflation expectations converge more
clearly toward the central target. Staff considers current monetary policy settings as broadly

28

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BRAZIL

appropriate given inflation expectations and remaining uncertainties. Tangible progress on restoring
the sustainability of public finances would create room for easing monetary policy earlier than
envisaged.
44.
Staff welcomes the use of the exchange rate as the first line of defense against shocks.
Intervention in foreign exchange markets should remain limited to episodes of disorderly market
conditions, and reserve buffers should be preserved. Staff sees merit in the continuation of the
central bank’s policy to reduce the net notional value of FX swaps.
45.
The resilience of the banking sector should be bolstered. Although the recession took a
toll on asset quality and profitability, the health of the banking system remains largely sound.
Looking ahead, to make the banking sector even more robust, financial safety nets should be
improved by strengthening the procedures for use of the deposit insurance fund, enhancing the
central bank’s emergency liquidity assistance, and modernizing the resolution regime. Private
insolvency frameworks should be improved, and frameworks to identify, prepare for, and respond to
future risks should be put in place. Staff welcomes the ongoing work to strengthen the stress testing
framework used by the central bank.
46.
Well-designed and properly sequenced structural reforms can hasten the return to
growth and strengthen it over the medium term. Staff encourages the authorities to follow
through on various plans to strengthen the supply side of the economy, increase efficiency and
productivity, and to further implement transparency, anti-corruption and AML measures. Without
these reforms, potential growth is likely to remain underwhelming.
47.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation takes place on the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate,
e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP)
remain at their levels of the last projection year.

is further damage to the credibility of the policy framew ork.

Greater efforts to ensure policy credibility. Monetary

firmly within the tolerance range and exchange rate

disruption. Fiscal policy should forge ahead w ith
efforts to ensure medium-term debt sustainability.

Increased financial vulnerabilities among banks w ith portfolio

Monitor for signs of emerging domestic financial and

External Risks
Sharp rise in risk premia with flight to safety:
Investors withdraw from specific risk asset classes as
they reassess underlying economic and financial risks
in large economies, or respond to unanticipated Fed
tightening, and increases in U.S. term premia, with
poor market liquidity amplifying volatility. Safe
haven currencies—especially the US dollar—surge
creates balance sheet strains for FX debtors.

M

Structurally weak growth in key advanced and
emerging economies: Weak demand, low
productivity growth, and persistently low inflation
from a failure to fully address crisis legacies and
undertake structural reforms, leading to lower
medium-term path of potential growth (the Euro
area, Japan, and the United States) and exacerbating
legacy financial imbalances especially among banks
(the Euro area) (high likelihood). Tighter financial
conditions and insufficient reforms undermine
medium-term growth in emerging markets (medium
likelihood).

H/M

Persistently lower energy prices, triggered by supply
factors reversing more gradually than expected.

L

H . Increasing Brazil’s risk premiums, pressures on the real and
reversal of capital flow s. Increasing yields in domestic bond
markets and higher funding costs for corporates and banks. In
particular corporates lacking FX hedging could be exposed.

The flexible exchange rate remains an important shock
absorber. Recourse to FX intervention if FX volatility
becomes excessive. Provide FX liquidity and support
individual banks if dollar shortages appear. May also
need to tighten fiscal policy to further strengthen
policy credibility and avoid sell-offs of Brazilian
domestic bonds. Capital flow management measures
could be envisaged on a temporary basis but only in
crisis type circumstances.

H/M . Worsening current account deficit and weaker growth.
Highly indebted corporates could see their profits decline. A
sharp decline in commodity prices would have a direct impact
on the exporting sector.

Use the exchange rate as first shock absorbers. Limited
room for monetary and/or fiscal policy stimulus to
smooth shock. Instead, prioritize structural reforms to
boost potential grow th.

M. Mild favorable impact on the trade balance in the shortterm, but w orsening current account in the medium term, when
Brazil is expected to become a net oil exporter. Petrobras could
see a decline in the value of its assets and face an increase in
borrowing costs, causing delays in on-going investment plans
and affecting plans to develop new fields. Banks could face
losses on exposures to oil sector.

The requirement for Petrobras’s participating in new oil
developments should be eased. Domestic pricing
policies should ensure Petrobras obtains an adequate
return. Tighten governance in the company and
enforce strict criteria on capital projects to avoid
unnecessary losses.

1 The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) show s events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s
subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability betw een 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability
betw een 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may
interact and materialize jointly. “Short term” and “medium term” are meant to indicate that the risk could materialize w ithin 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

Overall Assessment
The external position of Brazil in 2015 was
moderately weaker than the level consistent
with medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policy settings. The subsequent
appreciation of the REER as of June 2016
suggests that the REER remains above the
level suggested by fundamentals and
desirable policies. The current account-toGDP ratio will likely improve further in 2016
amid subdued domestic demand and the
delayed impact of the 2015 depreciation,
and despite further worsening of Brazil’s ToT.
Potential Policy Responses
Efforts to raise national savings are needed
to provide room for a sustainable expansion
in investment. Fiscal consolidation, including
from social security reform, should
contribute to shifting the structure of
spending away from consumption. Structural
reforms to reduce the cost of doing business
would also help strengthen competitiveness.
Foreign exchange intervention, including
through the use of derivatives, can be
appropriate to punctually alleviate disorderly
market conditions in the foreign exchange
market. The authorities should aim to
preserve their foreign reserve buffers.

Capital and
financial
accounts:
flows and
policy
measures

Background. Brazil’s NIIP improved to -27 percent of GDP in 2015 reflecting in part the real’s depreciation. It is
projected to remain broadly unchanged over the medium term. 1/ DI accounts for close to half of liabilities (which are
69.7 percent of GDP). Of concern is the rise in external debt since the global financial crisis (to some 350 percent of
exports).
Assessment. The NIIP is comparable to that of Brazil’s peers, but the shift in composition of liabilities toward external
debt over the last several years is a concern.
Background. The current account deficit adjusted sharply in 2015 owing to the real’s depreciation and the drop in
domestic demand, despite the ToT deterioration. 2/ The deficit fell from 4.3 percent of GDP in 2014 to 3.3 percent in
2015 against a broadly neutral structural fiscal stance. 3/ The deterioration in prices for Brazil’s major commodity
exports reduced export values by around 1.5 percent of GDP. The CA is projected to improve in 2016 and going
forward due to the delayed impact from the depreciation and the slow recovery in demand, even without closing all
policy gaps (e.g. fiscal). Brazil’s ToT are expected to weaken further under the baseline and remain a downside risk. 4/
However, a larger-than-expected recovery in private demand could widen the deficit unless public savings strengthen.
The development of Brazil’s off-shore oil potential is no longer projected to contribute significantly to the external
adjustment as investment in expansion has been cut back. 5/
Assessment. Staff estimates that the CA norm is consistent with fundamentals and desirable policy settings range
from 0.25 to -1.5 percent of GDP. 6/ With a cyclically adjusted CA of -2.8 percent, the 2015 CA gap ranged
between -1.3 and -3.1 percent of GDP, wider than the EBA gap estimate of 0.1 percent.
Background. The REER on average depreciated by 15 percent between 2014 and 2015. After some oscillations, by
June 2016, it was some 6 percent above its average 2015 level. The annual average ULC based REER also depreciated
by some 15 percent between 2014 and 2015, due to both labor shedding and improvements in cost competitiveness.
The nominal exchange rate has been sensitive to political developments and global trends in 2016.
Assessment. Staff’s assessment is that the real was on average some 5−15 percent above the level implied by
fundamentals and desirable policy settings in 2015. 6/
Background. Brazil continues to attract sizable capital flows but their composition changed in 2015. Equity liability
flows remained strong while debt liability flows fell sharply. Net DI fully financed the CA deficit (DI liabilities totaled
4.3 percent of GDP). The share of intercompany loans in DI liabilities dropped sharply. 7/ Net portfolio debt liabilities,
having accounted for more than 1 percent of GDP in previous years, fell to close to zero reflecting downgrades of
Brazil’s sovereign credit rating and associated corporate downgrades. Interest differentials will continue to attract
inflows, but the recession and growing vulnerabilities are expected to weaken investor interest.
Assessment. While the composition of flows has a favorable risk profile, there is a risk that outflows may increase
amid the prolonged recession and growing domestic risks. The currently higher appetite for equity over debt
investments may reflect a combination of the depreciation and investors taking a longer-term view.

FX
intervention
and reserves
level

Technical
Background
Notes

Background. Brazil has a floating exchange rate. Since mid-2011, reserves have remained broadly stable. The
preannounced intervention program the central bank initiated in 2013 ended in March 2015. Intervention in 2015
continued to rely on the use of FX swaps and FX repos but was symmetric over the course of the year and
generally more limited compared to previous years. 8/ During the market turmoil in September, the authorities
reacted to excessive volatility largely by providing FX liquidity through FX repos. In March and April of 2016, as the
currency strengthened, the BCB reduced the rollover rate of maturing FX swaps and started auctioning reverse FX
swaps, significantly reducing its net forward position to some $62 billion as of early June. Brazil’s gross reserves
remained broadly constant in 2015, at $358 billion, some 20 percent of GDP and 200 percent of short term debt at
remaining maturity.
Assessment. The flexible exchange rate has been an important shock absorber. Reserves are adequate relative to
various criteria including the IMF’s composite reserve adequacy metric (185 percent). While Brazil’s reserve
holdings in principle provide some space to intervene, the authorities should aim to retain these buffers and their
net creditor position in foreign exchange. Staff would advise only punctually alleviating disorderly market
conditions as needed.
1/ The projection takes valuation effects into account.
2/ Import volumes fell by 15 percent in 2015 due to both import compression and the real’s depreciation (between
a third and a half of the fall in import demand is attributable to the depreciation). Export volumes rose by 8
percent, but the bulk of the impact of the 2015 depreciation in expected to materialize in 2016, especially for
manufacturing exports.
3/ While the cyclically adjusted overall balance would signal a significantly expansionary fiscal stance in 2015, a
structural perspective (excluding e.g. BCB losses on FX swaps and the net settlement of previously unreported
commitments to public banks) suggests a broadly neutral stance.
4/ At 19 percent of the total, China remains Brazil’s most important export destination and accounts for the bulk of
Brazil’s major commodity exports
5/ Brazil currently features a small oil balance deficit; in the short run, falling oil prices thus strengthen the current
account ceteris paribus while they may depress the outlook for oil production in the medium term.
6/ Staff’s assessment centers on the current account norm. Estimates suggest a current account norm
between -2.7 percent (EBA current account approach) and -1.2 percent (NIIP-stabilizing approach). Staff’s
assessment of a current account norm range from 0.25 to -1.5 percent (higher than in previous years due to the
significant downward revision in the growth outlook) reflects low potential growth, commodity price downside
risks, and the objective of avoiding a deterioration in the NIIP over the medium term, and facilitates expenditure
switching away from consumption and towards investment. In contrast, EBA REER level and index approaches
suggest that the real was undervalued by 2–19 percent on average in 2015.
7/ The strong decline in proceeds from overseas borrowing by foreign incorporated subsidiaries of Brazilian parent
companies—chiefly Petrobras—illustrates that the risk profile of these flows is more similar to portfolio debt flows
than to other types of DI liabilities.
8/ In the Brazilian FX repo, the Central Bank sells dollars with the commitment to repurchase them at a predetermined future date. That is, the Central Bank retains a long dollar position following execution of the repo. In
the Brazilian FX swap, the Central Bank enters into a contract whereby it agrees to pay the onshore dollar rate on a
given notional value plus the variation in the exchange rate, and to receive the SELIC rate on the BRL equivalent (at
the moment of initiation) of the given notional value. The net value of these payments is redeemed in local
currency. Under this mechanism, the Central bank pays the holder if the BRL depreciates by more than the
difference between the SELIC rate and the onshore dollar rate, and receives payment from the holder in the
opposite case. This instrument provides hedging to agents with prospective hard currency needs.

Appendix III. Selected Topics1
A.

Update on the Infrastructure Program

1.
Have infrastructure pressures subsided in the wake of the recession in Brazil?
Slowing consumption of energy services by the corporate sector and lower traffic demand are
providing some relief to the electricity sector and congested roads. However, from a mediumterm perspective, making gains in spatial and social integration by expanding the transport
network and improving access to basic infrastructure services in an equitable way remains
paramount for Brazil’s development.
2.
In the years ahead, Brazil will have to “do more with less”, by leveraging private
finance, optimizing costs and eliminating inefficiencies in service provision. There are few
possibilities available for scaling up infrastructure investment over the near- and medium-term,
given a constrained public sector resource envelope and strained private sector balance sheets.
While reform needs are numerous, the focus should be on scaling up efforts to boost private
sector participation in investment financing, improving investment returns, and increasing
efficiency. Projects with private participation should also have transparent accounting practices
that recognize contingent liabilities that could impact the public finances.


Securing financing: the government has granted tax benefits for fixed income products
created specifically to finance infrastructure investments in 2012. Since then, the importance
of infrastructure bonds has grown: 78 infrastructure bonds (totaling R$15.7 billion) associated
with projects authorized by the ministries were issued. Over the coming months Brazil will
issue a new debenture model featuring income tax incentives, payment of interest
throughout the existence of the project, and premium quality guarantee on the debt
principal. The government will continue to work with the Inter-American Development Bank
Group and the CAF, which have programs to help finance new infrastructure concessions
through local financial partners. The CAF program is based on another smaller scale fund
created in Colombia to finance the highway concession program. These initiatives are
important steps in the right direction, which will have to be accompanied by other measures
to improve the attractiveness of projects.



Ensuring cost recovery: underpricing of infrastructure services leads to excess utilization
and low revenues, constraining private sector returns and shrinking resources needed for
maintenance and new investments. A thorough review of tariff-setting principles might reveal
areas for improvement.



Improving allocative and productive efficiency: Brazil is one of the leading Latin American
(LA) countries in terms of operational maturity for project management and institutional
framework, and lags behind other large LA economies only in terms of investment climate.

However, across all countries, the entire infrastructure investment process, from planning and
project selection to contracting, monitoring and evaluation, often can be strengthened by
aligning priorities, streamlining processes, and optimizing financial costs.
3.
The new Investment Partnership Program (PPI), created in May, changed the
institutional framework for the implementation of public infrastructure through
partnership agreements between the state and the private sector. The projects will include
pre-salt area bidding, energy and sanitation assets, as well as roads, railway, ports and, airports,
some of them already included in previous concession programs. Some of the changes
introduced in the Investments Partnerships Program (PPI) are:


increasing the time between the public notice and the auction to 100 days, to encourage the
participation of medium-sized and foreign companies;



calls for tenders can only be announced after preliminary environmental licensing;



internal rates of return used in the old model will be abandoned;



bridge loans, previously extended by public and private-sector banks to allow the beginning
of investments in the concession until the final long-term loan is approved, will be replaced
by guarantees provided by banks or through bonds which would be valid until the
concession has its own cash flow (typically 5-7 years), which will serve as collateral to the
securities.

4.
The government has created a Council of the Investment Partnership Program
(CIPP) in the Presidency and an infrastructure support fund. The CIPP is in charge of
monitoring implementation of the PPI program, formulating policy recommendations and
providing guidance to agencies, entities and the federal public administration. The members of
the Council with voting rights include the Executive Secretary of the Secretariat of the Investment
Partnership Program of the Presidency, which will also act as Executive Secretary of the Council;
the Chief Minister of the Civil House; Ministers of Finance, Planning, Development and
Management, Transport, Ports and Civil Aviation and the Environment; President of the National
Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES) and the President of Caixa Economica
Federal. The infrastructure fund will support infrastructure partnerships and will be managed by
the BNDES which will be in charge of providing specialized professional services for structuring
investment partnerships and privatization contracts.
5.
The changes in the institutional framework for regulatory agencies, for which
congressional approval is pending, are expected to contribute to greater stability and
professionalism in regulation. The proposal seeks to strengthen the autonomy of the agencies
and standardize aspects of management, organization, governance and social control. The
regulatory agencies will have an independent budget, and the selection of nominees to compose
their management boards will be more rigorous, in order to shield regulatory agencies from

political interference and other forms of capture. Also, deadlines will be set for appointment of
new directors, to avoid prolonged periods with vacant positions.

Financial Linkages Across Economic Sectors in Brazil—The BSA

Matrix
6.
The Balance Sheet Analysis (BSA) is an important tool for the assessment of macrofinancial linkages in an economy. Balance sheets carry information on stocks and can throw
light on the state and vulnerabilities of corporates, households and government. At the sectoral
level, balance sheet matrices show aggregate exposures, exposures to other sectors, and to the
rest of the world, revealing the degree of interconnectedness of the economy, which is important
for the propagation of shocks.
7.
The BSA matrix is constructed using several data sources including the MFS, the IIP,
and the GFSM among others. The central government, the state governments and the
budgetary public companies (excluding Petrobras and Eletrobras — the largest state-controlled
companies in Brazil) are grouped into the government sector.2 NFCs, typically considered “the
Private Sector”, include also some nonfinancial corporates in the Public Sector. The BSA matrices
for the years 2007 and 2014 allow the comparison of recent estimates with the last “pre-crisis”
year. (The way to read these matrices can be illustrated with the top, leftmost entries of Table 1.

2

This is not an important shortcoming, given limited exposures to other economic sectors.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 49

BRAZIL

The central bank held government bonds worth 20 percent of GDP in 2014, while the
government deposits at the central bank totaled 12 percent of GDP.)
8.
Brazil’s BSA presents some limitations, which are mainly due to data gaps.3 No data
are available for the relationship between Nonfinancial corporate (NFC) sector and Households
(HH) sectors and there is also no information about the maturity structure of assets and liabilities.
Moreover, focusing on aggregate sectoral exposures, the BSA analysis ignores potential withinsector risks and specific linkages among sectors. For instance, although overall exposure of the
Financial Sector to households may be contained, certain banks specializing in mortgage lending
to a segment of population with lower income may be at higher risk during periods of growth
slowdown.4

A useful complement to the BSA is the network map. The network map offers a
graphical representation of the size and direction of sectoral interlinkages, pointing to possible
areas that may benefit from in-depth analysis. The nodes in the network map in Figure 1
represent the total size of the sector’s liability exposure, while the links between the nodes
outline the direction and size of the gross exposure. For example, the size of NFCs liabilities to
Nonresidents was 51 percent of GDP in 2014, as in the BSA matrix in Table 1, and it is
represented as a gross arrow going from the NFC to the Nonresident sector. The small figure on
the left separates the linkages from the NFC sector to other economic sectors.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 51

BRAZIL

Figure 1. Intersectoral Gross Liabilities Network Map, 2014
(Percent of GDP)

10.
The BSA matrices and the network map (Tables 1, 2 and Figures 1, 2) show the
system’s increasing depth and connectedness. Gross assets of all sectors at end-2014
amounted to 416 percent of GDP, against 341 percent of GDP in 2007. Other financial institutions
(OFIs) in particular have become more important over time, in terms of size and connectedness.
Almost two thirds of the growth of total assets could be ascribed to the expansion of ODCs’
assets against the private nonfinancial sector. ODCs and NFCs are the largest issuers of gross
liabilities in the system. However, while declining somewhat since 2007, the government’s net
liability position remains the most dominant.
11.
Foreign currency exposure of NFCs increased on account of higher external
borrowing. The Central Bank accounts for a sizeable amount of reserves, but the public sector’s
foreign currency assets and liabilities as a share of total system’s assets and liabilities are limited.
ODCs’ gross foreign currency liabilities to Nonresidents have increased but the net currency
exposures remain modest. The highest exposure is seen in the NFC sector, where foreign bond
issuance picked up in recent years. The oil company Petrobras alone had about US$130 million
alone in foreign debt at end-2014.
12.
Exposure to the Nonresident sector increased. The government became more reliant
on financing from abroad, and NFCs’ net liabilities to Nonresidents appear to have increased too.
This may understate the growth of external borrowing of this sector to the extent that a part of
offshore bond issuances by foreign incorporated subsidiaries of Brazilian parent companies are
not repatriated through intercompany loans.

13.
While those sectors which were net debtors in 2007 remained net debtors through
2014, some changes in net liability positions since the global crisis are notable. The net
liability position of ODCs and NFCs improved (Table 1, Appendix I), but the net position of Other
financial corporations (OFC)s and that of the HHs sector worsened. The net liability position of
the Public Sector (the government and the Central Bank) improved albeit marginally. While the
extent of these changes is small relative to those seen in the U.S. balance sheets over the same
period, they are notable considering the initial depth of the financial sector in Brazil and the
strength of sectoral inter-linkages.
14.
Government policies have contributed to some changes in the liability positions
described above over the period 2007–14. First, the pickup of government liabilities to the
Central Bank reflects the issuance, in 2010, of securities, which the Central Bank uses for
monetary policy purposes.5 In fact, the growth of Central Bank liabilities to ODCs in Figure 2
reflect the increasing role of repo operations in liquidity management. Second, the government
also made a deliberate transfer of securities, in the aftermath of the crisis and over the following
years, to public banks to support countercyclical fiscal stimulus. This increased banks’ holding of
government paper but also allowed banks to step up lending, thus contributing to financial
deepening. Indeed, Caixa stepped up mortgage lending to HHs, while the BNDES increased
lending to businesses. ODCs (excluding BNDES) fund their lending activity manly through
domestic deposits (64.4 percent of GDP), with loan to deposit ratio amounting to over 99 percent
in 2014. Their strong liquidity position up to 2014 was made possible also by increased NFCs
cash holdings, the counterparty of which is higher company debt.
15.
Developments in 2015 altered the size of some intersectoral exposures in the BSA
matrix. Reflecting a high overall deficit, Government liabilities increased by 10 percentage points
of GDP. About 16 percent of gross debt was held by non-residents and 25 percent by financial
institutions. Because of the steep depreciation of the real, Central Banks’ foreign assets increased
by 3 percentage points to 24 percent of GDP. Total net liabilities of ODCs improved by
2 percentage points of GDP. Yet, their net exposure to NFCs’ increased by almost 6 percentage
points of GDP and net liabilities to the Public sector decreased by a similar amount due to their
higher holdings of government securities. Net liabilities to Nonresidents remained broadly
unchanged. Issuances of debt instruments by the NFC sector foreign slowed down because of
weak demand and amounted to 2.5 percent of GDP (of which 2 percent of GDP were domestic).
The direction of overall net sectoral interlinkages in the BSA remained unchanged.

Government assets at the central bank are the TSA deposits used for precautionary policy and for the
repayment of short-term debt obligations.

Nonresident sector:
The total liabilities to NFCs according to the IIP include some OFC liabilities, which are not
captured as OFCs in the MFS due to incomplete coverage. In addition, the total IIP number is
adjusted by the difference between MFS and IIP in ODC external liabilities, which is due to MMFs
being included as "other sectors" in the IIP total.
Government Finance:
Operations Statement data are from the Central Bank and Ministry of Finance. The Central Bank
of Brazil revised the data series for financial data (flows and stocks), correcting some classification
and consolidation problems. In the Balance Sheet, beginning December 2006 onwards, the
Central/General Government Gross Debt excludes the Central Government securities that are
under the Central Bank's outright ownership. The financial asset "currency and deposits" was
corrected by the same amount. (For additional information on this methodological break, please

C.

The Impact of Political Fragmentation on Public Debt

16.
Fiscal policy is the area of macroeconomic policy most directly intertwined with
politics. The reason is that fiscal policy is mostly about redistribution across individuals, regions
and generations: the core of political conflict. The common consensus among economists is that
there are increasing marginal costs of public deficit and debt. This raises the question of why
countries still spend beyond their means and risk not being able to cope with their financial
situation by accumulating long-term and excessive public debt. The political economy literature
in this field emphasizes the need to take into account the role that political factors have on fiscal
policy. There are two distorting political forces affecting policy choice. First, the incumbents
desire to retain power, which could lead to opportunistic behavior and the strategic use of debt.
Second, the degree of polarization in a society gives rise to a degree of social and ideological
conflict that reflects in the degree of government fragmentation and puts pressure fiscal policy
(Mulas-Granados, 2006; Alesina and Passalacqua, 2015).
17.
Political fragmentation is a key source of fiscal pressure, debt accumulation and
delayed stabilization. Two alternative theories predict that political fragmentation is associated
with higher deficits and debt. The common pool theory predicts that as the number of parties in
government grows the pressure on deficits and debt increases, because each party serves its own
privileged group while only facing part of the associated tax burdens (Weingast, Shepsle and
Johnsen, 1981). The veto players’ theory predicts that when the number of players increase and
their ideological distance grows, policy changes become more difficult to pass, making public
debt reductions more unlikely (Tsebelis, 2002). A wide body of empirical research using data
from advanced economies has demonstrated these theories are correct: minority governments,
divided legislatures, coalition and multiparty cabinets, with a large number of ministers, are all
associated with higher deficits and debt. More recent evidence from a sample of 92 advanced,
emerging and developing economies from 1975 to 2015 shows that traditional indicators of
political fragmentation (from both common pool and veto player theories) are associated with
average increases in public debt (Crivelli, Gupta and Mulas-Granados, 2016).
18.
Brazil has traditionally had a very fragmented political system. When compared with
a sample containing a large number of countries Brazil shows on average a higher level of
political fragmentation, a lower margin of parliamentary majorities, a higher ideological
polarization, and a higher number of spending ministries. In addition, Brazil has a larger number
of veto player’s than the average, and confronts an aging population, a growing unemployment
rate and higher social unrest (measured by the number of strikes). These are all indicators that
tend to put pressure on public spending and to be associated with public debt accumulation.

58

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BRAZIL

19.
Institutional frameworks that reinforce the medium-term perspective and
centralize budget commitments help eliminate the effects of political fragmentation on
public accounts. Strong budget rules and budget institutions help shield the budget from
electoral pressures and reduce the effect of political fragmentation on deficits and debt. In the
presence of divided cabinets, a strong coordinating role for the Ministry of Finance, is associated
with less fiscal profligacy and declining public debt (Hallerberg and Von Hagen, 1997; Von
Hagen, Hallett and Strauch, 2001).

D. Composition of Direct Investment Liabilities
20.
Direct investment (DI) has contributed to
Brazil’s external resilience in recent years. Net DI (flows)
amounted to some 3 percent on average since 2010 while
DI liabilities reached about 4 percent of GDP. This compares
to a current account deficit of some 3.3 percent over the
same period. Given their favorable risk profile, sustained
large FDI flows into Brazil represent a factor of strength.

flows because they reflect the proceeds from offshore bond issuances by the foreign
incorporated subsidiaries.
22.
Offshore issuances by foreign incorporated subsidiaries of domestic corporates
have gained prominence during the post-crisis period. Brazil is among a number of EMs in
which the outstanding stock of such issuances increased dramatically in recent years (to some
7 percent of GDP in 2014). To the extent that the parent is a non-financial corporate, the
repatriation of proceeds from such issuances would

E. Trade Response to the Real Effective Exchange Rate Change

The link between the exchange rate and export volumes has weakened over time
with the declining share of

volumes and the terms of trade (using

imports to REER changes appears to be

rather immediate and sizable at about
0.45. There is no evidence that a change in the REER affects import volumes later than 4 quarters
out. The elasticity of manufacturing exports to a REER change is -0.45, with the bulk of the
response materializing one year after the price change. Semi-manufactured and basic products
show smaller elasticities, which operate with longer lags. This is intuitive given that commodities’
supply tends to be inelastic. Importantly, this also implies that the aggregate export elasticity has
fallen over time as the share of manufacturing in total exports declined from 59 percent in 2000
to 38 percent in 2015. The current aggregate elasticity of about 0.4 would have been closer to 0.5
in 2000.

24.
Estimated trade elasticities are used to assess staff’s trade projections. We compare
our projections to those that would have been obtained had the REER remained constant at its
end-2013 with the value of other variables, including the terms of trade, evolving as in the
baseline. Import decline in 2015 following the dramatic REER depreciation in the same year is
sizeable. Exports, in turn, show a delayed
response that only fully materializes by
2017. The total effect of movements in
the REER between 2013 and 2020 is
projected to amount to 35 billion US
dollars, about evenly split between
exports and imports. Using the estimated
trade elasticities, the analysis indicates
that staff’s trade balance forecast would
have remained closer to zero throughout
the medium term in the absence of the
currency depreciation, all else constant.

Safeguards Assessments: A safeguards assessment of the Banco Central do Brasil (BCB) was
completed in June 2002 and updated in March 2005.
Exchange Rate Arrangement: Since January 18, 1999, Brazil’s de facto and de jure foreign
exchange regime has been classified as floating. Brazil accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2(a), 3, and 4, effective November 30, 1999.
The tax on financial transactions (Imposto sobre Operações Financeiras, IOF) of 6.38 percent on
exchange transactions carried out by credit card, debit card, and traveler's checks (including cash
withdrawals) companies in order to fulfill their payment obligations for purchases of goods and
services abroad by their customers gives rise to multiple currency practices (MCP) subject to Fund
jurisdiction under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3. In January 2008, the IOF for these exchange
transactions was raised to 2.38 percent and then further increased to 6.38 percent in March 2011.
The scope of operations was expanded to other foreign exchange transactions than with credit cards
in December 2013.
Last Article IV Consultation

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK1
The World Bank Group has been a valued partner for Brazil, providing integrated and often
multi-sector development solutions tailored to its needs. The Bank has also benefited greatly
from Brazil’s unique demands, which required the WBG to adapt and learn and provided a broad
range of lessons on development for the Global Community in areas ranging from poverty reduction
to social inclusion and environmental management.
The World Bank has initiated the preparation of its new Country partnership Framework. The
new CPF is being built on, and deepened, the last FY 2012‒15 Country Strategy, which had as a main
objective to make a catalytic contribution to Brazil’s efforts to eradicate poverty and to become a
more prosperous and inclusive country by focusing on four strategic objectives: (i) increasing the
efficiency of public and private investment; (ii) enhancing service provision to poorer segments of
the population; (iii) reducing regional economic disparities; and (iv) improving sustainable natural
resource management and climate resilience.
As part of the preparation of the new country strategy the World Bank recently completed a
Systematic Country Diagnostics. The SCD identifies five main challenges facing Brazil: (i) lack of
fiscal space and a large transfer of resources to the non-poor (particularly pensions); (ii) weaknesses
of public sector governance and institutional fragmentation which hamper effective long-term
policy design, planning and implementation; (iii) segmentation of financial markets, lack of long
term credit and high interest rates; (iv) insufficient competition and poor business environment; and
(v) weaknesses in the management of Brazil’s natural resources and insufficient resilience against
climate risks.
IBRD lending program was US$550 million for FY 15, and US$758 million for FY 16. The
strategy for the FY 17 is to start rebuilding the lending pipeline for FY 18, while FY 17 new lending
deliveries should be close to US$300 million. The Brazil program continues to maintain a complex
portfolio bringing together financial, knowledge, and convening services and sharing our work
globally. The WBG impact in Brazil cannot be derived exclusively from the size of its financial
contributions, which are bound to be small with respect to the country’s own resources. The Bank
Group deploys its resources according to the following principles. Flexibility: Adjusting areas of
engagement and instruments to better respond to the country’s evolving needs. Selectivity:
Focusing on areas where Brazil faces second-generation development challenges and can benefit
most from the Group’s knowledge and experience. Innovation: Supporting innovative investments
and policy reforms that can be replicated locally and internationally, and offering innovative services
and instruments (e.g. result-based and multi-sector loans, partial credit risk and other guarantees).
Leveraging: Increasing the use of leveraged resources from government, the private sector and
other development partners, to maximize development impacts.

IFC’s investment portfolio in Brazil now stands at US$4.05 billion, including US$1.3 billion
from syndications. IFC new commitments reached US$1.3 billion by the end of FY 16, making it the
Corporation’s largest country program for FY 16. Out of the US$1.3 billion in new commitments,
US$1.018 million are from IFC’s own account and US$309.38 million from mobilization. Key sectors
include Financial Markets, Health, Education, Agribusiness and Infrastructure. Looking forward, IFC
has taken a disciplined, selective approach to adapt to the current environment, focusing on
protecting portfolio companies, supporting the relief of distressed assets and keeping markets open
for expansion and investment. The long-term strategy aims to continue supporting the country to
address the challenges of financial inclusion, urbanization, competitiveness and sustainable
management of natural resources through investments focused on the infrastructure, telecom,
health, education, agribusiness and financial institutions sectors. In addition to its investment
projects, IFC has provided Brazil’s fast-growing private sector with various advisory services,
including for PPP projects (roads, health, education), through a partnership with BNDES, the Brazilian
development bank.
MIGA processed in FY 15 its first exposure transaction in Brazil since FY 09. While MIGA has
had no exposure in Brazil in recent years, it views Brazil as a target market, where it can support the
government’s agenda of meeting the country’s massive infrastructure requirements, through the
provision of guarantees of Non-Honoring Financial Obligations (NHSFO) in respect of financial
payment obligations of the sovereign, sub-sovereign and state-owned enterprises. These products
provide credit enhancement to borrowers to enable them to (i) reduce their funding costs
(ii) increase their access to long-term financing and (iii) diversify their financing sources. A case in
point is the São Paulo Sustainable Transport Project. MIGA’s NHSFO guarantee, which was approved
by the Executive Directors in April 2014 and by the Brazilian Senate on September 2, 2014, mobilized
long-term commercial bank financing on competitive terms, by guaranteeing the State of São
Paulo’s financial obligations under such bank financing. Brazil will also be the first IBRD beneficiary
of the Bank Group's effort to take advantage of synergies across the balance sheets of World Bank
Group entities. Brazil will gain about US$100 million in additional IBRD lending headroom through
an exchange of existing IBRD exposure to Brazil, where MIGA has the capacity to assume higher
exposure, for MIGA exposure to Panama, a country where IBRD has available capacity.

RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK1
The IDB’s Country Strategy with Brazil was recently approved on March 30, 2016. This was
established for the period 2016−18 and is comprised of three strategic areas: (1) increase
productivity and competitiveness; (2) reduce inequity and improve public services; (3) strengthen
institutions at the three levels of government; as well as the crosscutting issues of gender, diversity,
integration, and climate change.
The portfolio of loans approved during the strategy 2012‒14 period totaled 84 operations for
US$8.35 billion, 68 of which were sovereign guarantee (SG) for US$7.4 billion, and 16 of which were
non-sovereign guarantee (NSG) for US$950.7 million. Of the SG operations, 62 were with Brazilian
states, state-owned enterprises, or municipals, thereby maintaining a subnational emphasis
(91 percent of approved operations). In terms of the regional focus, 45 percent of SG operations (by
number) are in the North (19 percent) and Northeast (26 percent). With regard to technical support,
the IDB is the largest provider of technical assistance and knowledge transfer to public institutions.
During the strategy period, 45 technical-cooperation operations were approved for a total of
US$40.9 million, focusing on social and productive inclusion, and environmental and rural
management and climate change.
In 2015, the IDB approved seven loans amounting to US$382.5 million, including one
sovereign guarantee operation for US$56 million and six non-sovereign guarantee operations
for US$326.5 million. The majority of the lending went to promote development through the
private sector (85 percent), and promote the development of sustainable cities (15 percent). The
lending to subnational governments corresponded to 15 percent of total lending to Brazil. Among
the major operations approved, some highlights are: (a) Program for Integrated Urban Development
of the Municipality of Campo Grande (US$56 million); (b) Banco Coorporativo Sicredi Financing for
Rural Credit and Low Carbon Agriculture (US$50 million); (c) Mind Lab Increasing Access to
Innovative Education Methodologies in Brazil (US$4.6 million); and (d) Itau Unibanco WomenOwned MSME Partnership (US$100 million).

For 2016, the total loan approvals are projected to reach US$1,457.4 million. Loans with
sovereign guarantee make the bulk of the operations, amounting to US$1,250.0 million, while
operations with the private sector are expected to total US$207.4 million.2 In addition, the IDB
program in the period estimates approvals of US$43.9 million in grants for Technical Cooperation.
Brazil is the largest IDB borrower. The current active portfolio consists of 118 loans to the public
sector (US$11,315.8 million) and 50 loans to the private sector (US$974.2 million)3. Brazil’s
outstanding debt with the IDB amounts to US$14,588 million (as of end of February 2016) and from
the current portfolio US$7,253.2 million have not been disbursed yet (as of march 22, 2016).

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of September 23, 2016)
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: The quality of macroeconomic statistics has improved significantly, and data provision is
adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: Since 2015, the national accounts estimates follow the guidelines of the
2008 System of National Accounts. The availability of annual and quarterly supply and use tables
also contribute to the development of consistent national accounts estimates. The series (data
and supporting methodological notes) are available on the internet (http://www.ibge.gov.br) and
in International Financial Statistics (IFS). It is also participating in the G-20 Data Gaps Initiative
regarding recommendation 15, which calls for developing a strategy to promote the compilation
and dissemination of the balance sheet approach, flow of funds, and sectoral data on a quarterly
and annual basis.
Price Statistics: Since July 1999, the price index reference for monetary policy has been the Broad
Consumer Price Index (IPCA) compiled by the Brazilian Statistical Institute (IBGE). The IPCA covers
changes in the prices of goods and services purchased by households earning between one and
forty times the minimum wage in 11 metropolitan areas and two municipalities. Both the
Getúlio Vargas Foundation (FGV) and the IBGE compile producer price indices, IPA and IPP
respectively, since 2010.
Government Finance Statistics: The Ministry of Finance and the Brazilian Central Bank (BCB)
compile and disseminate government finance statistics using the Government Finance Statistics
Manual (GFSM) 2001 presentation. The reported statistics include the statement of government
operations and financial balance sheet for the consolidated central government (comprising the
National Treasury and Social Security) as well as financing operations and the financial balance
sheet for the general government. The reported data are compiled by converting the nationally
published data, which still broadly follow the GFSM 1986 framework. The data reflect the
movements of the single treasury account and are on a cash basis except for interest. The gross
debt indicator excludes government securities under the central bank’s outright ownership,
making international comparisons difficult.
In 2009, the Brazilian authorities developed a migration plan for the full implementation the
GFSM 2001. This plan comprises the introduction of a new accounting framework based on the
International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), which merges the traditional budgetary
approach, the accrual based accounting, and some additional internal controls into a single
system. This new accounting framework significantly enhances the usefulness of the Brazilian
public sector accounting information.

BRAZIL

I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance (Concluded)

Monetary and Financial Statistics: The BCB compiles and publishes monetary and financial
statistics, with concepts, definitions, and classification that are broadly in line with the Monetary
and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM) 2000. In close cooperation with STA, the BCB introduced
the standardized report forms based on accounting data in March 2013. However, the
institutional coverage of the other financial corporations needs to be expanded to include
insurance corporations, open pension funds, capitalization funds, and exchange houses.
The BCB regularly reports quarterly FSIs to the IMF for publication. Currently, the BCB reports all
core and 18 encouraged FSIs, with data beginning in Q1 2005. Plans are under way to compile the
rest of the encouraged FSIs.
External Sector Statistics: Brazil disseminates monthly data on the balance of payments and
quarterly data on international investment position. External data are compiled according to the
sixth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. The BCB is supplementing the registry of the
foreign exchange system with surveys on transportation, insurance, and other services.
Compilation of reinvested earnings and undistributed branch profits item in the current account
and reinvested earnings item in the financial account could be improved, as the registry of the
foreign exchange system does not capture these transactions. The BCB publishes data on
International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity on a daily basis with a lag of one day. Brazil
reports quarterly total external debt position data with a three-month lag to the World Bank’s
Quarterly External Debt Statistics database.
II.

Data Standards and Quality

Subscriber to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS)
since 2001. Uses SDDS flexibility options on the timeliness of the general
government operations and depository corporations survey.
Implementing G-20 DGI recommendations: The authorities have already
implemented a good number of the recommendations and work is
underway to implement the remaining ones. Further progress would focus
on monetary and financial statistics, external position and flow statistics,
real estate price indexes, general government statistics, and sectoral
accounts.

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Reflecting a severe recession, difficulties with implementation of the fiscal policy agenda, and the
cost of the FX swap program, gross debt of the nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) increased by
10½ percentage points of GDP in 2015, reaching 73.7 percent of GDP. Net debt of the public
sector rose by only 3 percentage points of GDP owing to the countervailing impact of valuation
gains on gross international reserves. The debt maturity profile and composition have remained
broadly unchanged since the last Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA), and foreign holdings of
government securities has remained broadly constant in percent of GDP. However, net interest on
NFPS debt picked up significantly in 2015 due to more elevated borrowing costs and because of
the large losses on the FX swaps, which are recorded in the interest bill (Box 1). Primary surpluses
above 3 percent of GDP (excluding interest revenue) would be needed to keep gross debt from
growing as a ratio to GDP beyond the projection horizon. In the baseline scenario, fiscal
consolidation based on the government’s proposed reforms on the government expenditure side,
if fully implemented, would restore the sustainability of debt, but debt ratios would stabilize after
the end of the 5-year projection period, with gross debt reaching 93.5 percent of GDP in 2021.
The trajectory of gross debt is highly sensitive to fiscal policy performance, owing to the adverse
dynamics determined by modest GDP growth and high borrowing costs. Failure to implement the
fiscal reforms proposed by the authorities would jeopardize debt sustainability.

Background
Debt coverage. Brazil’s gross debt statistics cover the NFPS, defined to exclude Petrobras and
Eletrobras, and consolidate the Sovereign Wealth Fund. In line with the GFSM 2014 manual, the
NFPS debt includes all Treasury securities on the Central Bank's balance sheet, including those not
used under repurchase agreements. At end-2015, the gross debt amounted to 73.7 percent of GDP.2
As reported by the government, net debt statistics correspond to the public sector, defined to
include the Central Bank. The consolidated public sector has a large stock of assets, amounting to
42 percent of GDP in 2015, which include 24.1 percent of GDP in international reserves. Nonfinancial public sector assets amounted to 34.3 percent of GDP. Brazil’s debt is reported at nominal
value.3
Debt profile. Federal government (FG) domestic tradable securities accounted for 90 percent of
total NFPS gross debt in 2015, of which 2/3 were held by the public.4 Active debt management in
recent years has improved the profile of these instruments, which now display longer maturities, of
about 4.6 years on average, up from less than 3 years in 2008. Still, a large share of domestic
2

In contrast, the national definition of gross debt includes the stock of Treasury securities used for monetary policy
purposes by the Central Bank (those pledged as security in reverse repo operations), but excludes the rest of the
government securities held by the Central Bank. Thus, according to the national definition, gross debt of the general
government amounted to 66.5 percent of GDP at end-2015. Note also that after completion of the 2015 DSA,
published revisions to the historical nominal GDP series have caused the debt ratios up to 2014 to be revised down.
3

The nominal value is calculated as the PDV of future interest and principal payments at the security’s contractual
interest rate(s), and generally differs from face value.

The rest is held by the Central Bank on its balance sheet. The Central Bank uses about ¾ of its holdings as security
in liquidity-draining operations with the banking system.

tradable securities, nearly 22 percent of total, will mature in 2016.5 The government has the
objectives of raising average maturity to 5.5 years and bringing total short-term debt (on both
original and residual maturity basis) down toward 20 percent of all debt over the medium term,
which is challenging because of a high term premium. The average maturity of new placements

21.7 percent of GDP. Foreign holding of domestic
securities was stable at 18 percent of total at end2015.
In addition to tradable securities, other NFPS debt consist of liabilities issued by SOEs and
subnational governments, as well as direct bank lending. Foreign currency denominated tradeable
securities accounted for only 6.7 percent of the total in 2015, representing slightly below 5 percent
of GDP. Gross financing needs have tended to be high, above 15 percent of GDP, and interest
charged on new issuances has increased by 250 bps since end-2014. However, this figure overstates
rollover risk, as a large fraction of the federal government debt (about 21 percent of GDP, with a
maturity profile in line with that of overall debt) is held by the Central Bank, which follows a policy of
automatic rollover of its holdings of government securities.
Box 1. Impact of Swaps and Valuation Changes on Interest and Debt in 2015
The Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) uses a variety of instruments to intervene in foreign exchange
markets but the most frequently used instrument is the Brazilian FX swap (the swap), a nondeliverable future settled in local currency. The swap program has grown over time and, at endDecember 2015, the notional value of the outstanding stock of swaps was about US$110 billion, equivalent
to 30 percent of gross international reserves or 7.3 percent of GDP. The FX swap is meant to provide
hedging to agents with exposures in dollars. If the Brazilian real depreciates too fast, the central bank makes
cash losses on the FX swaps; if it depreciates too slowly or appreciates, it makes cash profits. Gains and
losses on FX swaps operations are reported by the BCB under the item “Equalização Cambial” (EC) in public
debt statistics.
The BCB considers EC in the compilation of the General Government (GG) net debt (a positive result
decreases net debt; a negative result increases the net debt), but not in compiling gross debt. EC is
calculated daily and, aside from results of the swap operations and derivatives, includes changes in the
valuation of reserves (net external debt) and the carry cost of reserves. The treatment of EC applies to

5 This is broadly a recurring situation. Short-term debt at original maturity is very small, amounting some 2 percent of
total NFPS debt.

realized, as well as accrued-but-unrealized gains or losses incurred by the BCB. A positive result gives rise to
a transfer from the BCB to the Treasury Single Account (TSA) while to cover a negative result the
government issues debt to the BCB.
EC closely tracks exchange rate
movements and is influenced by the
size of reserves. Because of the large size
of foreign exchange reserves and the
dominance of the U.S. dollar in their
composition (over 2/3 of reserves are in
U.S. dollars), movements in EC are strongly
affected by changes in the real/U.S. dollar
exchange rate. For example, when the
dollar value of reserves increased from
17.8 percent of GDP in 2014 to
24.1 percent of GDP at endDecember 2015, on account of a 49 percent depreciation of the Brazilian real during the year, EC was
1.9 percent of GDP.
Interest on EC, which includes the interest on swaps, is accounted together with interest on public
debt. During the period elapsing between the calculation of the balance sheet of the BCB and the effective
payment, the values of EC accrue interest at the same rates applied to the FG deposits in the TSA.
Gains/losses on the swaps are also included in the net interest bill and thus in the overall government
balance. These occur when swap contracts mature, and the BCB pays its counterparts the observed exchange
rate change plus the pre-set coupom cambial and receives the ex ante Selic rate in return (Selected Issues
Paper for the 2015 Staff Report and Law No. 11.803, of November 5, 2008.). This part of the interest bill
reached 1.5 percent of GDP in 2015, pushing up the implied interest on net debt.

Baseline Scenario
Macroeconomic assumptions. The projections assume a real GDP contraction of -3.3 percent in
2016, ½ percent output growth in 2017, and a gradual return to potential growth of 2 percent by
2019. The assumed fiscal adjustment brings the primary balance to 0.8 percent of GDP by 2021,
which implies an improvement of about 3 percentage points of GDP during 2017−21, significant but
short of what would be needed to stabilize gross debt by 2021. The nominal interest rates on new
borrowing are between 12 and 15 percent over 2016−21, bringing the effective interest rate to
about 12 percent on average.6 The baseline scenario assumes limited structural reforms and a
modest world output recovery. In this baseline, gross debt remains on an upward path, reaching
93.5 percent of GDP by 2021 and likely to keep growing for some time still. Gross financing needs
are projected to remain above the high-risk threshold of 15 percent of GDP on average over the
medium term. By the end of the projection horizon, the primary balance required to stabilize debt in
the baseline scenario is 3.3 percent of GDP (excluding interest revenue).7 The baseline assumptions
do not include the early repayment of BNDES credit to the government, which is currently under
analysis at the TCU (the Federal Court of Accounts, whose concurrence is being sought).8
Heat map. The heat map in Figure 1 suggests that the stock of debt and the gross financing needs
are high. The premium asked by the market on government borrowing and the reliance on external
financing are elevated, pointing to a moderate risk to the debt profile. As noted earlier, however, the
gross financing need indicator overstates actual rollover risk as a result of the policy of continuous
rollover maintained by the Central Bank, which holds a significant amount of FG bonds. Gross
financing needs would amount to about 15 percent of GDP in 2016 excluding rollover of Central
Bank held bonds, still at the threshold level for high risk.
Past forecast errors. There is no evidence of a systematic projection bias in the baseline
assumptions that would undermine the assessment of sustainability and the projected fiscal
adjustment is in line with other countries’ experiences. The median forecast error for GDP growth,
the primary balance and inflation are below 2 percent and in line with other countries’ forecast
errors.
Realism of projections. Brazil’s projected fiscal adjustment (an improvement of about
2½ percentage points in the cyclically-adjusted primary balance/GDP over the medium term) is in
line with other countries’ experiences, with a 3-year adjustment in cyclically-adjusted primary
balance at the 23 percentile among all surveillance countries.9
6

Interest rates on new borrowing are projected to behave in line with the forecast for the Selic rate augmented by a
spread that varies depending on the maturity of the bond. Note also that effective interest rates show persistence
because of the high proportion of zero coupon bonds with multi-year maturities. In particular, zero-coupon bonds
issued with very high rates in 2015 will have their cumulated interest falling due in coming years.

The debt stabilizing primary balance shown on the right-most column of the table on “Contributions to changes in
public debt” in the Baseline Scenario (4.6 percent of GDP) corresponds to a concept of the primary balance that
includes interest revenue. The definition of the primary balance as a non-interest concept is customary in Brazil and
corresponds to 3.3 percent of GDP quoted in the main text.

8

The proposed schedule is for a repayment on R$100 billion in three installments starting in 2016. The estimated
savings on interest from this transaction amount to about R$7 billion per year.

9

The fiscal multipliers and persistence were estimated in the 2015 Article IV Selected Issues Paper at 0.3-0.5 percent.

Shocks and Stress Tests


Growth shock. The impact on the debt-to-GDP ratio of the 1 standard deviation shock
(3.4 percent) to real GDP growth is large. Over 2017‒18, real GDP growth rates become negative
while inflation declines by 200 bps in each year. The primary balance worsens before recovering
in 2019; interest rates increase by 55 bps for each percentage point decline in output growth. In
this scenario, gross debt increases to 112 percent of GDP by 2021 while gross financing needs
reach 39 percent of GDP.



Primary balance and real interest rate shocks. In the primary balance shock, consolidation is
delayed by one year. In the interest rate shock, borrowing costs increase by 200 bps in the first
projection year and remain the same over the medium term. The impact of these shocks on debt
and gross financing needs is modest, pushing up debt-to-GDP by 3 percentage points above
the baseline in 2021.



Combined macro-fiscal shock and contingent liabilities shocks. The macro-fiscal shock combines
the growth and interest rates shock and a primary balance shock as in the standard examples
above, together with the real exchange rate shock consistent with a maximum movement of the
real exchange rate over the past 10 years and a pass-through coefficient of 0.25. The contingent
liability shock simulates a loss of 10 percent of banking system assets, in line with the experience
with past banking crises in other countries, and assumption of contingent liabilities by the public
sector. The latter results in a primary deficit of -5.5 percent of GDP in 2017 and a 1 standard
deviation shock to GDP growth in 2017 and 2018. The effect of these shocks on debt ratios and
gross financing needs is large and reflects in particular the sensitivity of debt to growth shocks,
which make the largest contribution to the change in the debt path. Debt-to-GDP reaches about
109−119 percent by 2021 in the two shocks.



No reform. A custom-made scenario assumes that the government fails to implement its
proposed reforms on the fiscal front, so that primary deficits are registered throughout the
projection period. The currency depreciates by 5 percent in 2016 and by another 20 percent in
2017. Spreads on domestic securities pick up by 500 bps in 2016 and 2017, and remain elevated
thereafter. Growth recovery is weaker and the depreciation is steeper. Debt reaches 106 percent
of GDP by 2021.



Debt Reduction Begins by 2021 (“IMF recommended scenario”). An alternative custom-made
scenario projects debt and financing needs under an assumption of more aggressive fiscal
consolidation than under the baseline. The scenario is calibrated so that the primary balance
reaches the debt-stabilizing level within the 5-year projection period. Faster disinflation and
higher confidence supported by fiscal consolidation allows interest rates to drop lower than in
the baseline scenario, providing growth support in outer years while fiscal reforms send a
positive confidence signal. Gross financing needs are lower and gross debt is put on a declining
trajectory by 2021.

9/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
10/ "Interest revenue" is a reconciliation series calculated as a difference between the gross interest of the NFPS and the net interest of the PS. This concept is used to maintain consistency between the

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Brazil
October 31, 2016
1.
This note reports on information that has become available since the staff report
was issued and does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.


The constitutional amendment that limits the annual growth of federal primary
spending to inflation in the previous year has passed by a wide margin the first and
second votes in the lower house of Congress. The amendment will now go to the
Senate, where it must be voted twice.



High-frequency data suggest economic activity continued to contract in the third
quarter. In particular, the central bank’s monthly activity index (a good proxy for
GDP) fell sharply in August (0.9 percent m/m), driven by a sharp drop in retail sales,
industrial output, and services activity.



Headline 12-month inflation decelerated to 8.3 percent in mid-October (compared to
8.8 percent in mid-September), with a print of 0.19 percent m/m. The median market
forecast for annual inflation in 2017 fell to 5 percent on October 21, and is now
0.5 percentage points above the central bank’s target of 4.5 percent.



The central bank lowered the policy rate by 25 bps to 14 percent in its October
Monetary Policy meeting, citing declines since the last policy meeting in inflation,
inflation expectations, and the central bank’s own inflation forecasts in the constantpolicy-rate scenario. The central bank signaled that further easing of monetary
conditions would be gradual and moderate.



Petrobras announced a new pricing policy for gasoline and diesel at the refinery gate,
and lowered these prices slightly. According to the new policy, fuel prices will be
updated monthly based on changes in international prices, exchange rates,
transportation margins, and domestic market conditions, and will not be allowed to
fall below import parity.



Moody's upgraded all ratings, from B3 to B2, of Petrobras and those based on
Petrobras' guarantees, including the company's senior unsecured debt and corporate
family rating, citing lower liquidity risk and improved prospects for operational
performance in the medium term.

Statement by Alexandre Tombini, Executive Director for Brazil
October 31, 2016

1.
I thank staff for the set of reports, the high-quality analytical work and the valuable
engagement with the Brazilian authorities.
Recent economic developments
2.
In mid-2014 Brazil entered its worst recorded recession, accumulating a GDP
contraction of 8 percent in the nine quarters through the second quarter of 2016. As is often
the case, such a decline in economic activity resulted from a combination of factors. In
addition to external factors affecting commodity prices and unleashing important headwinds,
policy missteps, in particular on the fiscal front, contributed to eroding confidence in the
policy framework. Moreover, political uncertainty coupled with the shrinking of Petrobras
further impinged upon investment, which fell dramatically in the last two years. The collapse
in aggregate demand led to extensive job losses in the period and a steep rise in
unemployment.
3.
The new administration, which took office on an interim basis this May and was
confirmed only in September, has shown strong commitment to sound macroeconomic
policies and has galvanized broad support in Congress to cope with the challenging economic
situation.
4.
At this point, the Brazilian economy shows signs that activity is stabilizing, albeit still
tentatively. Short-term indicators are currently uneven, in line with what is expected in such
transitional periods. As political uncertainty dissipates, business and consumer confidence
have rebounded. It is expected, however, that labor market softening will continue in the
coming quarters, before stabilizing in 2017. Nevertheless, market participants are now more
optimistic with regard to GDP growth, as the forecast for 2017 was revised upwards to 1.2
percent, compared to 0.3 percent six months ago.
Economic policy priorities
5.
The authorities are fully aware of the severity of the situation and the sheer dimension
of the challenges ahead, and concur with staff that growth will more likely resume gradually.
They are nevertheless working consistently on different fronts to create the conditions to
ensure a stronger and sustainable rebound in growth. In this regard, they have devised and
are implementing a combination of actions to restore the credibility of the macroeconomic
policy framework, while proceeding with productivity enhancing structural reforms.

2
6.
A paramount goal within this approach is to undertake the needed measures to restore
confidence through first stabilizing gross public debt and then subsequently reducing it.
Considering that unsustainable long-term expenditure mandates have been a major source of
fiscal imbalances, the new administration has set out a fiscal consolidation strategy based on
initially curbing the real growth of public spending and then promoting a parametric reform
of the pension system. This approach is key towards reestablishing confidence in the fiscal
policy framework, helping inflation to converge to the target and creating an opportunity for
rebalancing the policy mix. Such a combination of lower inflation and real interest rates as
well as reduced uncertainty regarding fiscal sustainability will be crucial to reignite
investment in a more vigorous way than currently anticipated.
7.
Within this course of action, important progress has already been made in a relatively
short period. These include a constitutional amendment that was approved in August to deearmark a larger share of the budget, which also encompasses subnational entities and
facilitates fiscal adjustment; another constitutional amendment freezing federal spending in
real terms has been approved by an overwhelming majority in the lower house, before
proceeding to the Senate; the Court of Accounts is expected to rule soon in favor of the
legality of the early repayment of BNDES – the state-owned development bank – loans from
the Treasury, giving the green light for an agreement that may reduce the gross public debt
by R$100 billion (about 1.6 percent of GDP) in the next three years; and tax revenues from
the new law for the repatriation of undeclared assets are expected to reach R$50 billion (the
exact figure will be known in the next few days). Additionally, a constitutional amendment
establishing new parameters for the social security system, to promote its sustainability over
the long term is set to be sent to Congress by the end of this year.
8.
The Brazilian authorities consider that the key fiscal measures, namely, the spending
cap and the social security reform, are the game changers to restore debt sustainability and
confidence in the economy. So far the strategy is advancing as envisaged and Congress has
sent clear signals that it is willing to step up and approve these politically harsh, but
necessary measures.
9.
With the ongoing progress in the fiscal front, and with inflation expectations for 2017
having come down swiftly in the past six months from 6 to 5 percent and well anchored at
the target thereafter, the Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) cut the Selic rate by 25 basis
points in its last meeting, on October 19th. Monetary policy remains tight, with high real
interest rates. However, as stated by the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB), the gradual and
moderate flexibilization of the monetary stance is consistent with the convergence of
inflation to the target. Going forward, the magnitude and speed of monetary flexibilization
will depend on the level of confidence in the convergence of inflation within the relevant
period for monetary policy. Incoming data, in particular, the behavior of those inflation items
that are more responsive to monetary policy and economic activity, and the pace of

3
implementation of reforms will be key for such development. Within the outlined strategy, a
stronger fiscal stance and a rebalanced monetary policy will provide a mix consistent with
the macroeconomic goals that are more conducive to sustainable growth resumption, based
on reduced uncertainty, diminished crowding out, and lower financing costs.
10.
Meanwhile, in its pursuit to continuously enhance policy credibility and help the
disinflationary process, the BCB undertook measures to sharpen transparency and policy
communication. The government is also considering ways to strengthen the de jure
autonomy of the monetary authority.
Structural reforms
11.
Sustainable economic growth is the crucial precondition for overcoming the current
challenges of the Brazilian economy. A cyclical rebound may be amplified by the measures
mentioned above, but in order to ensure higher potential growth, a robust structural agenda
needs to be implemented. With that in mind, the government is pursuing different avenues.
One important strand relates to the changes being introduced in the framework for
privatization and concessions to make them more appealing. Such an initiative will
simultaneously help balance fiscal accounts and boost productivity, by removing bottlenecks
and bringing new players to the ground. In addition, Petrobras is currently streamlining its
activities, having also been exempted from the requirement to participate in all pre-salt oil
exploitation projects. Moreover, in order to facilitate private participation in the provision of
public services, a new framework for sanitation companies is being designed, while Infraero
– the state-owned airport company – is no longer required to be a mandatory partner in the
concession of airports.
12.
The authorities are conscious of the fact that microeconomic reforms are also crucial
for boosting productivity and long term economic growth, as well as increasing Brazil’s
competitiveness in a more open economy. In this regard, an agenda to foster a better legal
and infra-legal regulatory framework to improve the business climate and stimulate
investment is being developed. Some of the main goals are to enhance governance in SOEs,
increase the autonomy of regulatory agencies, prioritize evaluation of results over
procedures, and update the bankruptcy law. Last but not least, the administration is
encouraging BNDES to focus on infrastructure investment. The authorities believe that a
better business climate and a clearer design of infrastructure concessions and privatizations
will stimulate investments and unleash productive forces in the economy. Moreover, recent
corruption probes will lay the groundwork for a new, improved and more transparent
relationship between government and the private sector, with potential efficiency gains for
the economy.

4
Financial system soundness and the external sector
13.
The Brazilian financial system has recently been through a real life stress test and so
far has passed with flying colors. In the last three years, the decline in economic growth, the
sharp depreciation of the Brazilian real (BRL), the hike in domestic interest rate and the fall
in real household income, reached extraordinary levels. Even considering that economic
recovery is still needed to ease the pressure and strengthen profitability of the system,
deleveraging and absorption of shocks proceeded without any systemic event. Brazilian
banks are well provisioned and capitalized, and the regulatory and supervisory framework
proved to be robust. Furthermore, BCB’s FX swap program (non-deliverable future
instruments settled in BRL) provided a valuable additional supply of hedge, which allowed
the exchange rate to float widely without causing disruptive financial distress. The overall
fiscal impact of the FX swap program has been contained, as the large profits of the program
in the first ten months of 2016 made up for more than 80 percent of the losses incurred in
2015.
14.
Throughout this period of economic and political turbulence, high levels of
international reserves played a major role in providing stability to the Brazilian economy. A
large current account deficit and spikes in risk aversion leading to intense volatility of capital
flows did not trigger any mistrust about the ability of Brazil to meet its foreign exchange
commitments1. The floating exchange rate regime worked effectively as the first line of
defense to absorb external shocks and promote a swift adjustment in the current account. The
FX swap program was instrumental for corporate and financial sectors to assimilate sharp
exchange rate movements. In addition, during this period there were no episodes of capital
flight and foreign direct investment remained a reliable source of external finance. Looking
forward, the authorities foresee a healthier performance of the current account as the
economy recovers, while exchange rate flexibility and a sound financial system will continue
to be vital for sustainable growth in Brazil.
The fiscal situation of States and Municipalities
15.
The economic downturn also affected the public finance of subnational governments,
especially those whose revenues are more dependent on commodity prices. Consequently, all
levels of government, including states and municipalities, reduced spending to partially
accommodate for falling fiscal revenues. However, budget rigidities have constrained the
extent of that adjustment, and achieving sustainability is still challenging for states. In this
regard, while attention is required for necessary structural reforms, the temporary relief
granted by the federal government provided needed space for the adjustment to follow its

demonstrates that convertibility risk has been negligible in the Brazilian foreign exchange market.

5
course. More importantly, the social security reform to be proposed by the federal
government should help states tackle increasing pension expenditures.
16.
Strengthening controls, closer monitoring by the National Treasury, and full
enforcement of the Fiscal Responsibility Law together with improvements in the efficiency
in public spending and enhancement of fiscal transparency will help bring subnational
governments to a sounder fiscal footing. Yet again, growth will be decisive for restoring
fiscal sustainability, particularly for states, whose revenues are more responsive to the
economic cycle.
