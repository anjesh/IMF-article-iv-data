ISLANDS
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
December 19, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context. The Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) is going through a period of output
fluctuations. The economy expanded in FY2012 by 3.2 percent, supported by export growth,
but in FY2013 is estimated to have slowed to 0.8 percent due to the postponement of
infrastructure projects. A fiscal deficit of 0.8 percent of GDP was recorded in FY2012 and
another deficit of similar magnitude is estimated for FY2013.
Outlook and Risks. A growth rebound is expected in FY2014, assuming the resumption of
infrastructure projects. A sustained increase in growth is hindered by the scheduled reduction
in Compact grants and limited private sector expansion. Near-term risks are on the downside,
stemming from possible further delays in project implementation. Insufficient fiscal buffers and
public contingent liabilities constitute key risks for the medium-long term.
Policy Issues. The RMI faces persistent budget deficits, substantial fiscal risks from poorly
performing state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and the social security system, and the expiration
of most Compact grants after FY2023. Private sector development is limited by remoteness,
small market size, SOE dominance in some sectors and a weak business climate, constraining
growth, and making fiscal sustainability more challenging. Household debt and debt service
ratios are high, while the supervisory power and capacity of the Banking Commission is
hindered by institutional and resource constraints.
Key Policy Recommendations.

 A fiscal adjustment of no less than 4.5 percent of GDP by FY2018 is needed to achieve longterm budgetary self-reliance and to build some fiscal buffers, taking the trade-off between
consolidation needs and growth implications into account.
 Achieving this target would require public wage moderation, SOE restructuring, swift
implementation of the long-awaited tax reform and further reforms to the social security
system.
 Growth potential can be enhanced by upgrading human capital and infrastructure and
securing better connectivity, in cooperation with development partners and neighbor
countries. SOE reforms and measures to facilitate firm access to credit would support
private sector development.
 The capacity and oversight authority of the Banking Commission should be strengthened to
safeguard financial stability.

REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS

BACKGROUND
1.
The RMI is a small and isolated country, with a dispersed population and limited export
base, highly dependent on external aid and vulnerable to climate change. Under the renewed
Compact Agreement with the US, the RMI will continue to receive annually declining grants
averaging US$45 million (26 percent of GDP as of FY2012) until FY2023.1 A Compact Trust Fund (CTF)
is being built up to provide funding from FY2024 onwards.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. Recent developments
2.
The economy grew by 3.2 percent in FY2012, up from a lackluster 0.6 percent in
FY2011. The FY2012 growth pick-up was driven by the double-digit expansion in the fishery sector,
increased copra and coconut oil production and the expansion of the education sector (Figure 1).
Construction activity, however, continued to contract, owing to delays in the implementation of
Compact infrastructure projects. In FY2013 growth is estimated at a weaker rate of 0.8 percent, due
to further postponement of some construction activities. Employment has remained stagnant in
FY2012, with a slight reduction in private sector employment being offset by a small increase in
public sector employment. Outmigration slowed in FY2012, after ten years of average annual
outflows rates.
3.
Inflation moderated. Year-on-year inflation stood at 4.3 percent in FY2012—1 percentage
point lower than in FY2011—and is estimated to have eased even further, to 1.6 percent in FY2013,
thanks to subdued world commodity prices.
4.
In FY2012 the overall fiscal balance recorded the first deficit (0.8 percent of GDP) since
2005, in spite of favorable growth. The deterioration reflected an increase in transfers to SOEs of
1.1 percent of GDP and a 0.5 percent of GDP rise in the public wage bill, which more than offset an
increase in fishing license fees. For FY2013, the fiscal deficit is estimated to have remained at
0.8 percent of GDP, with a further increase in transfers to SOEs broadly offsetting that in fishing
license fees. The FY2012 deficit was financed by a drawdown in deposits, while the FY2013 deficit was
financed by an Asia Development Bank (AsDB) loan disbursement.
5.
The current account deficit including official transfers remained elevated in FY2012 at
8.1 percent of GDP. This was driven by high imports for the airport extension project, financed by
capital transfers. Exports continued their expansion, reaching nearly 35 percent of GDP in FY2012.
Fishing fees rose to 5.6 percent of GDP in FY2012, from 3.1 percent of GDP in FY2011 (Figure 2). In
FY2013 the current account deficit is estimated to have deteriorated to 9.4 percent of GDP, due to
the postponement of some donor grants.

B. Outlook and Exchange Rate Assessment
6.
While a growth rebound is expected in FY2014, the medium-term outlook is less
promising. Growth is projected at 3.2 percent in FY2014, assuming the resumption of Compact
funded infrastructure projects. The pickup in related construction activities is expected to continue
through FY2017, and unwind in FY2018, with growth slowing significantly in that year. The fishing
sector is expected to expand further, but at a slower pace (Box 1). In the medium-long term, growth
potential is projected at about 1½ percent—weighted down by the scheduled reduction in Compact
grants and limited private sector expansion. Inflation is expected to remain moderate at 1.7 percent
in FY2014, thanks to subdued global commodity prices.
7.
A fiscal deficit of 0.2 percent of GDP is projected for FY2014. The temporary
improvement compared to FY2013 is driven by one-off revenue factors—a grant from Papua New
Guinea and a dividend transfer from the Marshall Islands Marine Resource Authority— more than
offsetting increases in education and health spending in response to a US request.
8.
The current account deficit is expected to widen in FY2014 to nearly 21 percent of GDP.
The deterioration will be driven by the acquisition of
two ships provided by a donor to improve domestic

remained fairly stable since then. Exports have been
expanding and unit labor costs in the fishing sector—the main export— have been declining over
the past three years. Current account deficits are financed by a stable source of funding and the use
of the U.S. dollar as legal tender and the close ties with the United States provide a shelter against
external instability.2

Risks to the outlook are to the downside. In the short-term, further delays in the

A formal CGER-type analysis was conducted. However, that assessment framework is not fully suitable for the RMI
due to data limitations and the special characteristics of its economy, most notably the heavy dependence on aid. The
analysis points to a real undervaluation in the range of 9–38 percent, as estimated current account deficit norms are
very large—due to a significant economic development gap relative to trading partners and negative oil balances—
whereas underlying current account deficits are much smaller, reflecting the impact of stable foreign government
grants.

is ever-present. Global oil price shocks would have a detrimental impact on growth and other
macroeconomic variables. Longer-term risks include inadequate fiscal consolidation ahead of the
scheduled decline in Compact grants, climate change, and continued outward migration of the
working-age population. On the upside, a decisive push for structural reforms and additional
investment in infrastructure and the fishery sector would support growth (Appendix 1). Due to
limited international financial linkages, the RMI remains fairly isolated from spillovers from external
financial developments. Spillovers from trade linkages are expected to be limited in the nearmedium-term given RMI’s low dependence on tourism and relatively stable fish demand.

REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS

The Authorities’ Views
11.
Compared to staff’s projections, the authorities were more optimistic on growth
prospects. While they agreed that the resumption of infrastructure projects would be the main
driver of growth in FY2014, they saw better growth prospects from copra production in the mediumterm. In their view, the new ships from donors will allow higher coconuts collection from producers,
and a planned new copra oil refinery will reduce dependence on some imported inputs and raise the
value added of exports. The authorities agreed that foreign grants would continue to provide stable
funding for current account deficits, and indicated that the use of the U.S. dollar remained
appropriate.
12.
The authorities considered natural disasters and commodity price shocks to be the
main risks to the outlook. Extreme weather episodes due to climate change have adversely affected
the country in recent years and are becoming more frequent. Negative shocks to copra prices would
affect production and exports, while oil price increases would raise production costs. The authorities
also highlighted upside risks from future construction activity and from the fishing sector, as
adjustments that are favorable to the RMI are expected for the Vessel Day Scheme (VDS) and the
Partners to the Nauru Agreement (PNA) arrangements (Box 1).

SECURING FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY
13.
Government accounts are set to remain in deficit in the near term and beyond. After
FY2015 annual deficits are expected to widen to around 2 percent of GDP and persist in the medium
term, financed by bilateral and multilateral development partners. This projection reflects the
expected increase in expenditure for social security contributions for public sector employees from
the forthcoming pension reform (paragraph 17). The forecast assumes higher subsidies to SOEs,
driven also by some called guarantees (paragraph 15). Due to projected deficits, the central
government debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to increase, while public and publicly guaranteed debt is
projected to remain on a downward path, as SOEs are assumed to continue servicing their
government guaranteed debt.

Policy Issues and Staff’s Views
14.
A clear and bold consolidation strategy is urgently needed. Fiscal balances need to turn
back into surplus to secure long-term sustainability and build buffers against existing significant
fiscal vulnerabilities. These include substantial fiscal risks from SOEs and the social security system
(paragraphs 15 and 17), the end of most Compact grants in FY2023, uncertainty about future CTF
returns, and prospective costs from climate change.
15.
The fiscal adjustment path and composition should strike a right balance between
consolidation needs and short-term growth implications. In view of this, staff recommends
a permanent cumulative consolidation of no less than 4.5 percent of GDP by FY2018 compared to
the baseline. This implies that the government needs to build up a fiscal surplus of 2.6 percent of
GDP (about US$4.5 million in FY2012 prices) by FY2018, which will have to be maintained afterwards.
This would help the RMI to achieve long-term self sufficiency as well as create some fiscal buffer
(Appendix 2). If the government were successful in implementing structural reforms that would boost
real growth, the required fiscal surplus from FY2018 would be somewhat lower. The needed

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS

adjustment could be achieved through a mix of spending and revenue measures, but that would
require strong revenue administration.


Fiscal adjustment will necessitate targeted spending cuts. Containing public wages would be
essential to produce fiscal savings and reduce the large public-private sector wage gap
(Figure 1). A freeze on the nominal wage,

GDP since 2010 (Box 2). Moreover, as of
FY2012, the government has guaranteed US$34 million (20 percent of GDP) of their debt,
including US$28.1 million debt of the National Telecommunication Authority (NTA). This poses
a significant risk on public finances, as the company is unable to meet its repayment obligations
and has already defaulted on some monthly payments, forcing the government to step in. Some
SOEs are also planning to borrow further in FY2014, with a government guarantee. Staff
encourages the authorities to assess thoroughly possible risks from these operations.
Furthermore, staff urges the authorities to advance expeditiously SOE restructuring, with support
from the AsDB and the World Bank, by addressing the key issues of governance, pricing policies,
efficiency, enforcement of customers’ payments and cross-subsidization. In view of the needed
fiscal adjustment, the aim should be reducing government subsidies to SOEs by at least
1.5 percent of GDP by FY2018. A larger reduction is warranted and may be necessary if revenue
gains from the tax reform are on the low end of the forecast range.



Approval and swift implementation of the tax reform bill is critical to enhance efficiency
and equity as well as tax compliance. The comprehensive tax reform bill, currently before
parliament, can rectify several weaknesses of the current system. The reform would make the
wage and salary tax more equitable by eliminating unjustifiable exemptions, introducing
a uniform deduction, and increasing progressivity. Replacing existing import duties and local
government sale taxes with a broad-based and modern consumption tax will enhance efficiency
and tax compliance. The replacement of the Gross Revenue Tax with a new net profit tax for large
businesses will make corporate taxation more business friendly. The creation of a new client
focused and independent Customs and Revenue Authority and a more effective IT support

system will improve revenue administration. By broadening the tax base and enhancing tax
administration, the tax reform is expected to generate additional revenues of 0.5-1.8 percent of
GDP, depending on compliance.
Box 2. Marshall Islands: State-Owned Enterprises: Recent Developments
and Prospects for Reform
SOEs’ size in the RMI economy is significant, but they have failed to contribute to growth. They have total
assets of around US$150 million (85 percent of GDP), and account for nearly 8 percent of total employment.
However, between FY2004 and FY2012, SOE cumulative value added growth was only 1.7 percent— merely
1 percent of the increase in total GDP. Most SOEs ran operating losses in FY2012, totaling US$15 million
(8.5 percent of GDP)—3.1 percentage points higher than the FY2007-11 average.
While operating losses are partly motivated by the need to provide essential services to the outer islands
at affordable prices, they are also driven by several deficiencies. Lack of investment and maintenance result
in inefficient operation in the public transportation companies, Tobolar, and utility providers. The absence of
a comprehensive SOE law and of requirements on directors’ duties and obligations contribute to poor
governance and accountability. Tariffs are sometimes unduly kept below operating costs, and one SOE does not
pay the public energy company, thus benefitting from cross subsidization.
Some SOEs’ reform initiatives are in train, but the
timing of implementation and outcomes remain
uncertain. At the authorities’ request, the AsDB
undertook a review of SOEs in 2010, and
recommended reform actions. With technical support
from the AsDB, new SOE legislation was drafted in
2011, and now awaits parliament approval. The
Marshalls Energy Company has gone through some
restructuring, following the adoption of a
comprehensive recovery plan in 2009. The AsDB is also
helping to develop and implement strategic plans in
other SOEs. The World Bank is working with the

authorities on a restructuring plan for the National Telecommunication Authority. Reforms, however, face several
challenges, including opposition from SOEs, and may require a long time for approval and implementation.

16.
Public Financial Management (PFM) reforms are essential to address existing
weaknesses in budget reporting and planning. The authorities have worked with the Pacific
Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) on a comprehensive medium-term PFM Reform
Roadmap, including measures to strengthen the budgeting framework, the accounting system, debt
management, and revenue administration. The plan still has to be finalized and approved by cabinet.
Furthermore, a Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Management Act has been submitted to Parliament,
stating that fiscal policy has to achieve and maintain prudent levels of debt, and requiring more
stringent and periodic reporting of fiscal developments to parliament. Staff welcomes these
initiatives and recommends their rapid approval and implementation. Enhancing the medium-term
budgeting framework and integrating it into the annual budget would be particularly important for
fiscal policy planning, in view of the scheduled reduction in Compact grants.

benefit system. With the reform, the system is
projected to record a surplus until FY2022, but further deficits are likely to arise later on. Approving
and implementing the reform is an essential first step toward the creation of a more sustainable
pension system. Staff encourages the authorities to explore options for even further reforms that
would secure full long-term sustainability of the social security system.
18.
The RMI is assessed to have high risk of external public debt distress, although
mitigating factors limit near-term risks. Currently the ratios of present value (PV) of external
public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt-to-GDP, exports and revenues are all above their
respective reference thresholds. RMI’s vulnerability to debt distress is mitigated by the
concessionality of most obligations and access to a stable flow of funds from Compacts grants. On
the other hand, short-term risks are exacerbated by the uncertainty surrounding SOE reform
implementation and their plans to borrow further with government guarantees.

The Authorities’ Views
19.
The authorities recognized the need for fiscal adjustment. They intend to achieve
a balanced budget in FY2014 through a 25 percent cut in electricity and travel expenses, and build
surpluses over the following years. They agreed on the need to contain wage bills, and noted that
nominal wages have been unchanged over the past three years and that no increase is planned
going forward. The authorities also intend to reduce personnel through a hiring freeze and natural
attrition. They also pointed out that the tax and SOE reform bills currently before parliament will help
improve the fiscal accounts.
20.
The authorities were keen to improve fiscal planning and public financial management.
They noted that with the assistance of the AsDB the Ministry of Finance has adopted a fiscal
management model that will be used for budgetary planning. They intend to proceed expeditiously
with the finalization and implementation of the PFM reform, for which they have requested IMF
technical assistance.
21.
The authorities acknowledged the need for further pension reforms. They are
considering converting the social security system to a defined contribution scheme and are seeking
technical assistance in this area.

BOOSTING PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT AND
FINANCIAL STABILITY
A. Private Sector Development
Policy Issues and Staff’s Views
22.
Going forward, further private sector development will be essential to support and
stabilize growth and, hence, secure fiscal sustainability. In spite of the recent expansion of the
fishing sector, the public sector remains the main source of economic activity. Private sector
development is limited by remoteness, small size, a poor regulatory framework and weak business
climate (Box 3 and Figure 3). In addition, SOEs compete against private enterprises in some sectors,
such as telecommunications and hospitality, on an unequal footing, given their access to subsidized
credit.
23.
Policies are needed to enhance private sector growth prospects. The government could
work with development partners, the private sector and neighboring countries to upgrade both
capital and human resources and to secure cheaper and more reliable air links to and within the
country. Structural reforms should address the issues of weak competition due to SOE dominance in
some industries and the wide public and private sector wage gap. The authorities could consider the
introduction of an insolvency framework and further land registration reforms to facilitate firm access
to credit. Furthermore, easing procedures for long-term land leases to nonresidents could help
attract foreign direct investment.

The Authorities’ Views
24.
There was general agreement about the impediments to private sector development.
Structural obstacles on land use were regarded as deeply rooted in tradition, and very difficult to
remove. The authorities noted that SOE reforms were underway with the assistance of the AsDB and
the World Bank, and indicated that a law to liberalize the telecommunication sector was awaiting
parliament approval. They also pointed out that the gap between public and private sector wages
was due to the fact that the public sector employs more skilled workers than the private sector.

B. Financial Sector
25.
Lending conditions are tight, despite ample availability of deposit funding. The loan-to
deposit ratio remained low in FY2012, at around 70 percent, with commercial loans representing only
about 20 percent of private sector credit. Spreads between lending and deposit rates stayed elevated
at around 7 percent, reflecting the high risk in domestic lending (Figure 2 and 3). Banks operated
profitably—with a return on assets of nearly 3 percent in FY2012.

Box 3. Marshall Islands: Obstacles to Private Sector Development
Private sector growth in the RMI faces considerable obstacles. As in other Pacific Island countries (PICs), small
market size, remoteness, dispersion over a wide area, and exposure to natural disasters raise business costs and
make it difficult to benefit from economies of scale.
Lack of clarity on land ownership has adverse effects on private sector growth. The complex customary land
tenure system implies that at least three parties need to jointly agree on whether a transaction can occur, and
written documentation of ownership titles is limited. Hence the RMI is ranked at the bottom of the World Bank’s
indicator for “Registering Property”.1 A voluntary registration scheme, initiated in 2009, has been stalled by land
ownership disputes. Thus, investors not only have to navigate through a longer process to lease land, but also
face risks of legal contest to land usage. Commercial banks have also shied away from accepting land as collateral
given potential difficulties in repossessing the asset in the event of default.

Each governance indicator ranges from -2.5 (weak) to 2.5
(strong) governance performance.

The absence of a legislative framework for bankruptcy and limited investor protection also hampers
private sector development. Bankruptcy costs are higher than the regional average, at 38 percent of the estate
(compared to an average of 31 percent for PICs) and a recovery rate of just 17 cents on the dollar (compared to
an average of 27 cents in the dollar for PICs). Investor protection is also weak, reflecting the lack of disclosure
requirements, and a low extent of director liability.
The business climate is not conducive to growth due to weak public governance. The RMI scores poorly in
World Bank’s measure of government effectiveness relative to the PICs and other micro states, due to low scores
for public administration quality and budgetary and financial management.

The World Bank Doing Business indicators should be interpreted with caution due to a limited number of respondents, limited

geographical coverage, and standardized assumptions on business constraints and information availability.

26.
Household debt remains high. Consumer debt is almost 50 percent of total employees’
compensation, and anecdotal evidence suggests that debt servicing in many cases is as high as
90 percent of borrowers’ income. Recurrent refinancing of existing consumer loans also appears to
be quite common. In addition, there are indications that households are increasingly borrowing at
higher interest rates from money-lenders which are not regulated by the Banking Commission. The

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS

publicly owned Marshall Islands Development Bank (MIDB), which is outside the Banking
Commission’s oversight, is engaged in short-term consumer lending as well—an activity regarded as
less risky and more profitable.

Policy Issues and Staff’s Views
27.
Strengthening the regulatory framework will be critical, especially in view of the high
level of household indebtedness. Given the high debt service ratios, small shocks to borrowers’
disposable income (such as higher social security contributions following the implementation of the
pension reform) could produce increasing defaults. Hence, the Banking Commission should consider
imposing a ceiling on the allowed debt service ratio. The regulatory authority should also introduce
homogenous criteria on non-performing loan classification and require regular data reports, since
timely and consistent data are not readily available. The Banking Commission should also enforce the
legal requirement for deposit insurance—currently being contravened by one bank—, especially
given the absence of any insolvency law to protect depositors.
28.
The capacity and oversight authority of the Banking Commission should be enhanced.
Resource constraints have limited the Commission’s ability to carry out regular on-site bank
inspections. Staff also recommends that the Banking Commission be given more authority and
autonomy to carry out supervision, as currently, its actions can be reversed by the Cabinet. The MIDB
and other nonbank financial institutions that engage in private lending activities should also be
brought under the purview of the Banking Commission. The MIDB should refocus on its core
mandate of providing commercial lending, rather than consumer loans.
29.
The anti-money laundering (AML) framework needs to be stepped up, in particular
with regard to the transparency of legal persons. The 2012 OECD Global Forum progress report
confirms that measures to ensure availability of information on the beneficial ownership of legal
persons still need to be introduced, and effectively implemented. The RMI counts 30,000 active nonresident companies, at risk of misuse in money laundering and tax evasion schemes.

The Authorities’ Views
30.
The authorities agreed on the need to enhance the capacity of the Banking Commission
to carry out on site inspections. They also considered important to introduce a regulatory
framework for non-bank moneylenders and were contemplating establishing licensing requirements
and setting up a registry. The Banking Commissioner saw the need to limit recurrent loan refinancing
and had made recommendations to the Cabinet in this regard. The authorities also shared staff’s
view that the MIDB should be brought under the Banking Commissioner’s oversight. The
Commissioner concurred on the importance of establishing a safety net for depositors, but had not
formulated a reform proposal yet.
31.
The authorities noted that they have made some progress on measures against money
laundering. The RMI introduced amendments to existing legislation to cover self-laundering, and
addressed some deficiencies on the functionality of the financial intelligence unit. However, budget
constraints have resulted in delays in implementing several measures, including on-site reviews of
banks and targeted reviews of non-bank institutions.

STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
Medium-term growth prospects in the RMI remain weak. In spite of the projected
temporary boost from construction projects and some expansion in the fishery sector, beyond the
near-term the scheduled decline in Compact grants and sluggish private sector development hinder
faster growth.
33.
Projected persistent deficits, significant fiscal risks from poorly performing SOEs and
the social security system, and the expiration of most Compact grants after FY2023 call for
a swift and bold consolidation strategy. This should include urgent and comprehensive SOE
restructuring, public wage bill moderation, cuts in civil servants allowances, approval and
implementation of the pending tax reform. Approval and implementation of the social security bill
currently before parliament, as well as further pension reform, would be essential to secure longterm sustainability. PFM reforms are also needed to improve budget planning, execution and
monitoring.
34.
The RMI is assessed at high risk of public external debt distress, although the
concessionality of most obligations and access to a stable flow of funds from Compact grants
mitigate near-term risks. This calls for a very prudent external debt management policy, including
seeking concessional loans.
35.
The real exchange rate remains close to its historical value. The real appreciation of
FY2008–09 has been reversed, and the real exchange rate has remained fairly stable since then.
Current account deficits are financed by a stable source of funding and the use of the dollar as legal
tender and close ties with the United States provide a shelter against external instability.
36.
Private sector development would be critical for both lifting growth and supporting
fiscal sustainability. Policies to enhance private sector growth prospects include SOE restructuring
and measures to facilitate firms’ access to credit and foreign direct investment.
37.
Strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework would enhance financial
stability. Given high household debt and debt service ratios, the Banking Commission should
consider imposing a ceiling on the allowed debt service ratio and its supervisory authority should be
broadened to include all entities engaging in lending activities. There is also a need to improve
monitoring of non-performing loans and to increase the Banking Commission’s resources.
Furthermore, the Banking Commission should be given more authority and autonomy to carry out
effective supervision. Depositor protection should also be enhanced.
38.
The quality of official statistics is broadly adequate for surveillance, but should be
improved. Timeliness and coverage of statistics tend to constrain policy planning and assessment.
Additional staff training and capacity building would contribute to improving data quality.
39.
The authorities have taken a few steps to implement some of past IMF staff
recommendations (Appendix III).
40.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the 24-month
cycle.

Sources: RMI authorities

Two scenarios are considered to assess the long-term outlook and the implications for RMI’s
fiscal sustainability. Long-term self-sufficiency is assumed to be achieved if after FY2023 the CTF
can generate enough investment income to cover the reduction in Compact-sector grants and the
Supplemental Education Grant, without eroding the real value of the CTF.4
1. Baseline scenario
Under this scenario of unchanged fiscal policies, persistent fiscal deficits are projected until FY2033,
the last year of the analysis, and are assumed to be financed by external borrowing from bilateral
and multilateral development partners. This projection reflects also the expected increase in
expenditure for social security contributions for public sector employees from the forthcoming
pension reform. In view of projected deficits, no additional contributions from the government to
the CTF are assumed. The CTF net investment return is assumed at 6 percent, consistent with
previous staff analysis and an earlier study by the US Government Accountability Office. This is
slightly above the 5.6 percent net average return since the CTF’s inception in 2004, which, however,
reflects the impact of unusually dismal earnings in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.

1

The Compact Trust Fund for the RMI was created in 2004 to contribute to the long-term budgetary self-reliance by
providing the RMI Government with an ongoing source of revenue after FY2023. The amended Compacts and their
subsidiary agreements contain no commitments, either express or implied, regarding the level of the revenue that will be
generated by the Trust Fund, nor is there any commitment regarding the degree to which the revenue will contribute to the
long-term budgetary self-reliance of the RMI.
2

In addition to this, the D account of the CTF, which received contributions from the RMI’s government and Taiwan
Province of China, held US$11.4 million as of end-FY2013.
3

The CTF committee has no oversight or fiduciary responsibility of the D account.

4

The analysis is thus based on a broader perspective than what the CTF was designed to specifically support.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS

Under the baseline scenario, long-term self sufficiency will not be secured because the real
value of the CTF will decline over time, even though income flows in the years immediately
after FY2023 are expected to be sufficient to cover the anticipated reduction in grants.
Compact-related grants are expected to be reduced by US$32.0 million in FY2024, while the CTF’s
investment earnings are projected at US$37.6 million. The gap between the investment return and
reduction in grants will be too small to compensate for the increase in inflation,5 so the real value of
the fund will start declining in FY2024.
2. Policy action scenarios
In the first scenario, the government is assumed to undertake a fiscal adjustment of 0.9 percent of
GDP each year starting in FY2015— building a surplus of 1.7 percent of GDP in FY2018— and
maintain the same surplus after FY2018, and transfer surpluses to the CTF or invest them in another
trust fund with the same return. Under this course of actions the real value of the total asset would
be preserved at least until FY2033, the last projection year. The surplus required to achieve self
sufficiency is lower than past staff’s estimates due to the improved performance of the CTF.
However, this outcome is sensitive to the assumption on investment returns.6 For example,
a 1 percentage point decline in investment return would increase the needed adjustment to more
than 6 percent of GDP over a 4-year period. Hence, to cushion against CTF return volatility, and
taking account the growth implications of fiscal adjustments, staff recommends a permanent
cumulative consolidation of no less than 4.5 percent of GDP by FY2018.

On the other hand, if the government were successful in implementing structural reforms that would boost real

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
The Bank team led by Mr. Suri and the Fund team led by Ms. Zoli maintain a close working
relationship and have an ongoing dialogue on macroeconomic and structural issues.
The teams agreed that the RMI’s main macroeconomic challenges are to (i) address short term
macro volatility arising from the deterioration in the fiscal deficit and slowdown in economic growth,
(ii) to achieve long-term budgetary self-reliance and (ii) facilitate a greater role for the private sector
in delivering services and generating employment.
Based on this shared assessment, the teams identified several reform areas as critical in view of their
central role in achieving fiscal consolidation and fostering sustained growth:


Civil service reform. The public sector wage bill is similar to that in other small Pacific Island
Countries, but large by international standards of economies of comparable scale, and
unsustainable in light of declining US Compact grants. Reducing the public wage bill to
sustainable levels and reducing labor market inefficiencies will likely require a freeze in the civil
servant workforce and aligning compensation with private sector services costs. Such reforms
would, however, need to be cognizant of the constraints imposed on employment opportunities
by the small size of the economy and the current limited potential for private sector growth.



Reform of the revenue system. The existing tax system lacks the ability to raise needed
additional revenue, discourages private investment, and is inequitable. Careful consideration
needs to be given to the potential of a comprehensive tax reform program, including
strengthening tax administration, for raising additional revenue while supporting the private
sector.



Public sector enterprise reform. Many state-owned enterprises (SOE) are a drain on public
finance and provide unreliable or costly services undermining private sector development. To
improve their performance, reforms are needed to strengthen efficiency, better delineate
commercial and non-commercial services, and introduce tariff systems that better reflect cost of
services. In areas where SOEs provide purely commercial services, divestment should be
considered.



Structural reforms in the telecommunication and energy sectors. An improved regulatory
environment and private investment in telecommunications will likely facilitate broader access to
and reduce the costs of delivering social services and create opportunities for private sector
development. Tackling Marshall Islands Energy Company’s operating losses will improve the
reliability of electricity supply and reduce dependency on government transfers.



Improved aid management and coordination. Existing donor flows are poorly coordinated and
reporting arrangements are inadequate. This leads to inefficiency in public service delivery and
weakens macroeconomic management. Enhancing the recently introduced aid reporting and
coordination functions of the Economic Policy, Planning and Statistics Office (EPPSO) is a step in
the right direction to consolidate information on donor expenditures.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
The country strategy of the Asian Development Bank (AsDB)1 for the Republic of the Marshall Islands
(RMI) is set out in AsDB’s “Pacific Approach 2010–14” and the “Country Operations Business Plan
2014-2016”. The Country Operations Business Plan has three areas of strategic focus that are
relevant to the medium-term development of the RMI: (i) macroeconomic and fiscal management,
(ii) human capacity development, and (iv) infrastructure development. AsDB is proposing an
indicative lending and grant program of $20 million over 2014–16 comprising a water supply and
sanitation project for Ebeye, fully financed through grants from the Government of Australia and
a standby investment project to be determined following the preparation of the National
Development Plan 2014–16. Technical assistance (TA) of $725,000 is proposed for 2014 and 2015 for
improving state-owned enterprise performance and to prepare a potential investment project.
AsDB’s program in the RMI is also supported using regional TA and grants.
Since joining the AsDB in April 1990, the RMI has received 14 loans totaling $92.63 million. AsDB
loans have covered education, fisheries, health, water, and transport sectors, and support for public
sector reform and structural adjustment (see table). One loan assisted emergency typhoon
rehabilitation. From 2003 to 2009, AsDB’s program for the RMI focused on TA rather than loans.
Lending resumed in 2010 with the approval of a program loan (Subprogram 1 of the RMI Public
Sector Reform Program) for $9.5 million to support public sector reform. As of end December 2012
TA grants totaling $21.11 million for 48 TA projects had been approved. These comprised both
project preparatory and advisory TA. The TA program has covered a wide range of sectors and
issues from support to AsDB loans to building capacities in development banking, tourism
management, environmental protection, economic policy formulation, as well as in developing the
private sector and reforming the civil service.
In 2012, a loan of $5 million for Subprogram 2 of the RMI Public Sector Reform Program was
approved. This phase further broadens and deepens the reform initiatives that began under
Subprogram 1. Subprogram 2 supported the introduction of new legislation covering SOEs, tax, and
fiscal responsibility and debt management; the adoption and implementation of reform plans for
selected SOEs to improve their performance; the completion of a public sector workforce audit and
planning exercise; and the achievement of various expenditure targets.
In 2012, three TA projects were approved. The first for strengthening economic policy and planning
will support the implementation of the government’s new national development plan, once it is
finalized. The second, a regional TA with financing from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, will
support RMI’s early-grade learning assessments at selected primary schools. The objective is to
assist RMI begin the process of systematically measuring how well children in the early grades of
primary school are acquiring reading and mathematics skills, and ultimately spur more effective
efforts to improve performance in the core learning areas. The third, a project preparatory TA is
supporting the design work for the Ebeye water and sanitation project.

RELATIONS WITH THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE CENTRE
The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre’s (PFTAC)1 assistance to the RMI during the past
years has focused on public financial management, revenue administration, and financial supervision
through numerous missions, regional seminars and workshops which RMI officials attended.

Public Financial Management
Over the years, PFM activity in RMI has increased significantly. A peripatetic consultant was fielded
by PFTAC to work on fiscal forecasting and again in June 2008 for one final visit to anchor the
system and provide training. A cash management manual was developed by PFTAC and training
provided on its operation in early 2007. In 2008, training on the operation of the system was
provided to line ministries by a peripatetic consultant and a PFTAC advisor, as well as a review of the
system. The PFTAC advisor visited RMI again in May 2009 to provide training. PFTAC is also
developing a commitment control manual for RMI, and carried out an assessment of the IFMIS
systems in RMI in December 2009.
Following on PFTAC’s assistance in developing a draft Public Financial Management (PFM) reform
Roadmap in 2013, future TA in RMI is expected to focus on supporting the authorities to finalize the
roadmap. Activities to support the roadmap’s implementation are expected to include moving
towards medium-term budgeting, modernization of legislation and financial instructions and
strengthened cash management, accounting and financial reporting. PFTAC will also provide
assistance in analyzing the funding situation for the Social Security fund and developing options to
improve its sustainability.

Revenue Administration
In 2008, the Minister of Finance set up the Tax and Revenue Reform and Modernization Commission
(TRRM) to make recommendations to reform the revenue collection system and to strengthen the
capabilities and effectiveness of the Division of Revenue and Taxation (DRT). The TRRM reported
back in 2010 and recommended a comprehensive revenue reform to introduce an income tax and
domestic sales tax. Subsequent PFTAC advice highlighted revenue leakage in the sales tax proposal
and the recommendation was changed to introduce a VAT. Since then PFTAC has provided
assistance to develop a high level implementation plan for the revenue reforms (2010); draft
legislation for the income tax, VAT and excise taxes and revenue administration activities (2010–11);
and draft a terms of reference for the recruitment of a long term consultant who will assume the
role of Assistant Secretary of the duration for the reforms (2011). The adviser was recruited in 2012
and PFTAC plays a mentoring role in assisting the adviser to promote the tax reform agenda and
improve the overall level of tax administration. The reform program has been advanced at a cautious
rate with a considerable amount of public involvement. The DRT is optimistic that the reform

package will be passed by February 2014 and will take effect on October 1st 2014. PFTAC will
continue to provide TA to support DRT during the implementation process and will provide follow
up TA after October 2014 to ensure that new system operates effectively.
Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision
At the request of the Commissioner, an Advisor visited the Commission in July 2008. The focus of
the mission was to strengthen the capacity of the authorities to conduct off-site surveillance of
banks with a number of revisions recommended to improve the prudential reporting requirements
for banks, and the expansion of the off-site monitoring database. The mission also included training
in the analysis of financial statements to assess a borrower’s credit risk.
A follow-up visit to the Commission was conducted in January 2010 to provide training and support
to Commission staff in conducting an on-site CAMELS-focused bank examination. The visit included
providing hands-on training and support to Commission staff in assessing credit risk in the bank’s
loan portfolio through the use of financial statement analysis, reviewing the appropriateness of loan
repayment structures and repayment histories, and assessing the adequacy of collateral. The visit
also resulted in the development of a standardized examination report to assist the Commission in
presenting examination findings and recommendations. At the request of the Commission, a draft
regulation to clarify and ensure the proper calculation of the single borrower limit as provided in
Section 130(1)(a) of the Banking Act was also prepared during this visit.
In February 2011 training and support was provided to Commission staff in conducting a follow-up
examination to assess efforts by a bank to correct weaknesses and concerns noted as a result of an
earlier examination. As a result of the follow-up visit, assistance was provided to the Commission in
drafting an appropriate regulatory response to the examination findings. Future visits with the
Commission will include expanding and revising onsite examination procedures to allow for riskfocused procedures in order to improve examination efficiencies.

Economic and Financial Statistics
The Economic Policy, Planning and Statistics Office (EPPSO) received significant training since 2005
on balance of payments and national accounts statistics, including through participation on a PFTAC
regional national accounts statistics course conducted in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia in
2006. Despite the extensive training, these statistics continued to be compiled by external
consultants. The previous PFTAC Statistics Advisor provided some technical backstopping to the
national accounts consultant, and in July 2007 visited RMI to assist with the improvement and
compilation of their Balance of Payments (BOP) statistics. The mission was carried out in conjunction
with the two consultants who are funded by the U.S. Department of Interior to update the Annual
Compact Report.
In November 2008, the current PFTAC Advisor undertook a joint BOP and national accounts statistics
mission to RMI to continue development work on BOP and NA sources and methods, as well as to
assist in updating BOP and NA estimates. The EPPSO counterpart left in early 2009 and has just been
replaced in August this year. As a result, two consultants funded by the U.S. Department of Interior
visit RMI annually to update the BOP and national accounts statistics for inclusion in the Annual
Compact Report.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
As of October 1, 2013
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance and the authorities willingly share available data, though
some shortcomings tend to constrain policy analysis, especially on trade statistics. The Economic Policy, Planning and
Statistics Office (EPPSO) was established in February 2003 and took efforts in building local capacity to collect and
disseminate economic and social statistics. Through the close collaboration of EPPSO and various ministries, an
external consultant team in the Pacific Islands Training Initiative (www.pitiviti.org), funded by the U.S. Department of
Interior, prepares a comprehensive set of annual statistics covering key areas beginning FY2008. Previously, extensive
Fund technical assistance was provided through the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center (PFTAC) in
preparation of the balance of payments and national account statistics. Data shortcomings include the coverage and
timeliness of data releases.
National Accounts: National income accounts from (the latest data through FY2010) have been prepared by the
external consultants dating back to FY1997. Some shortcomings remain, for instance, investment, consumption and
savings indicators are not available. The national census was conducted in early 2011.
Employment: Data on employment and wages are available and classified by sectors based on the filings to Social
Security Administration. However, no unemployment data are available.
Price statistics: The new consumer price index (CPI), rebased in 2003Q1, replaced the previous CPI developed in the
1980s. The updated CPI is based on the information from the Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2002,
conducted with assistance from the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Census Bureau.
Government finance: Fiscal data are regularly compiled for budget control, and with the help of the consultants they
are consolidated into a format suitable for analysis. Annual financial audits on the central government and
component units were published. The RMI has recently started to present fiscal data using Government Finance
Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) format.
Monetary statistics: A reporting system has been established for domestic banking institutions on the basis of
monthly reporting forms and guidelines developed by the 1993 STA mission. Even though data are reported by banks
to the Banking Commissioner, they are not published or reported to the Fund. Tables on basic balance sheet items as
well as income and expenses are prepared for inclusion in the Annual Compact Report.
Balance of payments: Through the collaboration with the EPPSO, the external consultants provide annual updates
on the balance of payment statistics. Without mandatory reporting, statistics on exports and imports are incomplete.
Limited data are available on services, factor income, and private transfers, hindering analysis of external sector
developments. Institutional arrangements and cooperation between EPPSO, the government, and other institutions
involved in the compilation and dissemination of external sector statistics are partially in place, but should be further
enhanced. The lack of dedicated staff at EPPSO for the compilation of ESS is an important hindrance to efforts
towards the improvement of Marshall Islands’ balance of payments statistics.
Data Standards and Quality
Does not participate in the IMF’s General Data Dissemination System.
No data ROSC is available.
Reporting to STA (Optional)
No data are reported to STA.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By

Stephan Danninger,
Ranil Salgado, Jeffrey
D. Lewis and Sudhir
Shetty (World Bank)

Prepared by staff of the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank.

The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) indicates that the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) is at
high risk of debt distress. Currently the ratios of present value (PV) of external public and publicly
guaranteed (PPG) debt to GDP, exports and revenues are all above their respective indicative
thresholds, and the PV of the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to remain above its critical threshold
throughout the entire projection period. Although under the baseline some indicators of external debt
distress would fall below their policy-dependent indicative thresholds in FY2014, the thresholds would
be breached under all scenarios with stress tests. Even though short-term risks are mitigated by the
concessionality of most obligations and access to a stable flow of funds from Compact grants, risks
from public contingent liabilities and lack of fiscal buffers call for a bold fiscal reform strategy.

BACKGROUND
1.
RMI’s PPG debt is almost entirely external. According to the limited data available, the
domestic component—held by domestic banks— is only 3 percent of the total.
2.
PPG external debt has been on a downward trajectory since the early 2000s. It declined
from 73.7 percent of GDP in FY2002 to 55.9 percent of GDP at end FY2012. About 64 percent is
central government debt contracted with the Asian Development Bank (AsDB), on concessional
terms; while the remainder is State Owned Enterprise (SOE) government guaranteed debt toward
bilateral development agencies.
3.
Although data availability is scant, private sector external debt is estimated to be small.
The only available data is on deposit money banks’ external liabilities, representing less than
2 percent of GDP. Non-financial corporations’ external debt is expected to be very limited.

THE REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS

4.
The analysis is based on the standard DSA framework for Low Income Countries (LICs).1
Debt sustainability is assessed in relation to policy-dependent debt burden thresholds.2 RMI’s
policies and institutions, as measured by the CPIA, averaged 2.72 over the past 3 years. Hence the
country is classified as a “weak” performer and is assessed against lower thresholds compared to
countries with a stronger governance and policy environment.
5.
The key assumptions of the DSA are consistent with the macroeconomic framework set
out in the 2013 Article IV Report (Box 1). Under the baseline, the fiscal projections envisage an
annual central government deficit of 1.9–3.5 percent of GDP in FY2015–33. The financing gap is
assumed to be financed by a combination of bilateral loans from development partners and
multilateral concessional lending. The DSA is also consistent with the baseline scenario for the
Compact Trust Fund (CTF) outlook presented in Annex 2 of the 2013 Article IV Report and
summarized in Box 2.

PPG EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
6.
Under the baseline scenario, RMI’s external PPG debt trajectory remains above the
debt-burden threshold for a protracted period of time. The Present Value (PV) of external PPG
debt is expected at 43.7 percent of GDP in FY2013, nearly 14 percentage points above the indicative
threshold of 30 percent and is not anticipated to fall below that limit over the projection period. Debt
accumulation is expected to remain positive at least until FY2033 reflecting government deficit
financing. The grant element of new borrowing is expected to increase after FY2018, as the share of
concessional loans from multilateral partners in the financing mix is projected to rise. The PV of
external PPG debt-to-export ratio is currently close to the critical threshold of 100 percent, but is
projected to fall below it in FY2014, thanks to the projected export expansion. The PV of external PPG
debt-to-revenue ratio is also above the indicative threshold of 200 percent, and also expected to fall
below it in FY2014. As most of external PPG debt is on concessional terms, the debt service to export
ratio is already below the relevant threshold, while the debt service to revenue ratio is expected to
remain close to the threshold limit for a protracted period.

1

A 5 percent discount rate is assumed for the analysis.

2

The low-income country debt sustainability framework (LIC-DSF) recognizes that better policies and institutions
allow countries to manage higher levels of debt, and thus the threshold levels for debt indicators are policydependent. In the LIC-DSF, the quality of a country’s policies and institutions is measured by the World Bank’s
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index and classified into three categories: strong, medium, and
weak.

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS

Box 1: Marshall Islands: Macroeconomic Assumptions
GDP growth is projected to decline from 3.2 percent in FY2012 to about 1½ percent over the medium term,
weighted down by the decline in Compact grants and limited private sector expansion.
The GDP deflator is expected to remain about 1 percentage point below CPI inflation growth, consistent with
historical trends. CPI inflation is assumed to approach over the medium-long term the US rate of 2.2 percent.
A fiscal deficit of around 1.9–3.5 percent of GDP is projected until FY2033. Wage bills are assumed to grow in line
with the GDP deflator and also reflect increased social security contributions due to the forthcoming pension
reform.1 Subsidies to SOEs are assumed to decline very moderately in real terms. On the revenue side, Compact
grants in nominal terms are projected to decrease according to schedule, while grants from other donors are
expected to remain stable at an annual average of about 6 percent of GDP. The tax revenues-to-GDP ratio is
assumed to remain broadly unchanged, as the baseline scenario does not incorporate any impact from the tax
reform awaiting approval. Fishing licenses fees are assumed to increase moderately.
External Financing: In the absence of access to the international capital market and a very limited domestic
market, the financing gap is assumed to be financed by a combination of bilateral loans from development
partners and multilateral concessional lending. The annual interest rate on bilateral loans is assumed at 3 percent,
consistent with the rate currently charged to public entities by bilateral development partners. In the medium
term, it is assumed that the RMI will also be eligible for IDA and IDA-like concessional lending. The RMI benefits
from the exception provided to small states that allows them to access IDA resources even though their per capita
GNI exceeds the current IDA threshold of US$1205 (Atlas Methodology).
The Compact Trust Fund (CTF) outlook is summarized in Box 2.
The current account deficit is expected to widen in FY2014, driven by the acquisition of two ships provided by
donors and higher imports for the resumption of infrastructure projects. It is expected to tighten in the medium
term, as the impact of these temporary factors abates, and thanks to some expansion in fish exports and fishing
license fees.

__________
1

If the pension reform were not approved, the fund of the social security administration would be depleted in FY2022,
thereafter imposing on the government an implicit liability of over $12 million (5 percent of GDP) per year, due to the
projected deficits of the social security administration in the absence of reforms. With the reform the system is projected
to record a surplus until FY2022, but further deficits are likely to arise later on.

7.
Stress tests confirm the vulnerability of the debt position relative to GDP, exports and
revenues. In the most extreme shock scenario—with export value growth in FY2014–15 one
standard deviation below the historical average— the PV of the debt to export ratio would only fall
below its relevant threshold at the end of the projection period while the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio
remains above the threshold. The debt to revenue ratio would fall below its relevant threshold not
earlier than FY2024. Under a more benign scenario whereby key macroeconomic variables are
assumed at their historical averages—characterized by positive primary balances— the PV of the
debt-to-GDP, debt-to-exports, and debt-to-revenue ratios would fall below their critical thresholds in
FY2014 or FY2015.

Box 2: Brief Overview of the Compact Trust Fund Under the Baseline Scenario
The Compact Trust Fund (CTF) was established in FY2004 to contribute to the long-term budgetary selfreliance of the RMI after the current Compact Agreement with the US terminates in FY2023. The CTF is
administered by an independent committee formed by representatives from the RMI, USA, and Taiwan Province of
China, and is managed by a professional investment advisor. RMI’s contributions to the CTF have not been steady
over the years and depend on the country’s fiscal position. Contributions have been mainly provided by the US
and, to a lower extent, by Taiwan Province of China. From FY2024 onwards, income returns from the CTF can be
withdrawn to finance budget needs, under some limitations.

1

Under the baseline scenario, the CTF is assumed to yield an average annual return of 6 percent. Under this
assumption, long-term self-sufficiency will not be secured because the real value of the CTF will decline over time,
even though income flows in the years immediately after FY2023 are expected to be sufficient to cover the
2

anticipated reduction in grants. Compact-related grants are expected to be reduced by US$32 million in FY2024,
while CTF’s investment earnings are projected at US$37.6 million. As the gap between investment returns and
grant reduction is expected to be too small to compensate for inflation, the real value of the fund is projected to
start declining in FY2024. These projections are sensitive to the assumption on CTF annual investment returns,
which have been quite volatile in the past.

__________
1

Annual distributions from the CTF, starting in FY2024, can only come from earnings from the previous year up to
a maximum limit (grant assistance amount as of FY2023, fully inflation adjusted). The following analysis does not take
into consideration funds held in the D account, which held US$11.4 million at end-FY2013 and is under a different
governance structure.
2

The baseline scenario assumes no contribution of the RMI into the CTF going forward, due to projected fiscal deficits.

8.
Fiscal consolidation would greatly reduce the risk of debt distress. Under staff’s
recommended fiscal adjustment of 4.5 percent

PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
10.
Total PPG debt follows very closely the dynamics of PPG external debt. The PV of PPG
debt-to-GDP and to revenue ratios is projected to decline very slowly over the projection period. The
debt dynamics is particularly sensitive to growth shocks. Under the most extreme shock, the PV of
debt-to-GDP and debt-to-revenue would remain on an upward trend at least until FY2033.3 Under a
shock to the primary balance, the debt service-to-revenue ratio would also keep growing throughout
the projection period.

THE AUTHORITIES VIEWS
11.
The authorities recognized the risks posed by PPG debt. They saw the need for fiscal
adjustment and improvements in public financial management. They emphasized that a Fiscal
Responsibility and Debt Management Act is before parliament. A comprehensive public financial
management reform, including measures to enhance debt management, has also been developed
and is awaiting cabinet approval.

CONCLUSIONS
12.
The standard DSA framework for LICs suggests that the RMI is at high risk of debt
distress. The baseline scenario indicates that the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio would breach the
threshold throughout the entire projection period. Furthermore, stress tests suggest that RMI’s
external PPG debt trajectory could remain above relevant thresholds for an even more protracted
period of time. RMI’s vulnerability to debt distress is mitigated by a number of factors, as most debt
is on concessional terms and from development partners, the decline in external support from the
Compact will be gradual, sheltering the country from the risk of a sudden stop in foreign financing,
and the government is building up a trust fund that will provide a stable source of funding after
FY2023. On the other hand, vulnerabilities are exacerbated by the lack of fiscal buffers, uncertainty
about prospective SOE losses and by their plans to borrow further with government guarantees,
future contingent liabilities from the social security system even after the approval of the pending
pension reform, and uncertainty on prospective income returns from the CTF. These vulnerabilities
call for an immediate and bold fiscal adjustment strategy.

3

The scenario in which variables are at their historical levels is regarded as too benign and has been omitted since it
generates negative debt due to historical primary surpluses.

2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly
assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Revenues are defined exclusing of grants.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Press Release No. 14/41
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 3, 2014

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of the
Marshall Islands
On January 8, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with the Republic of the Marshall Islands.
The Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) is a small, isolated and disperse country, highly
dependent on external aid. GDP growth picked up in fiscal year (FY) 2012 (fiscal year,
ending September 30) to 3.2 percent, lifted by a surge in fishery output and higher copra and
coconut oil production. In FY2013, however, growth is expected to have slowed to 0.8
percent, dragged down by delays in the implementation of infrastructure projects.
Meanwhile, inflation is estimated to have eased from 4.3 percent in FY2012 to 1.6 percent in
FY2013, thanks to subdued global commodity prices. The fiscal balance slipped into deficit
in FY2012, and is expected to stay at -0.8 percent of GDP in FY2013, driven by large
transfers to poorly performing state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The current account deficit
including official transfers remained elevated at 8.1 percent of GDP in FY2012, as high
imports more than offset a pickup in exports and an increase in receipts from fishing license
fees. Lending conditions have remained tight, with the banking sector providing only limited
credit to businesses.
Although the RMI’s economic performance is expected to strengthen in FY2014, prospects
over the medium to long-term are less sanguine. In FY2014, GDP growth is projected to
rebound to 3.2 percent, driven by the resumption of Compact-funded infrastructure projects.
In the longer term, however, growth is expected to slow to around 1½ percent, weighted
down by the scheduled reduction in Compact grants and limited private sector growth. While
the fiscal deficit is expected to decline in FY2014 thanks to one-off revenues, it is projected
to widen again to around 2 percent of GDP in FY2015, and persist in the medium-term,
driven by high subsidies to SOEs and increased expenditures for social security contributions
for public sector employees from the upcoming pension reform.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that the Republic of the Marshall Islands’s recent output volatility
and external imbalances reflect its narrow productive and export base, and vulnerability to
external shocks. Medium-term growth prospects are constrained due to the unique challenges
of small, remote island economies and the decline in Compact grants. Directors underscored
the need for measures to promote fiscal and debt sustainability and foster private sector
development and economic diversification.
Directors called for the implementation of a bold, but balanced fiscal consolidation strategy
to secure long-term fiscal sustainability and build policy buffers. They welcomed the
authorities’ plans to achieve a balanced budget in FY2014 and future surpluses through cuts
in electricity and travel expenses and moderation of the public sector wage bill. They also
encouraged swift approval and implementation of the pending tax reform, designed to
promote efficiency and equity and boost tax compliance.
Directors stressed the need to address fiscal risks as part of a comprehensive adjustment
strategy. They called for containment of subsidies to state-owned enterprises and their
comprehensive restructuring with the assistance of the World Bank and Asian Development
Bank. Directors also recommended parliamentary approval of the social security reform bill.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ initiatives to enhance public financial management and
recommended the rapid approval and implementation of reforms to strengthen resource
allocation and the medium-term budgeting framework. They looked forward to parliamentary
approval of the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Management Act.
While recognizing the challenges posed by RMI’s remoteness and small size, Directors
underscored the importance of promoting diversified, inclusive growth through
improvements to the regulatory framework and the business climate, including in the areas of
investor protection and land reform. They recommended enhanced collaboration with
development partners, the private sector and neighboring countries to upgrade both human
capital and infrastructure.
Directors emphasized the need to strengthen the autonomy, capacity and supervisory
authority of the Banking Commission over both bank and nonbank financial institutions, with
a view to improving financial surveillance. They also called for efforts to address
shortcomings in the Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism
(AML-CFT) framework.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any

Statement by Jong-Won Yoon, Executive Director, and Kyounghwan Moon,
Advisor to the Executive Director of the Republic of the Marshall Islands
January 8, 2014
The Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI)’ authorities wish to express their appreciation to the
mission team for their constructive policy consultation and the well-structured report. Due to the
unique challenges of micro states such as extreme remoteness, small population, dispersion and
narrow production base, the RMI has undergone difficulties in achieving self-sustaining
economy, and has relied on external supports. The authorities appreciate the continued support
from the international community, particularly from the United States, in providing financial
support through the Compact of Free Association.
The RMI authorities are broadly in line with the staff report, which properly identifies the
country’s economic status and highlights the need for securing fiscal sustainability and boosting
private sector development. They will continue their efforts to address the challenges and rebuild
policy buffers for enhancing economic resilience and promoting potential growth.
Recent Economic Development
Economic growth of the RMI has fluctuated over the past few years, showing its
vulnerability to external shocks. Real GDP growth, which picked up by 3.2 percent in FY2012
from 0.6 percent in FY2011, is projected to slow down to below one percent in FY2013 due to
delays in project implementation of Compact infrastructure projects. As those projects start to
resume, growth is expected to reach above three percent in FY2014.
Risks to growth are tilted to the downside. As staff noted, main sources of domestic risks
include further delays in project implementation, insufficient fiscal consolidation and contingent
liabilities in the public sector. The danger from natural disasters and commodity price shocks also
pose considerable risks to the outlook, reinforcing the importance of maintaining large policy
buffers to absorb shocks. There are also upside risks, such as bold implementation of structural
reforms and better prospects of copra production from new ships and a new copra oil refinery.
The authorities are committed to their continued efforts for a gradual transition toward
self sustainability as the Compact comes to an end in FY2023. Last December, they reviewed
the progress of the RMI’s National Strategic Plan, which sets goals for sustainable development
of the country. No transfers from the authorities were made to the Compact Trust Fund (CTF) in
FY2013 due to fiscal deficits. Nevertheless, the authorities acknowledged the importance of
securing long-term self sufficiency of the CTF, which will be a source of revenue after FY2023.
Fiscal Sustainability
The authorities agree with staff that considerable fiscal adjustment is crucial while taking
into account the right balance between consolidation needs and growth implications.
A fiscal adjustment of 4.5 percent of GDP by FY2018 is not an easy task, but the authorities fully
recognize the need for fiscal consolidation, noting that further delay would make it difficult to
achieve sustainable growth. They aim to reach a balanced budget in FY2014 from the

2
consecutive deficits of 0.8 percent in the previous two years. Fiscal position would be further
improved once the pending tax and SOE reform bills are passed in the Parliament this year. The
authorities will continue to freeze the nominal wages so as to reduce the public-private sector
wage gaps over time, which are partly due to the differences in skills between workers.
Tax reform will contribute to enhancing efficiency and compliance in the tax system. The
purpose of this comprehensive tax reform bill, which is under discussion in the Parliament, is to
modernize the tax system by broadening the tax base and strengthening tax administration
through measures such as introducing a consumption tax and establishing an independent
Customs and Revenue Authority. The authorities will continue their efforts for approval and
implementation of this significant bill.
The authorities are actively working to implement SOE reforms. Liberalizing the
telecommunication sector is under discussion in the Parliament and an initial study has been
completed on the feasibility of privatizing the airline sector. The authorities note that SOEs have
become a substantial burden on the government, and reassure that they would push forward the
SOE bill to be passed in the Parliament, which contains international best practices of good
governance, commercial test and less government involvement. In restructuring SOEs, the
authorities will give proper consideration to the impact on the most vulnerable people, who
depend on the services of SOEs.
The authorities are exploring ways to reform the social security system to secure its
sustainability. It is estimated that the social security fund will be depleted by 2022 under the
current system and this may result in a considerable contingent fiscal risk. In this sense, the
authorities have drafted a reform bill, which is pending the Parliament approval. The bill aims to
cut current benefits by 22 percent and to increase contribution and retirement age, thereby
producing $3 million/year surplus. The authorities are also considering converting to a defined
benefit scheme and, in this regard, the Fund’s technical assistance would be appreciated in this
area.
Strengthening public financial management is another important policy priority for the
government. The authorities have worked with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the
Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) in preparing a roadmap for fiscal prudence
and public debt management. This would improve allocation of resources and enhance the
medium-term budgeting framework.
Financial Sector Development
The authorities agree to the need for strengthening regulatory framework. The financial
sector remains focused on consumer lending and the authorities are aware of the need for
vigilance in monitoring high levels of household debt. They are also considering bringing in
medium and small moneylenders under the formal regulatory framework.
Enhancing the capacity of the Banking Commission is also important for financial stability.
The role of the Banking Commission has been expanded for on/off-site examinations of banks

3
and the authorities welcome staff’s recommendation to increase the Commission’s resources and
to put the Marshall Islands Development Bank under the supervision.
Boosting Private Sector Development
Private sector could play a more dynamic role as the engine of economic growth. The
contribution of private sector on economic growth has increased to 29.5 percent (FY2010–
FY2012) from 26.7 percent (FY1997–FY1999), reflecting the rise of the fisheries sector. The
authorities will continue to take further steps to improve business environment and to encourage
entrepreneurship in achieving a self-sustaining business sector. The fisheries sector would
continue to be a source of growth and business development in niche/eco-tourism could also be
a profitable one.
The authorities will continue their efforts for easing the obstacles to private sector
development. They emphasize that there were some progress in registering land and that they
will tackle further the land ownership issue, while noting that this will take considerable time and
effort due to the complex nature of the Marshallese land tenure system. Ensuring proper
infrastructure and legislative framework will help reduce costs in running businesses and
providing a level playing field to investors will attract foreign direct investment.
