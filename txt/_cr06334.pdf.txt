Cape Verde
Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation and
Request for a Three-Year Policy Support Instrument
Prepared by the African Department
(In consultation with other Departments)
Approved by David Nellor and Anthony Boote
July 14, 2006
●

Discussions. Discussions for the 2006 Article IV consultation and on a medium-term economic program
that could be supported by a three-year Policy Support Instrument (PSI) were held in Praia on
April 28–May 16, 2006. The team comprised Mr. MacFarlan (head), Mr. Maehle, Ms. Karpowicz,
Mr. Franken (all AFR), and Mr. Saab (MFD).

●

Fund relations. The 2005 Article IV consultation and final review of Cape Verde’s three-year PRGF
arrangement were concluded in May 2005. The PRGF arrangement ended on July 31, 2005. Cape Verde’s
use of Fund resources stood at SDR 8.64 million (90 percent of quota) on December 31, 2005. Cape Verde
has accepted the obligations under Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement and maintains a fixed
exchange rate that is free of restrictions in the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions.

●

Last Board discussions. Directors commended the authorities for Cape Verde’s strong policy performance
during the PRGF arrangement, which helped correct the imbalances that followed the 2001 elections.
Directors urged the authorities to consolidate the progress made in recent years by maintaining a sound
fiscal stance, supporting exchange rate stability through further accumulation of international reserves, and
pushing ahead with their structural reform agenda.

●

Recent economic developments. Economic and policy performance remains strong. Growth in 2005 was
nearly 6 percent, fiscal restraint was maintained through the recent elections, and international reserves are
accumulating. Pass-through of high international oil prices will, however, result in lower growth in 2006
and substantially higher inflation.

●

Objectives of the PSI. The PSI program seeks to support the development strategy the authorities set out
in the PRSP through policies to reduce macroeconomic risks, provide a margin of safety against exogenous
shocks, and address the prospect of a longer-term decline in highly concessional external support. Priority
measures the authorities outline in their request for a PSI are (i) reducing public debt; (ii) building up
international reserves; (iii) rationalizing the system of tax exemptions; (iv) implementing the automatic
mechanism to adjust electricity and water tariffs; (v) improving public financial management; and
(vi) strengthening capacities and regulation in the financial sector, especially for the offshore financial
center.

●

Currency: The Cape Verde escudo has been pegged to the euro at a rate of CVEsc 110.3 per €1 since
1999.

●

Upon approval of the PSI, Cape Verde would resume the 24-month cycle for Article IV consultations.

●

Publication. The authorities have agreed to publish the staff report and their request for a three-year PSI.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Cape Verde’s economic and policy performance has strengthened significantly in recent
years, supported by reforms pursued under the country’s first Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) arrangement. International reserves have increased, adding credibility to the
exchange rate peg to the euro. The fiscal position has improved and, in a marked break from
the past, fiscal restraint held firm through the recent elections. Privatization and other
structural reforms are moving ahead. Reflecting the improved policy environment, growth
has averaged around 5 percent since 2000, supported by strong inflows of external financing
from both private and official sources.
The Article IV consultation considered the key issues that will shape the economic and
policy environment in the years ahead. With the goal of accelerating growth and reducing
poverty within a stable macroeconomic environment, policy priorities include safeguarding
the exchange rate peg, managing fiscal pressures and risks, and strengthening public sector
management. The authorities and staff agreed that specific emphasis also needs to be placed
on developing human capital, improving the business climate, supporting financial sector
development, and ensuring adequate supplies of energy.
The Article IV consultation formed the backdrop for discussions on a government
program that could be supported by the IMF through the Policy Support Instrument.
Cape Verde appears well-suited to a PSI: it has largely achieved macroeconomic stability; it
does not need or want financial assistance from the Fund; but the authorities would like to
stay in close dialogue with the Fund—both to support policy development and to signal to
the international community its commitment to sound policies.
To help Cape Verde prepare for the development opportunities and challenges it faces
in the coming years, policies pursued under the PSI would focus on:
•

Supporting the exchange rate peg by increasing foreign reserve coverage and
strengthening the operation of monetary policy.

•

Creating fiscal space to manage potential pressures on spending or access to
concessional external financing by, for example, reducing government debt as a share
of GDP, better prioritizing expenditures, and rationalizing tax exemptions.

•

Strengthening public sector management through measures to improve capacities and
procedures for budget management, and through civil service reforms.

•

Addressing risks to growth and to the fiscal position arising in public service
enterprises, including by improving the regulatory framework for the energy sector and
restructuring the national airline.

•

Improving the business environment, in part by reducing administrative barriers,
increasing labor market flexibility, and strengthening vocational training.

•

Ensuring that financial sector development—both among domestic banks and in the
rapidly growing offshore financial sector—takes place within an institutional
framework that is in line with international best practices.

5
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The cornerstones of Cape Verde’s economic strategy are sustained
macroeconomic stability and structural reforms in support of private sector-led growth.
Reforms pursued under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement that
ended last year focused on fiscal consolidation. Public spending was restrained and revenue
collection improved to correct the severe macroeconomic imbalances that had emerged in
2000–01. With the strengthening of the fiscal position since 2001, Cape Verde has built up
its international reserves and grown in policy credibility. As a result, Cape Verde has
experienced sizable inflows of external finance for investment and development, solid
growth averaging around 5 percent since 2001, low inflation, and a reduction in poverty.
Cape Verde was one of the first countries to receive support from the Millennium Challenge
Account (MCA) in 2005 and is eligible for further MCA support under a new category
created for lower middle income countries.1
2.
To underpin and signal its commitment to sound economic policies, the
government has requested a three-year Policy Support Instrument (PSI). The authorities
note that macroeconomic stability has been achieved; IMF financial resources are not
needed; but the government wants to stay in close dialogue with the Fund as it continues to
strengthen the country’s economic and policy performance. The government also points out
that Cape Verde continues to face large development challenges. Despite recent progress,
unemployment and poverty are still high; and because the country consists of many small
islands, improving infrastructure, public services, and other aspects of sustainable growth and
poverty reduction is inherently slow and costly. To address these and other challenges,
Cape Verde will continue to rely heavily on external support.
3.
The program to be supported by the PSI would provide a coherent economic
policy framework for the government’s medium-term development objectives. In
particular—as outlined in the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
(MEFP)—the program is designed to enhance the sustainability of growth and development
by maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment and moving forward with structural
reforms. Specific attention is given to reducing fiscal risks and giving Cape Verde a margin
of safety to protect the economy against exogenous shocks. The macroeconomic framework
would also help prepare Cape Verde for the prospect that—as GDP per capita continues to
rise—the country’s access to highly concessional external finance may fall.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.
The Cape Verde economy continues to perform well, although it is now
experiencing with a lag the impact of higher international oil prices. Growth is estimated
to have picked up to nearly 6 percent in 2005, supported by increased private investment—
1

The 2005 grant is for US$110 million (around 11 percent of GDP), to be spread over 4–5 years. This is being
directed mainly toward infrastructure projects, including port development and rural irrigation, and capacity
building in public administration.

6
mainly for tourism-related construction—and a higher execution rate of public investment.
Prices fell for much of 2003–05 but have recently increased sharply: the CPI rose by
7.4 percent in the year to May 2006, mainly reflecting higher food prices—driven by
temporary shortfalls in the supply of fish, fresh fruits and vegetables, and imported
sugar—and increases in regulated petroleum prices. Excluding these factors, the CPI
increased by only 0.6 percent (Figure 1). The CPI is expected to increase further after the
June 2006 adjustment of electricity and water tariffs (see below). In the year to April 2006,
the real effective exchange rate depreciated by 0.1 percent, primarily due to changes in the
euro-dollar exchange rate (Figure 2).

5.
In a marked break from the past, the authorities maintained a prudent fiscal
stance through the recent election cycle (Figure 3). Notwithstanding strong domestic
revenues and prudent spending, however, the fiscal deficit reached 5.1 percent of GDP in
2005, mainly reflecting an increase in the provision of concessional external loans and a
delay in the disbursement of budget grants. Still, sales of government financial and
nonfinancial assets enabled net domestic borrowing, excluding for arrears clearance, to
decline to -0.2 percent of GDP. As a result, domestic debt (including arrears, but net of
deposits) fell slightly although, at around 33 percent of GDP at end-2005, it was still close to
the level before the domestic debt reduction operation in the late 1990s. While exceptionally
low interest rates have contained domestic interest payments, other spending components are
beginning to create fiscal pressures. In particular, the government wage bill has continued to
increase, recently because of promotions and hiring of security personnel and teachers
toward the end of 2005.

6.
The external current account deficit fell from over 14 percent of GDP in 2004 to
4.6 percent in 2005. Growth in exports and remittances was stronger, and a broader market
base has allowed importers to draw on cheaper and more diversified sources of supplies. As a
result, exports of goods and services grew by 20 percent from 2004 to 2005, while imports
grew by only 0.5 percent in nominal terms. Reflecting the improvements in the current
account, international reserves rose from 2.4 months of prospective imports in 2004 to
3.0 months in December 2005.
7.
The excess reserves of commercial banks have increased significantly because of
strong net foreign exchange inflows, a lower reserve requirement,2 and a slowdown in the
growth of private sector credit in the first part of 2005 (Figure 4). Against this backdrop,
Treasury bill rates declined sharply from 5.0 percent in April 2005 to 2.0 percent in
April 2006; this is significantly below deposit rates. Actual lending rates have also markedly
declined. Concerned about the potentially adverse effect on their deposit base, and emigrant
deposits in particular, banks have only marginally lowered deposit rates. They have reacted
to growth of excess liquidity by sharply increasing their holdings of foreign assets and
pursuing domestic lending opportunities more aggressively, particularly consumer lending.
The Bank of Cape Verde (BCV) has started to sell central bank securities to partially absorb
excess liquidity.
8.
Financial services have continued to develop. There has been rapid growth in the
offshore financial sector, which now comprises five operating banks (several others are
licensed but not yet operational). The payment system has been modernized with the creation
of a network of automatic cash counters and expansion of international credit card services;
and the Cape Verde stock exchange has been revitalized. Total banking sector assets have
grown by 20 percent since end-2004 to reach over 90 percent of nominal GDP; growth is
heavily concentrated in lending to the real estate and construction sectors. Emigrant deposits
continue to play a critical role, accounting for over 40 percent of total deposits. Because of
tightened interest spreads and excess liquidity, the profitability of domestic commercial
banks suffered significantly in 2005, although prudential indicators remain sound
(see Table 6).
9.
Structural reforms are moving forward. The government has selected a new
management team to restructure the national airline TACV in preparation for privatization;
bidding is getting under way for privatizing the port operator, ENAPOR; and the remaining
four companies on the government’s privatization agenda are expected to be either liquidated
or sold later in 2006. Following the 2003 Country Financial Accountability Assessment
(CFAA), the authorities have completed a detailed action plan to build capacity in public
finance management, have established a civil servants database, and are preparing to reform
the number, allocation, and remuneration of civil servants. They are also pursuing a wide
range of measures related to Cape Verde’s accession to the WTO—expected to be voted on
by WTO members in July 2006—including a proposal to further reduce external tariffs.
2

The primary reserve requirement was reduced from 19 percent to 18 percent of deposits in November 2004, to
17 percent in June 2005, and to 15 percent on March 1, 2006.

Steps have been taken to clear the backlog of government accounts. Draft
accounts for 1998–2003 have been submitted to parliament for transmittal to the Court of
Auditors (TdC), and provisional quarterly accounts for 2004 and 2005 have been submitted
to parliament. Despite this progress, concerns remain about capacity constraints in the TdC
and the Inspectorate General of Finance, and about large statistical discrepancies in the
provisional quarterly accounts. Actions to address these concerns are part of the
government’s new program.
11.
An action plan has been prepared to settle public cross-debt. A recent study found
total net central government debt to the municipalities, the social security fund (INPS), and
public and parapublic enterprises of CVEsc 5.9 billion. The government has agreed to settle
CVEsc 4.8 billion (equivalent to 5.5 percent of GDP) of this; the rest is disputed.
12.
There has been progress in addressing the lingering conflict between the
government and the majority private shareholders of Electra (see Box 1). After the
government decided to eliminate fuel subsidies—including those for electricity and water
generation (by desalinization)—starting June 1, 2006, water tariffs were increased by
13.3 percent and electricity tariffs by 25.4 percent at the end of May. The autonomous
economic regulatory authority (ARE) has signaled its commitment to fully implement an
automatic mechanism for adjusting these tariffs to ensure that electricity and water prices
reflect input cost changes and provide incentives for efficiency improvements.
Box 1. Update on Electra
The government and Electra’s private majority shareholders reached agreement in June 2005
on the tariff deficit that the government owed to Electra because electricity and water tariffs
were not adjusted in 2000–02.1 The settlement of US$10 million is being paid to Electra in
five equal annual installments starting in 2006. Additional outstanding government liabilities
to Electra of about US$5 million comprise:
•

US$2.5 million for unpaid electricity and water bills of central government, parastatals,
and other public entities

•

US$2.5 million for VAT refunds and revenue losses following the introduction of the
VAT. Electra was required to pay VAT without any adjustment to the tariff structure.

The June 2005 agreement also addressed the recapitalization of Electra. The government has
recently paid its share in this recapitalization, amounting to US$3 million.
Municipalities have built up considerable arrears with Electra for their consumption of
electricity and water, a result of weaknesses in financial discipline and their small revenue
base. Not including their share in the recapitalization of the company, which amounts to
US$1 million, municipalities’ debt to Electra is believed to be around US$3 million. The
central government is urging municipalities to clear their arrears and, as noted in the MEFP, is
taking steps to ensure they remain current in electricity and water payments.

III. ACCOMPLISHMENTS UNDER THE PRGF ARRANGEMENT
13.
When Cape Verde’s first PRGF-supported program was put in place, the
country was facing severe macroeconomic imbalances in the wake of the 2001 elections.
Since then, economic and policy performance has been strong. The overall results under the
program were considerably better than anticipated and the country has been receptive to the
Fund’s policy advice. Solid growth, supported by strong official and private capital inflows,
has significantly alleviated poverty since the early 1990s. As a result, Cape Verde is about to
graduate to middle-income status3 and is on target to reach most of the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) before 2015—including the target of cutting poverty in half.
Reaching the MDGs in areas such as health, education, and sanitation will, however, place
major pressures on public spending to strengthen infrastructure and the volume and quality of
services.
14.
The lynchpin of the economic strategy under the PRGF arrangement was the
recognition that disorder in public finances and debt overhang fundamentally
constrained policies and required a multiyear fiscal consolidation. The strengthening of
the fiscal position since 2001 has supported a substantial buildup in international reserves.
Improved policy credibility has helped attract increased private investment, sizable inflows
of official aid and remittances, and emigrant deposits.
15.
Important progress has also been made with structural reforms. A major focus
has been on regularizing the public sector’s relationship with large state-owned and public
service enterprises to reduce fiscal risks and improve the efficiency of services. From forty a
decade ago, only six enterprises remain on the government’s privatization agenda, which
should be completed in 2006–07.
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS: SETTING THE STAGE FOR THE PSI
16.
As backdrop for discussions on a PSI, the 2006 Article IV consultation
considered the key challenges that will shape the economic and policy environment in
the years ahead. These challenges include:
•

accelerating growth and reducing poverty, while consolidating macroeconomic
stability;

•

safeguarding the exchange rate regime;

•

managing fiscal pressures and risks through, e.g., creation of fiscal space against future
contingencies and reduction of central government debt; and

•

strengthening public sector management, notably by improving capacities for financial
management and pushing ahead with comprehensive civil service reform.

3

Cape Verde will graduate from the group of less advanced countries to middle income status (as defined by
the United Nations) in 2008, following a UN resolution to this effect in December 2004.

12
The government’s strategy for tackling these challenges is set out in its Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) and the recent PRSP Progress Report.4 The main elements of this
strategy are summarized below and then brought together in the discussion of the specific
objectives and criteria of the PSI program.

Box 2. IMF-World Bank Structural Conditionality
The IMF and World Bank cooperate closely on Cape Verde’s structural reform program.
Program design and the conditionality of the Bank and Fund are fully consistent.
IMF Conditionality
Under the PRGF arrangement
• Conditionality was aimed at deepening fiscal consolidation; strengthening monetary policy;

A. Accelerating Growth and Reducing Poverty
17.
The new government’s economic strategy for 2006–11 aims at substantially
increasing GDP growth over the medium to long term to support significant reductions
in unemployment and poverty. Staff agreed that Cape Verde’s growth prospects seem
favorable, despite higher oil prices and the country’s limited natural resources. Strong foreign
interest and investment in tourism-related activities, coupled with continued public
investment in infrastructure, provide a solid base for accelerating growth and reducing
poverty. There was full agreement on the need to maintain stable and credible
macroeconomic policies—as emphasized in the program to be supported under the PSI—to
help ensure a continuing favorable environment for investment growth and, more generally,
for economic and social development.
18.
Recognizing that there is not necessarily a direct link between tourism-related
investment and stronger economic growth, the staff and authorities considered the
policy priorities for ensuring that the benefits of tourism development spread into
broad-based growth of domestic incomes and employment. It was agreed that
improvements in domestic capacities were crucial, supported in many cases by stronger
regulatory frameworks. Priorities (often inter-related) are to:
•

Improve the development and deployment of labor resources. As part of the general
strategy for human capital development elaborated in Cape Verde’s PRSP, the
authorities are working to enhance vocational training—including training targeted to
tourism-related industries. While safeguarding working conditions, the government is
also planning to amend the labor code to enhance the economy’s flexibility and
capacity to create jobs.

•

Strengthen the business climate. One aspect of this is to support the development of
small and medium-enterprises, including those that could provide ancillary services to
the main tourism-related development. Besides its reforms in the labor market and
financial sector, the government is reducing the administrative costs of doing business.
“One-stop” facilities now being set up will make it possible to complete online all
administrative procedures for registering and opening a business within 24 hours.
Business development will also be supported by regulatory reforms the authorities are
undertaking to liberalize the telecom market and develop transportation services.

•

Support financial sector development. The authorities are endeavoring to identify and
remove obstacles to private sector credit growth and reduce the cost of capital. These
efforts include amending the regulatory and legislative framework to protect lenders,
strengthening banks’ capacity to provide project-based lending, and supporting access
to credit for small and medium-sized enterprises. They also see development of the
offshore financial sector as a means of expanding financial services and expertise.
Noting, however, the risks that can arise in the offshore sector, the authorities agreed
with staff on the need for regulatory reforms to ensure that this development takes place
within a sound institutional framework that is in line with international best practice
(see below).

14
•

Ensure adequate and reliable supplies of energy and water. Service quantity and
quality has been uncertain, given the long-standing difficult relations between the
government and Electra. The staff argued that improving the regulatory framework in
the energy sector would help resolve these difficulties—through, for instance, full and
transparent implementation of the automatic mechanism for adjusting electricity and
water tariffs. In particular, application of this mechanism would help provide a more
stable and predictable environment for much-needed investment to improve the volume
and efficiency of energy supply. The staff supported the authorities’ strategy of
promoting conservation and alternative energy sources to reduce Cape Verde’s
dependence on oil imports.
B. Safeguarding the Exchange Rate Regime

19.
The fixed exchange rate has served Cape Verde well as an anchor for economic
stability. There are no indications of any misalignment of the exchange rate emerging: the
real effective exchange rate has depreciated by more than 6 percent over the last three years,
in line with changes in the terms of trade in goods (Figure 2); export growth in goods and
tourism services is strong; and foreign direct investment is booming. To ensure that the
country remains competitive despite natural cost disadvantages, the authorities view as
essential the need to maintain macroeconomic stability and low inflation. They agreed with
staff that wage growth, even with the temporarily higher “headline” inflation, needs to be
kept in line with productivity growth and underlying inflation. They also agreed that
competitiveness and growth need to be supported by increased labor flexibility and
productivity, trade liberalization, and development of higher-priced niche products in
tourism.
20.
While the longer-term possibility of hardening the peg has been considered, the
authorities saw no current need to move in this direction. In their view, the main benefit
from hardening the peg would be to increase the pressure for further improvements in fiscal
discipline, thereby enhancing investor confidence. However, current policies are already
headed in this direction and are supporting further increases in foreign reserves.
21.
Current foreign reserve coverage may be adequate to meet routine economic
shocks and uncertainties, but the authorities would like to increase reserves further to
better buffer against shocks. Supporting this objective, the staff noted that further
liberalization of the capital account would also require an increase in reserves (see Box 3).
The new government program envisages an increase in reserve coverage by 2011 to about
4 months of current-year imports of goods and services. Such an outcome would bring
reserves closer to the level of the monetary base, which would in principle allow the
monetary system to be converted into a currency board at any time.

15
Box 3. Assessing the Adequacy of International Reserves
Assessing the adequacy of a country’s international reserves requires judgments based on multiple
indicators and country specific factors. The main indicators to consider are:
•

Import coverage: Coverage of three or four months of prospective imports was in the past judged
sufficient. It should be larger if official and private capital flows are large or volatile.

•

Short-term debt coverage: Reserves should cover at least the country’s one-year foreign liabilities
(on a remaining maturity basis, and both domestic and foreign currency-denominated).

•

Base money coverage: Reserves at least as high as the monetary base would in principle allow the
system to be converted into a currency board at any time.

Country-specific factors for Cape Verde that support the case for further buildup of reserves are:
•

The high dependence on capital inflows: official aid inflows are about 10–13 percent of GDP,
remittances and other private transfers about 20 percent of GDP, and increases in emigrant deposits
about 3–5 percent of GDP.

•

The large stock of emigrant deposits—around 30 percent of GDP and 40 percent of broad money—
with unknown interest rate sensitivity.

•

A history of high volatility and periods of precariously low reserve coverage.

•

Currently high excess reserves in the banking system.

Country-specific factors that mitigate the need for further reserve accumulation are:
•

A Portuguese exchange rate support credit line of 27.5 million euros, with extension up to 45 million
euros if Cape Verde provides collateral.

•

The existence of capital account restrictions.

•

A likely high correlation between foreign exchange inflows and outflows (e.g., through aid-funded
imports for infrastructure projects, imports for tourists, goods for processing, and imports of goods for
procurement in ports).

C. Managing Fiscal Pressures and Risks
22.
While the authorities have made substantial progress with fiscal consolidation in
recent years, improving both expenditure prioritization and revenue collection, further
efforts are needed to prepare for potential pressures on the budget. For example, fiscal
pressures may arise from:
•

government liabilities to the public pension system as this develops and matures;

•

growth in demand for health, education, training, and other public services;

•

less access to highly concessional external support as Cape Verde moves into middleincome status; and

•

associated with the last point, the prospective need for increased domestic capital
participation in public investment projects.

23.
The authorities and staff agreed that medium-term fiscal policy should be
oriented toward the creation of fiscal space to prepare for these and other
contingencies. Such space (see below) would be generated in part by reducing government
debt as a share of GDP, which would both lower interest expenditures and provide an
additional buffer against economic shocks.
D. Strengthening Public Sector Management
24.
The authorities are pursuing a number of structural reforms to strengthen the
country’s fiscal position. These include measures to strengthen capacities and procedures
for formulating, executing, monitoring, and auditing the budget. Implementing the Country
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) action plan and the medium-term expenditure
framework (MTEF) will help. As mentioned, reforms are also under way to improve civil
service capacities and productivity within the constraints of the wage bill. Departmental
staffing levels are to be rationalized and wage structures reformed to ensure that government
compensation is competitive without putting pressure on private sector wages.
V. POLICY DISCUSSIONS: THE MEDIUM-TERM POLICY FRAMEWORK
25.
Drawing on the discussion of medium-term prospects and challenges, the
authorities and staff reached understanding ad referendum on a three-year policy
framework that could be supported by the PSI. Details of the proposed program are set
out in the attached MEFP. The economic and policy considerations underlying the program
include:
•

projections for economic growth and inflation for 2006–09;

•

the rate of increase in foreign exchange coverage;

•

the relative role of fiscal and monetary policy in supporting the reserve buildup and,
associated with this;

•

the formulation of the fiscal anchor and medium-term fiscal strategy;

17
•

the design of the monetary policy operational framework; and

•

structural measures to support fiscal objectives, reduce economic and financial risks,
and enhance growth.

however, averaging
6–7 percent in 2007–09. Foreign direct investment (FDI) is expected to remain strong,
although cautiously assumed to grow at a more measured pace over the medium term; budget
grants and loan assumptions are based on identified donor commitments; and the current
levels of project assistance (apart from MCA-related activity) and private remittances as a
share of GDP are assumed to continue over the medium term before gradually tapering off as
residents’ income level rises. There is also upside potential in the growth outlook—for
example, if FDI continues to increase at the same rate as is projected for 2006 to 2007 (which
is based on firm investment intentions).

with regard to the wage bill, to be
respected. In the projected scenario,
the 12-month inflation rate would fall

and food prices return to more normal
levels, as was the case in past episodes

of temporary shortfalls in supply of fish and fresh fruits and vegetables (Figure 5). Mediumto long-term inflation would then remain in line with inflation in the euro area. After
declining in 2005, the current account deficit is projected to rise—largely reflecting higher
imports of capital goods driven by MCA projects and private investment.
28.
The medium-term program aims to increase reserve coverage further, by
0.1 months of prospective imports per year (equivalent to about ½ percent of GDP). In the
authorities’ view, which the staff shares, this goal should balance the need for strengthening
reserve coverage against monetary and fiscal constraints, along with the desirability of
keeping lending rates low to support credit expansion and private sector growth.
29.
Fiscal restraint will be necessary to reach the reserve target, as there is only
limited scope for monetary policy to effect a long-term, sustainable buildup in reserves.
The fixed exchange rate regime implies that the domestic interest rate spread over the euro
area must ultimately reflect the market risk premium and transaction costs. Moreover,
containing domestically financed government expenditures would be the prime policy tool
for achieving the reserve target. This arises because the overall fiscal deficit largely reflects
the provision of external aid and its grant-loan distribution, and the demand for foreign
exchange from imports induced by aid-financed expenditures is broadly matched by aid
inflows.
30.
Containing government domestic borrowing, moreover, will help the
government reach its objective of lowering public debt. The program aims to lower the
central government debt ratio to below 70 percent of GDP by 2009. This includes reducing
government domestic debt to close to 20 percent of GDP by 2009, down from around
33 percent at end-2005. Anchored on this medium-term target for domestic debt, net
domestic borrowing would be the operational target and assessment criterion under the PSI;
borrowing would be measured exclusive of arrears clearance, to support the rapid elimination
of arrears.5
31.
The targeted debt reduction is consistent with further growth of capital spending
and high-priority current spending. Moreover, the program would create significant fiscal
space—growing to around 1.7 percent of GDP by 2009—for additional priority spending, tax
cuts, or further debt reduction. This fiscal space is created through:
•

mobilizing domestic revenue as recent improvements in the tax system and tax
administration take hold and efforts to streamline tax incentives and exemptions bear
fruit;

•

improving expenditure prioritization in line with the PRSP;

•

moderately scaling back the wage bill as a share of GDP to its 2005 level;

•

ending petroleum subsidies, as announced in the 2006 budget; and

5

This approach also ensures that the borrowing target is consistent with the definition of domestic debt, which
is measured net of deposits but including arrears.

19
•

lowering interest costs as debt declines.

32.
The program allows for a limited amount of well-targeted government or
government-guaranteed external borrowing that does not meet the full 35 percent
concessionality threshold, if fully concessional financing of essential projects is not
available. The US$20 million cap on less concessional borrowing is in line with the PRGF
arrangement, where this provision enabled the government to borrow on terms that fell short
of the 35 percent threshold. This borrowing was used to finance important health, education,
and infrastructure projects, including the new international airport in Praia. Cape Verde’s
long-term debt sustainability (see Appendix II) would not be jeopardized if highly
concessional loans are below the baseline assumptions and the resulting gap is covered by a
limited amount of less concessional borrowing.6
33.
As in the past, medium-term monetary policy will be geared to safeguarding the
exchange rate peg with the euro as an anchor for low inflation. Consistent with this, the
monetary policy framework has at times functioned similarly to a currency board: changes in
the foreign reserves at the central bank have been the main source of variations in the money
supply and, at least until recently, the BCV has been fairly passive in using the limited
monetary policy instruments at its disposal to control liquidity. Fiscal dominance is absent;
the government is required by law to settle any outstanding balance on its overdraft account
in the BCV at the end of each year.
34.
Nevertheless, periodic upsurges in excess liquidity in the banking system and the
recent decline in Treasury bill rates have highlighted some uncertainties in the BCV’s
monetary policy operating framework—including how the Bank should respond to such
developments. Following recent technical assistance from the IMF, the authorities felt that
there was a need for, and sufficient capital account frictions to allow, somewhat more active
liquidity management to prevent destabilizing swings in liquidity and interest rates. Drawing
on that technical assistance, the authorities intend to formulate a set of intermediate monetary
indicators—including broad money, credit growth, excess liquidity, and the interest
differential with the euro area—to guide liquidity management and other dimensions of
policy conduct. In-house capacity for tracking large external capital flows will be built, in
part to gauge the interest sensitivity of emigrant deposits and other private flows.
B. The Structural Reform Program
35.
Enhanced structural reforms will be crucial to achieving the PSI’s objectives.
Authorities and staff agreed that reform priorities are improving economic governance, fiscal
management, and capacity to formulate policy; sheltering the budget from quasi-fiscal losses;
and strengthening the financial sector. The reform agenda the MEFP details includes:
6

The alternative scenario elaborated in the DSA indicates that the country’s external sustainability ratios would
continue to imply a low probability of debt distress even if the US$20 million per year limit under the program
were borrowed on fully commercial terms. However, the ratio of debt service to exports would increase by
3 percentage points by 2009 and 4 percentage points by 2026.

20
•

Clearance of the stock of outstanding central government arrears of CVEsc 5.3 billion
by end 2009 (as scheduled in Appendix I, Table 1) and measures to prevent arrears
from again accumulating.

•

Further efforts to reinforce revenue collection. The government intends to submit
legislation to the National Assembly by mid-2007 that would reform the complex
system of tax exemptions; in particular, exemptions will be granted only according to
clearly defined economic criteria that correspond to the national development strategy,
and will be regulated under a single law.

•

Measures to strengthen public sector management capacity, including implementation
of the CFAA action plan and the MTEF and the new impetus to reforming civil service
staffing and compensation arrangements.

•

Regulatory and institutional reforms to support production and distribution of
electricity and water, including full application of the automatic tariff adjustment
mechanism.

•

Reforms to ensure that the regulation and supervision of financial institutions, including
in the offshore center, are in line with international best practice. These measures will
draw on the conclusions of a task force organized by the BCV.
VI. PROGRAM FOR 2006–07

36.
The government’s program for 2006–07 as spelled out in the MEFP is in line
with the medium-term strategy discussed above. By frontloading implementation of key
measures, the 2006 budget takes important steps toward supporting the government’s
medium-term macroeconomic strategy. Some highlights of the short-term fiscal strategy:
•

The fiscal position will be strengthened, supported by privatization and land sale
receipts (3.7 percent of GDP). To continue to reduce domestic debt, government net
domestic borrowing—except for clearance of arrears and late payments—will be
limited to -1.9 percent of GDP in 2006 and -0.2 percent in 2007. As a result, domestic
debt, net of deposits but including arrears, is projected to decline to 25 percent of GDP
at end-2007.

•

Arrears clearance of 1.7 percent of GDP is budgeted for 2006 (one-third of the end2005 stock of arrears) and significant further arrears clearance is anticipated in 2007.

•

Petroleum subsidies were eliminated starting June 1, 2006, and full provision has been
made in the 2006 budget for oil subsidies accrued in 2005 and the first part of 2006
(in the past, these subsidies were paid with a one-year lag).

37.
The program will be monitored using the assessment criteria and structural
benchmarks set out in the tables and in the Technical Memorandum of Understanding
attached to the MEFP (see also paragraph 29 of the MEFP). Program implementation and
the economic results associated with the program will be subject to two reviews per annum.
The program initially establishes quantitative and structural assessment criteria and
benchmarks for end-September 2006 and end-December 2006, and indicative targets for

21
2007.7 The first review mission, scheduled for November 2006, would reach understandings
on assessment criteria and structural benchmarks for 2007.
VII. RISKS TO THE PROGRAM
38.
As a small open economy with a narrow export base, Cape Verde is susceptible
to external and domestic shocks. For example, a deterioration in international security
could reduce tourism flows or investments; and increases in refugee inflows, as have
occurred recently, could put pressure on social services and the fiscal situation. Specific risks
that are related more directly to program assumptions include:
•

Higher than expected inflation: this could occur, for example, if wage growth in
2006–07 exceeds underlying inflation and productivity growth. An encouraging sign
that economy-wide wage movements will be moderate despite increases in food and
regulated prices is the recently announced 3.5 percent increase in civil service wages.

•

Continued increases in the government wage bill: failure to scale back the wage bill
to its 2005 level (as a share of GDP) would cut the 2007 fiscal space in half, while a
continuation of the wage bill growth experienced over the last five years would
eliminate the projected fiscal space entirely and leave a residual financing gap of
1 percent of GDP by 2009.

•

Quasi fiscal risks and service disruptions among public service enterprises: such
concerns could arise if there was failure to reach agreement on the investment plan for
Electra, or if economic or political obstacles did not allow TACV to operate on fully
commercial terms.

•

Outflows of emigrant deposits: there is still substantial uncertainty about what
motivates emigrant deposits, which comprise around 40 percent of M2. In particular, it
is unclear how sensitive these deposits would be to further reductions in the interest rate
differential between Cape Verde and more advanced economies (particularly the
European Union and the United States) where most of the Cape Verde diaspora resides.
Gross international reserves would be reduced to less than 2 months of imports if only
20 percent of the emigrant deposits were withdrawn, and completely depleted with a
withdrawal of less than 60 percent.

•

Fluctuations in external concessional support: Cape Verde’s ability to reduce
domestic debt as projected under the program would be impaired if there were
temporary shortfalls in external grants or highly concessional loans (or if this support
fell away more rapidly than expected with the country’s move to middle-income
status), and if resulting financing gaps were met using domestic resources.

7

The relatively close interval between the first two reviews and associated test dates is designed to enable the
program to begin without delay, but then to move quickly to a review cycle aligned with the fiscal
year—involving end-June and end-December test dates.

22
VIII. STATISTICAL ISSUES AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NEEDS
39.
The quality and timeliness of Cape Verde’s economic and financial data are
generally adequate for surveillance and program monitoring, although some areas need
substantial improvement (see Appendix III). The staff expressed concerns about the
monitoring of some aspects of fiscal performance and debt (especially external debt),
weaknesses in the national accounts and CPI, and tracking of large external flows. The
authorities are working to strengthen statistics. A comprehensive master plan directed by the
National Statistical Institute (INE) outlines the steps needed for improving all areas of
statistics. Cape Verde’s development partners have already committed a substantial part of
the estimated US$15 million required to implement the plan through 2010. The authorities
are also making progress in revising the national accounts and a new CPI index is scheduled
to be released in 2006. Staff stressed the importance of adequately funding full
implementation of these improvements.
40.
The authorities are seeking continued technical assistance, not only for
strengthening the statistical system but also for improving debt management, producing
summary fiscal information from the online budget monitoring system, and strengthening
regulation of the financial sector.
IX. STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
The authorities are firmly committed to macroeconomic stability and structural
reforms. Their policies are strengthening the foundations for sustained growth and poverty
reduction. Cape Verde’s strong economic performance under its first PRGF-supported
program, supported by official and private capital inflows, has significantly alleviated
poverty and led to Cape Verde’s “graduation” (effective in 2008) to middle-income status.
Growth reached close to 6 percent in 2005, and the fiscal stance was prudent through the
recent election cycle—contributing to a further build-up of international reserves, a decline in
domestic debt, and enhanced policy credibility.
42.
Cape Verde’s medium-term outlook is favorable despite the impact of higher
international oil prices on current economic activity. After slowing in 2006, growth is
expected to increase in the years ahead. The recent sharp increase in inflation is expected to
subside in 2007, but vigilance is required to ensure that one-off price adjustments do not
spread into more generalized inflation. Economic prospects are still largely driven by
tourism. A narrow economic base, capacity constraints, and the natural cost disadvantages of
a small country spread across many islands keep Cape Verde susceptible to such external and
domestic shocks as a deterioration in international security or the investment environment or,
on the domestic front, quasi-fiscal risks and service disruptions in public service enterprises.
43.
The fixed exchange rate has served Cape Verde well as an anchor for economic
stability. The peg to the euro should continue to play the central role in the macroeconomic
policy framework. There is no current need to harden the peg further, although this could be
considered as a longer-term policy option.

23
44.
The government’s medium-term program provides a sound basis for
macroeconomic stability, economic development, and poverty reduction. The program
gives particular attention to reducing fiscal risks and allowing Cape Verde a margin of safety
to help protect the economy against shocks. The structural reform program appropriately
centers on strengthening economic management through building capacity in fiscal
management and policy formulation; sheltering the budget from quasi-fiscal losses; and
strengthening the financial sector.
45.
To provide a firmer buffer against economic shocks, the government’s mediumterm macroeconomic framework is geared toward a further increase in international
reserves and a reduction in the government debt-to-GDP ratio. The staff fully agrees
with these program anchors. Containing domestic borrowing should help achieve both
objectives: the overall fiscal deficit largely reflects the provision of external aid and its
grant/loan distribution, and there is only limited scope for monetary policy to effect a longterm, sustainable buildup in reserves. Fiscal restraint is also needed for creating space to meet
potential future pressures on the budget, including from the public pension system and
possible declines in highly concessional external support.
46.
The targeted rate of reserve build-up and debt reduction appropriately balances
monetary and fiscal considerations. In particular, the macroeconomic framework provides
adequate room for lower interest rates, increased credit to the private sector, and further
growth of government capital spending and high-priority current spending.
47.
The government’s program for 2006–07 is in line with the medium-term strategy
and frontloads key measures. The fiscal position will be substantially strengthened through
a sizable reduction in the domestic debt ratio; clearance of arrears and steps to prevent their
recurrence; and full provision in the budget for past oil subsidies together with elimination of
future petroleum subsidies, which will remove a key source of fiscal risk. However, debt
reduction in 2006 is largely due to one-off privatization and land sale receipts, which cannot
be relied on as financing sources in the future.
48.
The restructuring and privatization of the national airline TACV and the port
operator ENAPOR should help reduce fiscal risks, improve economic efficiency, and
enhance growth prospects.
49.
Despite recent progress, ensuring adequate and reliable supplies of electricity
and water remains a significant concern. A key for overcoming current difficulties is to
strengthen the regulatory framework so that tariff levels provide adequate incentives for
investment. In particular, full and transparent application of the automatic tariff adjustment
mechanism for electricity and water would help provide a more stable environment for much
needed investment to improve the volume and efficiency of energy supply, and prevent the
re-emergence of a tariff deficit.
50.
The rapidly developing offshore financial center needs to be carefully monitored.
While this sector may provide gains in employment, expertise, and financial services to the
economy, there are also inherent risks. Regulatory reforms are necessary to ensure that

24
financial development takes place within a sound institutional framework that is in line with
international best practice.
51.
Cape Verde’s economic and financial data are generally adequate for
surveillance and program monitoring, but weaknesses remain. Efforts currently under
way to address these weaknesses are welcome, and the staff urges the authorities to provide
adequate budgetary resources to ensure full implementation of the statistical master plan.
52.
Given the authorities’ clear and demonstrated commitment to sound economic
management, the staff recommends Executive Board approval of the request for a
three-year PSI.
53.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Cape Verde take
place within 24 months subject to the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles in
program countries.

APPENDIX I: CAPE VERDE—LETTER OF INTENT

July 11, 2006
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street N.W.
Washington D.C. 20431
Dear Mr. de Rato:
1.
In July 2005, the government of Cape Verde completed its first arrangement with the
IMF under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). Put in place against the
backdrop of severe macroeconomic imbalances that Cape Verde faced in 2001, the PRGFsupported program emphasized a strengthening of the fiscal position, an increase in
international reserves, and a wide range of structural reforms. Overall results under the
program were considerably better than expected, as reflected in the significant improvements
that Cape Verde has experienced in terms of macroeconomic performance, policy credibility,
and external financial support.
2.
Looking ahead, the government is seeking to maintain a close policy dialogue with
the IMF under the Policy Support Instrument (PSI). The government believes that Cape
Verde is well-suited to the PSI: macroeconomic stability has been achieved; financial
resources from the Fund are not needed; but the PSI would support the government’s
ongoing efforts to strengthen policy performance and signal its commitment to sound policies
to the international community.
3.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) sets out the
government’s economic goals and policy framework for 2006–09, for which it requests
support under the three-year PSI. Key elements of this program include a reduction in
government debt, a further increase in international reserves, and structural reforms to
improve public sector management, reduce fiscal risks, and strengthen the financial sector.
4.
Under the three-year PSI, the government will keep the IMF regularly updated on
economic and policy developments and will provide the data needed for adequate monitoring
of the program—including in the context of the twice-yearly reviews. During the period of
this Instrument, Cape Verde will consult with the IMF on the adoption of any measures that
may be appropriate at the initiative of the government, or whenever the Managing Director of
the IMF requests such a consultation.

37
5.
We authorize the IMF to publish this letter and the attached MEFP and the related
staff report.
Sincerely yours,
/s/
João Pinto Serra
Minister of Finance and Public Administration

APPENDIX I, ATTACHMENT I: CAPE VERDE—MEMORANDUM OF
ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES OF THE GOVERNMENT FOR 2006–09
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This memorandum summarizes the government of Cape Verde’s economic objectives
and policy framework for 2006–09, for which the Government is seeking support from the
International Monetary Fund under the Policy Support Instrument (PSI). The government
believes that Cape Verde is well-suited to a PSI. The economy is stable; IMF financial
resources are not needed; but the Government would like to maintain a close dialogue with
the Fund—both to support the ongoing strengthening of economic and policy performance,
and to signal to the international community the authorities’ commitment to maintain sound
economic policies. The policies described are consistent with Cape Verde’s Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), which sets out the country’s medium-term development
priorities.
2.
The PSI program described in this memorandum builds on the strong results
that Cape Verde achieved in its previous arrangement with the IMF under the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement, which ended in July 2005. The
economic strategy under the PRGF arrangement emphasized the need for fiscal
consolidation, involving both restraint in public spending and improvements in revenue
performance, in order to correct the severe macroeconomic imbalances that emerged in
2000–01. The strengthening of the fiscal position since 2001 has supported a large build-up
in international reserves and growth of overall policy credibility. Reflecting these
improvements in the policy environment, Cape Verde has experienced sizable inflows of
external finance for investment and development, solid growth averaging around 5 percent
over 2001–05, low inflation, and a reduction in poverty.
3.
While recent economic performance has been strong, Cape Verde continues to
face large development challenges. Unemployment and poverty remain high despite recent
progress; and improving infrastructure, public services, and other underpinnings of
sustainable growth and poverty reduction across many small islands is inherently slow and
costly. For example, reaching the Millennium Development Goals in areas such as health,
education, and sanitation will place major pressures on public spending to strengthen
infrastructure and the volume and quality of services. To address these and other challenges,
Cape Verde will continue to rely heavily on external support. The government also notes
with concern that, despite its strong record of governance and policy performance,
Cape Verde has not been deemed eligible for external debt relief under recent multilateral
initiatives. To help redress this apparent incongruity, the government calls on the
international community to continue to support growth and development in Cape Verde over
the long term through grants and highly concessional financial assistance.

39
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
The Cape Verde economy continues to perform well. Preliminary economic
indicators point to a pick-up in growth in 2005 to an estimated rate of around 6 percent.
Inflation averaged only 0.4 percent in 2005, but has increased recently—mainly as a result of
higher food and petroleum prices. Supported by prudent fiscal performance in 2005,
international reserve accumulation has been strong, reaching 3.0 months of prospective
imports in December 2005. Commercial banks’ excess reserves increased substantially in
2005, a result of strong capital inflows, a lowering of the reserve requirement, and a
slowdown in private sector credit growth in the first part of the year. In response, the Bank of
Cape Verde (BCV) has sold securities to partially absorb the increase in liquidity.
5.
The government has been moving forward with its structural reform agenda.
A new management team has been selected to restructure the national airline TACV in
preparation for its privatization, and the bidding process is getting under way for
privatization of the port operator ENAPOR. The authorities have completed a detailed action
plan to build capacity in public finance management, and has established a civil servants
database to support analysis of the current workforce and proposals for further civil service
reform. Steps have been taken to clear the backlog of government accounts: the draft
accounts for 1998–2003 have been completed and submitted to parliament for transmittal to
the Court of Auditors (TdC). Provisional quarterly accounts for 2004 and 2005 have also
been submitted to the parliament.
6.
Thanks to sound governance and good economic performance, Cape Verde is
attracting significant international support, both official and private, for investment
and development. Cape Verde was one of the first countries to receive support from the
Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) in 2005. The amount of US$110 million will be
disbursed in the next five years to finance growth in the country’s physical and human
capacities. Cape Verde has been deemed eligible for further support from the MCA under a
new category created for lower middle income countries. Private investment inflows,
directed largely toward the construction sector and tourism, remain strong, as evidenced by a
large increase in the rate of project approvals during 2005.
7.
Financial services continue to develop rapidly. The banking sector’s total assets
have grown by 20 percent since end-2004 to reach over 90 percent of nominal GDP, with
growth heavily concentrated in the construction sector. Emigrant deposits, accounting for
over 40 percent of total deposits, continue to play a critical role in the banking sector. The
profitability of the banking sector suffered significantly in 2005, owing to a tightening in
interest spreads and the excess liquidity noted above, although prudential indicators remain
sound. The rapidly developing offshore banking sector in Cape Verde now includes four
operational offshore banks, with four other banks and two parabanking companies already
licensed but not yet operational. Among recent developments in the financial sector is an
ongoing project to create a centralized credit bureau that would help lenders assess the basic
creditworthiness of borrowers, thus enhancing access to credit and the overall credit culture.
The Cape Verde stock exchange (Bolsa de Valores de Cabo Verde) is seeing a revival in
activity, including daily trading of government bills and a small number of corporates.

40
III. MEDIUM-TERM OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY
8.
The Government’s medium-term objectives and strategy are set out in the PRSP
and other national planning documents, and have been reiterated and elaborated
recently in the Government Program for 2006–11. This strategy is directed at boosting
growth and reducing poverty through private sector-led development and diversification of
economic activities. In support of these goals, the Government’s policy priorities include
(i) building human capacities through improving access to education, training, and health
care; (ii) strengthening infrastructure and institutions, including to support service sector
growth in areas such as tourism, financial services, and communications; and (iii) improving
governance and the capacity of the public sector to implement policy reforms and program
mandates.
9.
The program to be supported by the PSI aims to provide a consistent and
coherent economic policy framework to underpin the Government’s medium-term
development objectives. In particular, the program focuses on enhancing the sustainability
of growth and development by maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment and
moving forward with structural reforms, especially in areas that have systemic significance
for the economy. Specific attention is given to reducing fiscal risks and to providing Cape
Verde with an adequate safety margin to help protect the economy against exogenous shocks.
The macroeconomic framework would also help prepare Cape Verde for the prospect that, as
the level of GDP per capita continues to rise, the country’s access to highly concessional
external finance may diminish.
10.

Key policy measures in the program include:

•

increasing foreign exchange coverage to further strengthen the credibility and resilience
of the exchange rate peg;

•

decreasing the burden of domestic debt and clearing remaining domestic arrears;

•

strengthening public finance management capacity, expenditure control, and revenue
performance;

•

pursuing structural reforms to reduce fiscal risks and support efficiency improvements
in the economy;

•

regulatory reforms to ensure that financial sector development takes place within a
sound institutional framework.

Outlook for growth and inflation
11.
The government’s goal is that, as the human and physical capacities of the Cape
Verde economy continue to build, growth should move up to double digit levels.
Macroeconomic and structural policy measures addressed under the PSI program will help
lay the groundwork for attaining this longer-term growth objective. While economic activity
in 2006 will be affected by the impact of higher international oil prices, growth is expected to
pick up in the years ahead and average 6–7 percent during the PSI program. Strong private

41
investment in the tourism sector and public investment in infrastructure, complemented by
the ongoing development of domestic capacities, will continue to provide the key support for
growth. Following an upward move in inflation over 2006–07, driven in part by sharp
adjustments in regulated prices following increases in international oil prices, consumer
inflation is expected to stabilize at 2–3 percent over the medium term in line with rates in the
euro area.
Fiscal policy and structural reforms
12.
The medium-term fiscal strategy will be geared towards preserving macroeconomic
stability, reducing risks, and creating fiscal space to prepare for potential future pressures on
the budget. For example, fiscal pressures may arise from government liabilities to the public
pension system as this develops and matures; from growth in demand for other public
services; from the possibility that Cape Verde’s access to highly concessional external
support may diminish as the country moves further into middle income status; and,
associated with the last point, from the prospective need for increased domestic capital
participation in public investment projects. To support its fiscal and macroeconomic
objectives, the government intends to reach and then maintain a central government debt
ratio of no more than 70 percent of GDP. This goal would be attained under the mediumterm program to be supported by the PSI through further reductions in both domestic and
external debt as a share of GDP. Furthermore, with external financing largely directed toward
the public investment spending, which has a high import content, the government recognizes
that ongoing restraint in current spending and domestic borrowing will play an important role
in supporting the desired increase in international reserves as well as the debt reduction
objective. Hence, in the medium-term program, government domestic debt would be targeted
to reach around 20 percent of GDP by 2009 (from over 33 percent at end-2005). In the
scenario set out in the statistical tables, this objective would be consistent with further growth
of capital spending, with net domestic borrowing that is in tandem with the program to clear
old arrears, and with the creation of increasing fiscal space to meet pressures such as those
noted above.1
13.
This fiscal stance would allow external debt to be lowered from 56 percent of
GDP in 2005 to 49 percent in 2009. The deficit will be driven primarily by the availability
of highly concessional external loans for financing the government’s public investment
program. If any external debt is contracted or guaranteed by the central government on terms
falling below the 35 percent concessionality threshold (as set out in the attached Technical
Memorandum of Understanding), the total of this new nonconcessional external debt and
guarantees will be held to no more than US$20 million per year (around 2 percent of GDP).
To ensure that this and other borrowing remain consistent with its debt sustainability
objectives, the government is seeking assistance from its international partners to support the
strengthening of both debt management practices and project appraisal capacities.
1

The fiscal methodology used in the statistical tables follows that set out in the 2001 GFS Manual, which the
government intends to fully adopt as rapidly as possible. The government requests technical assistance from the
IMF in support of this change.

42
14.
In support of these fiscal objectives, the government will continue to contain
nonpriority current expenditures, improve the mobilization of domestic revenues, and
limit contingent and quasi-fiscal liabilities. Within the constraints imposed by revenue
availability, expenditures will be prioritized in line with the PRSP objectives. The
government’s recent decision to end all energy subsidies, announced as part of the 2006
budget, represents an important step toward reducing expenditure pressures, strengthening
budget management, and creating fiscal space for higher priority spending—including
well-targeted measures to support those in need. The expenditure restraint necessary to
achieve government’s overall fiscal goals will nevertheless allow a substantial increase in
government investment, which is expected to remain around 16 percent of GDP over
2006–09, up from 13 percent in 2005. Lower interest expenditures as the debt declines will
support the redirection of spending toward the public investment program and other poverty
reduction efforts.
15.
The government recognizes that the full clearance of arrears is essential to
restore order in the public finances and ensure the credibility of government as a
diligent economic agent. A recent study assessed the extent of public cross-debt involving
central government, municipalities, the social security fund (INPS), and public and
parapublic enterprises. Following this study, the government has agreed to settle
4.8 billion CVEsc (equivalent to 5.5 percent of GDP) in several installments. The
government has also paid part of its old arrears to the oil companies for past subsidies on fuel
supplied to Electra. The government is firmly committed to repaying remaining arrears and
staying current on all its payment obligations throughout the program and beyond. To
prevent a recurrence of the arrears buildup that has occurred among municipalities and
autonomous public agencies, including their failure to remain current in payments for energy
and other inputs, the central government will work directly with these entities to strengthen
their financial management capacities and practices. If the arrears problem persists despite
these efforts, the central government will take direct measures to assert fiscal discipline; for
example, such measures may include government meeting energy payments on their behalf,
and deducting the corresponding amounts from government transfers to the entities
concerned.
16.
The government will maintain its efforts to reinforce and strengthen revenue
collection. Tax reforms over recent years, including the introduction of VAT and
streamlining of import and consumption taxes, have made a substantial contribution toward
reducing economic distortions, improving the transparency of the tax system, and
strengthening overall revenue performance. In the PSI program, the government will give
particular attention to pushing ahead with improvements already underway in revenue
administration, and to further widening the tax base through rationalization of tax incentives
and exemptions. In both areas, assistance has been provided by the IMF Fiscal Affairs
Department (FAD). Following FAD advice, the complex system of tax exemptions will be
reformed to ensure that exemptions will be granted only according to clearly defined
economic criteria that correspond to the national development strategy, and regulated under a
single law that will abolish the multitude of scattered norms currently in place. As noted
below, these reforms will be part of the 2006–07 program.

43
17.
Additional structural measures will be taken to help contain fiscal risks and
reinforce the macroeconomic targets set out above. Reform efforts will include:
•

improving the productivity of the civil service;

•

strengthening capacities and procedures for formulating, executing, monitoring, and
auditing the budget; and

•

implementing a clear strategy for supporting production of electricity and water,
including the automatic tariff adjustment mechanism.

18.
The government is determined to move ahead with reforms to public
administration. These reforms will focus on improving civil service capacities and
productivity within the constraints of the overall wage bill. The government will give
particular attention to ensuring that staffing levels are consistent with departmental
requirements, and that wage structures provide appropriate incentives for performance and
for the recruitment and retention of qualified staff, without putting undue pressure on private
sector wages. In preparing for reform and rationalization of administrative structures, and
following guidelines issued by the Council of Ministers, the Ministry of Finance and Public
Administration has issued a circular requiring section heads in government departments to
submit to the Directorate-General of Public Administration a list reflecting staffing needs and
personnel available for mobility. Supporting these reform efforts will be the new civil
servants database, recently established with the help of the World Bank. The above circular
also mandates that Autonomous Funds, Autonomous Services, and Public Institutes that fail
to submit the requested information will not receive monthly transfers. The government has
imposed a freeze on promotions in public administration while it takes stock of reform
requirements and directions. To further tighten fiscal control, the Public Treasury will not be
responsible for meeting the costs of staff contracted by local health and education authorities
in excess of budget limits.
19.
The government’s public sector reforms include a wide range of measures to
strengthen the budget process, from the formulation stage to final audit. Some specific
measures are discussed below in the program for 2006–07. These reforms are shaped in part
by the Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) action plan, which the
authorities are implementing with the support of the World Bank, the Netherlands, and other
donors. Key steps in this area include developing a new national plan of public accounts,
introducing a medium-term expenditure framework, strengthening public sector procurement
practices, and introducing a new fiscal register. The recently developed SIGOF system
provides a highly effective tool for real-time control of budget execution and monitoring, and
the government intends to support the further development of this system and its expansion
to other parts of the public sector. The authorities are seeking additional external assistance
to move ahead with these initiatives.
20.
The government’s energy policy is focused on supporting improvements in the
quality of life of Cape Verdeans, improving the economy’s competitiveness, ensuring
stable supplies of energy, and preserving the environment. This policy is directed in part
at promoting conservation and alternative energy sources to reduce Cape Verde’s

44
dependence on oil imports. To address persistent and growing concerns about service quality,
especially concerning supplies of electricity and water, an integrated approach is needed
involving the strengthening of the regulatory environment for the sector and increased
investment in production and distribution. In particular:
•

As part of its overall energy strategy, the government intends to strengthen legal and
regulatory structures to support a competitive energy market, safeguard consumers, and
increase discipline and transparency. In support of these measures, the government will
reinforce institutional capacities for energy administration and develop a specific legal
and regulatory framework for the subsector of electricity and fuel.

•

ARE, the autonomous economic regulatory authority, has full authority to establish a
tariff policy that both reflects costs and provides incentives for gains in efficiency. This
policy needs to take into account the government’s recent elimination of fuel subsidies,
and to include full implementation of the automatic mechanism to adjust tariffs in light
of changes in input costs and efficiency gains. ARE has guaranteed to the government
that these requirements will be met by June 1, 2006.

•

Investment in energy infrastructure is essential to increase efficiency and to ensure
wider and easier access of the population to energy and water services. The government
seeks the full cooperation and commitment of Electra to implement its investment plan
for improving production and distribution. The government also calls on donor support
to ensure that progress is made in this area.

Monetary policy and financial sector reforms
21.
Medium-term monetary policy will be geared, as in the past, towards
safeguarding the exchange rate peg with the euro as an anchor for low inflation. In order
to provide a further cushion against external shocks and underpin investors’ confidence into
the peg, macroeconomic policies under the PSI program will be designed to support a further
build-up of international reserves of at least 0.1 months of prospective imports per year—
equivalent to around ½ percent of current GDP. Drawing on technical assistance from the
IMF, the authorities will also strengthen the operational framework for monetary policy,
including the development of intermediate monetary indicators to guide liquidity
management and other dimensions of policy conduct. In-house capacity for tracking large
external capital flows will be built, including to gauge the interest sensitivity of emigrant
deposits and other private flows.
22.
In strengthening the financial sector, the government is committed to a wide
ranging set of measures which, among other aspects, will ensure that the regulation and
supervision of financial institutions, including International Financial Institutions
(IFIs), is in line with best international practice. Initiatives in this area will be guided by
an Action Plan being drafted by a multidisciplinary task force organized by the BCV. Among
other inputs, the task force will consider the recommendations of a November 2005 technical
assistance mission from the Monetary and Financial Systems Department (MFD) of the IMF.
The authorities will ensure in particular that there is sufficient growth in institutional
capacities for regulation and supervision of the financial sector. Furthermore, development of

45
IFIs will be taken at a careful pace, with proper measures in place to protect the system
against potential financial abuse and to safeguard Cape Verde’s reputation and access to the
international financial system. To the extent that IFIs engage in transactions with residents,
these activities take place under the same prudential standards as apply to domestic banks. In
the context of developing the legislative and institutional framework, including for antimoney laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), the authorities will
seek to bring this framework into line with international standards. In this regard, the Action
Plan and all relevant activities therein will be discussed with the stakeholders and the donor
community to ensure its adequacy and to secure technical and financial support for its
implementation.
23.
The authorities will look further into obstacles to growth in bank lending to the
private sector. Reducing the cost of capital will be an important goal of monetary policy and
financial sector development in the next few years. Growth of credit to the private sector will
be further supported by enhancing the regulatory and legislative framework to protect lenders
and strengthening banks’ capacity to provide project-based lending. Reforms in the financial
sector will also aim to improve credit risk management, expand access to credit for SMEs,
and increase competition in the financial market.
Other structural reforms
24.
In parallel with the fiscal and financial sector measures outlined above, the
government plans to implement ambitious reforms to enhance competitiveness,
strengthen the business environment, and hence promote private sector led growth.
Against this background, trade reforms are proceeding in the context of WTO accession, for
which a decision is expected during 2006; labor market reforms are being discussed with the
goal of increasing the economy’s capacity to create jobs and improving working conditions;
a modern regulatory framework has been drafted in order to advance with the liberalization
of the telecom market; and administrative barriers to private sector initiatives are being
removed, including by the introduction of modern information technology in the provision of
public services under the e-government initiative.
IV. POLICIES FOR 2006–07
25.
Within the general medium-term strategy described above, the government has
specific policy targets it plans to meet in 2006–07. These policies are intended to underpin
a sustained pickup in growth and reduction in inflation following the short-term impact of
increases in regulated prices during 2006.
Fiscal measures
26.
In addressing some key sources of fiscal concern, including eliminating subsidies
and clearing arrears, the 2006 budget has taken important steps toward supporting the
medium-term macroeconomic strategy of the PSI program. Policies for 2007 will be
geared toward further strengthening the fiscal position. Consistent with the objective of
reducing domestic debt to 20 percent of GDP by 2009, government net domestic borrowing
will be limited to at most 0.8 percent of GDP in 2006 (contributing to budgeted arrears

46
clearance of 1.7 percent of GDP) and 0.9 percent in 2007 (in line with arrears clearance
anticipated in 2007). As a result, domestic debt, net of deposits but including arrears, is
projected to decline from 32.7 percent of GDP at end-2005 to 25 percent at end-2007.
27.
To support these fiscal goals, the government is committed to ongoing restraint
of current spending, combined with structural reforms to improve revenue
performance, reduce fiscal risks, and improve financial management. Specific measures
the government plans to implement in 2006–07 include:
•

Rationalizing and streamlining tax incentives and exemptions. As discussed above,
the currently complex and fragmented approach to granting exemptions will be
reformed, with exemptions granted instead according to clearly defined economic
criteria and regulated under a single law. To effect these reforms, the government
intends to submit draft legislation to the National Assembly by mid-2007.

•

Implementing the automatic mechanism to adjust electricity and water tariffs in
line with changes in input costs and efficiency gains. As noted above, ARE has
guaranteed it will implement this mechanism by June 1, 2006.

•

Completing the privatization agenda. Among the few enterprises remaining on this
agenda, privatization of EMPROFAC (a pharmaceuticals distributor), ENAPOR (the
port operator), and INTERBASE (a fish freezing company) is expected within 2006. A
new management team will restructure TACV (the national airline) under a one-year
consultancy contract beginning in June 2006, and privatization is expected in 2007.

•

Establishing a macroeconomic policy unit in the Ministry of Finance and Public
Administration. The government recognizes that such a unit is needed to improve the
formulation of fiscal policy and its coordination with overall macroeconomic
objectives. A unit will be established and staffed by December 2006.

•

Strengthening internal and external audit processes. Priorities for the first year of
the program will be the completion and implementation of the laws on reorganization
and mandates of the TdC, and the National Chart of Public Accounts.

Monetary and financial sector policies
28.
Complementing these fiscal efforts, monetary policy during 2006–07 aims at
further enhancing the credibility of the exchange rate peg. Gross international reserves of
the BCV are programmed to increase by CVEsc 2.1 million in 2006 and 2.3 million in 2007
(to 3.2 months of prospective imports). The reduction in growth of net credit to the central
government should allow for an expansion in credit to the private sector in the range of
14 percent in 2006 and 2007, while broad money is expected to expand in line with nominal
GDP growth. The central bank is committed to actively utilizing the monetary instruments at
its disposal (including required reserves, its standing facilities, and open market type
operations) in order to control liquidity and achieve the monetary targets established under
the program. The program ceilings on net domestic assets of the BCV are set out in Table 1.

47
The BCV will also move forward during 2006–07 in tracking gross inflows and outflows of
emigrant deposits to support its analysis of the interest sensitivity of these flows.
29.
Measures to strengthen the financial sector in 2006–07 will draw on the
recommendations of the task force noted above. Over 2006–07, priorities include:
•

continuing to expand the institutional capacity of the BCV to conduct supervision;

•

signing formal information sharing agreements with home country supervisors of
subsidiaries and branches established in Cape Verde;

•

reviewing and reforming as necessary the legislative and regulatory framework of IFIs
in light of the task force report, including licensing procedures and criteria (especially
for autonomous companies), secrecy provisions, and branching into third countries; and

•

amending as necessary the AML/CFT legislation to bring it at par with the 2003
FATF/CFT standards.

The authorities are committed to addressing these priorities by mid-2007.
V. PROGRAM MONITORING
30.
Program implementation will be monitored according to assessment criteria and
benchmarks presented in Tables 1 and 2 (attached). The definitions of the variables
monitored as quantitative assessment criteria and benchmarks are contained in the Technical
Memorandum of Understanding (attached). The program will also include, as assessment
criteria, the equivalent of the standard performance criteria concerning the exchange and
trade system that apply in Fund financial arrangements. Program implementation and the
economic results associated with the program will be subject to two reviews per annum. The
first review will be expected to be completed by end-November 2006 based on
end-September 2006 assessment criteria and benchmarks, the second by end-February 2007
based on end-December 2006 criteria, and the third review by end-August 2007 based on
end-June 2007 criteria. Reviews will proceed on a half-yearly basis thereafter. The
quantitative criteria will be monitored on a quarterly basis.

APPENDIX I, ATTACHMENT II: CAPE VERDE—TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM
OF UNDERSTANDING
1.
This memorandum sets out the understandings between the Cape Verdean authorities
and the IMF staff regarding the definition of assessment criteria and indicative targets and
reporting requirements under the first annual program supported by the Policy Support
Instrument.
I. QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT CRITERIA AND INDICATIVE TARGETS
A. Net Domestic Borrowing Excluding for Clearance of Arrears and Net Late
Payments
2.
Net domestic borrowing excluding for clearance of arrears and net late
payments is defined as the cumulative change since the start of the calendar year of the net
credit to the central government from the banking and nonbanking sectors less (1) the
cumulative clearance during the calendar year of the stock of arrears as of end-2005 and
(2) the cumulative payments during the first three months of the calendar year of expenses
authorized by the previous year’s budget, and plus the expenses accrued during the current
year that will be paid during the first three months of the next calendar year as provisioned
for in the budget law (late payments or atrasados). The ceiling will be adjusted downward
(upward) by the cumulative downward (upward) deviations in external debt service and
upward (downward) by the cumulative downward (upward) deviations in nonproject external
financial assistance relative to program assumptions.
3.
Net credit to the central government from the banking and nonbanking system is
defined as the overall position of the main central government institutions vis-à-vis the
banking and nonbanking system—that is, the stock of all outstanding claims on the central
government (loans, advances), and all other government debt instruments, such as long-term
government securities) held by the central bank, commercial banks, and nonbank institutions,
less all deposits held by the central government with the central bank and with commercial
banks. The INPS is not included in central government accounts. Net credit to the central
government excludes claims on the Trust Fund (TCMFs).
4.
Reporting requirements. Data on the implementation of the budget compiled by the
Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning will be provided on a quarterly basis, to be
submitted not later than five weeks after the end of each quarter, including (i) government
domestic revenue by category; (ii) external budget support grants; (iii) government
expenditure, including primary current expenditure, domestic and external interest payments,
and capital expenditure, including domestically and budget support financed capital
expenditure and estimates of externally project financed capital expenditure; (iv) the gross
payment and gross accumulation of domestic accounts payable (atrasados); (v) the gross
payment and gross accumulation of domestic payments arrears; (vi) external loan receipts
and principal payments; (vii) external arrears payments and accumulation; (viii) bank and
nonbank financing; (ix) privatization and land sale receipts; and (x) any other revenue,
expenditure, or financing not included above.

51
5.
For the purposes of this memorandum, privatization and land proceeds will be
understood to mean all monies received by the government from the sale or concessioning of
a public company, organization, or facility to a private company or companies,
organization(s), or individual(s), as well as any proceeds generated from the sale of
government land and the liquidation of a public company, less restructuring costs.
B. Net Domestic Assets of the Central Bank
6.
The ceiling on the cumulative change, from the beginning of calendar-year 2006, in
net domestic assets of the BCV constitutes an assessment criterion. Net domestic assets
(NDA) of the BCV are defined as reserve money minus net foreign assets of the BCV,
evaluated at the current end-of-period exchange rates. The program ceilings for NDA will be
adjusted downward (upward) by the cumulative downward (upward) deviations in external
debt service and upward (downward) by the cumulative downward (upward) deviations in
nonproject external financial assistance relative to program assumptions. For purposes of
calculating the adjusters, these flows will be valued at current exchange rates. Reserve
money comprises bank reserves and deposits of the monetary institutions and private sector
with the central bank, as well as cash in circulation.
7.
Reporting requirements. The preliminary monthly balance sheets of the BCV and
the consolidated commercial banks will be transmitted on a monthly basis, with a maximum
delay of five weeks. The definitive version of the monthly balance sheet of the BCV will be
provided as soon as available.
C. Ceiling on Nonconcessional External Debt Contracted or
Guaranteed by the Central Government
8.
Under the program, ceilings on medium- and long-term, as well as on short-term,
nonconcessional external debt constitute assessment criteria. These assessment criteria are on
a continuous basis. Nonconcessional external debt is defined as debt contracted or guaranteed
by the central government with a grant element of less than 35 percent, calculated using
currency-specific commercial interest reference rates (CIRRs) published by the Development
Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD). Debt rescheduling and debt reorganization are excluded from the limits on
nonconcessional external debt. The limits on new nonconcessional external debt contracted
or guaranteed by the central government (excluding borrowing from the Fund) are specified
in Tables 1 and 2 of the memorandum of economic and financial policies. The definition of
short-term nonconcessional external debt excludes normal short-term (less than one year)
import-related financing. The Portuguese government’s precautionary credit line in support
of the exchange rate peg is also excluded from the definition of nonconcessional external
debt. In addition, the central government will not guarantee any external debt contracted by
state enterprises and will maintain the policy of not guaranteeing private sector external debt.
The assessment criterion on medium- and long-term nonconcessional external indebtedness
applies not only to debt as defined in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria
with Respect to Foreign Debt (Decision No. 12274-(00/85), 8/24/00) but also to
commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received. With respect
to the assessment criterion on short-term nonconcessional external indebtedness, the term

52
“debt” has the meaning set forth in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria
with Respect to Foreign Debt (Decision No. 12274-(00/85), 8/24/00).
9.
Reporting requirements. The government of Cape Verde will consult with Fund
staff before assuming any liabilities in circumstances where they are uncertain whether the
instrument in question falls under the assessment criterion. Details of all new external debt
(including government guarantees), indicating terms of debt and creditors, will be provided
on a quarterly basis within five weeks of the end of each quarter.
D. Net International Reserves of the Central Bank
10.
The floor on the cumulative change, from the beginning of calendar-year 2006, in net
international reserves (NIR) of the BCV constitutes a assessment criterion under the
program. The NIR of the BCV are defined as gross international reserves of the BCV net of
its external reserve liabilities, calculated at the current exchange rates. Gross reserves of the
BCV are those that are readily available (i.e., liquid and marketable and free of any pledges
or encumbrances), controlled by the BCV and held for the purposes of meeting balance of
payments needs and intervening in foreign exchange markets. They include gold, holdings of
SDRs, the reserve position at the IMF, holdings of foreign exchange and traveler’s checks,
demand and short-term deposits at foreign banks abroad, fixed-term deposits abroad that can
be liquidated without penalty, and any holdings of investment-grade securities. External
liabilities of the BCV comprise liabilities to nonresidents contracted by the BCV with an
original maturity of less than a year, any net off-balance-sheet position of the BCV (futures,
forwards, swaps, or options) with either resident and nonresidents, any arrears on principal
and interest to external creditors and suppliers, and purchases from the IMF. The program
floors for the NIR will be adjusted upward (downward) by the cumulative downward
(upward) deviations in external debt service and downward (upward) by the cumulative
downward (upward) deviations in nonproject external financial assistance relative to program
assumptions. For purposes of calculating the adjusters, these flows will be valued at current
exchange rates.
11.
Reporting requirements. A table on the NIR prepared by the BCV will be
transmitted on weekly basis, with a maximum delay of two weeks.
E. Nonaccumulation of New Domestic Payments Arrears
12.
As part of the program, the government will not accumulate any new domestic
payments arrears. This will be monitored through the monthly execution of the cash-flow
plan and the corresponding release of budget appropriations. For programming purposes, a
domestic payment obligation to suppliers is deemed to be in arrears if it has not been paid
within the normal grace period of 60 days (30 days for government salaries and debt service)
or such other period either specified by the budget law or contractually agreed with the
supplier after the verified delivery of the concerned goods and services, unless the amount or
the timing of the payment is subject to good faith negotiations between the government and
the creditor.

53
13.
Reporting requirements. The Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, through
the D.G.T., will submit on a quarterly basis a detailed table of the stock of domestic
payments arrears, including the accumulation, payment, rescheduling and write-off of
domestic payments arrears during the quarter. The data are to be provided within four weeks
after the end of the quarter.
F. Nonaccumulation of External Payments Arrears
14.
As part of the program, the government will not accumulate any new external
payments arrears on a continuous basis. This will be monitored through the monthly

APPENDIX II: CAPE VERDE—EXTERNAL AND PUBLIC DEBT
SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS (DSA) 1 2
Cape Verde’s debt level has increased in recent years. Despite the rising cost of servicing
this debt, the country’s external sustainability ratios indicate a low probability of debt
distress under the baseline scenario and in the face of plausible shocks. High domestic debt
and its implication for fiscal space, however, warrants focusing on total public debt in the
analysis.
Background
1.
The sustainability of Cape Verde’s external and total public debt is assessed using the
Fund-World Bank debt sustainability framework for low income countries. The previous
DSA was carried out during the sixth review of the PRGF and Article IV consultation,3 based
on the outstanding stock of debt at end-2004. The analysis concluded that, under long-term
economic scenarios that were in line with or more cautious than recent historical averages,
Cape Verde’s public debt appeared sustainable although vulnerable to a variety of possible
economic shocks.
2.
Total public debt in Cape Verde has been above 80 percent of GDP for most of
the last decade.4 At end-2005, debt stood at almost 90 percent of GDP, with interest
payments accounting for nearly 10 percent of domestic revenues (2.2 percent of GDP).
3.
External public debt increased significantly in the 1990s, but has declined over
recent years. After peaking at 64 percent of GDP in 2001, external debt decreased to
54 percent of GDP at end-2005. Of this, 79 percent was owed to multilateral creditors,
18 percent to bilateral creditors, and less than 1 percent to commercial creditors. The World
Bank (IDA) was the largest multilateral creditor, followed by the African Development Fund
and BADEA. Portugal, Russia, and Germany accounted for over 65 percent of bilateral debt.

1

This DSA has been prepared jointly by staff of the IMF and the World Bank. The analysis is undertaken based
on aggregate external debt data from the authorities, which have been revised since the last DSA.
2

This analysis focuses on central government and government guaranteed public debt only, as comprehensive
and reliable data on private external debt are not available. Private external debt contracted is believed to be
around US$25 million. The outstanding amount and the terms of repayment of this debt are not known.

Appendix I of IMF Country Report No. 05/320, 09/2005.

Due to its relatively high income per capita, Cape Verde is not eligible for HIPC assistance nor does it qualify
for debt forgiveness under the MDRI. Cape Verde’s eligibility for concessional financing through the PRGF
and IDA is based on the small island exception.

4.
Domestic debt has increased sharply since the debt restructuring operation in
the late 1990s. This increase has reflected the government’s assuming the debt of some large
public enterprises as part of their privatization, fiscal slippages, and, more recently, increased
recognition of domestic arrears. Central government net domestic debt including arrears
amounted to 33 percent of GDP at end-2005. Of this, 30 percent was short term. Commercial
banks were the major creditors, holding 55 percent of total government debt. The social
security fund INPS held the largest share of the debt to nonbanks (26 percent).
5.
The assumptions underlying this DSA are based on the medium-term
macroeconomic framework agreed with the authorities during discussions for the PSI
and long-term projections agreed between the Fund and the Bank staff. Over the longer
term, real GDP growth is expected to average 5 percent while inflation gradually decreases to
around 2 percent annually in line with rates in the euro area. Exports are projected to grow by
around 9 percent a year on average, below their historical average growth rate. A cautious
approach has been taken toward these assumptions; for example, growth could be higher than
projected if foreign direct investment continues to grow at a strong pace.
6.
Grants are assumed to decrease to 5 percent of GDP by 2026, and new
borrowing terms may also worsen as a result of Cape Verde’s graduation from low
income country status in 2008. Hence, while the baseline scenario assumes no commercial
borrowing in 2006–09, commercial loans are assumed to gradually replace loans from
multilateral creditors and the Paris Club in the long run. Thus, at the end of the projection
period (2026), loans from multilaterals account for 30 percent of total borrowing, whereas
commercial borrowing accounts for 40 percent. As a result, the concessionality of new
borrowing decreases from 27 percent in 2006 to 8 percent by 2026.

In the event that highly concessional loans fall short of the baseline assumptions,
an alternative scenario assesses the impact of covering the resulting gap by a limited
amount of less concessional borrowing, as provided for under the PSI program. To
assess the maximum impact of such borrowing, the alternative scenario assumes that the full
amount allowed under the program (US$20 million per year) is provided on commercial
rather than highly concessional terms over 2006–09. The alternative scenario assumes,
moreover, that in the long run, commercial loans will replace concessional loans at a faster
pace than in the baseline, thus accounting for 60 percent of total borrowing in 2026.
8.
The DSA incorporates new information that has become available since the
previous exercise in 2005. The main additions are as follows:
•

government guaranteed domestic debt is included in the total debt stock at end-2005;

•

newly recognized domestic arrears and cross-debt with the public administration and
institutes (amounting to CV Esc 5.3 billion) are included in the domestic debt stock;

•

revised projections on contributions to the social security fund stemming from the
pension reform of January 1, 2006 are incorporated in the fiscal framework;

•

oil subsidies are eliminated from the projections, following the government’s 2006
budget decision to this effect;

•

WEO oil price projections are updated as of the winter 2006 baseline.

External debt sustainability
9.
Despite the gradual reduction in concessionality of new loans, Cape Verde’s debt
stock and flow indicators under the baseline scenario remain below their policydependent thresholds throughout the projection period. The NPV of debt is projected to
increase minimally from 32 to 34 percent of GDP, and to decrease in terms of exports
(from 91 to 83 percent). Reflecting worsening borrowing terms, however, debt service

58
payments increase from 7 to 11 percent of exports. In the alternative scenario, the debt
service-to-export ratio would increase to 15 percent over the projection horizon.
10.
Standard bound tests suggest that even in the presence of external shocks, Cape
Verde does not appear vulnerable to debt distress. However, a one-time 30 percent
exchange rate depreciation relative to the baseline would bring the NPV of debt-to-GDP very
close to the threshold of 50 percent and keep it permanently at this level. The debt outlook
also appears sensitive to further worsening of borrowing terms and a decline in nondebt
creating flows (implying higher debt flows). While the former would increase the NPV of
debt-to-exports to 126 percent, a decrease in transfers by one standard deviation compared to
the historical average would push the debt service-to-export ratio from 7.6 percent in 2006 to
nearly 12 percent in 2023.

Fiscal sustainability
11.
The fiscal DSA is based on the assumption of ongoing fiscal consolidation in the
context of lower grant inflows. The DSA also builds in and extends the PSI program goal of
a sizeable reduction in domestic debt as a share of GDP. Specifically, domestic debt would
decrease to 16 percent of GDP by 2026. Domestic public revenues are projected to be
constant at 24 percent of GDP over the long term: this is lower than the recent historical
average and medium-term projections, reflecting prudent assumptions on the scope for
ongoing gains in revenue collection. The resulting overall fiscal deficit in the projection
period averages 3.1 percent of GDP.
12.
The baseline scenario depicts a decline in the NPV of debt-to GDP ratio, in line
with efforts to decrease the debt burden and create fiscal space for emerging pressures.
This ratio decreases to 50 percent in 2026 from 60 percent in 2006. While the NPV of debtto-revenues shows a small improvement, debt service increases sharply from 10 to 20 percent
of revenues by 2026—reflecting the worsening of borrowing terms in the baseline scenario.
In the alternative scenario, with a more rapid deterioration in borrowing terms, debt service
would rise to 22 percent of revenues by 2026.
13.
Standardized alternative shocks increase the NPV of Cape Verde’s public debt
and drive debt service to much higher levels. The most extreme test, which assumes that
the primary balance stays at its historical average minus 1 standard deviation in 2007–08,
increases the NPV of debt-to-GDP to 73 percent in 2008 and keeps it above the baseline
throughout the projection period. The same shock stabilizes the NPV of debt to-revenues at
around 200 percent in the long run, while increasing debt service-to-revenues to 23 percent
by 2026.

61
14.
Recent simulations by the World Bank indicate that the INPS pension system
will move into a cash flow deficit by 2037. While beyond the projection period in the
current DSA, this outlook clearly has negative implications for contingent fiscal liabilities
and public debt in Cape Verde over the long run. As in other pension systems around the
world, early efforts to address these imbalances would lower the eventual burden of
adjustment.
Conclusion
15.
In summary, the debt sustainability analysis suggests that Cape Verde is not
likely to face debt distress despite the rising debt service burden, given that
sustainability indicators are kept below the thresholds over the forecast horizon. The
analysis incorporates cautious assumptions on macroeconomic variables and builds in a
considerable worsening of borrowing terms in the long run. These results are contingent upon
the reduction of currently high debt ratios, highlighting the need for prudent fiscal and debt
management in the period ahead, including to ensure that debt service costs do not crowd out
high priority, poverty reducing spending.

Source: Staff simulations.
1

Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), noninterest current account in percent of GDP, and nondebt creating flows.

2

Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same.

3

Export values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly

assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4

Includes official and private transfers and FDI.

5

Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.

6

Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

IX. Safeguards Assessments
Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Cape Verde (BCV) is subject to
an assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement approved on April 10, 2002. A
safeguards assessment of the BCV was completed on December 9, 2002. The assessment
identified certain vulnerabilities in the reporting, internal control, and audit areas, and made
appropriate recommendations, as reported in “Semi-Annual Review of PRGF, PRGF-HIPC,
and SDA Investments,’’ issued on November 11, 2003. The BCV has implemented all
safeguards assessment recommendations, and has requested a new, voluntary, safeguards
assessment.
X. Exchange Arrangements
The currency of Cape Verde, the Cape Verde escudo, has been pegged to the euro at a rate of
CVEsc 110.3 per EUR 1 since January 4, 1999. Cape Verde accepted the obligations under
Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement effective July 1, 2004. Cape Verde maintains an
exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions.
XI. Article IV Consultation
Discussions for the 2005 Article IV consultation together with the sixth and final review
under the PRGF arrangement were held in Praia during March 8–23,2005. The Executive
Board concluded the discussions of the Article IV consultations and completed the sixth
review under the PRGF arrangement on May 25, 2005 (Country Report No. 05/320, dated
05/12/05); and www.imf.org.
XII. Technical Assistance
Since 1985, the Fund has provided technical assistance to the Bank of Cape Verde, the
Ministry of Finance, and, more recently, the National Institute of Statistics in several areas:
(i) The Bank of Cape Verde has received technical assistance from MFD in organization and
methods, management of external debt, monetary and banking statistics, accounting, credit,
and foreign exchange operations, management of public debt, and the separation of the
functions of the Bank of Cape Verde, as well as on the choice of exchange rate regime. It has
also received technical assistance from STA in monetary and balance of payments statistics.
(ii) The Ministry of Finance has received technical assistance from FAD in organization and
budgetary procedures, budgeting, tax policy, and tax administration; and (iii) the National
Institute of Statistics has received technical assistance in national accounts and price
statistics. Cape Verde is a participant in STA’s GDDS Regional Project for Lusophone
Africa, and its metadata were posted on the DSBB in February 2004. It is receiving technical
assistance to implement the GDDS plan for improvement in the context of this project.

69
Most recently, technical assistance has been provided in the following areas:
FAD
•

June 2004 follow-up visit to help the authorities move to a VAT, including the
rationalization of the import tariff and the overhaul of the domestic indirect tax
system. Many visits and a two-year resident advisor have gone into this effort.

•

October 2004, one mission to review tax administration, including VAT
implementation, and one mission to assist the assessment of tax exemptions and
incentives.

STA
•

National accounts (November 2003 and January–February 2006), balance of
payments statistics (February 2004), government finance statistics (March 2004,
April 2006), price statistics (June 2004, May–June 2006).

MFD
•

Safeguards assessment (July 2003), accounting, financial systems regulations,
monetary operations and liquidity management (April and May 2004), banking
supervision, liquidity management, exchange regime and reserves management

APPENDIX IV: CAPE VERDE—IMF-WORLD BANK RELATIONS
(June 16, 2006)
Partnership in Cape Verde’s development strategy
1.
The Joint staff advisory note (JSAN) of the Government’s full Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) was discussed in the Board in January 2005. Cape Verde’s strategy
focuses on five key pillars for public intervention: (i) promoting good governance;
(ii) improving competitiveness and private-sector-led growth; (iii) fostering human capital
development; (iv) strengthening social security and solidarity; and (v) improving
infrastructure and land use management. The main development challenges for the country
revolve around: (i) maintaining macroeconomic stability given external vulnerabilities and
uncertainties surrounding resources flows; (ii) achieving further improvements in
governance, especially in a decentralized context; (iii) reforming social expenditure programs
to reflect the changing nature of demand; and (iv) promoting stronger growth and poverty
reduction through improvements in the business climate.
World Bank-Fund collaboration in specific areas
2.
The Fund and the Bank continue to collaborate in many areas, including fiscal
operations and tax reform; public enterprise reform and privatization; public expenditure
management; civil service and pension system reform; utility regulation and private sector
development; and the strengthening of human resource development and the poverty
reduction strategy.
World Bank Group strategy
3.
The Bank’s FY05–08 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was discussed by the Board
in February 2005. It is fully aligned with the PRSP, and supports efforts in the areas of
(i) macroeconomic stability and sound finance and budget systems; (ii) private-led growth
through an enhanced investment climate and increased competitiveness through publicprivate partnerships in infrastructure; and (iii) social programs aimed at alleviating poverty
and inequity.
World Bank Group activities and assessment of country policies
IDA portfolio
4.
The Bank’s strategy aims at supporting the implementation of the Government’s
poverty reduction strategy by focusing in areas where the Bank has a comparative advantage.
The CAS calls for a significant shift towards programmatic lending, complemented by a
multi-sectoral investment operation, to the extent possible every two years. Contributing to
the harmonization agenda, Bank group support aims to catalyze other donors and build
partnerships. Most projects in the IDA portfolio have been rated satisfactory or better.

71
5.
With regard to programmatic lending, a second Poverty Reduction Support Credit
(PRSC-2, US$10 million equivalent) was approved by the Board in June 2006 and, as of
June 16, 2006, is not yet effective. It focuses on three main objectives: (i) promote good
governance, reinforce effectiveness, and guarantee equity; (ii) develop and upgrade human
capital; and (iii) improve the effectiveness and sustainability of the social protection system.
6.
With regard to investment lending, the current World Bank investment portfolio gives
a priority to stabilizing the macroeconomic framework, strengthening competitiveness
(infrastructure and private sector) and building capacity in the social sector (HIV/AIDS).
7.
IDA’s assistance in terms of strengthening the country’s physical infrastructure and
competitiveness, is covered as follows:
•

The Energy/Water Project aims to improve the supply of power, water, and sanitation
systems, to increase operational and end-use efficiency in the power and water,
sectors, to lower the barriers to the development of renewable energy sources, and to
foster the sound management of water resources.

•

The Growth and Competitiveness Project aims to broaden the base of private
participation in Cape Verde's economic growth, enhance private sector
competitiveness and further develop its financial sector. This would be achieved
through a series of actions supported by the project, notably: (a) financial sector
reform, including pension reform; (b) investment climate reform, which includes, but
is not limited to: (i) tax reform, (ii) alleviation of administrative barriers,
(iii) improvement of supply chains, and (iv) legal reform; (c) post privatization and
divestiture reforms; and (d) private sector and institutional capacity building. The
project thus helps to sustain the Government's poverty alleviation efforts by
generating increased employment opportunities through improved international
competitiveness.

•

The Road Sector Support Project aims to support critical road transport infrastructure
needs through all, or a combination of the following approaches: (i) improving access
roads linking villages and rural areas to main roads; (ii) filling critical gaps to
establish a minimum continuous network within an island with the construction of a
short section of new road (8–10 km. on St. Nicolau Island); and (iii) filling a major
gap in an island network, through the construction of bridges or providing access to a
chronically poor access zone.

8.
In the social sectors, an HIV/AIDS Project supports (i) mitigation of the health
and socioeconomic impact of HIV/AIDS at individual, household, and community
levels, thus sustaining an economically productive population, and (ii) establishment of
a strong and sustainable national capacity to respond to the epidemic.
9.
The World Bank, IFC, and MIGA will continue to coordinate their respective roles to
support development activities in Cape Verde.

72
Assessment of country policies
10.
The authorities of Cape Verde and development partners, including the Bank, have
undertaken a substantial body of analytic work to assess key social, structural, and sectoral
development policies and identify policy and institutional reform priorities for poverty
reduction. It allowed inter alia the adoption in April 2003 of a Statement of development
policies for private sector development, which was one of the basic framework to the
preparation of the Growth and competitiveness project.
11.
In FY06 and beyond, advisory services funded by the World Bank are in large part
related to infrastructure, fisheries and economic management (public service reform).
Proposed economic and sector work (ESW) includes core diagnostics, annual public
expenditures reviews (PER) updates, and general economic work to sustain macroeconomic
and sectoral dialogue. The following studies are planned: Investment Climate Assessment
(FY06), Integrated CFAA/CPAR (FY07), Rural Development Assessment (FY07), Long
term Growth and Competitiveness Study (FY08), Poverty Assessment Update (FY08).
12.
As of June 16, 2006, the current IDA portfolio includes five credits, with associated
credit amounts of about US$63 million equivalent and an undisbursed balance of about
US$31 million. The involvement of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in Cape
Verde remains limited (see tables below).

APPENDIX V: CAPE VERDE—STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
The quality of Cape Verde’s economic and financial data are generally adequate
for surveillance and program monitoring, although there is need for substantial
improvements in some areas. Weaknesses in the fiscal data—including with regard to the
accounting of arrears and late payments, financing transactions, and the corresponding large
statistical discrepancies in the provisional quarterly accounts submitted to parliament—is
hampering the monitoring of some aspects of fiscal performance. Weaknesses in the national
accounts, an outdated CPI that lacks sufficient details to adequately track the sources of
inflation pressure, a lack of short-term activity indicators besides the confidence barometer,
and gaps in the tracking of large external flows—notably FDI, emigrant deposits, and
remittances—are other areas of particular concern.
2.
The authorities are taking important steps to strengthen statistics, but the
statistical system still suffers from a shortage of financial and human resources. A
comprehensive master plan has been developed under the direction of the National Statistical
Institute (INE), which assesses the need for upgrading the various agencies that constitute the
statistical system and outlines the steps needed for broadening and improving all areas of
statistics. The plan envisages data improvements in several areas, including national accounts
statistics (annual and quarterly), business statistics (including a new business census),
demographic and social statistics (including a household survey to update the poverty
profile), trade statistics (retail and international trade), macroeconomic indicators, the regular
update of the CPI basket (every half a decade), labor statistics, and sectoral statistics. Cape
Verde’s development partners have already committed a substantial part of the estimated
US$15 million required to implement the plan over 2006–10.
3.
The authorities have signed up to the Fund’s General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS) in February 2004 and benefited from the technical assistance (TA)
provided by STA under the GDDS project for Lusophone Africa. The main purpose of
this TA project was to assist the government of Cape Verde in implementing the plans to
improve GDDS metadata, in particular as regards the adoption of the Government Finance
Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). In this context, a GFS mission visited the country in
March 2004, and there was a recent follow up in April 2006. TA has also been provided in
other areas, including national accounts, consumer prices (with a recent STA mission taking
place in May–June 2006, in preparation for the launching of the new CPI), and balance of
payments statistics.
Real sector
4.
Although some improvements have been made to the national accounts,
significant weaknesses remain. The timeliness of the data has improved, with the National
Statistical Institute (INE) releasing production and expenditure based GDP numbers for
2002–03 in 2005 and providing production based GDP estimates 2004–05 to the mission in

75
May 2006. However, the lag is still large when compared to international standards. The base
year for the constant price estimates is outdated, although INE is currently working on a
complete overhaul of the national accounts. The overhaul includes updating the national
accounts benchmark and base years from 1980 to 2002, and adopting the 1993 SNA. The
final objective is the timely compilation of GDP by industry and expenditure categories at
current and constant prices as well as the institutional sector accounts.
5.
A full implementation of the 1993 SNA would require a substantial improvement
in the source data collection programs for which the capacity is currently lacking. The
2006 STA mission found that there is a critical need for improving the timeliness and
accuracy of the national accounts source data, in particular the business survey. The capacity
of INE staff working on national accounts was found to be overstretched, assessing in detail
and correcting individual source data entries—a task which in most countries is not
undertaken by the national accounts compilers. The statistical master plan will address many
of these challenges.
6.
A new CPI is expected to be released by January 2007. The current official CPI
is obsolete, with weights dating back to 1989, four years before the liberalization of imports
that considerably changed the consumption pattern. INE has worked with the assistance of
the National Statistics Institute of Portugal, and benefited from a STA CPI mission in
April–May, 2006 on introducing the revised CPI. The new index will benefit from new
weights, an updated commodity basket, and new compilation software.
Government finance
7.
Benefiting from TA support under the GDDS project for Lusophone Africa,
progress has been made to improve fiscal data. In terms of data provision, draft
government accounts for 1998–2003 have been submitted to parliament for transmittal to the
Court of Auditors (TdC), and provisional quarterly accounts for 2004 and 2005 have also
been submitted to the parliament. However, capacity constraints have prevented the TdC
from making rapid progress in the final auditing of the accounts.
8.
Serious quality concerns remain, particularly regarding data availability at a
higher frequency. The provisional quarterly fiscal accounts are subject to large statistical
discrepancies and recording of arrears accumulations and clearance operations is not in line
with best practices. Significant delay in donor reporting of project related financing prevents
timely closure of accounts and the separate identification of budget and project financing is
not possible under current reporting standards.
9.
The GFS compilation system is being upgraded as part of the ongoing reforms of
the government’s management and information systems. Most accounts previously held
with commercial banks have been consolidated at the central bank level. In addition,
government agencies’ reporting, as well as the coordination among the treasury, the budget

76
directorates, and the central bank, has improved, with the Ministry of Finance and Planning
being the single point of commitment, execution, and monitoring of public expenditure.
10.
Steps for improving the coverage of extra-budgetary units were outlined during
the STA GFS mission of April 2006. During this mission important advances were also
made in simplifying the conversion of budgetary classifications to GFSM 2001
classifications. However, technical problems with the institutional sectorization and
budgetary registers are still to be resolved. Moreover, work remains to be done to change
statistics on cash basis to accrual basis, and to define a methodology to obtain the stocks of
assets and liabilities in terms of GFSM 2001.
Money and banking
11.
The quality of the monetary and financial statistics is adequate, both in terms of
the accuracy and timeliness of the data. However, more progress needs to be made by the
BCV to start reporting monetary statistics to STA using the standardized report forms
(SRFs), fully aligned with the recommendations of the Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual. Interest rate data need improvement. Published lending rates are based on posted
lending rates and do not adequately reflect the actual weighted lending rates as customers
frequently obtain better terms. Gaps in tracking the source and the direction of changes in
emigrant deposits, moreover, cause difficulties for gauging the appropriateness of the
monetary policy stance.
Balance of payments
12.
With technical assistance from STA, accuracy, periodicity and timeliness of
balance of payments statistics compiled by BCV have continued to improve. A greater
use of surveys, combined with the International Transactions Reporting System implemented
by the BCV, has permitted a significant expansion of data sources and statistical coverage,
which, to a large extent, follow the recommendations of the 5th edition of the Balance of
Payments Manual. Reporting of BOP data to AFR has been regular and quarterly data for the
first quarter of 2006 are already disseminated on the BCV website. However, the timeliness
of reporting of BOP statistics to STA needs to be improved. The latest data published in IFS
refer to 2003.
External debt and arrears
13.
Despite the recent revision of the historical data on external debt, significant
weaknesses in accounting still exist and hamper the preparation of reliable debt
sustainability analyses. Multilateral debt statistics regularly differ from data received by
creditors and debt service projections cannot be reconciled with the debt stock.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
July 31, 2006
1.
This statement provides an update on economic and policy developments since the
issuance of the staff report. These developments do not change the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
2.
The government of Cape Verde has assumed majority ownership of the major
electricity and water public utility, Electra. This followed an agreement reached on July 24
between the government and the Portuguese consortium EDP/ADP prompted by the
intervention of the Portuguese government. Under the agreement, EDP/ADP will recapitalize
Electra and the company's ownership structure will be changed to give the Cape Verde
government and municipalities a majority share. The agreement does not appear to have
fiscal implications for Cape Verde although full details are not yet available. The authorities
have signaled that Electra will continue to be run on fully commercial terms.
3.
The government of the United Kingdom has indicated that, as part of its debt relief
initiative, the United Kingdom will pay its share (10 percent) of Cape Verde’s debt service to
IDA and the African Development Bank (AfDB) from January 1, 2006. The resources
released by this payment, amounting to just over $0.5 million in 2006, will be spent on
poverty reducing investments in line with Cape Verde’s national poverty reduction plan.
4.
CPI inflation was 0.5 percent in the month of June 2006 and 7 percent in the year to
June. The latest monthly outturn includes a fall of 0.9 percent in food prices, reflecting a
reversal of recent supply-induced shortfalls in fish, fruit, and vegetables, and a 7.4 percent
rise in energy and water prices.

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with Cape Verde
On July 31, 2006 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Cape Verde and approved Cape Verde’s
request for a three-year Policy Support Instrument (PSI).1
Background
Cape Verde’s economic and policy performance has strengthened significantly over
recent years. International reserves have built up, adding credibility to the exchange rate
peg to the euro; the fiscal position has improved, with fiscal restraint maintained through
the recent election cycle—a marked break from the past; and important progress has
been made with privatization and other structural reforms. Reflecting the stronger policy
environment, growth has averaged 5½ percent since 2000, supported by rising inflows
of external financing from official and private sources.
Following a Fund staff-monitored program in the second half of 2001, the authorities’
economic program in 2002–05 was supported by an arrangement with the IMF under
the PRGF. With the PRGF arrangement having ended in July 2005, the government has
requested that its economic program for 2006–09 be supported by the IMF under the
PSI. The government’s medium-term development strategy is set out in the Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), which focuses on combating poverty and promoting
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities.

80
private sector-led growth. In particular, the PRSP includes measures to strengthen
education, training, health care, and sanitation, underpinned by improvements in
governance and the development of infrastructure.
Considering recent developments, GDP growth is estimated to have increased to nearly
6 percent in 2005, supported by increased private investment—especially in tourism
related construction—and a higher execution rate of public investment projects. After
falling for much of 2003–05, prices have recently increased sharply: food prices have
risen as a result of temporary, supply-driven factors, and regulated prices of fuel,
electricity, and water have increased following the rise in international oil prices and the
elimination of fuel subsidies (see below). In view of the negative impact of these price
rises on private sector purchasing power, coupled with some delays in implementing the
2006 public investment program, GDP growth in 2006 may be slightly weaker than in
2005—possibly around 5½ percent.
The current account deficit declined to 4½ percent of GDP in 2005 (from over
14 percent of GDP in 2004), mainly because of strong growth of exports and
remittances, along with importers’ use of broader-based and cheaper sources of
supplies. This improvement in the external position enabled Cape Verde’s official
international reserves to continue to build, reaching 3 months of prospective imports at
the end of 2005 (up from 2.4 months a year earlier). Strong capital inflows, together with
lower reserve requirements and slow private sector credit growth, have led to an
increase in excess liquidity in the banking sector. In response, banks have increased
their holdings of foreign assets and pursued domestic lending opportunities more
aggressively, while the Bank of Cape Verde has started to sell central bank securities to
absorb liquidity.
The buildup in official reserves has been supported by ongoing fiscal restraint. The
overall fiscal deficit (including grants) was just over 5 percent of GDP in 2005: while
higher than in 2004, the outturn for 2005 reflected an increase in the provision of
concessional external loans and a delay in the disbursement of external grants. With the
deficit financed in part by government asset sales, domestic debt declined to 33 percent
of GDP at end-2005.
On the structural front, the government is moving forward with a range of reforms to
improve public financial management and public administration. The government is also
close to completing its privatization agenda, with TACV (the national airline) currently
being restructured in preparation for its privatization and the bidding process getting
under way for ENAPOR (the port operator). An important step in addressing the longstanding financial difficulties facing Electra (the electricity and water company) was the
increase in electricity and water tariffs (by 25.4 and 13.3 percent, respectively) as of

81
June 1, 2006, following the government’s decision to eliminate fuel subsidies in the 2006
budget. The independent economic regulatory agency has also signaled its commitment
to fully implement an automatic mechanism to adjust these tariffs to reflect changes in
input costs and provide incentives for efficiency improvements.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors recognized that the government’s economic strategy has been anchored by a
build-up in international reserves that has strengthened the exchange rate peg to the
Euro; improvements in the fiscal position despite election pressures; and progress in
privatization and other structural reforms.
Directors observed that Cape Verde’s strengthened macroeconomic stability and policy
credibility have supported solid economic growth and sound development prospects.
They commented in particular on the pickup in foreign direct investment over recent
years, along with the strong outlook for investment, especially in tourism and
infrastructure. However, while medium-term prospects are favorable, Directors noted
that Cape Verde remains vulnerable to external shocks and dependent on foreign aid
and remittances.
Directors agreed that the policy priority is to work to accelerate growth within a stable
macroeconomic environment. Key requirements are to safeguard the exchange rate
peg, contain fiscal risks, and improve management in the public sector. They concurred
that the fixed exchange rate has served Cape Verde well—noting the favorable
evolution of the real exchange rate and exports, and they welcomed the focus on
increasing foreign exchange coverage in support of the exchange rate peg.
Directors lauded the authorities’ commitment to fiscal restraint to help address pressures
that may arise over the long term from public pension liabilities, a growing demand for
public services, and a decline in concessional external support. They welcomed the
authorities’ plans to create fiscal space by reducing domestic debt as a share of GDP,
rationalizing the current system of tax exemptions, and better prioritizing public
spending. Directors also emphasized the importance of the measures taken in the 2006
budget to eliminate fuel subsidies and clear arrears, and noted that containing the wage
bill will be essential for achieving budget objectives.
Directors agreed that the authorities’ macroeconomic objectives will be supported by
measures to improve public sector management, especially in drawing up and executing
budgets, and reforming the civil service to increase capacity and productivity. They
endorsed the attention to public sector and regulatory reform, and urged the authorities

82
to complete the privatization agenda and push ahead with measures to improve the
business environment.
Directors noted the recent energy sector developments that have resulted once again in
the state’s acquisition of a majority shareholding in Electra. They emphasized the need
to avoid fiscal risks from this source and called on the authorities to ensure that Electra
is run on commercial terms and under a regulatory framework that will support much
needed investment in electricity and water supplies. Directors strongly supported Cape
Verde’s commitment to ensuring that financial sector development, especially in the
rapidly growing offshore financial center, takes place under institutional and regulatory
conditions that are in line with international best practice. Implementing the AML/CFT
legislation will be important, as well as criminalizing terrorist financing in line with the UN
Convention.
In welcoming the PRSP annual progress report, Directors encouraged the authorities to
continue pursuing reforms consistent with the PRSP pillars. They urged implementation
of the recommendations of the Joint Staff Advisory Note, including on improving the
quality of primary education, access to health services, and the scope and timeliness of
data for monitoring the PRSP.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of
the IMF's views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the
country (or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article
IV consultations with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional
level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with
longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of
general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Press Release No. 06/172
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 1, 2006

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Approves a Three-Year Policy Support Instrument for Cape Verde
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved a three-year Policy
Support Instrument (PSI) for Cape Verde under the IMF's newly created PSI framework, which
is intended to support the nation's economic reform efforts.
Cape Verde's PSI is designed to enhance the sustainability of growth and development by
maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment and moving forward with structural reforms.
Specific attention is given to reducing fiscal risks and giving Cape Verde a margin of safety to
protect the economy against exogenous shocks. Approval of a PSI for Cape Verde signifies IMF
endorsement of the policies outlined in the program.
The IMF's framework for PSIs is designed for low-income countries that may not need, or want,
IMF financial assistance, but still seek IMF advice, monitoring and endorsement of their policies.
PSIs are voluntary and demand driven. PSI-supported programs are based on country-owned
poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory process involving civil society and
development partners and articulated in a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). This is
intended to ensure that PSI-supported programs are consistent with a comprehensive framework
for macroeconomic, structural and social policies to foster growth and reduce poverty. Members'
performance under a PSI is normally reviewed semi-annually, irrespective of the status of the
program. (see Public Information Notice No. 05/145).
Following the Executive Board's discussion of Cape Verde, on Monday, July 31, 2006,
Mr. Agustín Carstens, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, said:
“Cape Verde’s economic and policy performance remains sound. GDP growth is estimated to
have reached nearly 6 percent in 2005, supported by strong private and public investment. The
favorable investment outlook—especially in tourism and infrastructure development—bodes
well for growth in the years ahead. While inflation has picked up recently, influenced by
temporary increases in food prices and higher international oil prices, it is expected to fall
sharply over the coming year.
“Underpinning Cape Verde’s positive economic climate, the government has shown a clear
commitment to maintain prudent macroeconomic policies and push ahead with structural

85

reforms. Key support for growing policy credibility has come from the build-up of foreign
exchange rate reserves to back the fixed exchange rate peg to the euro; from improvements in
fiscal discipline; and from progress with privatization and other measures to improve economic
efficiency and reduce fiscal risks.
“The priorities in the program supported by the three-year Policy Support Instrument are to
further increase foreign reserve coverage and create fiscal space in anticipation of possible
pressures on public spending or financing. Specific measures include reducing domestic debt as a
share of GDP, rationalizing tax exemptions, and better prioritizing public spending.
“The new program also emphasizes public sector and regulatory reforms. Particular attention
will be given to strengthening public sector financial management and civil service capacities;
improving the regulatory framework for the energy sector, including through full implementation
of the tariff adjustment mechanisms for electricity and water; and ensuring that financial sector
development, especially in the rapidly growing offshore financial sector, takes place in line with
international best practice,” Mr. Carstens said.

86

ANNEX
Recent Economic Developments
Cape Verde’s economic and policy performance has strengthened significantly in the recent
years, supported by reforms pursued under the country’s first Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) arrangement. International reserves have increased, adding credibility to the
exchange rate peg to the euro. The fiscal position has improved and, in a marked break from the
past, fiscal restraint held firm through the recent elections. Privatization and other structural
reforms are moving ahead. Reflecting the improved policy environment, growth has averaged
around 5 percent since 2000, supported by strong inflows of external financing from both private
and official sources.
Program Summary
Cape Verde’s program under the PSI aims to provide a consistent and coherent economic policy
framework to underpin the Government’s medium-term development objectives. Key policy
measures in the program include:
•

Increasing foreign exchange coverage to strengthen further the credibility and resilience
of the exchange rate peg;

•

Decreasing the burden of domestic debt and clearing remaining domestic arrears;

•

Strengthening public finance management capacity, expenditure control, and revenue
performance;

•

Pursuing structural reforms to reduce fiscal risks and support efficiency improvements in
the economy;

•

Regulatory reforms to ensure that financial sector development takes place within a
sound institutional framework

Statement by Damian Ondo Mañe, Executive Director for Cape Verde
July 31, 2006

I.

Introduction

On behalf of my Cape Verdean authorities, I would like to thank staff for the constructive
policy dialogue and candid exchanges during the discussions held in Praia. My authorities are
of the view that the staff report is accurately informative of the challenges they face and the
commitment of the authorities to the reform agenda.
Since 2001, the authorities have been implementing a strong reform program in order to
correct severe imbalances in the economy, raise economic growth and reduce poverty. The
reform program was consistent with the country’s medium-term development goals as
articulated in the authorities’ PRSP.
The authorities have made good progress in the implementation of the program.
Macroeconomic policies have been broadly consistent with the objective of achieving
stability and reducing the economy’s vulnerability to external shocks. All quantitative
performance criteria were met and poverty was drastically reduced so much as to propel
Cape Verde out of the low income countries group. These achievements enabled Cape Verde
to become one of the first group of countries to qualify for U.S. assistance under the
Millennium Challenge Corporation which puts a strong premium on governance and
soundness of the country’s policies.
The authorities are very grateful to the Fund for its advice and support, and welcome a
continued close policy dialogue. However, as Cape Verde does not need Fund financial
assistance presently, but want to continue the reform program to strengthen the country’s
economic and policy performance, the authorities are requesting a PSI arrangement, the
details of which are provided in their Letter of Intent, Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Policies and the Technical Memorandum of Understanding. The authorities view
the PSI as a suitable instrument to support their reform efforts. The significant improvement
in the economic and financial situation is helping to move Cape Verde to the rank of middle
income countries. The commitment to reforms and the progress achieved should also enable
Cape Verde to rely more on the capital markets for its financial resources. However, the
authorities have indicated that they will follow a very prudent approach as regards
borrowing. Their intention, presently, is to bring down the debt ratio.
The program supported by the PSI aims at providing a consistent and coherent economic
policy framework to underpin the Government’s medium-term development objectives. More
broadly, the program is designed to enhance the sustainability of growth and development by
maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment and continuing with structural reforms.
Through the PSI, the authorities seek a support to their development strategy as laid out in
the PRSP whose goal is to reduce macroeconomic vulnerabilities to exogenous shocks, and
address the prospect of a longer-term decline in highly concessional external support.

89
II.

Recent Economic Development

Economic and policy performance continued to be strong in 2005. Real GDP growth was
high, at almost 6% led by an increase in private investment in the tourism sector and a higher
execution rate of public investment. Although inflation remained subdued overall since 2003,
a spike was recently recorded due to temporary supply shocks in the food and energy sectors.
Fiscal discipline was maintained, despite the electoral cycle. Strong domestic revenues were
collected from the divesture of governments financial and non financial assets. The
authorities maintained a prudent stance with regards to spending, which enable them to
reduce net domestic borrowing. Nonetheless, fiscal pressures appeared in 2005 due to a delay
in the disbursement of a budget grant and the increase in the wage bill. The latter spending
was required to hire and promote additional teachers and security personnel.
Monetary policy was geared towards the safeguard of the peg to the Euro. The external assets
position of the country strengthened with the accumulation of reserves and non-energy
inflation remained subdued. The stock of international reserves increased from 2.4 months of
prospective imports in 2004 to 3 months in December 2005. The recent spike in inflation is
related to a one time adjustment of energy prices paid by consumers to align them with the
market prices. While my authorities remain vigilant to the risks of a pass-through of high oil
prices which may reduce growth, they point out that these are temporary supply shocks and
that there is ample margin for policy action to address these risks should they materialize.
The prudential indicators of the banking sector and financial services remained strong, and
financial intermediation deepened. However, due to a large inflow of foreign exchange
stemming from remittances, estimated at 40 percent of total deposits, and export growth,
excess reserves of commercial banks increased. The Bank of Cape Verde, therefore
undertook to sell securities in order to absorb the excess liquidity. The payment system was
upgraded with the deployment of a network of automatic cash counters and the expansion of
credit card services. The offshore financial sector grew rapidly also. In total the banking
sector assets have grown by 20% since 2004 to reach 90 percent of nominal GDP.
My authorities have continued to implement the structural reform agenda. A new
management team was selected to redress TACV in preparation for its privatization. The
privatization of the port operator, ENAPOR is well under way. Overall, the government plan
to complete in 2006 its privatization process with the sale or liquidation of the remaining four
public companies.
An agreement was reached in the conflict between the government and the majority private
shareholders of ELECTRA regarding tariff deficit that the government owed to the company
because of subsidies to electricity and water. My authorities decided to eliminate the fuel
subsidies starting in June 2006 and the price of water was adjusted upward to reflect market
developments.
Other structural reforms were undertaken in relation to Cape Verde's impending WTO
accession.

Macroeconomic and Structural Policies for the Medium Term

The medium-term strategy is consistent with the PRSP which is aimed at enhancing growth
prospects and reducing poverty through private sector-led development and diversification of
economic activities. The priorities are (i) improving human capacities; (ii) strengthening and
developing infrastructure and institutions; and (iii) improving governance and the capacity of
the public sector to implement policy reforms.
The medium-term strategy aims at preserving macroeconomic stability and addressing the
economy’s vulnerabilities to external shocks. The key objectives are raising the average
economic growth rate to 6–7 percent in 2007–09, bringing the inflation rate to close to zero
in 2007–08 and stabilizing it at 2–3 percent thereafter. The program also aims at increasing
the level of international reserves by 0.1 months of imports per year, and lowering public
debt to below 70 percent by 2009
Fiscal Policy and Public Sector Reforms
To meet the program’s fiscal objectives, my authorities are committed to ongoing restraint
of current spending, combined with structural reforms to improve revenue performance and
improve financial management. In this regard, the authorities are taking steps to rationalize
and streamline tax incentives and exemptions, implement an automatic mechanism for
adjusting electricity and water tariffs, establish a macroeconomic policy unit at the Ministry
of Finance to help in improving the formulation of fiscal policy and coordinating with overall
macroeconomic objectives, and strengthen internal and external audit process. In addition,
the government is committed to financing the public investment program primarily through
concessional external loan.
Monetary and Financial Sector Policies Reforms
Monetary policy under the PSI will focus on preserving the exchange rate peg with the Euro.
This policy provides a strong anchor to inflation expectations and a cushion against
exogenous shocks for the benefit of investors. Under the PSI, the authorities plan to build up
international reserves as noted above. Credit to the central government will be reduced thus
allowing for an increase in credit to the private sector, which should support the development
of private sector activities. Moreover, as emigrants deposits play such an important role in
the economy, the central bank will move forward with the tracking of gross inflows and
outflows of these deposits to support its analysis of the interest sensitivity of the flows. My
authorities are committed to the strengthening of the operational framework for monetary
policy and the modernization of the regulation and supervision of financial institutions. A
task force has been organized by the BCV which will draft an Action Plan based on Fund
advice.
Other Structural Reforms
Structural reforms will focus on improving the business climate and enhancing the
competitiveness of the economy. Notably, my authorities have engaged discussions aimed at
introducing more flexibility in the labor market; a modern regulatory framework has been

91
drafted with a view of liberalizing the telecom market; and a modern information technology
system is being deployed in the public service under the e-government initiative in order to
remove administrative obstacle to the private sector. Moreover, trade reforms are being
implemented and a decision on accession to the WTO is expected in 2006.
Program for 2006–07
Within the framework set forth by the medium-term plan the authorities plan to frontload the
implementation of key measures during the 2006–07 budget cycle.
On fiscal policy, my authorities plan to strengthen revenue collection and management while
rationalizing spending. They expect an inflow stemming from privatizations and land sale
receipts which are projected to reach 3.7 percent of GDP. Further resources will be made
available by the elimination of petroleum subsidies. These resources will be used to continue
to reduce domestic debt to 25 percent of GDP by end-2007. A provision to significantly
reduce arrears has been made and it is expected that one-third of the end-2005 stock of
arrears will be cleared in 2006.
On monetary policy my authorities intend to take steps to strengthen the exchange rate peg
to the Euro. The gross international reserves of the BCV are accordingly programmed to
increase by CVESC 2.1 million in 2006 and 2.3 million in 2007, which represents 3.2 months
of prospective imports. While ceilings on the growth of domestic assets will be implemented,
the BCV will enhance its analysis and tracking of emigrant deposits inflows and outflows.
The strengthening of the financial sector is also a key priority that the authorities wish to
address by 2007. The policy action will be informed by the ad-hoc task force
recommendations. In priority, BCV’s capacity to conduct surveillance and the regulations of
IFI’s will be enhanced.
IV.

Conclusion

Cape Verde’s economic and financial performance has improved significantly in the recent
past supported by a PRGF arrangement. Nevertheless, Cape Verde continues to remain
vulnerable to exogenous shocks and the country still faces important development
challenges. To address the challenges, my authorities are determined to further the reform
agenda in close collaboration with the Fund and other development partners, so that
Cape Verde can move up the economic ladder and be soon among the emerging market
economies. My authorities are confident that this can be achieved. To help them implement
their ambitious program of reform, the authorities are requesting Fund support under a PSI.
In view of their commitment and full ownership of the program and their excellent past
policy performance, I request the support of Directors for my Cape Verdean request.
