STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 1, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context. The economy has slowed considerably due to weak activity in main trading partners, a
contraction in public investment, and the effects of uncertainty on household consumption and
firms’ hiring and investment decisions. The recent turbulence in global financial markets has led to
an increase in zloty volatility and sovereign spreads, although the latter remain low by historical
standards. Going forward, economic activity is expected to pick up gradually in the second half of
2013, as growth in key trading partners recovers.
Interconnectedness. Substantial trade and financial linkages with euro area countries make
Poland vulnerable to spillovers from the region, and its open capital account makes it susceptible
to shifts in investor sentiment. Poland’s integration into the German supply chain has served it
well, but has also increased the impact of (positive and negative) external shocks. This points to
the importance of continuing to build policy buffers to increase resilience to shocks.
Monetary policy. The monetary easing cycle that began in November 2012 is welcome, given
muted inflation pressures and still high real interest rates. Monetary policy is the main
macroeconomic policy tool to support the economy.
Fiscal policy. Fiscal consolidation has continued, but the economic slowdown poses challenges
going forward. Despite limited space, there is scope for fiscal policy to balance structural
consolidation with support for the economy by allowing automatic stabilizers to operate in 2013.
As the economy recovers, additional fiscal consolidation will be needed to put the public debt
ratio firmly on a downward path and rebuild fiscal buffers.
Financial sector policy. The banking sector has remained well capitalized, liquid, and profitable,
but credit growth has stalled. Banking supervision has improved, but further efforts are needed.
Relatively high impaired loans need to be addressed by tackling legal and tax obstacles. The
authorities have continued to work on the legal frameworks for macroprudential supervision and
bank resolution.
Structural reforms. Additional measures to increase labor participation and raise potential
growth are needed. These include reform of the occupational pension schemes, further efforts to
reduce administrative burdens, and changes to the insolvency regime. The launch of the public
investment fund could support growth and help offset a decline in public investment, but it is
crucial the fund’s corporate governance and operations are transparent and accountable.

CONTEXT
1.
Poland is highly integrated with Europe through both trade and financial channels
(Appendix I). Although Poland is less dependent on trade and cross-border bank flows than some of
its Eastern European neighbors, it plays a key role in the German supply chain (Box 1). This has
shaped its trade and financial ties with Europe and, to some extent, the rest of the world.


About 70 percent of Poland’s domestic value added is exported to, and consumed in, Europe.
More than 90 percent of the stock of inward foreign direct investment (which represents about
36 percent of GDP) originates from Europe.



The foreign claims of BIS reporting banks amount to almost 60 percent of GDP, of which
80 percent are accounted for by assets of foreign European bank subsidiaries and cross-border
funding from European banks. In turn, Polish subsidiaries have become an important source of
earnings for some European parent banks.



Spillovers from the euro area—through trade, financial, and confidence channels—therefore
remain a key source of risk facing Poland.

2.
Poland is also linked with global financial markets through its open capital account.
Significant foreign investment in the government bond market—particularly since 2008–09—has
increased Poland’s integration with international capital markets. Given Poland’s relatively deep and
liquid financial markets, investors often use the zloty as a proxy for exposure to, or hedging against,
risk in the region. This exposes Poland to more generalized shifts in investor sentiment, including on
account of turbulence in global financial markets or shifts in risk appetite for emerging market
assets.
3.
Despite its resilience in recent years and very strong fundamentals, the economy has
weakened significantly over the past year. The slowdown appears to be cyclical, as growth in
Poland’s main trading partners (notably Germany) has weakened, with knock-on effects on
consumer and business confidence (and, therefore, private consumption and investment). Several of
the factors that helped keep domestic demand resilient following the 2008-09 global financial
crisis—including fiscal expansion, rising EU structural fund inflows (which supported public
investment), and ample credit—have reversed and are now headwinds to the recovery. As a result,
growth in 2013 is projected to be lower than in 2009. At the same time, fiscal space is limited
(notably by the proximity of public debt to national legal thresholds), suggesting that the policy mix
will need to rely on monetary policy to cushion the economy. A fundamental question is whether
domestic demand will bounce back, or whether confidence effects and uncertainty will continue to
weigh on private consumption and investment. Given Poland’s exposure to shocks, rebuilding policy
buffers—including through medium-term fiscal consolidation, maintaining reserve adequacy, and
further strengthening the resilience of the financial sector—remains essential.
4.
The political situation is stable, but reform momentum has lost some steam. The ruling
coalition has maintained a slim majority in Parliament, but forthcoming elections at the local level
and the need to manage the weak economy appear to have reduced the appetite for further major
reforms.

Box 1. Economic Integration into the German Supply Chain:
Benefits and Challenges for Poland1
In Europe, the emergence of vertical specialization has been particularly evident among German firms.
The German-Central European Supply Chain (GCESC) has expanded rapidly since the mid-1990s, led by
favorable “pull” factors (such as proximity and high labor-cost differentials) in Central European countries,
notably the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia (CE4, hereafter).
Exports from the CE4 are skewed toward “downstream” activities, although to a lesser extent in
Poland. The value-added decomposition of aggregate exports from these countries suggests that trade
specialization is mainly in “downstream” activities and exposure to the rest of world is greater than what
traditional metrics suggest. Poland stands out as a more balanced case, with downstream and upstream
activities more equally represented in its bilateral trade ties. A possible explanation is the larger size and
deeper diversification of Poland’s economy. Moreover, its export exposure (based on final demand) implies
that its links to the rest of the world are significantly higher than what is suggested by traditional metrics.
Staff analysis finds that the integration of the CE4 into the German supply chain has had significant
positive macroeconomic effects on both the real and financial side.

The foreign value-added and the domestic value-added embodied in CE4 exports are strong
complements rather than substitutes, with this finding strongest for Poland and Hungary.

Integration into the German supply chain has contributed to higher long-term real GDP growth and
fostered income convergence. Indeed, Poland’s convergence outpaces that of most other countries in Europe
and in the CE4. This has occurred because of positive domestic spillovers from integration into the supply
chain in terms of increased domestic capital formation and technological transfer.

Supply chains links have shaped the CE4’s financial accounts towards a greater reliance on long-term
capital flows (notably FDI), making them less prone to capital account reversals.
At the same time, integration into the supply chain has considerably increased the CE4’s exposure to
the German business cycle and global shocks.

The co-movement of CE4 and German business cycles has deepened over the years, especially in Poland,
and the exposure (based on final demand) of the CE4 to non-European trading partners is significantly higher
than in the past. Poland’s exposure vis-à-vis the rest of the world increased by 10 percentage points when the
concept of final demand (as opposed to traditional measures) for exports was used.

Model-based simulations confirm that the transmission of global shocks to the CE4 is more pronounced
than in the past and could become even larger if German balance sheets were weaker.
Policy implications for Poland and the rest of the CE4 are geared towards securing and maximizing the
benefits generated by the supply-chain links, while continuing to increase resilience to shocks. Given its
current balanced model of trade integration, the challenge for Poland is to safeguard its privileged place in
the supply chain by moving up the value added chain, to compensate for labor cost convergence that will
inevitably take place. This will require upgrading the skills of the labor force, through education and
vocational training, continuing to improve the business environment to support entrepreneurship and
innovation, and boosting investment (especially in infrastructure). Pressing ahead with efforts to build policy
buffers—notably by continuing with fiscal consolidation and further strengthening the resilience of the
financial system—will also be important to improve Poland’s resilience to shocks.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
A. The Economy has Lost Steam
5.
Poland’s economy has slowed, amid weak external and domestic demand (Figures 1
and 2). Real GDP growth moderated to 1.9 percent in 2012 from 4.5 percent in 2011. A slowdown in
Poland’s main export markets, combined with uncertain prospects for euro area growth and a sharp
drop in public investment, weighed on demand and output, particularly in the construction and
industrial sectors. This also led firms to hold back investment and hiring decisions, and to draw
down inventories. In the face of adverse confidence effects, sluggish disposable income, falling real
wage growth, and rising unemployment, household consumption slowed markedly. Relatively tight
monetary and credit conditions, present until late 2012, contributed to the slowdown. High
frequency indicators have been mixed.
6.
Inflation has fallen sharply below the lower band of the target range (Figure 3).
Headline CPI inflation hovered above the upper band of the target range (1½–3½ percent) during
2011 and the first three quarters of 2012, but declined rapidly since then to 0.5 percent in May as a
result of weak demand, muted wage pressure, and lower fuel and energy prices. Core inflation also
dropped considerably, to 1 percent in May from 2.3 percent in the previous year. Inflation
expectations have continued to ease.
7.
The current account deficit narrowed considerably to 3½ percent of GDP in 2012—its
lowest reading since 2005 (Figure 4). The trade deficit shrank as imports decreased for the first
time since 2009 (reflecting weak domestic demand), while export growth slowed, but remained
positive. Exports were sustained by gains in market share and a modest expansion towards non-euro
area European Union and central and eastern European countries, which helped offset a drop in
exports to the euro area, particularly motor vehicles, televisions and engines. The change in Poland’s
balance of payments compilation system two years ago continued to bear fruit as errors and
omissions fell to -0.7 percent of GDP in 2012 from about -1.8 percent in 2011.

B. Despite Recent Turbulence, Financial Conditions have been Broadly
Supportive
8.
After remaining relatively tight through most of 2012, domestic financial conditions
improved (Figure 5). A financial conditions index (FCI) constructed for Poland indicates that overall
financial conditions started to contribute positively to growth in late 2012 (Box 2). This positive
contribution has mainly originated from a decline in the key interbank benchmark rate (3-month
WIBOR) in response to monetary policy easing (which began in November 2012).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

Box 2. A Financial Conditions Index for Poland1
A financial conditions index (FCI) can be used to explore the link between financial conditions and
the real economic activity. An FCI combines a wide range of high-frequency financial variables to assess
aggregate financial conditions in the economy. The resulting data provide information on the evolution of
financial conditions over time, and help to identify and examine the extent of macro-financial linkages. The
FCI can also be used to gauge the impact of monetary policy decisions on the real economy since it captures
important channels of monetary transmission. By including external variables in the construction of the FCI,
it can also capture external spillovers on domestic financial conditions and economic activity.
Two complementary approaches were used to construct an FCI for Poland: factor analysis (FA), which
aims at extracting the “common factor” from a wide range of financial variables, and vector auto-regression
(VAR), which allows for the expression of FCI in terms of contribution to GDP growth. A group of domestic
financial indicators and external financial indicators are selected to construct the FCI. The FA-based FCI is
driven by both external and domestic factors. For the VAR-based FCI, domestic factors dominate: the WIBOR
rate, lending standards, and the corporate loan spread contribute most to the FCI. Nonetheless, external
financial indicators (VIX, S&P 500, and EURIBOR-OIS spread) are also important, as they have both a direct
and indirect impact on growth—the latter through their influence on domestic financial conditions.

Financial conditions in Poland improved in the first quarter of 2013. This reflected easing monetary
conditions following significant cuts in policy interest rates, as well as the very favorable external financial
conditions that prevailed in the first quarter. The model results suggest that, all else equal, overall financial
conditions in the first quarter of 2013 could have a cumulative positive impact of 5 percentage points on
growth in the third quarter of 2013 (since the FCI is estimated to operate with a 2 quarter lag). However, the
model does not incorporate important factors that are likely to continue to be a drag on growth, including
limited fiscal space, weak external demand, and uncertainty effects (such as firms holding back investment
and hiring decisions). Moreover, the recent tightening of external financial conditions is also likely to weigh
on growth going forward. For these reasons, the overall impact on growth is likely to be substantially more
muted than suggested by the model.

External financial conditions have been generally favorable, despite the recent
increase in volatility. As in recent years, the current account in 2012 was mostly financed by EU
transfers and FDI, notwithstanding a reduction in net FDI inflows. Moderate outflows from the
domestic banking system were more than offset by strong portfolio inflows into the government
bond market. As a result, the share of foreign holdings of government bonds increased further to
37 percent, a historical high. EMBI spreads dropped from 350 bps at end-2011 to around 140 bps,
and sovereign CDS spreads fell by about 150 bps since end-2011 to about 120 bps. This allowed the
government to pre-fund 80 percent of its 2013 financing needs by end-May. The zloty remained
relatively stable and implied volatility low through late May. More recently, volatility has increased in
line with global trends in emerging market countries.

Poland’s external position is broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals (Box 3).
The (cyclically adjusted) current account deficit and real effective exchange rate (REER) are broadly in
line with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies according to the External Balance
Assessment models. International reserves rose by $11 billion in 2012 (to $109 billion) and are
broadly adequate: the gap between international reserves and the current account deficit plus
short-term debt at remaining maturities is projected to be closed by the end of 2013 as the
authorities continue to build reserve buffers. Poland has a large stock of external debt, which is
expected to have peaked at 74 percent of GDP in 2012 and is projected to be on a gradual
downward path. Stress scenarios suggest that external debt is relatively resilient to interest rate,
growth, and current account shocks, but would increase sharply under a substantial depreciation of
the zloty (Figure 6). Near-term gross external financing needs are significant, estimated at 23
percent of GDP in 2013, mainly reflecting parent bank funding and intra-company loans.

C. The Banking System has Remained Resilient
11.
The largely foreign-owned banking system has remained well-capitalized, profitable,
and liquid (Figure 7). The average ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets increased further to
15½ percent (with core tier 1 capital adequacy at 13¾ percent) at end-March, supported by
retained profits. Profitability was strong in 2012 on account of high interest income, and, in some

appropriate policies, but with some potential vulnerabilities.

Model-based estimates suggest that the current account and the REER are broadly in line
with fundamentals. The 2012 cyclically-adjusted current account deficit was 2.8 percent of GDP,
about 1 percentage point wider than the current account norm estimated by the External Balance
Assessment (EBA) model.1 The REER at end-2012 was 3 percent less than the EBA model estimate.

Net IIP liabilities are large at over 60 percent of GDP, but are mostly comprised of diversified
FDI liabilities and intra-company lending. In contrast to some other countries in Central and
Eastern Europe, FDI liabilities in Poland are more diversified and comprise both the tradable and
non-tradable sectors.

EU transfers and net FDI finance the bulk of the current account deficit. However, net
financial inflows in 2012 were at their lowest level (as a percent of GDP) since 2006.2 The other
investment account experienced outflows from the banking system. Net foreign direct investment
flows also slowed. However, foreign appetite for government bonds remained strong. While this
has helped reduce Poland’s sovereign spreads and yields, it has also increased its vulnerability to
a reversal of investor appetite.

International reserves are broadly adequate, exceeding most indicators of reserve adequacy.
Reserves at the end of 2012 covered about 140 percent the IMF reserve adequacy metric, within
the recommended range.3 However, they remain somewhat lower than the recommended
100 percent of short-term debt at remaining maturities plus the current account deficit in 2012,
but should reach that threshold by end 2013. The FCL arrangement with the IMF also serves as a
precautionary buffer against external shocks.

12.
The banking system reduced its reliance on foreign currency (FX) funding (Figure 8).
Regulatory and supervisory actions to curb FX-denominated mortgages have borne fruit. A sharp
drop in new FX mortgage lending is leading to a gradual decline in the stock of these mortgages (as
existing loans are repaid) and a reduction in banks’ on-balance sheet open FX positions. Banks have
increasingly contracted cross-currency interest rate swaps instead of short-term FX swaps to hedge
currency risk—the former have a longer tenor which should help reduce FX liquidity risks. The cost
of hedging has also dropped substantially. Funding withdrawal by (mainly European) parent banks
continued in the first half of 2012, but has begun to ease. Nordea sold its Polish subsidiary—which
has a substantial foreign currency loan portfolio and a loan-to-deposit ratio of about 200 percent—
to the largest Polish bank, PKO BP. Under the terms of the sale, and to help defray credit and
liquidity risk, Nordea will provide PLN 15.2 billion (about 50 percent of the subsidiary’s liabilities) in
FX financing for 7 years and cover up to half of losses on the subsidiary’s mortgage portfolio for the
next 4 years.
13.
Credit expansion has slowed, and impaired loans have increased. Credit growth
decelerated to 3½ percent in the first quarter of 2013 (down from 11 percent a year ago), on the
back of weak credit demand and tight lending policies by banks, particularly with respect to SME
lending. The impaired loan ratio inched up to 9 percent mainly due to deterioration in the corporate
loan portfolio, reflecting rising bankruptcies (notably in the construction sector). Looking ahead, the
senior loan officer survey suggests an easing of bank lending policies for households and a rise in
demand for household loans. A new government-sponsored program to partially guarantee SME
credit should help ease credit constraints to these firms.1

1

Under the program, the state bank, BGK, will guarantee up to 60 percent of the amount of a loan issued by a
commercial bank to an SME. Eventual losses are shared pari-passu between the commercial bank and the
government. The program has an overall ceiling of about 2 percent of GDP, of which some ¼ percent of GDP is
expected to be executed this year. It also complies with EU regulations on state aid.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
14.
The economy is expected to slow further in 2013. Real GDP growth is projected to
moderate to 1.1 percent in 2013: the first half of the year is expected to be weak, followed by a
recovery in the second half. The baseline assumes an improvement in economic conditions in
Poland’s main trading partners during the second half of the year, which should help boost
household and business confidence. Domestic demand would also be supported by muted inflation
pressures (which, projected at 1.6 percent in 2013, should lift real income and wages) and the effects
of monetary policy easing (which should support credit expansion).
15.
A gradual recovery should ensue over the medium term. Growth is projected to bounce
back to 2¼ percent in 2014, with domestic demand driven by an improvement in consumption, as
confidence returns, the labor market stabilizes, and credit conditions improve (Appendix II). Given
ample spare capacity, private investment is expected to recover with some delay. Over the medium
term, the new allocation of EU structural funds (2014–20) should boost public investment and
provide further impetus to the economic recovery. Growth is projected to reach about 3½ percent
by 2018, lifted by an increase in the capital stock (as public investment picks up), a rise in labor force
participation (as a result of the increase in the retirement age enacted in 2012), and productivity
gains (as recent progress with structural reforms takes hold). Inflation is expected to gradually return
to target as the output gap closes.
16.

Risks are tilted to the downside (see Risk Assessment Matrix, Appendix III).



A protracted slowdown in Europe would hamper Poland’s recovery through lower exports and
confidence effects. A restoration of confidence is essential for the gradual improvement in
household consumption and private investment under the baseline.



Renewed financial stress in the euro area, or a renewed episode of distress in global financial
markets, would affect Poland through both banking and financial market channels—the former
through possible disorderly funding withdrawals by parent banks and the latter through shifts in
investor sentiment that could lead to portfolio outflows (given the large share of foreign
investors in Poland’s government bond market).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

REPUBLIC OF POLAND



As the analysis on Poland’s role in the German supply chain shows, Poland would also be
adversely affected by global shocks, although the magnitude of the impact depends in part of
the strength of German balance sheets.



The recovery is also dependent on credit developments. Private domestic demand could fail to
pick up as assumed under the baseline—possibly because of reduced credit availability—
denting the recovery. On the upside, the government’s investment support scheme could
support credit expansion and economic growth by more than expected (see Section D below).



With respect to inflation risks, a substantial and sustained depreciation of the zloty would have
pass-through effects leading to higher inflation.

Authorities’ views
17.
The authorities shared staff’s view on the near-term outlook and emphasized that risks
stemmed mainly from external sources. They broadly concurred with staff’s growth and inflation
forecasts. They were especially troubled by the sharp deceleration in household consumption, which
they attributed to confidence effects. In this regard, the authorities were concerned about the
outlook for the euro area, noting that the speed of Poland’s recovery would depend on the situation
in Europe, including through confidence channels. Nonetheless, they shared the view that the
slowdown was cyclical and also expected a recovery to take hold later in 2013. On risks, the
authorities agreed that a protracted period of slow growth in Europe or a reversal in foreign investor
sentiment posed the main risks. On the latter, however, they noted that these risks were mitigated
by the composition of the investor base, which included pension funds, central banks, and other
long-term investors. They also felt strongly that the FCL arrangement provided important insurance
against risks.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
18.
Given the uncertain external environment, Poland’s main policy challenge is to balance
the need to support the economy with further building of policy buffers. The discussions
focused on the appropriate macroeconomic policy mix in the context of narrow fiscal space and the
weakening economy, the strategy for medium-term fiscal consolidation, policies to further enhance
the resilience of the financial sector (including ongoing initiatives to tackle impaired loans,
strengthen the bank resolution framework, and establish a macroprudential framework), and
structural reforms to boost potential growth. In recent years, policies have been broadly aligned with
Fund advice (Box 4).

A. Monetary Policy: Supporting Growth amid Low Inflation
19.
In response to muted inflation pressures, the Monetary Policy Council (MPC) started
an easing cycle in November 2012. Cumulative rate cuts since then amount to 200 bps, bringing
the reference rate to 2¾ percent, a record low. On one occasion in early June, the NBP intervened in
the foreign exchange market, selling foreign currency in response to excessive zloty volatility.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

Box 4. Implementation of Past Fund Advice
Policy actions have been broadly in line with past Fund advice:

Fiscal policy: The pace of fiscal consolidation slowed in response to the economic downturn, but
the authorities remain committed to their medium-term objective (MTO). To strengthen the fiscal
framework, work on the permanent fiscal rule has continued. Recent increases in the retirement age
were consistent with Fund advice, but reform of the special pension regimes still needs to be advanced.

Financial sector: The Fund’s past advice focused on taking a more proactive approach to address
the outstanding stock of impaired loans, developing the resolution and macroprudential frameworks,
and providing additional supervisory resources to the financial supervisory authority (KNF). The KNF is
conducting a thematic review of impaired loans, and the authorities are advancing legislation to create
a Systemic Risk Board (SRB) and to overhaul the bank resolution framework.

Structural reforms: Ongoing initiatives to streamline unwarranted bureaucratic barriers to
economic activity should help boost potential growth. There is room to further increase labor
participation and reduce administrative barriers to business. Modifications to the insolvency framework
are welcome.

20.
The continued monetary policy easing cycle is welcome (Figure 9). There is scope for
modest additional easing, after which further policy action would need to depend on incoming data.


With economic activity clearly below potential, a weak labor market, and subdued consumer
demand, inflation is expected to remain below the target over the policy horizon. Staff analysis
suggests that, under the baseline, further monetary policy easing is unlikely to significantly
intensify inflation pressures.



Ex-post real policy rates in Poland remain high as do some (but not all) measures of ex-ante real
policy rates (based on surveys of inflations expectations). Policy rates adjusted for country risk
premia are among the highest in the region. This, together with the improving current account
position, suggests that monetary easing should not lead to destabilizing capital outflows.



The relatively quick transmission of policy rate cuts to the key benchmark rate (3-month WIBOR)
and bank lending rates (despite some initial stickiness) implies that further easing could have
immediate effects, through lower household and corporate debt servicing costs (since most
loans carry floating interest rates). Over time, as uncertainty dissipates, easier monetary
conditions should help boost credit to the economy.



In the event of a stronger slowdown (or downturn) under supportive external financial
conditions, policy rates should be cut more. However, room for further rate cuts may be limited
if the slowdown/downturn is accompanied by substantial capital outflows. In this case, the
cushioning role of the flexible exchange rate should be exploited to the maximum extent
possible, while paying due attention to the impact on the domestic financial system and
household balance sheets. In this regard, the NBP’s readiness to provide liquidity both in zloty
and FX is welcome. Intervention in the foreign exchange market could be used to limit excessive
volatility.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

21.
The functioning of the interbank market has improved. The negative spreads between
the overnight interbank market rate (POLONIA) and the reference rate have narrowed and the level
of excess reserves has declined, reflecting an improvement in the functioning of the interbank
market and the introduction of fine-tuning operations by the NBP. Although overnight transactions
still dominate uncollateralized interbank markets, the share of longer tenor transactions has
increased. Following a global trend, new regulations targeted at minimizing WIBOR manipulation
are to be implemented. Staff pointed out that, to facilitate the NBP’s liquidity forecasting and
management, it is important for the NBP to receive advanced information regarding the MOF’s
anticipated exchanges of foreign exchange with the NBP.
Authorities’ views
22.
The authorities agreed that monetary easing should continue. They shared staff’s view
that inflation pressures are likely to remain limited, amid weak domestic demand and a low risk of
commodity price shocks. They acknowledged that real interest rates are high in Poland and, given
limited fiscal space, monetary policy remains the main tool to support economy. However, the MPC
remains divided: a few members are concerned about possible adverse effects of low interest rates
(such as disincentives for corporate restructuring, inefficient investment, and asset price bubbles),
while others worry that high real interest rates are harming growth.

B. Rebuilding Fiscal Space at an Appropriate Pace
23.
Poland’s fiscal consolidation continued in 2012. The deficit declined from 7.9 percent of
GDP in 2010 to 5 percent of GDP in 2011 and to 3.9 percent of GDP in 2012. The latter, however, was
somewhat larger than expected, as the economic slowdown reduced tax collections (mainly VAT). In
recognition of Poland's structural effort and adverse economic situation, the Council of the
European Union recommended that Poland be granted a two-year extension to exit the EU’s
excessive deficit procedure (EDP), from 2012 to 2014. While public debt (ESA95 definition) dropped
for the first time since 2007 to 55.6 percent of GDP in 2012, fiscal space remains very limited due to
the proximity of public debt to national legal thresholds.2 Meanwhile, favorable market conditions
and aggressive pre-financing of public borrowing needs have reduced the average cost of debt and
increased the average maturity.

2

The constitution caps public debt (national definition) at 60 percent of GDP. In addition, the Public Finance Law
establishes a preventive debt threshold at 55 percent of GDP. If the ratio of debt to GDP exceeds 55 percent in year T
(after adjustments for the exchange rate and liquid holdings of the Ministry of Finance), mandatory fiscal
consolidation measures must be implemented in year T+2. The national definition of debt is narrower than ESA95, as
it excludes liabilities of the National Road Fund and other entities. At end-2012, the national definition of public debt
was 3 percentage points of GDP lower than the ESA95 definition.

25.
Going forward, additional fiscal consolidation measures will be needed to put the
public debt ratio on a firm downward path. The authorities have maintained a medium-term
objective (MTO) of a structural fiscal deficit of 1 percent of GDP, but the target date to reach it was

and announced in advance, and implemented as
the economy recovers in 2014 and 2015. To this end, staff noted that an expenditure review could
prove useful to help identify areas where non-priority public expenditures can be rationalized. Staff
strongly urged the authorities to avoid further cuts in public investment.
26.
The authorities have continued to work on the design of a permanent fiscal rule. They
are contemplating several variants of an expenditure rule, and plan to send the proposal to
parliament later this year. Staff has argued for a simple and transparent rule (possibly akin to the
Swiss debt brake) with sound counter-cyclical properties and a clear link to the MTO. As with any
fiscal rule, the final choice would involve some trade-offs: staff analysis suggests none of the
3

Under the baseline, public debt under the national definition would remain below the 55 percent of GDP legal
threshold. Staff calculations indicate that a combined growth and exchange rate shock (where growth falls to
−1 percent and the average exchange rate depreciates by 10 percent) would push debt above 55 percent of GDP.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

mechanisms offers clear dominance, but some refinements could improve their performance,
especially under shock scenarios (Box 5). In addition, the effective implementation of a fiscal rule
would require improvements in fiscal reporting and budgetary processes, including top-down
budgeting, multi-year financial plans, and regular expenditure reviews. At the local government
level, an initiative to impose additional fiscal constraints was abandoned as the current set of rules
was deemed sufficient to protect long-term fiscal sustainability.
27.
In late June, the authorities concluded a comprehensive review of the pension system.4
The review focused on the costs and benefits of the second pillar and modalities for making payouts
from the second pillar. Based on the findings of the review, the authorities have proposed three
options for modifying the pension system—all with significant implications for the functioning of the
second pillar.5


Option 1 (make the second pillar voluntary rather than mandatory). This option entails giving
contributors an option to either remain in the second pillar or have their assets transferred to
the first pillar (the default option would be transfer to the first pillar).



Option 2 (like Option 1 but with an additional contribution). This option would also make
participation in the second pillar voluntary. But, participants would also be required to pay an
additional contribution of 2 percent of salary.



Option 3 (transfer of holdings of non-equity securities). This option would involve the transfer of
all holdings of non-equity securities to the government, with corresponding amounts recorded
in individual accounts in the first pillar.

28.
The implications of the proposed modifications will need to be carefully assessed. All
three options are likely to reduce public debt and the fiscal deficit, while at the same time increasing
future pension liabilities of the government. Since Poland’s first pillar is a notional defined
contribution system, the impact on fiscal sustainability should be limited. However, the public sector
will bear additional fiscal risk associated with pension liabilities (including demographic risk). In
terms of financial markets, despite the authorities’ desire to safeguard second pillar assets invested
in the equity market, liquidity in the equity and government bond markets may be affected by the
reduced presence of the pension funds. Staff will continue to monitor developments, especially as a
final decision is made. It will be essential that modifications are implemented transparently to
reassure the public that their pensions remain secure.

4

Poland’s pension system largely consists of a mandatory (public) first pillar and a mandatory (private) second pillar
(a voluntary third pillar exists but is barely utilized).
5

In addition, the review determined that the payout phase of the second pillar will be centralized in the first pillar, via
the phased transfer of assets starting ten years before retirement.

Box 5. A Permanent Fiscal Rule for Poland1
The Polish authorities plan to implement a permanent fiscal rule to strengthen the fiscal framework. A
permanent fiscal rule would complement existing public debt limits and support the sustained attainment of
the medium-term objective (MTO) over time, helping entrench fiscal consolidation. In this context, the
authorities have advanced work on the design and assessment of the mechanism.
Ideally, a fiscal rule should behave in a smooth countercyclical fashion under normal macroeconomic
conditions, and produce a predictable path of public sector balances, consistent with the MTO. Also, the rule
should deliver robust results under various macroeconomic scenarios and provide adequate flexibility to
implement countercyclical fiscal policy under extreme adverse circumstances.
Using these guiding principles, four alternative rules were calibrated and assessed for Poland. These
encompassed three variants of expenditure rules, and a budget balance rule akin to the Swiss debt brake. The
expenditure rules capped the growth of expenditures at or below trend GDP growth. In turn, the Swiss brake
mechanism targeted a level of expenditures consistent with the MTO. The assessment was guided by the
simplicity of the rules, their cyclical and long-term dynamics, their robustness to alternative macroeconomic
scenarios, and their behavior under extreme adverse circumstances.
The assessment of each rule was based on Monte Carlo simulations. The exercises were conducted by
projecting relevant series (i.e., GDP growth, fiscal revenues, fiscal expenditures, and inflation) over a 37-year
horizon (until 2050). Each exercise entailed 500 simulations. Initial variable values were set to their actual 2012
levels. In all the simulations, government revenues, the output gap, and prices were modeled as stochastic
processes, and their association was calibrated using historic information over 1995−2012. The data
generating processes covered a wide range of possible GDP growth paths, following three alternative sets of
assumptions regarding long-term potential GDP growth. To analyze the behavior of the rules under adverse
circumstances, each set of scenarios was also modeled by imposing an extreme but likely negative shock to
GDP growth.
These simulations suggest that there are no “silver bullets”. None of the rules display strict dominance
across attributes. At the same time, the results provide insights on the relative advantages and weaknesses of
each mechanism, and some guidance for potential improvement:

In general, the three expenditure rules exhibited a fiscal-tightening bias. This result seemed to originate
from the structure of the mechanism: a limit to the growth of public expenditures also lowered the
expenditure base for subsequent periods (regardless of fiscal performance and the state of the economy). This
tended to introduce a one-way bias in the ratio of public expenditures to GDP, and generated protracted fiscal
surpluses (unless compensated by successive tax policy cuts).

An alternative to deal with this bias is to accumulate any deviations between the resulting fiscal balances
and the MTO in a notional account, and use the latter to impose symmetric corrections when deviations
become large.

In turn, while the Swiss debt brake proved appropriate to target the MTO and more robust to alternative
macroeconomic conditions, it also tended to generate excessive expenditure cuts at the one-year horizon, and
a slightly more procyclical behavior of expenditures.

More generally, the results illustrate the advantages of including the MTO in the main formula of the fiscal
rule.
Based on these results, further analysis and fine-tuning of the rules under consideration seems
advisable.

Authorities’ views
29.
The authorities agreed that fiscal space was very limited and wished to avoid fiscal
policy being a drag on growth. They saw the fiscal underperformance in 2012 and weak revenues
so far in 2013 as clearly cyclical, reflecting the sharp slowdown. Their deficit projections for 2013
were more optimistic than staff’s, notably with respect to expenditure restraint. The authorities
reiterated their commitment to the MTO and concurred with staff on the importance of
strengthening the fiscal framework. In this regard, they appreciated the collaborative work with staff
on the analysis of alternative fiscal rules. On pensions, the authorities stressed that the review was
intended to improve the functioning of the system.

C. Further Enhancing the Resilience of the Financial Sector
30.
The banking system appears resilient, as detailed in the companion FSSA (Box 6). Risks
have been managed well and vulnerabilities contained through effective regulatory and supervisory
measures, including on foreign exchange exposure, capital adequacy, and bank funding. The main
risks stem from outstanding portfolios of FX mortgage loans and potential pressures on bank
funding under a scenario of renewed distress in financial markets. These risks are mitigated by
several factors, including low household indebtedness, longer duration of FX hedging instruments,
less reliance on parent funding, and a diversified foreign investor base. Stress tests conducted as
part of the recent FSAP Update confirm the sector’s resilience: bank capital and liquidity buffers can
withstand large shocks and contagion risks are limited.
31.
The authorities have continued to work to strengthen the resilience of the financial
system. The KNF has required banks to boost their capital and liquidity buffers. It revised the
prudential guidelines on consumer lending, easing documentation needs for small loans and
replacing general caps on debt-service-to-income (DTI) ratios with those derived from banks’
internal models. It also modified the guidelines on mortgage lending: mortgage loans will need to
be in the same currency as borrower’s income, limits on loan-to-value (LTV) ratios will be gradually
reduced to 80 percent by 2017, and (as with consumer lending) DTI caps will be replaced with those
derived from banks’ internal models. While these changes in prudential guidelines allow banks to set
DTI limits according to creditworthiness, the KNF will need to tighten oversight over banks’ credit
risk management practices to ensure that lending policies do not become too lax.
32.
Bank supervision has improved considerably, but further work is needed. The frequency
of targeted inspections has increased and onsite/offsite coordination has been enhanced.
Nonetheless, the areas where the KNF can issue prudential regulations (resolutions) should be
broadened, particularly with respect to powers to regulate permissible risks in bank activities. The
recent incorporation of credit unions under KNF financial oversight is welcome, but this should be
accompanied by greater budgetary autonomy and, at a minimum, increased budgetary flexibility (to
reallocate resources) for the KNF. The widening regulatory and supervisory initiatives at the global
and European levels also suggest that greater supervisory resources are needed.

33.
Staff welcomed the recent efforts to tackle impaired loans, and urged further progress.
Staff noted that the majority of loans past due 90 days or more have been past due at least one
year, and that consumer loans (typically with low recoverability) comprise almost half of this stock.
Banks have been gradually addressing the existing stock of impaired assets, but tax disincentives
(constraints on the deductibility of loan losses and debt relief), interest accrual practices (allowing
banks to accrue statutory interest for three years), and legal obstacles (stemming from the
insolvency regime) need to be tackled to speed up progress. In this context, the KNF’s ongoing
thematic review of impaired loans is timely and should help identify areas for further improvements.
34.
Staff strongly urged the authorities to put in place the new macroprudential and bank
resolution frameworks as soon as possible. The authorities should press ahead with legislation to
create a SRB and establish a formal and explicit macroprudential framework that will aim to identify,
monitor, and contain systemic risks to the financial system. Staff advised the authorities to take this
opportunity to delineate the mandates of the various institutions involved in financial oversight,
secure sufficient autonomy and accountability for each, and define coordination arrangements. It
welcomed the progress in advancing legislation to overhaul the bank resolution framework, which
will provide critical tools for orderly bank resolution. Staff suggested that the legislation could be
supported by explicit depositor preference.
35.
Staff encouraged the authorities to facilitate the development of more sources of
long-term bank funding. This would help to diversify banks’ funding sources and prepare banks to
meet the new Basel III liquidity requirements (notably the net stable funding ratio). Staff
recommended that universal banks be allowed to issue mortgage covered bonds which would be
subject to the same terms and conditions as those issued by the mortgage banks. At the same time,
it will be important to ensure that the share of encumbered assets remains at prudent levels to allow
for a smooth resolution process.
Authorities’ views
36.
The authorities broadly concurred with the mission’s recommendations, but there
were differences of views in a few areas. They agreed to consider more flexibility in KNF’s internal
allocation of budgetary resources, but felt strongly that full budgetary independence was not
desirable. They also noted that the regulatory powers of the KNF are constrained by the
Constitution. On impaired loans, the thematic review is progressing, and the KNF plans to amend
the prudential framework based on the results of the review. The authorities agreed on the
importance of putting in place the macro-prudential and the bank resolution frameworks, and are
moving ahead with the relevant pieces of legislation. They also acknowledged the importance of
developing mortgage covered bonds to support long-term funding for banks. However, they argued
that allowing universal banks to issue mortgage covered bonds could reduce their quality (given
different underwriting standards), and preferred to develop these markets at a gradual pace.

Box 6. FSAP Update Main Findings and Recommendations1
The FSAP Update, conducted earlier this year, concluded that Poland’s financial system appears to be
resilient with vulnerabilities contained. At the same time, it identified several elements of the financial policy
framework that can be further improved to enhance the system’s resilience.
Impaired loans. Accounting constraints, tax disincentives (deductibility of loan losses and debt relief),
income accrual practice, and legal obstacles (insolvency regime) should be addressed to accelerate progress
in cleaning up bank balance sheets and the disposal of impaired assets. The ongoing thematic supervisory
review of impaired assets provides an opportunity to update regulatory guidance if warranted. The
authorities are in the progress of revamping the insolvency scheme and introducing a new law on
restructuring to support rehabilitation of viable debtors (rather than liquidation).
Bank supervision. Banking supervision has significantly improved. However, under the Polish legal system it
remains difficult to provide the KNF with sufficient powers, independence, and resources, which is of
particular concern considering its expanding perimeter and new supervisory initiatives at both the global
and European levels. Consultations with banks and other stakeholders in the industry could be further
strengthened.
Credit unions. The sector shows rapid growth and consolidation, but financial trends have been negative
since 2009 and weak credit unions should adopt capital rehabilitation plans. Ongoing changes to the legal
framework governing credit unions will strengthen their supervisory framework and safety nets.
Macro-prudential policy framework. The legislative process for setting up a SRB has started. The
establishment of the SRB would provide the opportunity to adopt a supervisory approach to systemic risks
and systemic institutions and clarify the objectives and the roles of the respective macroprudential,
microprudential, and monetary policies. The FSAP Update recommends that the law provides the SRB with
independence, accountability to Parliament, and power to make recommendations coupled with an “act or
explain” mechanism.
Bank resolution framework. Draft legislation on resolution is progressing to set up a state-of-the-art
resolution framework for the financial system. The planned resolution framework designates the deposit
guarantee fund as the resolution agency and puts a complete suite of resolution tools at its disposal, in line
with the Financial Stability Board’s Key Attributes. The authorities plan to add explicit depositor preference
to the framework.
Deposit insurance scheme. Poland is broadly compliant with International Association of Deposit Insurers
(IADI) Core Principles and will be even more so once the resolution framework has been adopted.

D. Deepening Structural Reforms and Euro Adoption
37.
Structural reforms are crucial for Poland’s long-term growth. Despite significant
progress in reducing structural rigidities, further reforms are needed to lift potential growth and
preserve the benefits generated by involvement in the German supply chain. Labor participation
rates are still low and skill mismatch remains a concern. There is ample room for further
improvement in the business climate, including by enhancing the frameworks for insolvency and
dispute resolution. The public sector share in gross value added declined slightly in recent years,
but, at around 20 percent, it remains above the authorities’ target of 10 percent. Potential growth
would be boosted by increasing the investment rate including in the area of infrastructure

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

investment. The latter is crucial to ensure that Poland is positioned to fully realize the positive
spillovers of integration in the German supply chain.
38.
Staff welcomed the recent reforms to improve the business environment and labor
market. The authorities took measures to improve the liquidity of small firms—by allowing
cash-based (instead of accrual) VAT settlement—and further reduce administrative burdens.
Privatization has continued, and the government intends to sell its stake in most of the remaining
companies under its control (except some 20 firms considered to be strategic). The authorities also
eased access to 50 regulated professions earlier this year, with particular focus on facilitating entry
into these professions by the youth. Work is underway to reduce entry barriers in another 140
professions. To mitigate the impact of the economic slowdown on the labor market, more flexible
work-time regulations have been proposed and a pilot project to improve job-matching is
underway.
39.
The authorities have launched a public investment fund, financed by the sale of equity
in state-controlled companies. The objective is to have the investment fund, Polish Development
Investments (PIR), provide equity financing to long-term commercially-viable infrastructure projects
and help catalyze private sector funding. Seed capital for PIR will come from privatization revenues
(some ½ percent of GDP) plus a minority participation of the public bank, BGK (intended to provide
start-up funds).6 The initial projects are likely to start in 2014.
40.
To build on this progress, staff called for additional efforts to support employment
and boost potential growth.


Labor market. Increasing labor force participation and reducing structural unemployment are
key priorities. Reforms to align the special occupational pension schemes (notably for miners
and farmers) and the formula for disability pensions with the regular system should help
increase labor participation and contribute to fiscal sustainability (Appendix IV). There is also
room to reduce segmentation in the labor market, by better aligning temporary and permanent
work contracts. Job creation would also be supported by further efforts to ease access to
regulated professions, improve education, and upgrade skills (including through vocational
training).



Business environment. Business activity would benefit from changes in the insolvency law to
promote rehabilitation (rather than liquidation) of viable debtors. Cumbersome construction
regulations could be streamlined, including by simplifying rules on construction permits, while
maintaining strong safety standards. Privatization should be continued, guided by the
authorities’ goal of reducing the public sector’s role in the economy.

6

Early this year, BGK received a capital injection of about ¼ percent of GDP. This operation boosted BGK’s capacity
to participate in long-term syndicated loans and to offer financing to local governments for infrastructure projects.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

REPUBLIC OF POLAND



Investment. With the proceeds from sales of state owned assets to be mostly channeled to the
new investment support scheme, it is crucial that PIR’s corporate governance and operations are
transparent and accountable, in line with best international practice, and that only commercially
viable projects are selected. Ultimately, PIR could play an important role in mobilizing private
funds for infrastructure projects.

41.
Euro adoption remains an important long-term objective. The authorities have continued
to make progress toward fulfilling entry criteria, particularly on the fiscal front given the substantial
decline in the deficit since 2010. They are also continuing to work on necessary legal changes,
including to the Constitution. No target date has been announced.
Authorities’ views
42.
The authorities emphasized advances in the structural reform agenda. They stressed the
importance of the steps to ease access to regulated professions, and noted that further initiatives to
identify and remove red-tape obstacles to entrepreneurship and economic activity are under way.
To guide this process, efforts to improve the consultation process with social partners is ongoing.
The authorities underscored that work on the new insolvency regime has continued, with the draft
law expected to be submitted to parliament later in the year. They stressed that PIR would operate
under strong governance and transparent reporting policies to improve efficiency and limit fiscal
contingent liabilities.

STAFF APPRAISAL
43.
Despite its resilience in recent years and very strong fundamentals, the Polish
economy has slowed markedly. The slowdown appears to be cyclical, as weakness in euro area
growth spread to Poland’s main trading partners, with knock-on effects on Polish consumer and
business confidence. Factors that supported growth in the past—notably fiscal expansion and rising
public investment—have reversed and now pose headwinds to the recovery. Nonetheless, Poland’s
sound macroeconomic management (including a reduction in the fiscal deficit from 7.9 percent of
GDP in 2010 to 3.9 percent of GDP in 2012), broadly adequate international reserves, resilient
financial system, and precautionary Flexible Credit Line (FCL) arrangement with the Fund have
helped maintain confidence. Further building buffers remains essential to increase resilience to
shocks and to pave the way for an eventual exit from the FCL arrangement.
44.
Growth is set to slow further in 2013, and risks are on the downside. Real GDP growth is
projected to moderate to 1.1 percent in 2013, as weakness in the first half of the year is expected to
be followed by a recovery in the second half. A protracted economic slowdown in Europe presents
the main risk—this would hamper Poland’s medium-term recovery through sustained trade,
financial, and confidence effects. Shifts in global risk appetite or renewed financial stress in the euro
area could lead to capital outflows, particularly from the government bond market or the banking
sector.

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

45.
The monetary easing cycle initiated in November 2012 is welcome. With economic
activity below potential, inflation is expected to remain below the target over the policy horizon. At
the same time, real policy interest rates in Poland remain high and policy rates adjusted for country
risk premia are among the highest in the region. The transmission of policy rate cuts to bank lending
rates implies that further easing could have immediate effects through lower household and
corporate debt servicing costs. Over time, as uncertainty dissipates, easier monetary conditions
should help boost credit to the economy. Under these circumstances, and with limited fiscal space,
monetary policy remains the main tool through which macroeconomic policies can support the
economy. The exchange rate should be allowed to float freely, but intervention could be used to
avoid abrupt movements. The NBP should provide liquidity support if needed.
46.
There is scope for fiscal policy to balance structural consolidation with support for the
economy in 2013. While the debt-to-GDP ratio has remained close to an important legal threshold,
there is room to allow automatic stabilizers to operate around measures contained in the 2013
budget. Under these assumptions, the general government deficit is expected to reach 4 percent of
GDP in 2013, largely as a result of the impact of the growth slowdown on fiscal revenues. The strong
credibility of fiscal policy has contributed to favorable financing conditions.
47.
As the economy recovers, additional fiscal consolidation will be needed to put the
public debt ratio firmly on a downward path and rebuild fiscal buffers. The authorities’ MTO of
a 1 percent of GDP structural deficit remains appropriate and should allow for sustained reductions
in the public debt ratio. To reach the MTO, additional measures of about 1 percent of GDP will be
necessary over 2014–16. These measures should be identified in advance and could include
conducting a broad expenditure review to identify areas where non-priority spending can be
reduced. Further cuts in public investment should be avoided. Finalizing the design of a permanent
expenditure rule that is simple and transparent, with sufficient counter-cyclical properties and a clear
link to the MTO, would help anchor public finances in the medium term. The fiscal rule should be
supported by improvements in fiscal reporting and budgetary processes.
48.
The changes to the pension system have significant implications for the functioning of
the second pillar. Fiscal implications—with respect to public debt and future pension liabilities and
risks—and financial market effects will need to be carefully assessed. It is critical that any
modifications be implemented transparently, with a view to minimizing disruptions to financial
markets and public expectations. It also important that other pressing reforms to the pension
system proceed, notwithstanding the temporary relief provided by any modifications to the system.
49.
The banking system has continued to perform well, and the recent improvements in
supervision are welcome. It is well-capitalized, profitable, and liquid. Risks have been managed
well and vulnerabilities contained through effective supervisory measures. Nonetheless,
safeguarding asset quality will be essential, especially as the impaired loans are likely to increase as
a result of the economic slowdown. In this regard, the existing stock of impaired loans should be
addressed by tackling tax and legal obstacles. Improvements in bank supervision should continue by
broadening the areas where the KNF can issue prudential regulations, and increasing the KNF’s

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

supervisory resources and budgetary autonomy and flexibility. The new macroprudential and bank
resolution frameworks should be put in place as soon as possible.
50.
The recent steps to improve the business climate and labor market are welcome, but
additional reforms are needed to boost potential growth. Despite admirable progress in
reducing administrative barriers to economic activity, further efforts would increase long-term
growth and preserve the benefits of Poland’s integration into the German supply chain. Efforts to
ease access to a number of regulated professions are important and should continue. Given the
growing number of bankruptcies, work to modify the insolvency regime—notably by setting up a
framework conducive to restructuring of firms instead of the current bias towards liquidation—
should be advanced. Reform of the special occupational pension schemes and the disability formula
would help increase labor participation, and better alignment of temporary and permanent labor
contracts would reduce market segmentation. With respect to the new investment fund, it is crucial
that its corporate governance and operations are transparent and accountable, in line with best
international practice, and that only commercially viable projects are selected.
51.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Appendix I. Poland’s Interconnectedness1
1.
This annex highlights the application of the Fund’s work on interconnectedness to
Poland, as recommended by the Triennial Surveillance Review.2, 3 In particular, network analysis is
used to map Poland’s cross-border trade and financial linkages, which provides a framework to
formulate hypotheses about economic relationships and spillovers.4 The resulting network maps
provide a useful overview of Poland’s integration into the global economy, and a first step toward
assessing the implications of Poland’s role in the German supply chain. Delving deeper is crucial to
better understand the functional characteristics of the relationships and to provide context.5
2.
The network map has
three key features (Map 1).




1

First, a core set of globally
important economies such as
Germany, Italy, and the US are
at center. These countries are
directly linked to a large number
of other countries and several
links pass through them.6
Poland is more in the periphery
(right side) to the core, linked to
core European countries.

Second, groupings or clusters of
countries, which have the
strongest mutual inter-linkages
considering both trade and financial links (shaded in the same color below), are identified.

There are different algorithms to perform network analysis. We use the Clique Percolation Method proposed by
Palla, G., Derenyi, I., Farkas, I., Vicsek, T. in a 2005 paper in the journal Nature. It has the beneficial feature of mapping
overlapping relationships between clusters and chains of clusters to hypothesize about the direct and indirect
interconnections.
5
The existing literature does not find any consistent prediction about the relationship of interconnectedness and
macroeconomic outcomes, such as output synchronization or volatility. See chapter 1 of the Enhancing Surveillance
Background Paper, http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2012/031612b.pdf

This version of the map is constructed using 2011 IMF direction of trade, BIS bank (both consolidated and
locational), and the IMF coordinated portfolio and direct investment surveys. The Enhancing Surveillance paper used

Poland is in a cluster with Germany, Italy, Austria, and the Czech and Slovak Republics (see black
oval).


Third, gatekeeper economies are defined as those that belong to more than one cluster and
connect a cluster to others or to the core cluster (Map 2). In Poland’s cluster, Germany and Italy
are gatekeepers to the core cluster (right side of the Poland cluster). Austria is also a gatekeeper
(left side of the Poland cluster) to a cluster containing Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and
Slovenia.
Map 2

3.
Gatekeepers are important in potentially propagating or cushioning shocks. For
example, a shock in Germany affects Poland and other countries in the same cluster.7 Moreover, that
shock can affect the core economies (at the center of the map above), particularly core Europe.
While the crisis has focused attention on negative shocks, they could also be positive. German
policies, for example, could have positive spillovers, dampening the propagation of shocks to its
clusters.
Map 3
4.
Chains of clusters help
to hypothesize about the
channels through which
indirect links operate (Map 3). It
is a commonly held view that
Poland benefits from being in the
German supply chain in part
because Polish exports can
ultimately find their way to fast
growing economies like China.
The network analysis documents
this indirect link to hypothesize how shocks in China (right side Asian cluster) affect Poland. They are

likely to pass through the U.K. and U.S. first, which are the gatekeepers of that cluster to the core.
The shock is then transmitted via Germany or Italy to the Poland cluster.
5.
Trade linkages more closely define the Polish cluster, rather than financial ones Map 3
more closely resembles Map 2 which combines both trade and financial linkages. This is because the
CPM algorithm3 takes in to account the mutual trade relationships consistent with a supply chain.
For example, Poland imports upstream
Map 4
goods that are then exported as
downstream products in the German
and Italian auto supply chain. In
contrast, financial linkages (e.g.
consolidated BIS banking exposures) are
similar to concentric circles with Poland
in the periphery, outer ring connected
to core banking systems in the inner
ring like those of Italy, Spain, and
Austria, which own subsidiaries in
Poland (Map 4).

Appendix II. Does the Current Economic Slowdown
Hide Some Structural Features?1
1.
The Polish economy is experiencing a sharp demand-driven economic slowdown. Real
GDP growth slowed from 4.5 percent in 2011 to 1.9 percent in 2012, driven by a contraction in
domestic demand and a slowdown in export growth. The economy is expected to slow further in
2013, followed by a gradual recovery over the medium term.
2.
Staff considers that the slowdown is mainly cyclical, given limited evidence of structural
features at the household, corporate, and labor market levels:

in households’ disposable income
and heightened uncertainties associated with a rising unemployment rate (around an already
high structural unemployment level).2 Those factors are not irreversible and appear highly
dependent on the economy’s position in the business cycle. Moreover, relatively low household
indebtedness (about 36 percent of GDP as of end 2012) limits the risk of financial stress and
protracted slowdown in consumption.

Staff calculations indicate that, regardless of the econometric method used (Okun’s law, Phillips curve and

stands at around 10 percent as of end 2012.

uncertainties on investment plans. Firm expectations regarding the general outlook are
depressed and the number of new exports contracts secured in the first half of the year has
plummeted. The NBP survey also reveals a declining path of the number of enterprises reporting

The recent movements along the Beveridge curve do not only imply an improvement in the “matching process” in
the labor market. They could also suggest that unfilled positions are shrinking consistent with the observed erosion
in household disposable income which has strongly reduced “voluntary” unemployment.

Staff estimates also uncover two important results: (i) the unemployment rate (and the
unemployment gap) is significantly and negatively correlated with the business cycle position of
the economy but in an asymmetric way: the responsiveness of the unemployment gap to the
output gap is stronger during upturns, suggesting a significant adjustment of the labor market
through prices (wages) during downturns; and (ii) the responsiveness of manufacturing wages
also exhibits this asymmetrical behavior: manufacturing real wages are on average, positively
correlated with productivity shocks but the correlation is stronger when productivity shocks are
negative.




High
The adverse impact of public and private
sector deleveraging on the real economy in
Europe may be larger than expected in the
medium-term, leading to sizable output
gaps and potentially spurring debt-deflation
dynamics.
Job skills could become obsolete due to
long unemployment spells and subdued
investment, reducing potential output.
Medium
As a result, financial stress could reemerge in
the short-term and bank-sovereign-real
economy links could re-intensify as a result
of stalled or incomplete delivery of policy
commitments in some peripheral countries.
Strong market pressure on euro area
economies are likely to reverberate across
financial markets and asset classes.

Medium
Excessive or uncoordinated deleveraging by
parent banks would have adverse effects on
credit supply and economic activity.

Medium
Growing demand from foreign investors of
domestic government bonds could lead to
asset overvaluation and result in a sharp
unwinding of foreign investors’ positions in
the short and medium terms.
An unanticipated rise in global interest rates
could cause investors to reallocate assets
away from EMs. For example, this could
result from distortions from unconventional
monetary policy or a fiscal shock in the U.S.

Low
Continued uncertainty could further depress
confidence, leading to a decline in domestic
demand and higher unemployment.
This could cause less appetite for new
borrowing, which could depress housing
demand and lead to further declines in
residential real estate prices.

Medium
Significant trade linkages with Europe would
weaken growth in Poland through lower exports.
The effects could be partly offset by domestic
demand, as Poland’s economy is relatively closed.
Monetary policy should be further eased, especially
as fiscal space is limited.

Medium
Significant zloty depreciation could lead to liquidity
strains and credit losses in some banks with FXdenominated mortgage portfolios.
The effects would be mitigated by the strong and
high quality capital position in the banking sector,
and by the moderate stock of these mortgages
relative to GDP (11 percent of GDP).
The exchange rate should be allowed to float freely,
but intervention could be used to avoid abrupt
movements. The NBP should provide liquidity
support if needed.
Medium
Excessive deleveraging could result in a credit
squeeze, with adverse implications for growth.
The effects could be mitigated by reduced reliance
on parent funding, strong balance sheet and
liquidity of the banking system, and the reliance of
the corporate sector on retained earnings to finance
investment.
The NBP should provide liquidity support.
Medium
The sudden reversal could lead to higher funding
costs for the government.
The unwinding of foreign investors’ hedging
positions would reduce the liquidity in the FX
derivatives market, increasing banks’ hedging costs.
The risk could be mitigated by a relatively stable
investor base, prudent public debt management,
strong liquidity positions in the banking sector, and
banks’ more prudent approach to hedging FX risks.
The exchange rate should be allowed to float freely,
but intervention could be used to avoid abrupt
movements. The NBP should provide liquidity
support if needed.
High
A stronger than expected domestic slowdown and
higher unemployment could cause larger bank
losses and reduced bank profitability.
The effects could be mitigated by strong capital
buffers in the overall banking system.
Monetary policy should be further eased, especially
as fiscal space is limited.

Appendix IV. Addressing Inconsistency Between Disability
and Old-Age Pensions1
1. In the early 1990s, the number of non-farm disability pensioners was almost equal to those
receiving old-age pensions, reflecting generous criteria for granting disability rights. The rules
were tightened in 1997 by defining disability as inability to work (instead of as a health condition),
shifting medical assessment to doctors authorized by the Social Insurance Institution (ZUS), and
granting disability rights for limited time (except in extreme cases). This reduced the inflow of new
disability pensioners, who now account for about ¼ of old-age pensioners (Chart). The ratio of
average disability benefits to old-age pension benefits stabilized around ¾ in recent years.

2. There is an inconsistency between the current formulas used to calculate disability versus
old-age pensions. After the comprehensive pension reform in 1999, a defined contribution (DC)
system was adopted for old-age pensions so that they would better reflect individual contributions
and life expectancy at retirement. In contrast, disability pensions have remained under a defined
benefit (DB) system, with a weaker link to contributions paid (Box 1).

Box 1. Old-Age and Disability Pension Formulas
In the reformed DC system, the old-age pension (P) is derived as: P=K/LE (where K is the capital
accumulated on individual pension accounts, and LE is average life expectancy at retirement). This
formula marks a departure from the previous DB scheme, where benefits included also lump-sum and
non-contribution elements. Replacement rates are lower in DC system than they would have been in DB
scheme for the same work career.
Despite the reform, the disability pension (Pd) remained on a DB basis defined as:
Pd = 0.24*AWt +0.013*Yc* W10+0.007* Yn* W10
where: W10—best earnings for 10 consecutive years during 20 years before retirement, divided by the
average wage in the economy during the same period, and multiplied by average wage in the economy
at the year of retirement (AWt); Yc—years with pension contributions paid; Yn—non-contribution years
including disability years to reach the retirement age, maternity, or education.
If a benefit based on this formula falls below the legal minimum disability pension, the minimum would
apply. The disability formula, like pre-reform old-age pensions, includes a lump-sum factor based on the
average wage in the economy, is based on the 10 best years of pre-retirement income, and covers noncontribution periods. It does not have a link to life expectancy.

3. If this inconsistency remains unaddressed, it will create incentives for retirement via
disability (instead of old-age) benefits. These incentives would increase over time, as the old-age
pension gradually shifts to the DC scheme, leading to a decline in replacement rates. Indeed, stylized
estimates suggest that in the reformed system, pensioners will be better-off with disability instead
old-age pensions (Chart). While the relative advantage of disability has diminished following last
year’s increase in the statutory retirement age to 67 years (since replacement rates under the DC will
rise), it has not disappeared. The incentives to prefer disability will be particularly strong for those
with low earnings and those who were dropped off the social security system during work career.
The latter may be the case of the youth working on short-term contracts. Growing incentives to
choose disability poses a risk of a renewed inflow of “disabled” into the system, possibly
undermining achievements in this area.
4. The authorities are aware of this problem, but a solution remains elusive. The authorities
proposed a solution in 2008, mandating that disability benefits be based either on the DC formula,
similar to old-age pensions, or equal the legally binding minimum pension if it was higher than
calculated DC benefit. The proposal was, however, vetoed by the President and no alternative has
been put forth. To ensure consistency in the pension system and to avoid adverse incentives,
aligning disability benefits with DC system will be essential.

Exchange Arrangements:
The zloty has floated freely since April 12, 2000.
Poland accepted the obligation of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on June 1, 1995. Poland maintains an
exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions, except for the exchange restrictions imposed by Poland solely for the preservation of
national or international security as introduced by the European Union within the framework of the
Common Foreign and Security Policy. The consolidated list of such sanctions is available at:
http://eeas.europa.eu/cfsp/sanctions/consol-list_en.htm.
Article IV Consultation:
The last Article IV consultation was concluded on July 2, 2012. In concluding the consultation, Directors
noted the good performance of the Polish economy in 2011 despite the challenging environment, and
commended the authorities for their sound macroeconomic management. At the same time, they
observed that Poland’s strong economic links to the rest of Europe and large external financing needs
could give rise to adverse spillovers. Directors broadly supported the on-going fiscal adjustment, which
they deemed necessary to rebuild fiscal buffers. They noted that, over the medium term, additional
permanent fiscal measures would be needed to achieve the authorities’ medium-term objective,
avoiding excessive cuts in public investment. They welcomed the ongoing work on a permanent fiscal
rule and the recent pension reform, which they viewed as important steps to strengthen public finances.
Given the absence of inflationary pressures, Directors agreed that monetary policy should remain on
hold. They noted the resilience of Poland’s banking system, but underscored that vulnerabilities remain
owing to households’ foreign currency exposure and nonperforming loans (NPLs). They welcomed
recent supervisory measures to contain foreign currency lending and encouraged a more proactive
approach to addressing NPLs. Directors commended the recent and proposed improvements to the
oversight of the financial sector, including plans to establish a macro-prudential framework, and
underscored the need to develop a bank resolution regime. They also encouraged the authorities to
continue structural reforms in order to boost the growth potential.
Resident Representative:
Mr. James Roaf will replace Mr. Mark Allen as the Senior Regional Resident Representative for Central
and Eastern Europe, effective August 8, 2013.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: The Central Statistical Office (GUS) compiles and disseminates annual and quarterly
GDP at current and constant prices following 1993 SNA and ESA 1995. Moreover, a full set of accounts,
including financial accounts by institutional sectors are compiled too. There are inconsistencies between
annual and higher frequency data reflecting differences in weights and in coverage. Electronic retrieval of
the data is challenging. The sub-annual data are collected on a cumulative rather than on a discrete basis,
and plans to introduce proper benchmarking have been delayed. Seasonal adjustment on relatively short
interval leads to frequent and large backward revisions.
Price Statistics: The CPI does not cover the imputed rents of owner-occupied dwellings. The scope of
the index covers all resident households, except those in some rural areas. The PPI does not include any
estimation for missing prices or quality and seasonal adjustments.
Government Finance Statistics: General government data are released on a quarterly basis, and
compiled on the same basis as the annual general government data, i.e. derived from detailed ESA
accounts (ESA = European System of Accounts). Revenue and expense are available according to the full
economic classification and, in addition, expense is also available according to COFOG (Classification of
the Functions of Government).
Further significant enhancements to government sources of data are necessary to comply with the
accrual basis of reporting, and to compile full information on financial and nonfinancial asset stock data
for general government.

Monetary and Financial Statistics: Beginning with data for January 2004, the NBP compiles monetary
accounts in accordance with the ECB’s framework for monetary statistics using the national residency
approach. An earlier ROSC mission recommended that the NBP, in cooperation with the MoF, reconcile
monetary and government finance statistics and carry out a reconciliation exercise on a regular basis.
Balance of Payments: Largely to improve data accuracy, the NBP reduced its reliance on International
Transactions Reporting System (ITRS) data and increased its reliance on survey-based source data,
starting in the first quarter of 2010; however, the size of errors and omissions remained unacceptably
high. In 2009 and 2010, errors and omissions were larger than the current account deficit. STA undertook
an evaluation mission to Poland in July 2009 (prior to the implementation of the new compilation system)
to examine possible causes of the large and growing net errors and omissions. Among those potential
sources were financial account transactions (by banks and nonbanks), goods imports, and weaknesses in
data capture through the ITRS.
During the 2011 IMF Spring Meetings, the NBP informed of data improvements work that the NBP and
GUS had undertaken, and revisions that it anticipated incorporating in the external sector accounts at

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

end-June 2011. A STA mission followed up on these issues during June 6-10, 2011. The mission
concluded that the intended revisions to the Polish data are based on appropriate compilation
techniques. The revisions would affect the estimates from 2004 forward.
Poland has conducted much research into trade in used cars (imports of used cars from Germany may
have been missed); remittances (incoming private transfers may be overstated and outgoing private
transfers may be understated); repurchase agreements (a limited amount of double counting of financial
transactions in repos may have occurred); and overseas assets of non-financial corporations (these may
be misreported or missed). Further, the NBP’s new survey-based compilation system has had an overall
positive impact on data quality.
The mission also advised that research may usefully be conducted into the valuation of exports and
imports of goods and the coverage of derivatives transactions.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Poland
On July 17, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Poland. 1
Despite its resilience in recent years and very strong fundamentals, the Polish economy has
slowed markedly. Real GDP growth moderated to 1.9 percent in 2012 from 4.5 percent in
2011. A slowdown in Poland’s main export markets, combined with uncertain prospects for
euro area growth and a sharp drop in public investment, weighed on demand. Household
consumption was affected by adverse confidence effects, sluggish disposable income, falling
real wage growth, and rising unemployment. Credit growth decelerated sharply to 3.5 percent
in the first quarter of 2013 (down from 11 percent a year before), on the back of weak credit
demand and tight lending policies by banks.
Reflecting the slowdown, as well as lower fuel and energy prices, CPI inflation has fallen
sharply and stood at 0.5 percent (year-on-year) in May. A monetary easing cycle was started
in November 2012, and the policy rate was cut by a cumulative 200 basis points to 2.75
percent in June 2013.
Fiscal consolidation has continued, albeit at a slower than envisaged pace. The fiscal deficit
declined from 5 percent of GDP in 2011 to 3.9 percent in 2012. The latter was somewhat
larger than expected, as the economic slowdown dented on indirect tax collections, especially
the VAT. Public debt (ESA95 definition) dropped to 55.6 percent of GDP in 2012.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary
is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found
here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

The banking sector remained well-capitalized, profitable, and liquid. Reliance on foreign
currency funding has declined. But the impaired loan ratio inched up to 9 percent mainly due
to deterioration in the corporate loan portfolio, reflecting rising bankruptcies (notably in the
construction sector). Stress tests conducted as part of the recent IMF-World Bank Financial
Sector Assessment Program update confirm the sector’s resilience: bank capital and liquidity
buffers can withstand large shocks and contagion risks are limited.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors emphasized that Poland’s sound macroeconomic management, strong
fundamentals, resilient financial system, and adequate international reserves have helped
preserve confidence in the country’s policies. The precautionary Flexible Credit Line
arrangement has provided insurance against external risks. However, Directors noted that
slower growth will require balancing support for the economy with the need to further build
up policy buffers.
Directors observed that Poland’s high trade and financial interconnectedness with Europe
and open capital account make it susceptible to shocks. In this regard, Directors welcomed
actions by the authorities, notably the large pre-funding of government financing needs, to
mitigate these risks.
Directors commended the authorities’ commitment to fiscal sustainability. For 2013, most
Directors agreed that automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate fully around
budgeted measures. A few others, however, considered that further consolidation measures
could be necessary. Directors broadly agreed that the medium-term objective of a structural
deficit of 1 percent of GDP by 2016 remains appropriate. However, additional fiscal
measures of about 1 percent of GDP would be needed to put the public debt ratio firmly on
a downward path. They called for a broad expenditure review to identify areas where
non-priority spending can be reduced, while protecting investment spending. They looked
forward to the implementation of a simple and transparent expenditure rule which should
allow for countercyclical fiscal policy.
Directors noted that the recent review of the pension system will have significant
implications for the functioning of the second pillar. They emphasized that the fiscal and
financial market implications should be carefully assessed.
Directors agreed that the accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate in a context
of muted inflationary pressures and narrow fiscal space. However, a number of Directors
advised a cautious approach to further easing, given risks associated with a low rate
environment. Directors agreed that the exchange rate should be allowed to float freely, but
that interventions could be used to limit excessive volatility. They urged the National Bank
of Poland to provide liquidity support if needed.

3

Directors welcomed the findings of the Financial System Stability Assessment that the
banking system is well capitalized, profitable and liquid. They commended efforts to further
strengthen banking system resilience, including the reduced reliance on foreign funding.
Directors underscored that safeguarding asset quality will be essential, especially given the
economic slowdown. They encouraged broadening the areas where the Financial Supervision
Authority (KNF) can issue effective supervisory guidance, as well as increasing its resources,
budgetary autonomy, and flexibility. They looked forward to the establishment of
macroprudential and bank resolution frameworks in the near future.
Directors encouraged continued structural reforms to boost potential growth and maximize
the benefits of integration into global supply chains. They recommended reducing
administrative barriers, improving access to certain regulated professions, and advancing
reforms to increase labor force participation and labor market efficiency. Directors noted the
launch of the new investment fund and recommended that its corporate governance and
operations follow best international practices.

Statement by Mr. Dominik Radziwill, Alternate Executive Director
and Ms. Joanna Osinska, Advisor to Executive Director
July 17, 2013
On behalf of our Polish authorities, we would like to thank staff for the constructive
consultations held in Warsaw and the comprehensive set of papers. The authorities
broadly concur with the staff assessment and policy recommendations.
Economic Outlook
While the Polish economy continued its upward trend in 2012, it entered a phase of
cyclical GDP slowdown. Economic growth moderated last year to slightly less than
2 percent. This year, it is expected to reach 1.1percent, the lowest figure since 1991. Key
factors behind the weak GDP growth in 2013 include unfavourable economic situation in
the euro area, falling household consumption dynamics (driven by a difficult situation in
the labor market and a gradual recovery in household savings), as well as fiscal
tightening, and falling public investment financed with EU structural funds. Still, Poland
remains one of the fastest growing EU economies.
Over the medium term, however, the economic outlook should improve, due to a rebound
in domestic and external demand. Given strong trade, financial and confidence channels
between Poland and its external environment, risks are on the downside. The
unemployment rate remains high at 10.7 percent (reflecting, among other factors, an
increase in participation rate). Until domestic consumption improves, net exports are
expected to remain a positive contributor to growth on the account of higher dynamics of
exports than imports. In the first four months of 2013 Polish exports grew by more than
7 percent, notably due to a partial reorientation toward less-traditional—i.e., non-EU—
markets. In April the current account recorded an all-time high monthly surplus, while
narrowing to 2.5 percent in 12-month terms of GDP.
Similarly to recent developments observed elsewhere, June witnessed an outflow of
portfolio investments from the sovereign debt market. The dynamics for July, however,
are more balanced, showing a positive perception of the country’s risk by foreign
investors. The authorities decided to abstain from holding bond sales in July and August
after they managed to pre-fund almost 90 percent of the yearly borrowing needs by endJune owing to highly favorable financing conditions.
Poland continues to benefit from the precautionary Flexible Credit Line arrangement with
the Fund which provides an additional reserve buffer against external shocks and helps
strengthen investor confidence.

Fiscal Policy
The Polish authorities remain fully committed to reducing the remaining fiscal imbalance
and ensuring long-term fiscal sustainability. Mindful of the fragile economic outlook,
they carefully design the range of measures in a way that would not pose a threat to the
country's medium-term growth perspectives. The 2010-12 sizeable consolidation
package, combining both revenue and expenditure measures, helped to cut the nominal
deficit from 7.9 percent of GDP in 2010 to 3.9 percent in 2012. In structural terms, the
reduction took place at a pace even exceeding the one recommended by the EU Council
(in 2012 alone, the structural balance was improved by 1.7 percentage points of GDP).
As expected, in 2012 the share of general government expenditure in GDP (after
excluding budget co-financing of projects financed with the EU structural funds) reached
its lowest level in the last two decades. In the same year the authorities managed to put
the public debt ratio on the downward path to 55.6 percent of GDP (ESA95 definition).
Nonetheless, the adverse economic circumstances had a major negative impact on the
government finances and led to deterioration of its cyclical component. In effect, the
decrease of the nominal deficit-to-GDP ratio reached in 2012 turned out to be too small
to enable abrogation of the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP). However, in recognition
of Poland’s significant structural effort, the EU Council granted a two-year extension of
the deadline for correction of the excessive deficit situation, from 2012 to 2014. The
authorities are committed to further improving the structural balance in the coming years
in line with the recommendation and with the aim to reach the medium-term budgetary
objective (MTO) of 1 percent of GDP in 2016.
Simultaneously, our Polish authorities continued efforts to strengthen the fiscal
framework. Work on the design of a stabilizing permanent fiscal rule reached the final
stage. The overarching aim of the prospective rule is to reduce and—subsequently—
stabilize the deficit and public debt. To this end, the rule will set an expenditure limit
based on the medium-term GDP growth and be equipped with an appropriate correction
mechanism. The latter will take into account business cycle developments and thereby
will ensure avoiding a risk of fiscal procyclicality. Our authorities appreciate the
collaborative work with staff on the analysis of alternative variants of fiscal rules.
Monetary Policy
After persistently exceeding the upper limit for deviations from the NBP’s target of
2.5 percent in the recent years, in the fourth quarter of 2012 the inflation rate began to
decrease rapidly. In early 2013, headline CPI reached levels below the lower limit of the
permissible fluctuation band. Also, PPI continued its downward trend and fell into

negative territory. Low inflation rate stems from a negative output gap and weak demand
pressure related to the weak labor market.
In response, the Monetary Policy Council (MPC) commenced a monetary policy easing
cycle. Cumulative interest rate cuts of 225 bps—including the July MPC’s decision
which is supposed to end the cycle—resulted in an all-time low reference rate of
2.50 percent. This significant reduction of rates, implemented since November 2012,
should support economic recovery and limit the risk of inflation running below the NBP
target in the medium term. Moreover, the level of official reserves remains largely
adequate, covering about 5.6 months of imports.
Financial Sector
The ongoing slowdown in GDP growth and the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area did
not adversely affect resilience of the Polish financial sector. Polish banks maintain low
leverage ratios, remain liquid, well-capitalized and highly profitable.
Despite weaker macroeconomic conditions and falling interest rates, the net profits of
Polish banks have been stable since they reached record high levels in 2011. In line with
recommendations issued by the Financial Supervisory Authority (KNF), banks increased
their capital buffers with the capital adequacy ratio reaching 15.4 percent at the end of the
first quarter of 2013 and Tier 1 capital representing around 90 percent of total capital. At
the same time, the liability structure of Polish banks improved as the parent-based
funding was, to some extent, substituted with deposits from non-financial residents. In
spite of the impact of the financial crisis on some of the foreign parent institutions, there
was no evidence of disorderly deleveraging in the Polish banking sector.
After a strong credit growth over the last two years, the expansion slowed this year.
Although the overall credit to non-financial sector grew by 2.2 percent y/y (after
exchange rate adjustment) as of the first quarter of 2013, further tightening of banks’
lending policies is expected—particularly for SMEs. With a view to mitigating credit
constraints they face, a new government-sponsored initiative was launched. The “De
Minimis” program is aimed at providing government guarantees for loans for SMEs,
enabling them to raise funding for their working capital needs and taking some of the risk
burden away from the commercial banks.
Simultaneously, the authorities take further measures to strengthen the financial sector
and improve supervision, including new macroprudential and bank resolution
frameworks. Regulatory and supervisory actions to reduce the share of FX loans in new
mortgage lending proved successful. Although the overall NPLs level slightly increased
on the account of economic slowdown and rise in unemployment—with most
pronounced deterioration in the corporate loan portfolio, it remains well provisioned.

Structural Reforms
Mindful of the importance of structural reforms for long-term growth, the authorities are
further advancing the structural reforms agenda. They maintain efforts to implement
labor and product market reforms, with focus on further increasing the labor participation
rate and reducing youth unemployment. Important steps were taken to ease access to
regulated professions, with the first deregulation act (easing access to 51 professions)
expected to soon enter into force, the second deregulation (91 professions) recently
approved by the Council of Ministers and the third tranche (104 professions) currently
under consultations. In addition, the authorities remain committed to further improving
the business environment and moving forward with privatization of state-owned
enterprises.
To provide a stimulus for greater activation of private capital in the Polish economy, the
authorities have launched the “Polish Investments” Program. It aims to support long term
and commercially-viable infrastructure projects. Importantly, the program’s design
ensures that public debt will not be increased.
