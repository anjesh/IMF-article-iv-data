• Discussions for the 2006 Article IV consultation and the third and fourth reviews under the PRGF
arrangement were held in Bujumbura March 1–18, 2006. The mission consisted of Messrs. Mathieu (head),
Manoel, Basdevant, Samake (all AFR), and Dicks-Mireaux (PDR), and Ms. Adjahouinou (Assistant-AFR).
Mr. Engstrom, the Resident Representative for Burundi, based in Kigali, joined the mission.
Ms. Leroy-Themeze (World Bank) and Mr. Nintunze (advisor to Executive Director Ngumbullu) also
participated in the discussions. The mission met with President Nkurunziza, the Second Vice President; the
presidents of the National Assembly and the Senate; the Ministers of Finance, National Defense, Interior, Plan,
and Energy; and the new Central Bank Governor. It also met with representatives of civil society, the business
sector, and the diplomatic and donor communities.
• Performance under the PRGF-supported program in 2005 was satisfactory. All end-June and endDecember 2005 quantitative performance criteria were met, except for a temporary accumulation of external
arrears in late 2005. The structural performance criterion at end-October and three benchmarks were missed,
but three of the associated measures were implemented by early 2006.
• In the attached letter of intent and memorandum of economic and financial policies, the authorities review
performance under the PRGF-supported program during 2005 and set out policies and program monitoring
issues for 2006. They request completion of the third and fourth reviews; waiver of some performance criteria;
modification of a performance criterion; extension of the PRGF arrangement to allow for completion of the
sixth review; and additional interim assistance under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.
• Key policy issues The successful end to the political transition and the installation of a democratically elected
government open a window of opportunity to relaunch structural reforms as the basis for a durable recovery.
The program for 2006 provides sufficient fiscal space for Burundi to begin addressing deep social needs
without compromising macroeconomic stability and relaunch structural reforms.
• Other issues The new authorities were not in a position to discuss the effectiveness of past Fund surveillance,
but expressed appreciation for Fund policy advice, technical assistance, and discussions with staff. They
stressed the importance of reinforced Fund technical assistance and requested the posting of a full-time
resident representative. While data provision to the Fund is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes,
shortcomings in the national accounts, government finance, and balance of payments statistics hinder the
monitoring of economic developments. Burundi maintains exchange restrictions subject to Fund approval
under IMF Article VIII and staff does not recommend approval of these restrictions. Burundi has consented to
publication of the staff report and program documents. A selected issues paper accompanies this report.

Executive Summary
•

The peace process initiated in August 2000 with the Arusha Accord, and the
political transition that followed, concluded successfully with the installation of a
democratically elected government in August 2005. The new political environment
opens a window of opportunity for Burundi to secure macroeconomic stability and
relaunch structural reforms to set the basis for a durable recovery. The new
government has intensified efforts to resolve the conflict with the remaining rebel
group and is emphasizing good governance and improved social services. Improving
security conditions and a sustained momentum of reform suggest an improved
medium-term macroeconomic outlook.

•

The Article IV consultation discussions focused on lessons from the period of
extended social conflict and on the challenges ahead, including the constraints
and efforts needed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The
key challenges are to launch the economy on a higher growth path and raise spending
on social sectors and infrastructure. Strengthening public financial management and
creating an economic environment conducive to private sector activity will also be
important.

•

Macroeconomic developments in 2005 were broadly in line with the program,
though growth was lower at about 1 percent. The program remained on track in
2005, although structural reform, especially on privatization and the coffee sector
lagged, reflecting the political transition. Some progress has been made on
governance but the capacity of the new institutions needs to be strengthened.

•

The program incorporates strong fiscal reforms. The introduction of treasury
securities would further improve liquidity management, and supervision of the
financial sector is being strengthened. A privatization agenda, especially for coffee, is
to begin in 2006. The managed floating exchange rate regime has served Burundi
well so far and little remains to be done for Burundi to be in a position to accept its
obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of
Agreement.

•

Implementation of the program could help 2006 become a pivotal year for
Burundi’s economic turnaround. Prospects for 2006 are for a rebound in real
growth to 6 percent and a further reduction in inflation. There are risks to the
program, including regional insecurity, a still fragile domestic peace, and immature
democratic institutions. However, given the strength of the program and the
demonstrated commitment of the authorities to reform, the staff recommends
completion of the third and fourth reviews under the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) and supports Burundi’s requests for waivers of two performance
criteria; modification of another; extension of the PRGF arrangement; and additional
interim assistance from the Fund under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Burundi is emerging from more than a decade of civil conflict that started with
the 1993 coup d’état against its first elected government. The Arusha Accord of August
2000 initiated a peace process that was successfully concluded with the installation of a
democratically elected government in August 2005. Since 1993 conditions in Burundi have
deteriorated significantly: per capita income dropped by about half (to about US$110 in
2005); the percentage of people living below the poverty line nearly doubled, to about
58 percent by 2001; access to safe water and health services has deteriorated; and HIV/AIDS
prevalence has risen. There are some 300,000 internally displaced persons and refugees
in camps in Tanzania (down from a million at the peak of the fighting) and half a million
orphans. Burundi is the ninth least developed country in the world.1
2.
Strong progress has been made on the political and security situation that can
set the basis for a durable recovery. From the start, the new government has made intense
efforts to resolve the conflict with the remaining rebel group, the FNL, and has emphasized
good governance and improved social services. In late 2005, the United Nations Security
Council extended the mandate of the U.N. Operation in Burundi through July 2006, but plans
a phased withdrawal of peacekeeping troops through the end of 2006. Military
demobilization, supported by the World Bank’s Multi-Country Demobilization and
Reintegration Program (MDRP), progressed well in 2005. Almost 20,000 persons were
demobilized after the rebel movements were integrated into the armed forces and the new
national police force. Peace talks with the FNL, facilitated by Burundi’s partners in the peace
process, were initiated in Tanzania in early June 2006.
3.
Recent economic developments and performance under the program are discussed in
Section II. The Article IV consultation discussions focused on the lessons from the past
decade and the challenges facing Burundi in the medium term, including the constraints and
efforts needed to achieve the MDGs (see Section IIIA). Policy discussions on the 2006
program and the medium-term outlook are presented in Sections IIIB and IIIC, respectively.
Section IV addresses program monitoring, safeguards, and risks, and the staff appraisal is in
Section V.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAM
4.
Macroeconomic developments in 2005 were broadly in line with the program,
although growth was lower at about 1 percent, largely because of a poor coffee harvest
and worsening drought in the north (Table 1). End-period inflation fell markedly in the
second half of 2005 to about 1 percent at year-end, well below the program target. This
reflected tighter monetary policy and a turnaround in public confidence, as evidenced by an
appreciation of the nominal exchange rate. Fiscal performance was significantly better than
1

programmed because revenue performance was stronger than expected. As a result, the
primary deficit was reduced to about half the program target.
5.
However, the external current
account deficit (including grants)
deteriorated, owing to lower coffee
exports and higher imports, including
petroleum products. As drought in parts of
the north worsened in early 2006, it was
necessary to mobilize emergency actions to
feed those affected, supported by
international relief agencies. However, by
the spring the drought appeared to have
broken and a more normal harvest is
expected in mid-2006.

structural performance criterion on installing a computerized financial management
information system (IFMIS) in the Ministry of Finance was missed, as were three structural
benchmarks, but the measures subject to the PC and two benchmarks were implemented by
early 2006 (Appendix I, Table 2).
7.
Fiscal performance in 2005 was
satisfactory (MEFP, paragraphs 6-9). Revenue
remained buoyant at 20 percent of GDP,
significantly above the program target, thanks
primarily to administrative reforms. Current
expenditures were higher than forecast but
because domestically financed project spending
was considerably lower, the primary deficit was
limited to half the program target. On a
commitments basis, the deficit after grants was
6.2 percent of GDP, compared with the target of
0.2 percent of GDP. This reflected delays in
disbursement of budget support by the World
Bank and others.

The 2006 budget, adopted in late 2005, envisaged a drop in revenues to
18.9 percent of GDP and spending of 40.8 percent of GDP. The budget incorporated
important reforms to remove distortionary taxes, lower import duties, extend the tax base,
eliminate discretionary exemptions, and to bolster expenditure management—all of which
represent significant progress. However, in early 2006, levies on beer, soft drinks, and sugar,
which had funded the war effort, were abolished. Given the resultant revenue loss of
1.0 percent of GDP and the need to program the clearance of domestic arrears, a revised
budget became necessary. An external audit of domestic arrears of the budget, financed by
the World Bank, was completed in December 2005. It confirmed a stock of about 3 percent
of GDP, and a strategy to clear these arrears in 2006 was approved by the council of
ministers in early June. A partial integrated financial management system (IFMIS) on
expenditures introduced in January 2006, combined with the new system of accounts
introduced in 2005, should significantly strengthen expenditure management.

10.
The situation of the banking system, which remains segmented and
underdeveloped, is of concern. Nonperforming loans amounted to 19 percent of assets in
2005, in large measure reflecting government arrears to private operators. Four smaller banks
are in difficulty.
11.
The external current account
deficit, including grants,
deteriorated in 2005 to 10.5 percent
of GDP, on lower-than-expected
exports, as a result of a very poor
coffee harvest and higher imports.
However, gross official reserves rose
to 2.9 months of projected 2006
imports because of higher project and
humanitarian aid inflows. With the
successful political transition and
improvements in the BRB’s foreign

Burundi has made
progress in securing debt relief. The enhanced HIPC Initiative decision point was reached
in August 2005 and relief totaling US$7.4 million was received in 2005. Scheduled debt
service, after traditional debt relief from Paris Club creditors in 2004 and HIPC debt relief,
fell from about 110 percent of exports in 2004 to 33.5 percent in 2005. Burundi has yet to
secure debt relief from non-Paris Club bilateral creditors. Arrears that Burundi inadvertently
accumulated to the OPEC Fund in late 2005 were cleared early in 2006.

Structural reform in 2005 was uneven. Significant progress continued in the
monetary, exchange regime, and fiscal administration areas, but reform of the coffee sector
slowed in the second half and the privatization program was not launched because the new
authorities needed more time to take ownership of the reform strategy (MEFP,
paragraphs 11–12). Limited administrative capacity and delays in securing technical
assistance also played a role in both cases. In late 2005, the Audit Court published its first
audit of the 2004 government accounts.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
14.
The Article IV consultation discussions focused on lessons from the past decade
and challenges ahead, including achievement of the MDGs. The new authorities were not
in a position to engage in a discussion on the effectiveness of past Fund surveillance, but
expressed appreciation for Fund policy advice and technical assistance, and for the candor of
discussions with Fund staff. They stressed the importance of reinforced Fund technical
assistance and requested that a full-time resident representative be posted. Policy discussions
for 2006 focused on securing macroeconomic stability and creating an economic
environment conducive to private sector activity. Achieving these goals will depend on
pursuing prudent fiscal and monetary policies and deepening structural reforms. The
authorities will need to strengthen governance and transparency while managing high public
expectations for a peace dividend.
A. Lessons and Medium-Term Challenges
15.

the economic effects of stalled structural reforms were also increasingly felt. These

the turn of the millennium,
living standards in Burundi had dropped sharply and the external debt burden had become
unsustainable.2
16.
The state has long dominated Burundi’s economy and the formal private sector
is very small. Poor performance of public enterprises in the productive sector, exacerbated
by weak international commodity prices in the late 1990s, led to large financial losses,
external and domestic payments arrears, and decapitalization of the key agricultural sector,
which employs a large majority of the population. By 2001/02, the decapitalization of the
coffee sector reached the point that sizeable bank credit, financed by directed credits from the
central bank and guaranteed by the budget, was needed to finance crop marketing. The
budget absorbed the large losses of the coffee sector throughout 2003–04. As a result, fiscal
imbalances widened, nonperforming loans accumulated, and the financial system
deteriorated.
17.
Initial progress was made in addressing these large imbalances and
administrative restrictions through programs supported first by the Fund’s emergency
post-conflict assistance policy in 2002–03 and subsequently under the PRGF. By
end-2005, many of the restrictions on foreign trade, the financial sector, and the exchange
system had been unwound. The top import tariff rate was reduced from 100 percent in 2003
to 30 percent in January 2005. In the 2006 budget, the simple average tariff, which had been
35.0 percent in 2001, was further cut from 19.2 percent to 12.6 percent with 99.8 percent of
the tariffs falling in four bands (5, 10, 15, and 30) and a few at 0 or 20 percent. The 6 percent
import surcharge was eliminated and a 0.5 percent customs fee introduced on the c.i.f. value
of imports.

Stalled Structural Reforms” in the accompanying Selected Issues paper for a fuller discussion.

18.
The challenges ahead, as reflected in the interim and forthcoming full PRSP, are
to launch the economy on a higher growth path, raise spending on social sectors and
infrastructure, and achieve the MDGs. The new political environment opens a window of
opportunity to secure macroeconomic stability and relaunch structural reforms to make the
nascent recovery durable. Stronger public financial management (PFM) will also be
necessary. Political stability and improved security in both Burundi and the Great Lakes
region will clearly be a condition for sustained economic recovery. While it is unlikely that
all the MDGs can be met by 2015, significant progress can be made if Burundi:
•

Adopts a more market-oriented economic policy, supported by appropriate regulation
and featuring a well-sequenced privatization strategy, starting with coffee, where
privatization of individual washing stations is envisaged.

•

Improves administrative capacity and the quality of public institutions, especially
regarding PFM, including the central bank and supervision of the financial sector.

•

Pursues prudent monetary and fiscal policies and contains public expectations of a
large peace dividend.

•

Restructures public spending, moving it from the security sector (army and police) to
the social sectors to address deep social needs and progress toward the MDGs.

•

Improves infrastructure and makes a concerted effort to improve governance,
transparency, and create a business-friendly environment to attract much-needed
private investment.

•

Manages aid flows consistent with macroeconomic stability and maximizes their
effectiveness in reducing poverty.

19.
The authorities were in broad agreement with the conclusions on lessons of the
past decade and challenges for the future. They also indicated their commitment to
bringing the poorest segments of the population into the economic recovery and improving
basic social services to reduce poverty.
B. The Macroeconomic Program for 2006
20.
In 2006, real GDP growth is projected to recover to 6 percent with continued
vigor in the service sectors and a strong rebound in coffee output (MEFP, paragraph 13).
Average inflation is expected to decelerate further to about 3 percent (period average),
despite the pass-through of petroleum price increases. To contain inflationary pressures, it
will be necessary to further strengthen the BRB’s monetary policy instruments and limit bank
financing of the budget. With the clearance of domestic arrears, and the decline in nominal
interest rates in early 2006, a further monetization of the economy is expected. Bank credit to
the economy is projected to rebound in support of higher growth and investment. The
external current account deficit, including official transfers, is expected to deteriorate, on

- 12 -

account of a strong increase in foreign-financed projects. Gross international reserves would
rise modestly to about 3.3 months of 2007 imports.
Fiscal policy and reform
21.
The program provides fiscal space for Burundi to start addressing urgent social
needs consistent with macroeconomic stability. Fiscal policy envisages a shift in
expenditures from security to social services and poverty reduction, enhanced PFM, and the
clearing of government’s domestic arrears (Box 1). Fiscal policy also seeks to support the
inflation target by limiting budget recourse to financing from the banking system. Bank
credit to the government, net of government paper issued to clear domestic arrears
(1.9 percent of GDP), would be limited to about 1 percent of beginning broad money stock.3
A revised 2006 budget will be promulgated before end-June to reflect changes that have
emerged since the initial budget (MEFP, paragraphs 14–16 and 19-20). The primary deficit
would rise to about 9 percent of GDP, while the deficit (commitment basis, after grants),
would decline to less than ½ percent of GDP.
Box 1. Clearance of Domestic Arrears
By the end of 2005, domestic budget arrears totaled 2.7 percent of 2005 GDP (FBu 25.7 billion).
The domestic arrears of the public sector had amounted to 5 percent of GDP a year earlier, as verified by
an external auditor. In 2005, the budget cleared FBu 3.8 billion of its own arrears; those of the public
enterprises (FBu 6 billion) and cross-debts with the petroleum sector will be dealt with separately. The
domestic arrears to the public are reflected in large measure in the nonperforming assets of the banking
system.
The Council of Ministers approved an arrears clearance strategy on May 26, 2006 to be
implemented in mid-2006. All individuals and corporations with arrears claims of up to FBu 100
million will receive a cash payment upon signing a note liquidating their claim (total cash payment is
estimated at FBu 7.4 billion). Creditors with arrears greater than FBu 100 million will also receive a
certificate recognizing their debt (FBu 18.3 billion). These certificates will be exchangeable for treasury
bonds of 3–5 years maturity and may be used in the privatization program, both of which are set to be
launched in September/October 2006.

22.
A strong set of measures to strengthen revenue administration is being
implemented in 2006 (MEFP, paragraph 18). Nevertheless, overall revenue will decline by
1 percentage point of GDP to 19 percent as the war levies are abolished. The government,
with Fund and World Bank technical assistance, is undertaking to modernize and strengthen
revenue administration, including customs.

3

Government securities issued to clear the domestic arrears in mid-2006 are assumed to end up in the banking
system.

- 13 -

23.
Expenditure is projected
to rise significantly in 2006 to
about 41.8 percent of GDP,
mainly tracking an increase in
pro-poor social spending (Table
2). The increase is in part made
possible by external debt relief
under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.
The wage bill will rise to just under
10 percent of GDP as new teachers
are hired4 and there is a muchneeded salary increase.5 Spending
on security (army and national
police) will decline to 30 percent of
primary outlays from 37 percent in
2005, as soldiers are demobilized,
financed by the MDRP. The
program includes spending of
1.2 percent of GDP to allow for
food and emergency aid for
populations suffering from the
drought and to compensate small
depositors of a failed bank.

PFM is being
strengthened, from a very low base, with the help of Fund and World Bank technical
assistance (MEFP, paragraph 17).6 Implementation of program action plans would
strengthen public procurement and the management of government employees. The wage bill
will be incorporated into the IFMIS in late 2006.

Primary school enrollment has doubled since primary school fees were abolished in September 2005, which
overwhelmed facilities and teacher capacity. The World Bank is preparing an education sector project
(US$40 million) in cooperation with bilateral donors to support rehabilitation of the education system. On
May 1, 2006, health care for expectant mothers and children under 5 years of age was made free.
5

The increase of 15 percent in base salaries starting July 1, 2006 is the first since a 10 percent hike in July
2001. In the five years since the last general wage increase, consumer prices have risen by about 35 percent.

See “Public Expenditure Management Reform in Burundi” for more details on the status of public expenditure
management in the accompanying selected issues paper.

- 14 -

Monetary policy
25.
Monetary policy is crucial to achieving the program’s inflation target; reserve
money is the nominal anchor (MEFP, paragraphs 21–22). The central bank will use a
judicious mix of monetary instruments, primarily foreign exchange sales and liquidity
auctions, to contain liquidity and will introduce treasury bills by September 2006 to further
strengthen liquidity management. The velocity of circulation of broad money is expected to
decline further, as financial deepening strengthens in response to financial and foreign
exchange market reforms (Table 3). Reserve money growth will be significantly reduced to
10 percent, in expectation of a rise in the money multiplier and the renewed commercial bank
credit to the private sector (24 percent growth is projected). Continued strong foreign
exchange sales by the BRB into the market may put upward pressure on the nominal
exchange rate, given the size of external aid inflows, but, on balance, this would be
preferable to crowding out private investment.
26.
The authorities agreed that fortifying financial sector supervision and
eliminating weaknesses in BRB internal operations is urgent and the program includes
a prior action in this area. In early 2006, a Fund technical assistance team discussed
measures to reinforce monetary policy, banking supervision, and BRB internal operations. A
Fund resident advisor is helping the authorities on monetary policy reforms and central bank
operations. An anti-money laundering (AML/CFT) law has been prepared7 (MEFP,
paragraph 28) with Fund technical assistance; and the central bank law will be revised to
make the BRB independent (MEFP, paragraph 33).
Exchange regime, trade policy, and external debt
27.
Staff and the authorities agreed that liberalizing the exchange regime has been
beneficial to the economy and that the managed float exchange rate regime has served
Burundi well so far. Removal of administrative restrictions and distortions has all but
eliminated the parallel market exchange rate differential, which represents good progress in
reducing foreign exchange market segmentation. Efforts are planned to further integrate and
deepen the foreign exchange market, supported by Fund technical assistance (MEFP,
paragraph 22). The BRB intends to continue to limit its interventions in the foreign exchange
market to those needed to achieve its international reserves targets, consistent with the
reserve money nominal anchor, and limit short-term exchange rate volatility. In discussing
external competitiveness, staff noted that despite its recent appreciation, the real effective
exchange rate remained well below (some 30 percent) the level in 2000. It saw external
competitiveness as broadly adequate, as recovering export performance illustrates.
Furthermore, staff noted, and the authorities agreed, that the main impediments to external
competitiveness are structural in nature, and would be best addressed by structural reforms
7

correspondents abroad.

- 15 -

that would improve the business climate and promote privatization. The gains in productivity
resulting from these reforms would also help reduce the possible adverse impact on external
competitiveness of large-scale aid inflows; indeed some of these inflows would be for
productivity-enhancing reforms.
28.
In early 2006, a Fund technical assistance mission found few remaining
exchange restrictions on current international transactions and felt that little remained
to be done for Burundi to be in a position to accept its obligations under Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. The authorities agreed with the
staff’s assessment and indicated their intention to accept these obligations. Burundi
eliminated an exchange restriction on limits on invisibles in May 2006 and expects to
eliminate one remaining restriction on ex ante authorization of certain transactions and two
remaining multiple currency practices (MCPs) shortly. The exchange restriction and MCPs
are subject to approval under IMF Article VIII (Appendix II, Section VIII).
29.
The staff noted that a liberalized trade policy could enable Burundi to benefit
from globalization. Here the recent significant reduction in import duties and nontariff
barriers is encouraging. The authorities agreed that there is a need for sustained efforts to
integrate Burundi with Africa and the rest of the world. They intend, with the support of the
World Bank, to improve the business climate to attract private investment, domestic and
foreign, and institute a one-stop business licensing window. Staff welcomed the authorities’
intention to join the East Africa Community (EAC) and adopt its common external tariff
(rates of 0, 10, and 25 percent, with an average rate in line with Burundi’s present tariff).
30.
The authorities have been seeking debt relief comparable to the Paris Club
agreement from non-Paris Club creditors. They have also sought intensified technical
assistance from donors on debt management, an area where progress has been slow. Several
multilaterals have confirmed their participation in the enhanced HIPC Initiative. At the HIPC
completion point (possibly in mid-2007) external debt service would drop from 109 percent
of exports in 2004 to 11.1 percent in 2007. With additional relief under the Multilateral Debt
Relief Initiative (MDRI), the Fund will provide upfront debt stock relief on Burundi’s
outstanding debt to the Fund at end-2004 of SDR 26.4 million (US$39.5 million).8 The
authorities have requested disbursement of additional interim HIPC assistance from the Fund
in the amount of SDR 86,500 for July 28, 2006–July 27, 2007.9

As a transitional measure, HIPC debt relief at, and after, the assumed completion point (mid-2007) is

- 16 -

Program financing
31.
The program for 2006 is fully financed (Tables 4, 5, and 6; MEFP, paragraph 31).
The 2006 program depends heavily on external budget grants (12 percent of GDP, not
including interim HIPC debt relief). In the past few years, delays in disbursement of external
program support have put pressure on the macroeconomic framework, notably bank
financing. The authorities have created a committee to reinforce their dialogue with donors.
Structural reform
32.
The authorities agreed that the 2006 program needs to reactivate the
privatization agenda, especially for coffee (MEFP, paragraphs 23–26 and Box 2). Their
strategy, with the support of the World Bank, is to take a graduated approach. The initial
effort focuses on small-scale assets, such as coffee washing stations. Execution of the reform
strategy for coffee will be vital to reducing poverty in Burundi, in particular for some
800,000 small rural producers, and to export performance (coffee accounted for some twothirds of exports in 2004–06). The authorities have put in place structures to manage the
reforms, and to minimize the financial risks to the producers and the government during the
transition. A strategy for the sale of the washing stations will be established, on the basis of a
World Bank-financed technical study, by September 2006. The reforms will be pursued so
that producers may operate freely so as to ensure competition at all levels of the coffee sector
and to attract much needed investment and private financing. The authorities will ensure that
regulation by the state coffee marketing board (OCIBU) does not impede investment.
Box 2. Structural Conditionality
Coverage of structural conditionality under the`PRGF-supported program
Structural conditionality in 2005 was directed at deepening reform of the coffee sector, initiating a
privatization program, introducing more efficient monetary policy instruments, and making further
progress on PFM, including conducting an audit of domestic arrears.
Status of structural conditionality under the 2006 program (Appendix i, table 4)
For 2006, structural conditionality is directed at clearing domestic arrears, further reinforcing PFM and
liberalizing coffee and other sectors, completing exchange liberalization, rehabilitating national
statistics, making the central bank independent, and launching the privatization strategy.
Structural areas covered by world bank lending and conditionality
Under the proposed economic reform support grant (ERSG), the World Bank is helping Burundi prepare
a strategic privatization plan, improve public finances and the operations of the treasury, and reform of
the coffee, tea, and cotton sectors. The program includes launching the privatization strategy; furthering
expenditure management reforms, especially in procurement; and improving the business environment.

33.
Some progress has been made on governance and transparency (MEFP,
paragraphs 27-28), but the new institutions (e.g., the Audit Court) are untested, and much
remains to be done. With Fund and World Bank technical assistance, weaknesses in PFM are

- 17 -

being addressed. The authorities have moved strongly to address issues raised in the Fund’s
safeguards assessment of the central bank (MEFP, paragraph 33).
34.
The complete PRSP is in the final stages of preparation and is expected to be
ready in mid-2006 (MEFP, paragraph 32).10 The authorities have estimated the three-year
cost of implementing the PRSP at US$535 million (67 percent of 2005 GDP) and intend to
mobilize financing at a donors’ conference planned for the fourth quarter of 2006.
35.
The authorities have made good but uneven progress toward achieving
enhanced HIPC Initiative completion point triggers (Table 7). However, they have made
little progress on improving debt management and producing external debt reports, for which
they have requested additional technical support.
National statistics and technical assistance
36.
The authorities are conscious of the serious deficiencies in the national statistical
base and the operations and legal basis of the national statistical office (MEFP,
paragraphs 29–30). They have requested technical assistance from the Fund and other donors
to address the weaknesses. A national statistical development plan drafted in collaboration
with the World Bank and AFRISTAT will be implemented in 2006, with donor support. With
Fund technical assistance, the balance of payments was converted to version five of the
Balance of Payments Manual in early 2006.
37.
Burundi has significant technical assistance needs (MEFP, paragraph 34). The
authorities stressed the importance of reinforced Fund technical assistance in asking for a
full-time resident representative. The authorities expect that the Fund’s new regional
technical assistance center (AFRITAC-Centre) opening in Gabon in early 2007 will be of
significant help.
C. Medium-Term Outlook and Debt Sustainability Analysis
38.
The successful conclusion of the political transition, improving security
conditions, and sustained reform momentum prefigures an improved medium-term
macroeconomic outlook (Tables 8 and 9). The growth profile is likely to be typical of
recovering post-conflict countries, with an initial period of catch-up growth.11 The higher
investment and growth profile reflects the momentum of reforms and higher projected aid
10

A PRSP Preparation Status Report and Joint Staff Advisory Note were issued to the Executive Board on
July 11, 2005 (Country Reports Nos. 05/325 and 05/324, respectively).

11

This outlook assumes a stronger recovery of growth and investment than is assumed in the enhanced HIPC
Initiative Decision Point Document (Country Report No. 05/329). Higher investment (financed by higher aid
inflows), together with sustained structural reform, would drive stronger export and overall growth over the
long term. Imports would also grow more strongly and over the long-term decline only moderately in relation
to GDP.

- 18 -

inflows. Stimulated by economic reforms, the entrance into productive activity of returning
refugees and demobilized combatants, and the economic use of land and other property in
previously insecure locations, economic growth is projected to rise to 6½–7 percent early in
the period (2007–09). Growth would then ease to a sustained rate of 6 percent, with
privatization and an improved business environment. Nevertheless, not until 2023 is GDP per
capita (in current U.S. dollars) projected to reach the equivalent of US$1 a day. The external
current account deficit (excluding current official transfers) would peak at about 38 percent
of GDP in 2007 and thereafter decline gradually to 13 percent of GDP by 2026, based on a
recovery in production and exports. As privatization takes effect, gross investment, especially
from the private sector, would rise over the medium term. Domestic savings would cease to
be highly negative and begin providing resources for investment by 2017.
39.
From a low base in 2004, exports are projected to drive growth over the long
term as traditional sectors recover and new sectors emerge. The inflow of private
investment would raise the quality of Burundi’s coffee, which is projected to once again
fetch a premium over international prices starting in 2008. Private investment in
nontraditional sectors such as horticulture, fresh fruits and vegetables, essential oils, tourism,
and minerals (gold, nickel, and tungsten), which is already emerging, would make a
significant contribution in the second decade of the period, especially if direct air links to
Europe are reestablished and electricity supply problems are addressed. Foreign reserves
would be maintained at just over four months of following-year imports. Financing gaps of
US$75–130 million through 2016 would begin tailing off to about US$80 million by 2025,
amounts that could be covered from 2007 in part by additional debt relief under the MDRI.12
40.
Two alternative scenarios examine the impact of lower growth, reflecting stalled
reform, and of higher coffee export prices. In the low-growth scenario, starting in 2007, GDP
growth would be only 4 percent a year for ten years before returning to the baseline rate. In
this scenario, the financial position of the country would weaken considerably and the
external current account deficits and financing gaps are much larger in the outer years.
Investment would be somewhat lower, while domestic savings would emerge only late in the
period. GDP per capita would be 25 percent lower (and less than US$1 a day) in 2026. The
second scenario assumes a selling price for coffee that is 25 percent higher than in the
baseline from 2007 to 2010. This scenario assumes that coffee sector investment would
accelerate revenues. Financing gaps would be significantly reduced early on and investment
and domestic savings would be somewhat higher.
41.
An updated low-income country debt sustainability analysis (LIC DSA),
prepared jointly by Fund and World Bank staff, indicates that Burundi is vulnerable to
shocks and remains in the high debt distress category for low-income countries
12

As a transitional measure, HIPC debt relief at and after the assumed completion point (mid-2007) is presented
in flow terms. It will be shown as a stock operation, along with the MDRI, in the documents for the fifth PRGF
review scheduled for December.

- 19 -

(Appendix VI). The external debt-to-exports ratio after enhanced HIPC assistance is
projected to remain above the threshold for 2005–13. The stress tests show that Burundi is
vulnerable to adverse developments, including borrowing on nonconcessional terms. The
DSA underscores the need for Burundi to implement a strong, sustained reform effort to
encourage export diversification and support robust growth in exports and GDP. Prudent debt
management will be important, as will external financing on highly concessional terms.
IV. PROGRAM MONITORING, SAFEGUARDS, AND RISKS
42.
The prior actions for completion of the third and fourth reviews primarily seek
to address slippages in implementing structural reforms, including the phasing in of
coffee sector reform (MEFP, paragraph 35, and Appendix I, Table 4). To take into account
domestic arrears clearance and the introduction of tradable security instruments, the
quantitative performance criterion on bank credit to government has been replaced by one on
overall domestic financing. The BRB has begun to address the issues identified in the
safeguards assessment completed in January 2006. The authorities have requested a
nine-month extension to the PRGF arrangement to complete the sixth review (Tables 10
and 11).
43.

The program is subject to several risks:
•

Security within the country is fragile. Institutional rehabilitation and economic and
social recovery will be needed to promote further progress. The situation in the Great
Lakes region is also fragile; there could be grave repercussions for Burundi should
the situation deteriorate.

•

Delays in the pace of structural reforms and in improving social services could
undermine public confidence in the reform and recovery effort. Progress on
achieving a sustained, poverty-reducing recovery of economic activity depends
critically on a strong early effort to improve the business environment and to start
privatization.

•

Timely and adequate external financial support is critical. Burundi’s program
depends heavily on external budget support. Major delays in disbursement of program
support would severely stress the budget and the macroeconomic framework.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL

44.
Burundi made commendable progress in 2005 in implementing its
PRGF-supported program in a difficult post-conflict environment. While structural
reforms slowed in the second half of 2005, owing to the political transition, all the end-June
and end-December 2005 quantitative performance criteria were met, with one temporary
exception. Growth in 2005 was much lower than expected primarily because of the vagaries
of rain-fed agriculture. A strong rebound is expected in 2006. Inflation was significantly
reduced in 2005 because the central bank was better able to conduct monetary policy and
inject official foreign exchange inflows into the exchange market.

- 20 -

45.
The successful political transition to a democratically elected government and
improved security is encouraging. The recent peace talks with the last remaining rebel
movement is a very welcome development. The integration of former rebel movements into
the armed forces and army has gone well, as has the demobilization process.
46.
The past decade was very difficult for Burundi because of the extended social
conflict and the accumulated effects of intensified restrictions and stalled structural
reforms. The authorities will need to resolutely implement structural reforms to stimulate
private sector activity, notably by launching the privatization program and improving the
business climate. To increase spending on the social sectors and infrastructure, as is
necessary to achieve the MDGs, Burundi would need to continue to reduce the size of its
security forces, and thus spending on security, through demobilization.
47.
The pace of structural reform in 2005 was uneven. Progress was strong in the
fiscal, monetary, and exchange areas, but there were delays in initiating the deeper reforms in
the productive sectors that are fundamental for sustained recovery. While the delays are
understandable given the political transition, staff urges the authorities to press ahead with
privatization. Recent efforts to reinforce coordination with donors to ensure timely and
cohesive technical assistance and financial support should continue.
48.
The authorities are to be commended for Burundi’s strong fiscal performance in
2005. The buoyancy of revenues, despite the significant reduction in import duties, confirms
that the revenue reforms were appropriate. However, abolishing the levies for funding the
war effort was ill-timed coming just after budget approval. Staff encourages the authorities to
fully cost all social initiatives and ensure that they are consistent with the budget. The
authorities have strengthened expenditure management from a very low base. These efforts
must be pursued and extended over the medium term with donor assistance to further
strengthen budget execution, financial control, and public procurement. Staff encourages the
authorities to carefully manage public expectations of a peace dividend.
49.
The BRB has made good progress on firming up monetary policy. Clearing
domestic arrears and introducing standardized and negotiable treasury securities in 2006 will
strengthen the efficiency and soundness of the financial system. It is important that the BRB
follow through with its efforts to bolster banking supervision. The staff commends the BRB
for improvements in its internal operations, including its responses to the safeguards
assessment, as evidenced by its second annual external audit. Nevertheless, much remains to
be done to modernize its operations, including computerization of accounting and better
internal auditing. Passing an anti-money laundering law and revising the central bank law to
give the BRB independence are further important measures planned for 2006.
50.
There has been commendable progress in liberalizing the exchange regime.
Burundi maintains exchange restrictions subject to Fund approval under IMF Article VIII,
and staff does not recommend their approval. The authorities recently eliminated an
exchange restriction and intend to eliminate the remaining restriction and multiple currency
practices shortly. The authorities’ intention to accept the obligations of IMF Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4, in 2006 is a significant step forward. The staff supports continuation of

- 21 -

the managed-float exchange rate regime, which appears to be serving Burundi well. With
Burundi’s prospective joining of the EAC, staff encourages the authorities to work with EAC
partners to further tariff reform focused on reducing the highest rates.
51.
It will be important for the authorities to pursue discussions to reach agreement
with non-Paris Club bilateral and other creditors that have not yet provided debt relief
under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.
52.
The full PRSP is being finalized. The staff welcomes this development, as well as
the progress made on the enhanced HIPC Initiative completion point triggers. While
improvement in Burundi’s social conditions has been uneven and reforms are still at an early
stage, there has been notable progress. Nonetheless, considerable challenges to meeting the
MDGs lie ahead. The authorities, with donor support, will need to pay particular attention to
reinforcing the government’s capacity to deliver social services.
53.
Staff encourages the authorities to strengthen the statistical system, which has
several deficiencies that hinder the monitoring of economic developments.
54.
Good governance and transparency practices should be reinforced, including
through PFM reforms and the progressive withdrawal of state intervention in the
economy.
55.
With the implementation of the program, 2006 could be a pivotal year for
Burundi’s economic turnaround. It will be crucial for the authorities to maintain the pace
of administrative reform and liberalization, while pressing ahead with privatization. Donor
coordination and timely and predictable disbursement of program support is important for
macroeconomic stability and program implementation.
56.
The main risks to the program are regional insecurity, a still fragile domestic
peace, and immature democratic institutions. While there are significant risks to the
program, given the demonstrated commitment of the authorities to reform and the strength of
the program’s reform measures, staff recommends completion of the third and fourth reviews
under the PRGF; approval of the authorities’ request for waivers of two performance criteria
and modification of another; extension of the PRGF arrangement; and extension of additional
interim assistance under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. The staff supports the request for
waivers because the nonobservance was temporary and corrective action was taken promptly.
For the extension of interim assistance, satisfactory assurances from Burundi’s other
creditors are in place.
57.
The staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to make public the staff report,
the letter of intent, and the MEFP. It recommends that the next Article IV consultation
with Burundi be held on the 24-month consultation cycle in accordance with
Decision No. 12794-(02/76) of July 2002, as amended by Decision No. 12854-(02/96) of
September 12, 2002.

Table 7. Burundi: Progress Toward HIPC Completion Point Triggers
TRIGGER

PROGRESS

1. PRSP: Preparation of a full PRSP through a participatory process and its
satisfactory implementation for one year, as evidenced by an Annual Progress
Report that has been the subject of analysis in a Joint Staff Advisory Note.
2. Macroeconomic stability: Maintenance of macroeconomic stability as
evidenced by satisfactory performance under the PRGF-supported program.

A full PRSP is in the final stages of preparation.

3. Use of budget savings resulting from HIPC-related debt-service relief
during the interim period: Use of budgetary savings from debt relief in
accordance with the priorities identified at the decision point and in the PRSP
duly documented and discussed by a national Independent Oversight
Committee on a semiannual basis.
4. Public expenditure management: Establishment of an integrated public
expenditure computerized system that provides a budget monitoring and control
system, in particular for poverty-related spending, and the production of at least
two quarterly budget execution reports based on the new unified budget
nomenclature.

Budgetary allocations for priority spending
targeting pro-poor activities and projects have
increased markedly.

5. Governance measures and the delivery of services in key sectors:
Completion for the education, health, and justice sectors of (i) a budget tracking
exercise (budget monitoring) of public spending on the delivery of pro-poor
services; (ii) an evaluation by users of the quality of services provided; (iii) an
evaluation by providers of constraints to effective delivery of pro-poor services;
and (iv) preparation of an action plan to address problems identified.
6. Demobilization: Execution of the National DDR Program in line with the
pace and final objectives set forth in the Letter of Demobilization Policy to the
World Bank, dated 19 February, 2004.

A technical team will be conducting an
evaluation of services delivery by September
2006, with World Bank and Belgian technical
assistance.

7. Structural measures: Tendering for sale the state holdings in a majority of
coffee washing stations.

A study on the strategy for privatization is in
process and the launch of tenders is programmed
by end-October 2006.

Macroeconomic developments in the past two
years have been broadly in line with the
program, which has remained on track.

An integrated computerized expenditure
management system was put in place in January
2006 using the new budget nomenclature.
Quarterly budget execution reports will be
produced from mid-2006.

The demobilization program is advancing well.
Some 20,000 persons were demobilized in 2005
and another 5,000 are expected in 2006.

8. Social sectors
Education: Increase in the gross national enrollment rate in primary schools
from 74 percent in 2003/04 to 77 percent in 2006; and from 16 percent in
2003/04 to 18 percent in 2006 in secondary schools, subject to the provision
that the average increase in provinces with lower than average enrollment rates
in 2004 must be higher than the increase in the national rate over the same time
period.

The elimination of primary school fees in
September 2005 resulted in a large increase in
first grade enrollment. Primary school
enrollment rate rose from an estimated
80 percent in 2003/04 to 85 percent in 2004/05,
to close to 100 percent in 2005/06. On the rate
for lower secondary education is estimated at
17 percent in 2004/05.

Health: Increase in the national immunization rate for children of less than one
year of age from 75 percent in 2004 to 85 percent in 2006, subject to the
provision that the average increase in provinces with lower-than-average
immunization rates in 2004 must be higher than the increase in the national rate
over the same time period.
9. Debt management: Production of monthly external debt reports, including
projections for the upcoming three months, for at least six months before the
completion point.

A report by UNICEF indicates that the
vaccination rate reached 80 percent in 2005 and
would likely rise to 90 percent in 2006.

APPENDIX I

Bujumbura, June 26, 2006

Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Mr. de Rato,
1.
On behalf of the authorities of the Republic of Burundi, we hereby transmit the
attached memorandum on economic and financial policies (MEFP) that sets out the
objectives and policies under the program that the authorities intend to implement in 2006.
The attached technical memorandum of understanding (TMU) defines the terms and
conditions of the implementation of the program.
2.
Burundi continues to make progress with reforms aimed at sustaining the economic
recovery. In support of these efforts, Burundi benefits from the Fund’s advice and financial
support under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), approved by the IMF
Executive Board in January 2004.
3.
The program’s quantitative performance criteria (PCs) for end-June 2005 for the third
program review were observed, as were the indicative quantitative targets at end-September
2005 (Table 1). We request a waiver for the nonobservance of the structural PC (end-October
2005) regarding the installation of a computerized financial management information system
(IFMIS) of moderate size in the Ministry of Finance (Table 2). The IFMIS became
operational on January 1, 2006. Three structural benchmarks were not observed or were
observed with a delay. The publication of the Audit Court’s report on the 2004 government
accounts (end-September 2005) was observed with a delay on December 6, 2005 and the
audit of the inventory of the government’s domestic arrears (end-June 2005) was completed
behind schedule on February 20, 2006. The adoption of an action plan defining the new roles
of the coffee sector institutions (end-November 2005) was not observed and was re-phased.
4.
The quantitative PCs for end-December 2005 for the fourth review, to be completed
by end-June 2006, were observed except for the nonaccumulation of external arrears, which
were incurred in October and December 2005. The external arrears were cleared in March
2006. We therefore request a waiver for the nonobservance of this criterion.
5.
In support of the macroeconomic and financial objectives set for 2006, we hereby
request approval of the third and fourth reviews under the PRGF and disbursement of
SDR 14.30 million (18.6 percent of quota). We request the disbursement of additional
interim HIPC assistance in the amount of SDR 86,500, which will be sufficient to cover
50.5 percent of PRGF Trust Interest obligations falling due between July 28, 2006 and
December 31, 2006, and 57.4 percent between January 1, 2007 and July 27, 2007.

- 37 -

APPENDIX I

6.
The objectives and measures in the MEFP for 2006 remain consistent with Burundi’s
Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP—Cadre stratégique intérimaire de
croissance économique et de lutte contre la pauvreté) and the forthcoming full PRSP.
7.
The economic and financial policies set forth in the MEFP should ensure that the
objectives of the 2006 program are met. If needed, the authorities will take any further
measures that may be necessary. Burundi will consult with the Managing Director on the
adoption of these measures in advance of revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP, in
accordance with the Fund’s policies on such consultations.
8.
The quarterly quantitative PCs and indicative targets for 2006 are shown in Table 3.
We request a modification of the PC on banking system credit to government, reflecting the
programmed issuance of tradable treasury securities, which would be set on domestic
financing of the budget. The prior actions for the third and fourth reviews, as well as the
structural PC and benchmarks for 2006, are shown in Table 4. The fifth review of the threeyear PRGF arrangement with the Fund will be based on meeting the targets for end-June
2006.
9.
In order to conclude the sixth review of the program we request an extension of the
three-year PRGF arrangement by nine months until end-September 2007.
10.
The Burundi authorities are keen to make this letter, the attached MEFP, the TMU, as
well as the staff report on the 2006 third and fourth reviews under the PRGF arrangement,
available to the public. We hereby authorize their publication and posting on the Fund’s
website subsequent to Executive Board approval. We will do the same on the official
websites of the Burundi government.
11.
The authorities will provide the IMF Managing Director with all the information he
may request as necessary to monitor program implementation and achieve program
objectives on schedule.
Sincerely yours,
/s/

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

Republic of Burundi
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies for 2006
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This memorandum summarizes progress under the program during 2005 and sets out
the authorities’ economic and financial policies for 2006. On the basis of these policies, the
authorities request Fund support in the form of fourth and fifth disbursements under the
three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement. The policies and
objectives of the new program are consistent with the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (I-PRSP), as well as the full PRSP which is being finalized.
II. BACKGROUND
A. Political Transition Completed
2.
Burundi crossed a historical threshold in August 2005 with the election of a new
parliament, the investiture of a new President of the Republic, and the formation of a
government, all as a result of democratic elections. The security situation in the country has
significantly improved. The disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) of former
combatants and the armed forces was well under way in 2005, with the support of the World
Bank-led Multi-Country Demobilization and Reinsertion Program (MDRP). At end-2005, the
number of demobilized persons was some 20,000. The United Nations Operation in Burundi
(ONUB) and bilateral donors are also supporting the associated security sector reform (SSR)
involving the training and equipping of the new national police force.
B. Recent Economic Developments
3.
Macroeconomic performance in 2005 has been mixed. Real GDP growth was about
1 percent, reflecting a sharp decline in the coffee harvest compared with 2004 (7,000 as
against 38,000 metric tons). The problems in the agricultural sector resulting from the
drought in the northern part of the country (food production fell by 1 percent) were
nonetheless partly offset by a strong rebound in the secondary and tertiary sectors. Consumer
price index (CPI) inflation remained high during the first half of the year, reflecting the effect
of the drought in the north and the pressure on prices from the large presence of the
international community. Since mid-2005, the Burundi franc (FBu) has appreciated against
the U.S. dollar (10 percent) and together with a tighter monetary policy contributed to a
marked slowdown in inflation to 1 percent at end-December.
4.
Preliminary data suggest that the external current account deficit, after grants, was
larger than expected under the program, at about 10.5 percent of GDP, as a result of a drop in
coffee exports and, in particular, a strong increase in project-financed imports. In real
effective terms the Burundi franc appreciated 9.2 percent in 2005. The differential between
the parallel and the official exchange rates stabilized at about 3 percent.

- 39 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

C. Performance Under the Program
5.
Performance in 2005 was broadly in line with program targets. All end-June 2005
quantitative performance criteria, after adjustments, were observed, as were the indicative
targets for end-September (Table 1). The criteria for end-December 2005 were also observed,
except for an accumulation of external arrears to the OPEC Fund in late 2005, which have
since been cleared. Program implementation was somewhat delayed in the third quarter due
to the political transition. The installation of a computerized financial management
information system (IFMIS) of moderate size in the Ministry of Finance (structural
performance criterion for end-October 2005) was not observed (Table 2), and the IFMIS
became operational on January 1, 2006. Three structural benchmarks in 2005 were not
observed or were implemented with a delay.
6.
Fiscal performance in 2005 was satisfactory and in line with program targets.
Revenues (FBu 172.1 billion, or 20 percent of GDP) were much higher than the program
target. Current expenditures were consistent with the program, while domestically financed
project spending was considerably lower than programmed. Total spending was therefore
weaker than expected at about 36.8 percent of GDP. Domestic arrears on 2004 expenditures
were cleared and the primary deficit was limited to 1.7 percent of GDP, or about half the
program target. On a commitments basis, the overall deficit, after grants, was 6.3 percent of
GDP compared with the target of 0.2 percent of GDP, as program grants were delayed.
7.
The 2006 Budget was promulgated on December 31, 2005. The later included
revenues equivalent to 18.9 percent of GDP and overall spending of 40.8 percent of GDP,
with a primary deficit of 6.2 percent of GDP. The 2006 Budget incorporated an important
package of reforms, including:
•

the consolidation of extra budgetary funds, except for the road fund and the national
solidarity fund;

•

the budgetization of the revenues of the national solidarity fund and introduction of
ceilings on its spending;

•

provision for the regularization of civil servants’ salaries;

•

the elimination of the 7 percent transactions tax on banking transactions;

•

the deductibility of the transactions tax paid on investment goods for corporate tax
purposes;

•

the revision of the customs tariff schedule to reduce tariffs on primary products, and
raise those at 0 percent to 5 percent;

•

the elimination of the service tax on imports (6 percent);

•

the introduction of an administrative fee for customs of 0.5 percent of the c.i.f. value
of imports; and

- 40 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

•

the elimination of exemptions on indirect taxes, except for diplomats, government,
and NGOs;

•

the strengthening of efforts to apply the income tax to all local employees of
international agencies.

8.
In addition, on January 24, 2006, a new regulation on import procedures was
introduced. On February 7, a revision to the contract with SGS (the pre-import inspection
company) was signed giving it management of import declarations (DI) beginning
April 3, 2006, as well as delinking the inspection of imports from the exchange control
system. At the beginning of January 2006, the transactions tax on petroleum products, which
had been suspended in September 2005, was re-introduced. In December 2005, the
authorities created a national commission for aid coordination (CNCA) with the aim of
improving dialogue and coordination with donors, and in February 2006, a permanent
secretariat of the CNCA was created to assure effective aid management.
9.
In early 2006, the prices of beer, sugar, and soft drinks were significantly
reduced, resulting in a large net revenue loss, primarily for the national solidarity fund
(which financed the war effort) of FBu 9 billion for 2006. Strong pressures on
expenditures to address the drought and famine in the north of the country, for the
reintegration of refugees, and for the large increase in primary school pupils (following the
abolition of primary school fees in September 2005) led the authorities to hold a Partners’
Conference for Burundi on February 28, 2006. At the conference, donors made pledges of
new financing amounting to about US$70 millions. Therefore a supplementary budget for
2006 will be needed.
10.
Regarding monetary policy, the introduction of weekly liquidity auctions since
mid-April 2005, enabled the Bank of the Republic of Burundi (BRB) to partially sterilize the
impact of the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves on the growth of the money supply
(M3). Nevertheless, M3 expanded by 19.7 percent, outpacing nominal GDP growth
(17.6 percent), representing a monetization of the economy. International reserves rose by
US$46 million in 2005 to reach US$113 million (the equivalent of 3 months of 2006
imports). Credit to the economy declined by 9 percent, reflecting the political transition,
security conditions, and outstanding budget arrears. In December 2005, the BRB raised the
required reserve ratio on domestic currency deposits from 5 percent to 7 percent, and in
January 2006, the BRB introduced a required reserve ratio (7 percent) for foreign currency
deposits held by commercial banks. Since late 2005, and especially in early 2006, interest
rates fell significantly, in part as a result of the elimination of the 7 percent tax on banking
transactions. The BRB also reinforced its contract with its external auditor for the audit of the
2005 accounts, following the recommendations of the IMF’s safeguards assessment report.
The independent audit committee (of the Board of Directors) was made operational. The
liberalization of the exchange system continued with the raising, and conversion to
indicative limits, of the ceilings for invisibles in June 2005.
11.
The implementation of structural reforms advanced more slowly than expected in
2005, reflecting a lull in the third quarter as a result of the political transition. The Audit

- 41 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

Court reviewed the government’s accounts for 2004 and published its report on December 6,
2005. It also conducted specific audits of the defense and civil service ministries, as well as
more in-depth investigations into specific cases. The new bankruptcy and liquidation laws
were approved by parliament in November 2005, and were promulgated on March 15, 2006.
12.
The reform of the coffee sector continued with a call for bids for two washing
stations, but without success. Entry into the sector and commerce at all levels of the coffee
sector were liberalized in January 2005. The sector generated an operating surplus of
FBu 19 billion in the 2004/05 crop year, for the first time since 1998/99. The surplus was
used to pay a premium to coffee producers (FBu 30/kg., equivalent to FBu 6.1 billion) to
purchase phytosanitary products, distributed free to producers, fertilizers, and other inputs
(FBu 3.5 billion) for sale to producers; and to finance the 2005/06 crop (FBu 8.8 billion). The
government guarantee for bank credit to the coffee sector was abolished.
III. THE 2006 PROGRAM
A. Macroeconomic Objectives
13.
The authorities’ strategy for 2006 is based on the reduction of macroeconomic and
financial imbalances, notably inflation, and the pursuit of financial and structural reforms
needed for durable economic recovery. The economic program targets a recovery of real
economic growth of 6 percent, reflecting a rebound in coffee production, and an inflation
rate of about 3 percent (period average). The external current account deficit, after grants,
would rise to about 17.5 percent of GDP, resulting from a sharp increase in imports of
humanitarian aid.
B. Fiscal Policy
14.
Fiscal policy for 2006 envisages an increase in social and poverty-reduction
spending, improved revenue mobilization, a strengthening in public finance management,
and the clearing of the government’s domestic arrears. Fiscal policy also seeks to support the
inflation target by limiting its recourse to financing from the banking system. A revised
budget for 2006 will be promulgated before end-June to take into account important changes
that have emerged since the approval of the initial budget on December 31, 2005. Total
revenue would decline to 19 percent of GDP, owing to the abolition of the levies earmarked
to the national solidarity fund to finance the war effort, and of excise duties on sugar. The
increase in expenditure to FBu 400 billion (41.8 percent of GDP) is due mainly to the large
increase in spending on education and that linked to the emergency program for 2006, and
was in part made possible by the budgetary savings from external debt relief under the HIPC
Initiative. The revised 2006 budget contains contingent spending of 1.2 percent of GDP.
15.
Current expenditures will increase to about 26.4 percent of GDP while project
spending will rise further to 13.5 percent of GDP, financed mostly by grants, and will give
priority to the rehabilitation and reconstruction of social and economic infrastructure,
particularly for the education sector. A wage rise for government employees will be limited

- 42 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

to a 15 percent increase in base pay with effect from July 1, 2006. The share of security
outlays will be trimmed from 34.8 percent of current expenditure in 2005 to 32.0 percent in
2006. The overall deficit, on a commitment basis, after grants, is expected to decline to about
0.5 percent of GDP, partly as a result of the greater share of grants in external financial
support. Poverty-related expenditure (as defined in the I-PRSP) is set to increase
substantially from about 33.6 percent of primary expenditure in 2005 to about 35.5 percent in
2006. The supplementary budget will set new ceilings for domestic debt sufficient to allow
for the issuance of new treasury securities related to the settlement of the government’s
domestic arrears.
16.
The revised 2006 budget includes two expenditure contingencies totaling
FBu 11.5 billion (1.2 percent of GDP) dependent on specific aid disbursements and the
recovery of the assets of the failed BCD bank in liquidation. The first contingency involves
the urgent need to distribute food aid to those affected by the drought. Expenditures for
emergency food aid will be financed by reallocating resources from domestically financed
project expenditure. Domestically financed project expenditure will be raised back (up to a
maximum of FBU 10 billion) to its original level, subject to disbursement from donors of
funds to compensate for the food aid distribution. The second contingency concerns
additional spending on goods and services contingent on asset recovery from BCD.
Additional spending will be committed from the proceeds of the BCD liquidation once, and
only once, recovery for the budget reaches FBu 1 billion, up to a maximum new spending of
FBu 1.5 billion.
17.
The authorities are committed to further improving transparency and public finance
management. Building on the new system of accounts, an interim computerized financial
management system (IFMIS) for expenditures from the commitment to payment stage, with a
direct link to the central bank, was put in place in the Ministry of Finance with effect from
January 1, 2006. This system is designed to reinforce the monitoring of budget execution,
including of social outlays, and to produce real-time financial operations reports. The
authorities will reinforce the management of the civil service in 2006, with the support of the
World Bank (ERSP project), through (i) the putting in place of a central data file and a single
identification number for all government employees (teachers, civil service, army, and
police); (ii) the physical census of employees; and (iii) the issuance of personal identity cards
with photo and signature.
18.
The authorities are conscious of the importance of full pass through for domestic
petroleum products, which should reflect movements on international markets. The
authorities are convinced of the advantages of an automatic retail price adjustment
mechanism, which will be put in place by June 2006. This will also protect tax receipts.
Action plans in the areas of customs, income tax, the treasury, public accounting, and
procurement will be implemented in 2006 to improve revenue and expenditure management.
Genuine treasury securities (standardized, tradable, and managed by the BRB) will be
introduced in 2006 in support of the clearance strategy for government arrears.

19.
The DDR and SSR programs continue to be essential, not only for public security,
but also for reducing security outlays so as to boost social and poverty reduction spending. In
this respect, the government is committed to achieving the objectives defined in its Policy
Letter to the World Bank of February 2004, on Demobilization, Reinsertion and
Reintegration, and to reducing the size of the army and the national police through the DDR
program. The authorities will seek volunteers in the national police force for demobilization.
The authorities intend to conduct a census of the security forces by end-June 2006, with the
support of international technical assistance. They also intend to seek technical assistance
from the international community in 2006 to assess the appropriate size and composition of
the new police force, taking into account budget constraints and security imperatives.
20.
External debt-service relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative will allow an
increase in pro-poor budgetary spending. The additional expenditures were identified in the
2006 budget in consultation with World Bank and IMF staff and are in line with the priorities
identified in the forthcoming full PRSP. The main sectors covered are health, education,
infrastructure, agriculture, refugee and displaced person resettlement, economic reintegration
of victims of conflict, and judicial reform. The implementation of the IFMIS expenditure
management system will assure the monitoring of these expenditures.
C. Monetary and Exchange Policies
21.
Monetary policy is based on a medium-term strategy to further liberalize the
exchange regime and to effect a sustained reduction in inflation. For 2006, the BRB will
focus on slowing monetary growth by containing banking system credit to the government
and by strengthening liquidity management (introduction of reserve requirements for foreign
exchange deposits and negotiable treasury securities). The BRB will introduce and manage
on behalf of the government, a new series of standardized and negotiable treasury securities.
In parallel, a set of structural reforms will enhance the efficiency of the financial system
(reinforced banking supervision and restructuring weaker banks). These measures will make
it possible to revive credit to the private sector, which should increase by about 24 percent in
2006. Broad money (M3) growth would be reduced to about 18 percent (on the assumption
of a further monetization of the economy). Gross international reserves of the BRB would
increase further to US$145 million by end-2006, or about 3.3 months of 2007 imports.
22.
The BRB will continue to enhance the effectiveness of liquidity management. To
that end, the Ministry of Finance and the BRB have strengthened their cooperation,
particularly on budget cash flow forecasting which will be updated monthly. The BRB also
intends to strengthen its foreign reserves management, internal audit and control procedures,
and to computerize its accounting system. These efforts will be complemented with measures
to enhance transparency and improve governance. The results of the external audit of the
BRB’s accounts and all monetary and exchange policy decisions will be posted on its
website. The liberalization of the exchange regime and control systems will be continued,
with the objective of achieving full convertibility of international current transactions in
2006. The BRB recognizes the need to publicize widely these changes. The BRB will limit
its interventions in the exchange market to those necessary to achieve its foreign asset targets

- 46 -

ATTACHMENT I

and limit short-term volatility of the exchange rate. All these measures will, in time, enable
the BRB to focus on an inflation objective and gain the necessary credibility for a flexible
exchange regime.

D. Structural Reforms
23.
The authorities are committed to strengthening the implementation of the
structural reforms needed to ensure economic recovery. Key steps for 2006 include, in
particular, the launching of the privatization of state assets in the financial and coffee sectors,
and further progress in governance and transparency.
24.
The implementation of the reform strategy of the coffee sector, supported by the
World Bank and the European Union (EU), remains vital to poverty reduction in Burundi, in
particular for some 800,000 small rural producers. The authorities have put in place
governmental structures to manage the sector reforms, to minimize the financial risks to the
producers and the government during the transition, and to ensure the consistency of the
STABEX-financed washing station rehabilitation project with the privatization plan for 2006.
Rehabilitated stations will be offered for sale without delay. A strategy for the sale of the
washing stations will be established on the basis of the technical study by the World Bank,
aimed at ensuring a fully competitive market structure at all levels of the coffee sector. The
reforms will be pursued to ensure that producers may operate freely with a view to ensuring
competition at all levels of the coffee sector and to attract long-awaited investment and
private financing. In regard to the above-mentioned measures, the authorities will make sure
that the regulatory powers of OCIBU do not impede investment and that during the transition

- 47 -

to a private sector every effort will be made by OCIBU to minimize the costs and delays in
marketing. A public information campaign of the reforms will be undertaken.

December 2006

25.
The privatization program, delayed by the political transition and conditions of
insecurity, will be relaunched in 2006 with World Bank technical assistance in accordance
with a transparent procedure for public tenders. The goal is for the government to gradually
and completely phase out its involvement in the productive and financial sectors of the
economy. The government intends hereby to reinforce the role of the private sector as the
engine of economic growth.

2006

E. Transparency, Good Governance, and Statistics
27.
In an effort to enhance transparency and allow the public to better understand and
follow the economic reforms, the government and the BRB will publish decrees, laws,
decisions, as well as economic reform strategies and, in particular, the Memorandum on
Economic and Financial Policies addressed to the IMF Managing Director, on the
government, BRB, and REFES websites, which will be kept up to date. The budget and
operations of the Official Bulletin of Burundi (BOB) will be strengthened. The Audit Court
will continue to strengthen its activities in 2006. The government is convinced of the wisdom
and importance of protecting the independence of the magistrates of the Audit Court.
28.
A draft Anti-Money Laundering (AML) law has been prepared. It has benefited
from comments from IMF technical assistance to ensure consistency of the legal framework
and with international best practices. The council of ministers intends to review the text
before end-June and submit it to parliament before end-September 2006. The authorities have
requested continued TA from the IMF for the application of the AML law.
29.
The authorities are aware that the quality of national statistics has been greatly
eroded, especially as regards the national accounts, price indices, and social and poverty
indicators. The authorities are committed to improving national statistics, in particular, by

- 49 -

ATTACHMENT I

implementing a rehabilitation plan for the statistical agency ISTEEBU so as to regain the
capacity to compile national accounts interrupted since 1998, and to improve the quality of
the CPI, which is the only macroeconomic indicator still being produced by ISTEEBU.
30.
The authorities equally intend to implement the recommendations of the IMF
statistics missions and to include a multi-sector plan for developing statistics in the
PRSP. In February 2005, the authorities officially communicated their intention to
participate in the IMF’s General Data Dissemination Standards (GDDS) initiative. An IMF
Statistics mission prepared an initial set of metadata, which needs to be revised and
completed by the authorities with IMF’s technical assistance.

F. Program Financing and External Debt Management
31.
For 2006, the external nonproject financing need is estimated at US$177 million. This
external financing requirement is expected to be covered by disbursements from the IMF
under the PRGF (US$32 million); the World Bank (US$60 million) under the ERSG; AfDB
and ADF program grants and loans (US$11 million); the EU FED program (US$17 million);
bilateral donors (US$16 million); and by traditional debt relief on current maturities
(U$5 million) and under the HIPC Initiative (US$36 million).
32.
The authorities have written to non-Paris Club creditors seeking debt relief on
comparable terms to that obtained from Paris Club bilaterals. The authorities are also
conscious of the need to reinforce external debt management capacity and have requested
further technical assistance from donors.
G. PRSP Process
33.
The participatory process for the preparation of the full PRSP is almost completed.
Consultations at the local level with private and public stakeholders at the local level are
completed and were followed by sectoral consultations at the national level, launched in
November 2005. The full PRSP is expected to be finalized in mid-2006. The cost of the
priority programs identified in the full PRSP was estimated at US$535 million, for which
some financing remains to be identified.
H. Safeguards and Technical Assistance
34.
The BRB is committed to improving its operations consistent with the principles of
good governance included in the IMF’s safeguards guidelines. A safeguards assessment
was completed in January 2006. The BRB is committed to improving financial reporting
procedures and strengthening its system of internal controls. The BRB underwent its first
external audit in August 2005. The external auditors made recommendations on the adoption
of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and improvements in BRB operations,
which the BRB is actively addressing. More fundamentally, the government is committed to
supporting the revision of the BRB law to grant it independence, needed for the sound
conduct of monetary policy, while making the BRB fully accountable to Parliament.

Burundi has extensive technical assistance needs, and the authorities will continue to
work closely with multilateral and bilateral partners to rebuild administrative capacity in
priority areas. IMF technical assistance has been provided in 2005 in the areas of tax
administration, public expenditure management, monetary and exchange rate policy, banking
supervision, and national economic statistics. Further IMF technical assistance is planned in
these areas in 2006.
I. Program Monitoring
36.
Table 1 summarizes the quantitative performance criteria for the third and fourth
reviews (end-June and end-December 2005, respectively) and the actual outcomes. The
structural performance criteria and benchmarks under the program for 2005 are presented in
Table 2. Table 3 shows the quantitative performance criteria for 2006, and the quantitative
indicators for March, June, and September 2006 for program monitoring purposes. Program
monitoring has been modified to account for the introduction of tradable security instruments
and the arrears clearance exercise, notably by substitution of the PC on bank credit to
government with one on overall domestic financing. The prior actions for the third and fourth
reviews and structural performance criteria and benchmarks for 2006 are shown in Table 4.
The definitions of the program’s performance targets, external assistance adjustors, and
underlying assumptions, as well as Burundi’s reporting requirements, are described in the
attached TMU. Burundi will avoid incurring overdue financial obligations to the Fund, as
well as introducing new exchange restrictions, multiple currency practices, bilateral
payments agreements inconsistent with Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, and
import restrictions for balance of payments purposes. In addition, the authorities stand ready
to adopt any new financial or structural measures, in consultation with Fund staff, which may
become necessary to ensure program success.

The domestic arrears of the government amounted to FBu 35.7 billion as of
end-2004, of which FBu 4.2 billion was to state enterprises. This total was identified by the
Ministry of Finance and audited by an external auditor. In 2005, the budget cleared
FBu 3.8 billion of these arrears. The outstanding balance (FBu 25.7 billion) will be cleared
by end-June 2006, according to the strategy described as follows. An official decision by the
government will establish the total amount of arrears, as well as the modalities for their
settlement. All individuals and corporations holding arrears claims will receive a cash
payment of FBu 100 million upon signing a note liquidating their claim on these arrears
(total cash payment estimated at FBu 7.4 billion). For creditors with validates arrears greater
than FBu 100 million, a certificate recognizing these debs will be issued for the nominal
value of the remaining arrears (FBu 18.3 billion). These certificates will not earn interest but
will be feely exchangeable for treasury bonds of about 3–5 years maturity. These bonds will
be auctioned by the BRB, on behalf of the government treasury. These certificates can
equally be used (100 percent of their nominal value) in the privatization program, to settle
winning offers to buy. The payments arrears of public enterprises, as well as the cross-debts
of the petroleum sector, are not included in this settlement process and will be dealt with
separately.
11.
The program includes a ceiling on new nonconcessional external debts contracted
or guaranteed by the government and the BRB, which precludes the contracting of any such
debt. This performance criterion applies to the contracting or guaranteeing by the central

- 62 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

government, local governments, or the BRB of new nonconcessional external debt (as
specified below) with an original maturity of more than one year, including commitments
contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received. The term debt shall be
understood as defined in the Executive Board Decision No. 12274-(00/85) adopted
August 24, 2000. Debt rescheduling and restructuring are excluded from the criterion.
Included are financial leases and other instruments giving rise to external liabilities,
contingent or otherwise, on nonconcessional terms. In determining the level of
concessionality of these obligations, the definition of concessional borrowing shall apply.
Concessional debt is defined as having a grant element of 50 percent or more. For loans with
a maturity of at least 15 years, the 10-year average commercial interest reference rates
(CIRRs) published by the OECD should be used as the discount rate for assessing the level of
concessionality, while the 6-month average CIRRs should be used for loans with shorter
maturities. To both the 10-year and the 6-month average CIRRs, the following margins should
be added: 0.75 percent for repayment periods of less than 15 years; 1 percent for 15-19 years;
1.15 percent for 20-29 years; and 1.25 percent for 30 years or more. The performance
criterion is defined to exclude the use of Fund resources and any Burundi franc-denominated
treasury securities held by nonresidents.
12.
The stock of short-term external debt, with a maturity of up to, or equal to, one
year, owed by the government is to remain at zero under the program. Normal import credits
are excluded from this ceiling. Loans with an initial maturity, as recorded in the original loan
agreement, of more than one year are considered medium-term or long-term loans. This
performance criterion applies not only to debt, as defined in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on
Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt, adopted August 24, 2000, but also to
commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received (including
leasing). Excluded from this performance criterion are rescheduling arrangements, borrowing
from the Fund, and any Burundi franc-denominated treasury securities held by nonresidents.
As of end-December 2005, the stock of short-term debt outstanding was nil, as was
nonconcessional medium- and long-term debt contracted during the year.
13.
Receipts from privatization during 2005 totaled FBu 0.4 billion. The 2006 program
projects receipts on the order of FBu 3.6 billion, and 50 percent of receipts over and above
the projected amount will be used to reduce the domestic borrowing requirement. Any
privatization receipts over and above this amount will be used to reduce domestic debt.
14.
The government’s primary fiscal balance is defined as the difference between total
government revenue, excluding grants, on the one hand, and noninterest current government
expenditure and domestically financed capital expenditure (including through the use of
counterpart funds), on the other hand. The primary fiscal balance for 2005 amounted to
FBu -14.6 billion, and the target for 2006 is FBu -84.8 billion, broken down as follows:

government, including all allowances and bonuses. The government’s wage bill for 2005

External financial assistance adjustor
16.
The program provides for a symmetrical adjustor for shortfalls or excesses in external
financial assistance that is applied to quantitative targets for the net foreign assets and net
domestic assets of the BRB, and for net bank credit to the government.
17.
External financial assistance (measured in U.S. dollars) is defined to include the
following: (i) nonproject loans and grants to the budget (including payments made through
the multi-donor trust fund managed by the World Bank for current debt service to
multilaterals); (ii) debt relief on current maturities; minus (iii) any cash payments for external
arrears clearance operations. Disbursements into blocked accounts by donors for the purpose
of clearing arrears will not be included as foreign assistance for program monitoring
purposes. The assumptions for 2006 are shown below.

The ceiling or floor targets will be adjusted to accommodate 100 percent of any
deviation from the projected cumulative external financial assistance. In case of a financing
excess (shortfall), the floor on the stock of net foreign assets of the central bank will be
adjusted upward (downward), and the ceilings on the stock of net domestic assets of the
central bank and on the stock of net credit from the banking system to the government will be
adjusted downward (upward). External financial assistance will be converted to Burundi
francs using the program end-period FBu/US$ exchange rate.

The ceiling on net credit to the government from the banking system will also be
adjusted to reflect 100 percent of any deviation from the projected net accumulation of fiscal
arrears, as measured by the accumulation of nonexecuted payment orders older than 30 days.
In case of an increase (decline) in fiscal arrears, the ceiling on the stock of net credit from the
banking system to the government will be adjusted downward (upward).

APPENDIX II

VIII. Exchange Arrangements
Burundi maintains a managed float exchange regime. The U.S. dollar is the intervention
currency. On May 31, 2006, the exchange rate was FBu 1,030.26 to the U.S. dollar. In
mid-2000, the authorities began reversing the heavy restrictions put in place during the
1996-99 embargo period by introducing a system of weekly foreign exchange auctions. In
2002, the central bank eliminated the positive list of eligible imports, implemented a single,
competitive settlement exchange rate for each weekly auction, and reduced the full surrender
requirement for coffee, tea, and cotton exports to 70 percent. In 2003, the central bank
eliminated most remaining exchange restrictions on current international transactions and
delegated authority to the commercial banks to approve standard transactions. In early 2004,
the surrender requirement was lowered to 50 percent and eliminated in early 2005. The
central bank admitted foreign exchange bureaus to the weekly auctions. Most external
payments arrears to bilateral and multilateral creditors were cleared by end-2005.
Burundi availed itself of the transitional arrangements of Article XIV when it joined the Fund
in 1962, but no longer maintains exchange restrictions or multiple currency practices under
Article XIV. Burundi maintains two multiple currency practices inconsistent with Article
VIII, Section 3, arising from or in connection with the current Dutch auction system, and one
exchange restriction inconsistent with Article VIII, Section 2(a), resulting from the
authorization process that is applied to certain current international transactions. One
multiple currency practice results from the fact that no mechanism limits the potential
variation of winning bids from differentiating from each other by more than 2 percent. The
other multiple currency practice results from the fact that the exchange rate used for
government transactions takes place at a rate that may differ by more than 2 percent from
market exchange rates. The exchange restriction results from the central bank having
discretion to refuse to authorize the sale of foreign exchange for reasons other than in
connection with verifying the bona fide nature of the transaction. Burundi also maintains
certain restrictions for security reasons, and has notified those restrictions to the Fund
pursuant to Decision 144-(52/51). An exchange restriction was eliminated on May 30, 2006
and it is understood that the authorities will eliminate a remaining one on ex ante approval of
certain transactions and two multiple currency practices shortly. The authorities have not
requested, and staff does not propose, approval of the multiple currency practices.
IX. Article IV Consultation
Burundi is on the 24-month cycle. The 2003 Article IV consultation discussions were
conducted in Addis Ababa and Bujumbura during the period October 14-29, 2003. The staff
report (Country Report No. 04/41) was discussed by the Executive Board on January 23,
2004, along with the consideration of the request for three-year arrangement under the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). On that occasion, Executive Directors
welcomed the progress made in advancing the peace process since the Arusha Agreement in

- 69 -

2000 and commended the authorities for the strong implementation of their post-conflict
economic program in 2003. They noted that Burundi still faced formidable challenges,
particularly with regard to reducing the heavy external debt burden, absorbing a large number
of refugees and internally displaced persons, and demobilizing combatants. They emphasized
the critical importance of coffee sector reform.

APPENDIX IV

Burundi: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of May 8, 2006)
A. Partnership in Burundi’s Development Strategy
1.
Burundi has emerged from a cycle of politico-ethnic conflicts in August 2000 with
the signature by most of the parties involved in the conflict of the Arusha peace agreement.
The political transition as disposed in the Arusha agreement has now been peacefully
completed. A post-transition constitution has been overwhelmingly approved by a national
referendum in February 2005. Communal and parliamentary elections were held in June and
July. The President was elected by the Parliament on August 19. The post-transition
Government took office on September 1, 2005.
2.
As Burundi recovers from its long conflict, the post-transition government is
implementing the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) that was completed in
November 2003 based on broad consultations, except for some provinces where the
consultations were limited due to security reasons. The interim PRSP was discussed by the
Boards of the World Bank and the IMF in January 2004. The formulation of the full PRSP
was launched in May 2004 under the leadership of the Head of State. With the support of the
Bank and other donors, the full PRSP is expected to be completed by mid-2006. The
preparation of the full PRSP is well advanced with broad and inclusive consultations being
completed. Community participatory and inclusive consultations have been completed and
provincial reports are available, as well as the synthesis of the overall consultations. Sectoral
and thematic consultations were completed in November 2005. A first draft of the PRSP is
being finalized and will be discussed with all stakeholders at national, provincial, and
communal levels in order to take into account their comments and recommendations. The full
PRSP would be approved by the government during the second quarter of 2006.
3.
Based on sound macroeconomic policies and progress in reforming the economy,
external financial aid has resumed and culminated with Burundi being granted access to debt
relief under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Country Initiative (HIPC Initiative) in
August 2005, which will reduce debt by over 90 percent in NPV terms, and scheduled debt
service by some US$30-40 million per year for the next thirty years. An Interim Strategy
Note (ISN) prepared on the basis of the I-PRSP for FY 2006-07 Bank support to Burundi was
approved by the Bank Board on May 3, 2005. The government is intensively using the
full-PRSP preparation process to improve coordination of development efforts in the country,
including donor-supported activities. Although public expenditures are unevenly aligned with
poverty reduction priorities, but there are ongoing efforts to improve alignment. The 2006
budget is specifically linked to the priorities identified in the context of the PRSP under
preparation and recent progress in developing sector development policies, in particular in
health and education. Moreover, pro-poor expenditures have been identified and increased
from 33.6 percent of total primary expenditure in 2005 to 35.5 percent in 2006 revised
budget law soon to be approved by the Parliament. Also, the military wage bill-to-GDP ratio
has been reduced from about 3.5 percent in 2002 (a peak) to about 2.8 percent in 2005 and
2.3 percent in 2006 revised budget law while the civilian wage bill was increased from
3.5 percent in 2000 to 6.0 percent in 2006 budget law.

- 72 -

APPENDIX II

4.
The Fund is supporting this strategy through a PRGF, and IDA through a series of
fast-disbursing and investment operations specifically on budget execution transparency and
accountability, post-conflict rehabilitation and reintegration, education, health and social
policy reforms, privatization, the environment for employment creation (particularly in rural
areas), and sustainable infrastructure. In practice, there is a close collaboration in many areas,
particularly those related to growth and poverty reduction.
B. IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
5.
Common objectives and the development of post-conflict instruments have led to
increased collaboration between the Fund and the World Bank in recent years. The Bank and
Fund teams have been closely coordinating their assistance strategies and policy advice and
assistance to the government’s implementation of the I-PRSP. There is also close
coordination and good cooperation in the determination of structural conditionalities, in
particular with regard to crucial reforms for the coffee sector. The Bank is leading the policy
dialogue on key structural aspects of the reform program. The Fund is leading the policy
dialogue on macroeconomic and financial issues, in particular fiscal, monetary and exchange
regime policies. Both institutions are providing significant technical assistance in their
respective areas. The Fund and the Bank have both contributed to the Diagnostic Study for
the Integrated Trade Framework—a review of the policy, regulatory and institutional
framework—with the objective of promoting employment-generating trade. Collaboration in
2005 has been intensified in the context of the preparation of Burundi's full PRSP and the
HIPC Decision Point Document jointly prepared by the Bank and Fund staff.
C. World Bank Group Strategy
6.
The Bank’s current FY 2006-07 Interim Strategy Note (ISN) underscores I-PRSP
challenges and provides support through two core strategic elements which are: (a) improved
security, social stability, and service delivery; and (b) debt relief, economic growth, and
diversification. Governance and institutional strengthening are cross-cutting issues that need
to be addressed throughout the whole program in order to sustain progress. Preliminary
estimates put the funding needs of the ISN at US$170 million for the two years in grant form.
Additional financing (in the amount of US$30.6 million equivalent) to the ongoing Public
Works and Employment Creation project has been already approved on January 5, 2005. The
other planned operations are also expected to be implemented throughout the country, with a
focus on ensuring a distribution of benefits across all provinces. These include: in FY06 (i) a
Post Conflict Transitional Economic Rehabilitation Grant; and in FY07 (ii) an Education
Sector project; and (iii) Community Rehabilitation project. For the following years
(FY08-09), a Multi-Sector Infrastructure Rehabilitation, a new Health, an Economic
Rehabilitation Grant, and possibly a Private Sector Development projects could be foreseen.
It is expected that progress will be made during this period toward the preparation of a full
PRSP, which will provide the basis for preparation of a Country Assistance Strategy.
7.
As a key element in support of the consolidation of the peace process, the government
has established a national Demobilization, Reinsertion, and Reintegration Program (DRRP)
within the framework of the Multi-Country Demobilization and Reintegration Program
(MDRP) for the greater Great Lakes region to support the demobilization and reintegration of

- 73 -

APPENDIX II

ex-combatants in Burundi. The DRRP is supported with an IDA grant (US$33 million) and
two grants from the Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) of the MDRP (US$45.5 million). The
demobilization program is proceeding satisfactorily, with 19,739 ex-combatants demobilized
to date. All child soldiers have been demobilized. In addition, 10,988 of an estimated 29,427
former militia fighters have been disarmed and received severance payments. The process of
disarming and dismantling the militia is proceeding satisfactorily after initial difficulties.
Further demobilization activities will help to reduce the size of the National Defense Force in
2006 as per the commitments specified in government’s letter of demobilization policy to
limit the size of the integrated armed forces to 25,000 by 2007. The provision of reintegration
assistance to demobilized ex-combatants has been proceeding too slowly to date. Efforts are
under way to scale up and accelerate the provision of this support.
8.
An Economic Rehabilitation Credit (ERC), amounting to US$54 million, of which
US$20 million was disbursed during 2002 and US$20 million in April 2003, and a final
floating tranche released in January 2005, was intended to support economic recovery
through balance of payment support; and the counterpart funds generated from ERC foreign
exchange auctions by the Central Bank (BRB) used to finance the government’s specific
development programs. This project was closed in end-December 2005. The Bank also
manages a trust fund for arrears clearance and debt service to multilateral development banks
(particularly the African Development Bank (AfDB)). Besides the strong partnership with the
Fund, the Bank is collaborating with a number of donors, including with the European
Union. A new Economic Reform Support Grant (ERSG) is currently under preparation and
expected to be discussed by the Board early in the third quarter of 2006. The proposed grant
aims at supporting the Government in implementing its interim PRSP in four areas:
(i) improving public expenditure management and their impact on the poor; (ii) reforming
cash crop sectors (coffee, tea, and cotton); (iii) reviving the private sector; and (iv) reforming
public enterprises through State divestiture and private/public partnerships.
9.
Burundi has a relatively large but young active portfolio, ranging from infrastructure
through public sector management to social sectors. The current IDA portfolio consists of
ten projects (see table below) for a total commitment of US$329 million and an undisbursed
amount of about US$161.22 million, reflecting the Bank’s re-engagement in Burundi after
almost a decade of civil strife.
Nonlending activities
8.
Bank assistance also emphasizes nonlending activities and advisory services,
including those under ongoing operations, plus through trust funds and grants, to improve
understanding of the socioeconomic context, rebuild the knowledge base to support the
policy dialogue, and design effective poverty reduction strategies. Ongoing advisory services
and economic and sector work include: strengthening public expenditure management;
providing support to the PRSP process, specifically the consultation and participatory
diagnostic processes; and a study on sources of growth; a post-conflict social sector and
poverty assessment, and a debt sustainability analysis.

Burundi is a member of IFC since 1975. In the recent past years, IFC holds a
US$1 million equity portion in Verreries du Burundi (glass), which is not sellable owing to
the poor performance of this public enterprise. IFC have also been requested to provide to the
Burundi private sector a term loan of U.S. dollars 741,000 for two projects in agriculture and
fisheries (AEF Florex and AEF V & F Export). With the peaceful end of the transition,
prospects for IFC involvement in Burundi are improving. An IFC mission was conducted in
January 2005 to discuss two areas of possible IFC intervention: (i) support to the country’s
privatization program; and (ii) potential investment in Burundi largest commercial Bank
(Banque de Crédit de Bujumbura, BCB).
MIGA

Burundi became a member of MIGA in March 1998. Currently, there are no active
projects in MIGA’s pipeline for Burundi. However, one contract with Mauritius Telecom for
US$0.9 million was signed in the third quarter of FY03. MIGA’s outstanding portfolio
consists of one contract of guarantee in the infrastructure sector, with a gross exposure of
US$0.9 million, and a net exposure of US$0.8 million. The total estimated amount of foreign
direct investment facilitated to-date by MIGA is approximate

APPENDIX IV

Burundi: Relations with the African Development Bank Group
(As of April 30, 2006)
Burundi has been a member of the AfDB Group since its foundation in 1964. The AfDB’s
grant and loan operations with the country were interrupted by the outbreak of civil strife in
1993. On July 19, 2004, the AfDB Boards approved general policy guidelines to assist postconflict countries to clear their arrears and created a facility, the PCCF, initially funded with
about SDR 100 million in AfDB funds, to provide financial assistance to qualifying
post-conflict countries. The policy guidelines call for a three-way burden-sharing formula
among the country, donors, and the PCCF. On October 27, 2004, the AfDB Boards endorsed
a specific arrears clearance proposal for Burundi whereby the balance of arrears was settled
with the help of donors and the PCCF before the Decision Point under the enhanced HIPC
Initiative.
On November 24, 2005, the Boards of Directors of the African Development Bank (ADB)
and the African Development Fund (ADF) agreed that Burundi had effectively met the
conditions and reached the decision point under the enhanced framework of the Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. The Bank Group’s share of debt relief will
amount to US$149.35 million in present value terms (US$226.01 million in nominal terms),
which is equivalent to about 21 percent of the multilateral creditors’ assistance, and about
18 percent of total assistance from all creditors. This amount will save up to 90 percent of
Burundi’s debt-service obligations annually until February 2043.
The AfDB staff is prepared to resume lending operations (under its FAD 9 allocation)
following the lifting of sanctions in October 2004. On July 7, 2004, the Bank Group
approved a grant of SDR 2.13 million to finance training of civil servants and procurement of
equipment for institutions in charge of economic management and the civil society. A
structural adjustment credit totally SDR 6.72 million, in one tranche, accompanied by a
further grant of SDR 1.5 million for institutional support, was approved by the Board on
December 2004. A multi-sector project, totaling SDR 9.8 million, was also approved on
December 2004. Under its FAD 10 allocation, the Bank Group approved in December 2005 a
grant of SDR 12 millions to finance rural water infrastructure rehabilitation and, in March
2006, a SDR 9 million to finance the watershed management project. One more grant is
under preparation: SDR 7.3 million to finance economic reforms and governance support
program.

APPENDIX V

Burundi: Statistical Issues
While data provision to the Fund is now broadly adequate for surveillance purposes,
shortcomings in the national accounts, government finance, and balance of payments
statistics hinder the monitoring of economic developments. A multisector STA mission in
November-December 2004 found that staffing shortages, insufficient funding, and lack of
equipment hamper the production and dissemination of macroeconomic statistics. The
mission also noted poor coordination among institutions responsible for the compilation of
statistics.
In February 2005, the authorities indicated their interest in participating in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS). In March 2006, a STA mission assisted the authorities in
preparing metadata and, in collaboration with the World Bank and donors, helped develop a
comprehensive medium-term statistical development action plan. The authorities will refer to
the action plan in their Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper and, once finalized, will post it on
national websites. Burundi is expected to become a GDDS participant in July 2006.
Outstanding statistical issues
Real sector
Serious deficiencies in real sector data handicap analysis and macroeconomic management,
with national accounts last compiled for 1998. Source data on agriculture, the most important
activity, is extremely weak. Since 1998, Burundi has reported annual national accounts
estimates to the Fund with about a three-month lag, but these are derived from a
macroeconomic projection model maintained by the Ministry of Finance. The consumer
prices index (CPI) is compiled on a monthly basis, with coverage limited to the capital city;
weights are based on an outdated 1991 household expenditure survey. There are no producer
price indices, and data on employment are out of date.
Government finance
Government finance statistics are compiled by the Banque de la République du Burundi
(BRB) using source data from the Ministry of Finance. Computerized ledgers are seldom
maintained by ministries, preventing establishment of balances and other accounting
controls. Limited accounting information is available on extra-budgetary units. The absence
of detailed information on revenue and expenditure reduces the transparency of government
accounts. There are also problems in recording arrears on external debt and current
expenditure financed by foreign grants, leading to significant discrepancies between the
balance of revenue and expenditure and financing estimates. An interim public financial
management system was implemented in 2005 and the Ministry of Finance intends to
produce the government accounts based on the new system. Government finance statistics
transactions data up to the fourth quarter of 2004 have been reported in the International

APPENDIX V

Finance Statistics, with government debt figures reported to the second quarter of 2005.
No data have been reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook
since 1999.
Monetary accounts
The institutional coverage of monetary statistics is deficient in several respects: data on credit
and savings cooperatives are not collected; the sectoral classification of public entities and
financial corporations in the BRB’s accounts does not reflect the current methodology for
monetary statistics; and other depository corporations report their monthly balance sheets
using outdated formats. Partly as a result of insufficient computer equipment and staff
constraints at BRB, only a few of the principal recommendations of previous technical
assistance missions have been fully implemented. However, the BRB is well advanced in the
process of submitting monetary statistics using the new Standardized Report Forms (SRFs).
The recent second provisional submissions of SRFs covering 15 months of monetary
statistics (January 2005 through March 2006) signal the BRB’s commitment to adopt the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual methodology.
Balance of payments
Annual balance of payments and international investment position statistics are compiled
according to the fourth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM4) on the basis of
limited information. Merchandise trade statistics are derived from customs data, but no
adjustments are made for unrecorded international trade flows such as gifts in kind that do
not go through the banking system. Another issue is the appropriate treatment for exports of
nonmonetary gold recorded in customs statistics since the gold is neither produced locally,
nor recorded in imports. Data for services are collected mostly through bank settlement
reports, and appear to be insufficient. Income estimates are almost exclusively derived from
monthly bank settlement reports. For both services and income, the accuracy of the source
data is not routinely assessed against other available data sources.
A December 2005 mission assisted the BRB in (1) improving information collected through
bank reports, and (2) preparing and launching surveys for capturing and/or improving data on
services, income, current and capital transfers, enterprise investment and external debt. It also
assisted the BRB in converting the published data of Burundi’s 2004 balance of payments
into a detailed and documented BPM5 presentation. It is now expected that the BRB will
soon begin compiling balance of payments statistics according to the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual.

APPENDIX VI

Burundi: Debt Sustainability Analysis for Low-Income Countries Framework
(LIC DSA)
1.
This LIC DSA assesses the external and public debt dynamics of Burundi using
the forward-looking framework for debt sustainability for low-income countries.1
Burundi remains at high risk of debt distress, even after the full delivery of debt relief under
the HIPC Initiative. Assuming additional debt relief under MDRI, the risk of debt distress
would ease, but still remain elevated. The LIC DSA updates the analysis presented in the
HIPC decision point document for Burundi of July 2005.2 Three key differences underpin the
results of this analysis from the previous: (i) the baseline scenario assumes a substantial
scaling up of aid inflows, and larger current account deficits and primary fiscal deficits, to be
financed mainly with additional grants and concessional loans in the medium term; (ii) real
growth would average 6.5 percent in the medium term and 6 percent in the long term, about
1 percent higher than in the decision point baseline, reflecting the combination of higher
external financial assistance and investment, and a strong sustained reform effort; (iii) the
HIPC completion point is expected to be reached in mid-2007, one year later than the
assumption at the decision point.
Baseline scenario
2.
The baseline scenario reflects continued growth of real GDP sustained by an
increase in export volumes, and financing in the form of grants or highly concessional
borrowing (Box 1). The medium-term outlook envisages strong economic growth at
6.5 percent per annum. Growth would be sustained by the consolidation of the peace process,
macroeconomic stability, a deepening of structural reforms in the banking sector, public
investment in infrastructure, reforms in agricultural export sectors, and strong growth of
nontraditional exports. Public investment would average 10.7 percent of GDP in 2006-16,
financed through the fiscal space created by aid (grants and concessional loans) inflows,
HIPC debt relief and continued strong tax revenue performance. Exports, underpinned by
new investment and sustained reforms, are projected to drive growth over the long term
assuming significant development of nontraditional sectors. The baseline assumes that prices

of the main exports would remain in line with recent market developments and coffee prices
would fetch a premium beginning in 2008. Privatization would further enhance productivity
and increase production and quality in the coffee and tea sectors. Reforms in the banking
sector and limited domestic public borrowing would increase the availability of credit to the
private sector, sustaining private investment.
Box 1. Main Assumptions in the Debt Sustainability Analysis
Real GDP growth averages 6.0 percent over 2006–26, underpinned by a peacetime broad-based
recovery in agricultural production and other private sector activities.
CPI inflation (end-period) is projected to rise from 1.1 percent in 2005 to 8.7 percent in 2006,
and subsequently to stabilize at 4 percent from 2007 and remain at that level through 2026.
Fiscal policy aims at restructuring the government’s spending priorities while maintaining
macroeconomic stability. Revenues, excluding grants, are assumed to rise gradually from
20 percent of GDP in 2005 to 21.6 percent of GDP by 2026.
Gross official external financing (grants plus loan disbursements) is expected to decline from
25.2 percent of GDP in 2006 to 16.8 percent in 2007 and then gradually decline over the period
2008-26 to 1.0 percent of GDP in 2026.
Official financing: program financing would be only grants in 2007-15 (excluding the IMF),
50 percent grants and 50 percent loans on IDA or comparable terms during 2016–26. Project
loans are assumed to be entirely at concessional rates on IDA or comparable terms. The financing
gap would be only partially covered by MDRI assistance.
Export receipts are expected to increase sharply in 2006-07 and then to rise more gradually at
10-12 percent per annum in 2008-26, with coffee quality gradually improving, reflecting the
impact of the sector’s reform, and the re-emergence of a premium over world prices after 2008.
The composition of exports would gradually shift from coffee and tea to other agricultural
products, processed foods, and light manufactures. In volume terms, export growth would average
11.5 percent a year over the projection period. Exports of goods and services would rise from
11.9 percent of GDP in 2006 to 20.8 percent in 2026.
Imports of goods and services are projected to average 50 percent of GDP in 2006–07 and with
emergency assistance and reconstruction-related imports winding down to decline to 34 percent of
GDP in 2026. In volume terms, imports would rise on average by 5.5 percent a year from 2008
onward, following the 2006-07 period of consolidation.

3.
External concessional inflows would finance increased public investment and
sustain current account and primary fiscal deficits. Gross external financing would
average 12 percent of GDP per annum (about US$175 million) over 2006-16, compared with
13 percent (US$175 million) assumed in the 2005 LIC DSA, with grant financing making up
about 90 percent of total external financing. In 2016-26, total external financing would
decrease to 3 percent of GDP per annum on average, with the grant share at about 80 percent
of the total. Gross investment and national savings would gradually rise to about 22 and
10 percent of GDP, respectively, by 2026. The current account deficit is projected to widen
initially and average 15 percent of GDP in 2006–16, and then decline to 12 percent in 2026.
The overall fiscal balance is projected to remain close to zero throughout the period.

4.
Unless otherwise indicated, all debt ratios in this DSA assume that Burundi will reach
the enhanced HIPC completion point in mid-2007, and would then be eligible for relief under
the MDRI.
External debt sustainability assessment
5.
The results under the baseline scenario indicate that, even after full delivery of
HIPC assistance, Burundi faces a considerable risk of debt distress. The NPV of debt-toexports ratio remains above the indicative threshold for countries with comparable policies
and institutions for a considerable period of time, before falling below it in 2013 (Box 2) and
decreasing further to 76 percent by 2026. Even though all other external debt burden
indicators are below their respective thresholds during the projection period, the NPV of
debt-to-exports ratio indicates that even after HIPC relief, and assuming future financing on
highly concessional terms, debt distress would remain a concern in the long term.

bottom quintile of countries ranked by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment Index
(CPIA).

6.
At end-2005, Burundi’s stock of public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external
debt was US$1,427 million, US$43 million higher than at end-2004. New borrowing
includes disbursements under the PRGF arrangement and on already approved credits from
IDA and the African Development Fund. Simulating the full delivery of HIPC assistance
immediately, the debt would amount to US$101 million at end-2005 in NPV terms,
corresponding to 12.6 percent of GDP and 110.9 percent of exports. Reflecting debt relief
and strong export performance in 2005, debt burden indicators for 2005 have substantially
improved with respect to projected ratios in the 2005 LIC DSA. The ratio of debt service to
exports in 2005 was 47.1 percent (Table 1 and Figure 1), reflecting interim relief provided by
creditors in 2005. Debt sustainability indicators are projected to worsen considerably in 2006

because of expected new borrowing of US$72 million (US$43 million in NPV terms),3 but to
trend down steadily after 2006 until 2010, after which they remain broadly stable. The

The NPV of debt-to-exports indicator remains above the indicative threshold until
2013, and then hovers around the indicative threshold. The NPV of debt-to-exports
declines from 139.3 percent at end-2006 to 93.7 percent in 2026.
The external debt-service indicator suggests a more modest and manageable debt
burden both in the short and medium term. Public external debt service is projected
to average about 5.1 percent of exports during 2006-26; the projected trajectory
shows an initial decline and then an increase during the years of the repayment of
disbursements under the PRGF arrangement. Generally, the relatively low debtservice-to-exports indicator reflects: (i) a stable and relatively high grant element in
the debt stock resulting in a relatively low debt service requirement, and (ii) the
cumulative effect of high export growth during the period when debt service
requirements increase as a result of the end of grace periods. The external
debt-service-to-fiscal-revenues ratio (including grants) follows a broadly similar
trajectory and is well below the indicative threshold.

The new borrowing includes disbursements under the PRGF arrangement and World Bank credits that were
initially expected to be disbursed in 2005, but were delayed on account of the political transition.

- 83 -

APPENDIX VI

The ratio of the NPV of debt to GDP is projected to decline to 13.4 percent in 2014,
before rising to about 20 percent in 2026. The indicators remain consistently below
the country specific threshold.

7.
Alternative scenarios indicate that less concessional borrowing substantially
increases the risk of debt distress.4 An alternative scenario shows the effect on debt
indicators of borrowing at 2 percent higher interest rates during the projection period.
Borrowing at less concessional terms would considerably increase the risk of debt distress for
Burundi, with the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratios reaching 30 percent by 2026, compared to
19 percent in the baseline, and the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio remaining above the
policy-dependent threshold (Table 2 and Figure 1). This scenario highlights the risk of
borrowing at less concessional terms after the reduction of the external debt burden as a
result of debt relief and the availability of grant financing by IDA and other donors. This
would suggest that Burundi should avoid nonconcessional borrowing after HIPC relief. It
also points to the need for creditors to align their lending with the borrower’s debt
sustainability situation.5
8.
Stress tests signal the vulnerability of Burundi to adverse developments.
Burundi’s debt sustainability indicators experience a considerable deterioration under stress
tests assuming lower GDP and export growth (Table 2). For the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio,
there is a sizeable increase relative to the baseline when all the main parameters determining
the debt dynamics are assumed to be one-half standard deviation below their respective
historical averages during the period 2006-07 (the most extreme test in Figure 1, Panel 1).
Significant increases in the NPV of external debt-to-exports and debt service-to-exports
ratios are observed when exports are assumed to grow at the historical average minus one
standard deviation. In particular, under this stress test (the most extreme test in Figure 1,
Panels 2 and 3), the debt-service-to-exports ratio rises above the threshold during 2011–15,
before declining slightly below the threshold, signifying a considerable risk to external
liquidity in the event of sustained overall macroeconomic underperformance.
Fiscal sustainability analysis
9.
The baseline macroeconomic scenario (Table 3 and Figure 2) assumes a strong
revenue performance and financing of the reconstruction effort and poverty reduction
4

The historical scenario, which assumes key variables at their historical average from 2000 (signing of the
Arusha Peace Accord) to 2005, shows debt dynamics that would substantially improve Burundi’s net external
position. This is a somewhat mechanical result stemming from the scenario’s standard assumption of a reduced
current account deficit with respect to the baseline, while maintaining the same level of grant financing as in the
baseline.

APPENDIX VI

in the medium to long term primarily with grants. This would allow the public sector
borrowing requirement to fall over time, while keeping expenditures consistent both with the
government’s poverty reduction strategy and with macroeconomic stability. In particular, it is
assumed that revenues as a percentage of GDP rise from 20 percent in 2005 to 22 percent in
2026 and that borrowing decreases from 7.5 percent of GDP in 2006 to 3.4 percent of GDP
on average between 2007 and 2026.
10.
Given the relatively strong revenue effort, public debt (external and domestic)
burden indicators are projected to remain below their respective indicative thresholds.6
The NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio is projected to drop from 90 percent in 2006 to 72 percent
in 2026, and the debt service-to-revenue ratio is projected to decline from 8 percent in 2006
to 6 percent in 2026.
11.
As in the external debt sustainability analysis, alternative scenarios and bound
tests signal a significant increase in Burundi’s risk of debt distress over the medium
term. A lower growth scenario that assumes long-term growth at 5.5 percent,
one-half percentage point less than the baseline, indicates that the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio
would exceed the policy-dependent threshold. The scenario highlights the risk of failing to
achieve sustained long-term growth. In effect, unless the ambitious scaling-up of investment
expenditure translates into the projected rate of GDP growth, the investment would not be
affordable or possibly even sustainable given the high level of grant financing assumed in the
baseline.
12.
Other stress tests highlight the negative impact of temporary shocks on debt
burden indicators. In particular, a 30 percent real depreciation represents the most extreme
stress test. A one-off increase of debt-creating flows by 10 percent of GDP, and a recession
with GDP growth equal to the historical average minus one standard deviation in 2007–08
also signal increased risk of debt distress over the medium term.
Impact of the full delivery of debt relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
(MDRI)
13.
Burundi would be eligible for debt relief under MDRI from the IMF, IDA, and
the AfDF after reaching the completion point.7 With the HIPC completion point expected
in June 2007, debt relief under HIPC and MDRI would amount to a stock of debt reduction
of US$921 million, with debt relief under the HIPC Initiative amounting to US$848 million
6

In the LIC DSA methodology, the ratio of debt service to revenue is calculated with revenue including
budgetary grants. Under the HIPC DSA framework, grants are excluded.

and debt relief under MDRI estimated at US$73 million.8 Under the HIPC Initiative, Burundi
was assessed to be eligible for debt relief equivalent to 91.5 percent of the NPV of debt
outstanding at end-2004. The additional effect of MDRI is therefore estimated to be modest,
and would represent an average debt service saving of US$2.5 million dollars in 2007-23 or
about one percent of exports. 9 A one-year delay in reaching the completion point would
imply losing US$2.7 million in additional multilateral debt service relief, beyond HIPC.

This alternative baseline assumes that MDRI debt relief from the IMF would be provided at the completion
point date in June 2007; debt relief from IDA is implemented starting in July 2007 through the forgiveness of
the debt service payments on the debt outstanding and disbursed (DOD) as of end-December 2003. As for the
African Development Fund, it is assumed that debt service payments on the DOD as of end-December 2004
would be cancelled from January 1, 2008.

This estimate and text table 1, underestimate the combined debt relief of MDRI and HIPC assistance from the
IMF and hence the reduction of debt distress. The estimate of debt relief from the IMF is the amount related to
the elimination of the stock of debt owed to the IMF at end-2004. Under the provisions of the IMF’s Instrument
to Establish the MDRI Trust (Decision No. 13588-(05/99) for a member that has both pre- and post-MDRI
cutoff-date debt to the IMF that is to be covered by HIPC assistance, HIPC debt relief disbursed by the IMF at
the completion point would be allocated in proportion to the ratio between pre- and post-cutoff-date debt. As a
result, relief on end-2004 debt owed to the IMF would be disbursed by the IMF in about equal amounts from
MDRI and HIPC assistance (US$40 million in total). The remaining amount of HIPC assistance to be disbursed
by the IMF would be about US$11 million.

donors maintained total future borrowing as in the baseline, MDRI would lower the debt
burden indicators modestly (Text Table 2). The ratio of the NPV of external debt to exports
would be 30 percentage points lower than in the baseline, and would fall below the policydependent threshold in 2010, only three years earlier than in the baseline, as well as remain
below thereafter. If lower financing from IDA and the AfDF were not compensated by
additional resources from other donors, the debt burden indicators would decrease further.

Conclusion
15.
Burundi’s NPV of external debt-to-exports ratio after enhanced HIPC assistance
is projected to remain above its indicative threshold over the period 2005-13. In
addition, the DSA indicates that adverse shocks would significantly affect the debt
sustainability indicators. For these reasons Burundi is viewed as being at high risk of debt
distress. The fiscal sustainability indicators for total (domestic and external) debt suggest a
more robust position, reflecting a strong domestic revenue effort. However, as reflected in
the external debt indicators, the foreign exchange constraint could be binding. Indeed, the
external debt sustainability indicators suggest that particular attention be given to exports as
the driver of overall growth.
16.
The DSA indicates that in order for Burundi to lower its high debt stock ratios with
respect to exports and to maintain the other debt indicators below their respective thresholds,
particular emphasis needs to be placed on four aspects of future economic performance. First,
the authorities will need to implement a strong and sustained reform effort, especially to
develop a diversified export base, to support robust growth in exports and GDP. Second, the
authorities need to implement prudent fiscal and monetary policies to ensure fiscal discipline
and macroeconomic stability. Third, together with prudent debt management, future
financing needs to be in the form of grants and highly concessional loans, except in limited
justifiable cases in outer years. Fourth, attention should be given to strengthening policies
and institutions, which would raise the indicative debt thresholds for the risk of debt distress.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assum
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
July 14, 2006

The following information has become available since the issuance of the staff report for the
2006 Article IV consultation, the third and fourth reviews under the three-year arrangement
under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, request for waiver of performance criteria,
modification of a performance criterion, extension of arrangement, and additional interim
assistance under the Enhanced Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries. The thrust of
the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
1.
Program performance. The program remained on track through end-March 2006
and preliminary information suggests that the end-March outcome was consistent with the
projected targets. No information is yet available on the end-June 2006 outcome.
2.
Inflation. Annual inflation fluctuated around zero in the first four months of 2006.
However, the rate rose to about 5 percent at end-May 2006, on account of a sharp rise in
administered petroleum product prices in May.
3.
Coffee sector. A good crop is currently being harvested. For the first time in many
years coffee marketing is being financed by private entrepreneurs and commercial banks
(without state guarantee).
4.
The budget. The revised 2006 budget, consistent with the program, has been
approved by Parliament and was signed into law on July 7, 2006.
5.

Foreign exchange regime
One of two remaining multiple currency practices (MCPs) has been eliminated.

The adoption and publication of a single exchange system regulation (structural
benchmark for end-June 2006) is delayed, although work is at an advanced stage, with Fund
technical assistance support, and a final draft regulation is expected shortly.
6.
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). A final draft of the complete PRSP has
been produced and includes a development plan to rehabilitate the national statistical base
(structural benchmark for end-June 2006). The PRSP will be presented for approval to the
Council of Ministers.
7.
Statistics. A new institutional framework and employee code for the national
statistical institute (ISTEEBU; structural benchmark for end-June 2006) was approved by the
Council of Ministers on June 1, 2006 and will be submitted to Parliament shortly.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation
with Burundi
On July 14, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Burundi.1
Background
Burundi is emerging from an extended period of civil conflict following the 1993 coup d’état
against its first elected government. The Arusha Accord of August 2000 initiated a peace
process, which was successfully concluded with the installation of a democratically elected
government in August 2005. Socio-economic conditions have deteriorated significantly since
civil conflict erupted: income per capita dropped by one-half (to about US$100) and
the percentage of people living below the poverty line has doubled. The present environment
provides a window of opportunity to secure macroeconomic stability and to relaunch structural
reforms to set the basis for a durable recovery. The new government has intensified efforts to
resolve the conflict with the remaining rebel group and has placed a strong emphasis on good
governance and improved social services.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
Macroeconomic developments in 2005 were broadly in line with the PRGF-supported program,
albeit with lower growth of about 1 percent, largely on account of a poor coffee harvest and
worsening drought in the north. Inflation fell markedly in the second half of 2005 to about
1 percent (end-period) at year-end, reflecting the tightening of monetary policy and the
appreciation of the nominal exchange rate. Fiscal performance was strong: the primary deficit
was reduced to about half the program target. While the monetary aggregates continued to be
well above program target, their growth eased somewhat in the second half of 2005.
The external current account deficit (including grants) deteriorated, owing to lower coffee
exports and higher imports.
The program remained on track in 2005, although structural reform, especially on privatization
and the coffee sector, lagged in the second half of 2005, reflecting the political transition.
All the quantitative performance criteria (PC) at end-June and end-December 2005 were
observed except for a temporary accumulation of external arrears in late 2005. The structural
performance criterion on the installation of an integrated computerized financial management
information system in the Ministry of Finance was missed, as were three structural
benchmarks, but the measures subject to the PC and two benchmarks were implemented at
end-2005/early 2006.
The Article IV consultation discussions focused on the key lessons from the period of extended
social conflict and the accumulated economic effects of stalled structural reforms, and the
medium-term challenges, including the efforts needed to progress on the Millennium
Development Goals. The key challenges ahead are to launch the economy on a higher growth
path, raise spending on social sectors and infrastructure, and reinforce public financial
management necessary for macroeconomic stabilization. The successful conclusion of the
political transition, improving security conditions, and sustained momentum of reform, has laid
the basis of an improved medium-term macroeconomic outlook.
Progress has been made on the governance front but the new institutions are new and much
remains to be done to strengthen this capacity. Burundi made progress in securing debt relief
in 2005. The enhanced HIPC decision point was reached in August. Scheduled debt service,
after traditional and HIPC relief, was reduced to 34 percent of exports from 110 percent in
2004. Burundi has yet to secure debt relief from non-Paris Club creditors.
Policy discussions focused on the need to secure macroeconomic stability and create an
economic environment to encourage private sector activity and improve productivity.
The program for 2006 projects a recovery of real GDP to 6 percent, reflecting continued vigor
in the service sectors and a strong rebound in coffee output. Inflation is expected to decelerate
further. The 2006 program provides fiscal space to start addressing urgent social needs,
consistent with macroeconomic stability, in part through a shift from security to social
spending. The budget includes a strong set of administrative reforms and the clearance of
domestic arrears. Monetary policy aims at further strengthening liquidity management with the
introduction of treasury securities. Financial sector supervision is being strengthened.
The program includes to activation of the privatization agenda, especially for coffee.

3
The managed floating exchange rate regime has served Burundi well so far and little remained
to be done for Burundi to be in a position to accept its obligations under Article VIII, Sections,
2, 3, and 4 of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the progress made in implementing
Burundi’s PRGF supported program in a difficult post-conflict environment. The fiscal deficit
was reduced owing to buoyant revenues, and inflation fell significantly. Following lower-thanexpected economic growth in 2005, a strong pick-up in growth, fueled by a rebound in coffee
production and strengthening confidence, is expected in 2006. Directors were in particular
encouraged by the successful political transition and improved security situation.
They encouraged the authorities to move ahead with the resolute implementation of structural
reforms, and to refocus spending on the social sectors and infrastructure necessary to achieve
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
Directors observed that commendable progress has been made in structural reforms in the
fiscal, monetary, and foreign exchange areas. At the same time, deeper reforms in the
productive sectors that are fundamental for a sustained recovery have been delayed. Directors
urged the authorities to press ahead with structural reforms to stimulate private sector activity
and improve the business climate, and to reactivate the privatization agenda, especially for the
coffee sector, building on strong efforts to mobilize political and social consensus in support of
the reforms.
Directors welcomed the strong fiscal performance in 2005. The buoyancy of revenues, despite
the significant reduction in import duties, augurs well for the effectiveness of continued
revenue-enhancing efforts. There is also a need to sustain efforts to improve public
expenditure management and to reinforce budget execution, financial control, and public
procurement practices. Directors underscored the importance of managing carefully the
public’s expectations of a peace dividend, of fully costing all social initiatives in the budget, and
of maintaining prudent fiscal and debt management policies given continued vulnerability to
shocks and debt distress risks. It will also be important to further strengthen good governance
and transparency, including through public financial management reforms and the progressive
withdrawal of state intervention in the economy.
Directors observed that improvements in the Bank of the Republic of Burundi’s (BRB) ability to
conduct monetary policy and channel official foreign exchange inflows into the exchange
market have helped to strengthen inflation control. They called on the authorities to clear
domestic arrears and introduce standardized and negotiable treasury securities in 2006.
Directors emphasized the need to bolster banking supervision, and looked forward to early
passage of laws to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and to reinforce
the central bank’s independence. They commended the BRB for improvements in its internal
operations, including its pro-active response to the safeguards assessment, and encouraged
further efforts to modernize its operations and internal auditing.

Directors considered that the managed-float exchange rate regime has served Burundi well,
helping to cushion exogenous shocks. They welcomed the progress made in liberalizing the
exchange regime, and looked forward to the authorities’ acceptance of the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement.
Directors urged the authorities to seek debt relief from non-Paris Club creditors that have not
yet provided such relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative on terms comparable to those
obtained from Paris Club creditors. They also emphasized that Burundi will need continued
access to grant financing.
Directors noted that good but uneven progress has been made in raising Burundi’s social
conditions, but that the challenges in meeting the MDGs remain significant. Particular attention
should be paid in the period ahead to reinforcing, with donor support, the government’s
capacity to deliver social services. Directors also saw scope for further reducing military
expenditures in favor of social spending. Directors welcomed that a full PRSP is being
finalized, which should provide the necessary framework for pursuing the authorities’ poverty
reduction and social development goals, and support progress towards the HIPC completion
point.
Directors encouraged the authorities to strengthen the statistical system, to improve the ability
to monitor economic developments.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 14, 2006

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Completes Third and Fourth Reviews Under Burundi's PRGF
Arrangement and Approves US$21.1 Disbursement

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the third and
fourth reviews of Burundi's economic performance under an SDR 69.30 million (about
US$102.4 million) Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement (see Press
Release No. 04/13), and approved the disbursement of an amount equivalent to SDR 14.3 million
(about US$21.1 million), which will bring the total disbursements under the PRGF arrangement
to SDR 55 million (about US$81.3 million).
In completing the third and fourth reviews, the Executive Board granted Burundi's request for
waivers of nonobservance of two performance criteria, one relating to the installation of a
computerized financial management information system (IFMIS), and the other to external
payments arrears. The Board also extended Burundi’s PRGF arrangement through to September
30, 2007 and granted additional interim assistance to Burundi under the enhanced Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative.
Following the Executive Board's discussion on July 14, 2006 on Burundi's economic
performance, Mr. Agustín Carstens, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“Following a long-lasting social conflict, the recent successful political transition and improved
security situation in Burundi have now set the stage for moving ahead resolutely with structural
reforms that are essential to stimulate private sector activity, improve the business climate, and
accelerate growth over the medium term. Given Burundi’s pressing social needs—as one of the
poorest countries in the world—the authorities’ intention to refocus public spending on the social
sectors and infrastructure needs that will help achieve the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) is welcome.
“Performance under the PRGF-supported program in 2005 was satisfactory. Although the pace
of structural reform was uneven, reflecting the political transition, commendable progress was
made in the fiscal, monetary, and foreign exchange areas. In the period ahead, the authorities will
need to focus on initiating deeper reforms in the productive sectors that are fundamental for a
sustained economic recovery.

-2-

“Fiscal revenues have been stronger than expected, and public expenditure management has
improved. Further steps will be needed over the medium term—and with donor assistance--to
strengthen budget execution, financial control, and public procurement. Expectations of a peace
dividend need to be managed carefully, and the costs of all social initiatives should be included
in the budget. Further enhancements in good governance and transparency practices will help
strengthen private investor and donor confidence.
“Monetary policy implementation has been strengthened, as evidenced by the decline in inflation
and stronger exchange rate. At the same time, banking supervision should be improved, and
efforts continued to modernize the central bank’s internal operations. The managed-float
exchange rate regime has served Burundi well, helping to cushion external shocks, and
commendable progress has been made in liberalizing the exchange regime.
“The authorities are in the final stages of preparing a full PRSP, which is expected to be ready in
mid-2006. An expenditure-tracking mechanism has been set up. A donor’s conference to
mobilize financing is planned for the fourth quarter of 2006. Donor coordination and predictable
disbursement of program support will be important for macroeconomic stability and
administrative capacity building, and helping the authorities reinforce the delivery of social
services. Following the extension of additional interim assistance under the enhanced HIPC
Initiative, the authorities are now encouraged to buttress their efforts toward reaching the HIPC
completion point,” Mr. Carstens said.
The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF-supported
programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory
process involving civil society and development partners and articulated in a PRSP. This is
intended to ensure that PRGF-supported programs are consistent with a comprehensive
framework to foster growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate of
0.5 percent and are repayable over 10 years with a 5 ½-year grace period on principal payments.

Statement by Peter J. Ngumbullu, Executive Director for Burundi
and Dieudonne Nintunze, Advisor to Executive Director
July 14, 2006

Introduction
1.
The Burundian authorities would like to express their appreciation to staff,
Management and Executive Directors for the constructive engagement and continued
support. They are appreciative of the exchange of views with staff during discussion of the
2006 Article IV consultation and the reviews under the PRGF arrangement, and welcome the
policy advice formulated. The authorities reiterate their commitment to implement the
measures agreed under the economic reform agenda. Following the successful completion of
the political transition, which resulted in the establishment of new democratically elected
Government and Parliament since August 2005, the authorities have now a favorable
environment for deepening structural reforms and sustaining current efforts in economic
recovery.
Recent economic developments and performance under the program.
2.
Despite the complex post-conflict environment and exogenous shocks, including
drought and the high oil prices, the authorities have made substantial progress in
implementing their economic program, and have established a track record of
implementation of the reforms. Prudent fiscal and monetary policies have resulted in
improved macroeconomic performance in 2005, although GDP growth was lower than
projected, reflecting negative effects of the drought on agriculture production. Inflation was
contained substantially in the second half of 2005 falling to 1 percent end- December, a far
lower level than the program target; the fiscal primary deficit was contained to half the
program target, and international reserves reached higher levels.
3.
Fiscal performance was better than programmed in 2005, with government revenue
exceeding the program target by 1.8 percent of GDP, mainly reflecting the effectiveness of
implementation of tax and customs administration reforms and improved revenue collection.
Burundi is still experiencing enormous post-conflict needs and the authorities have increased
the poverty related expenditure level as defined in the I-PRSP, at 7.3 percent of GDP, in
2005. Although primary expenditure remained in the range of the program targets, the overall
budget deficit was wider than targeted, reflecting delays in disbursement of programmed
external budgetary support.
4.
Significant progress was achieved in monetary and exchange rate policies during
2005. The Bank of the Republic of Burundi (BRB) has tightened monetary policy and,
capitalizing on IMF’s TA recommendations, has made progress in implementing measures
aimed at introducing market-based monetary instruments. In this regard, the BRB has
continued to conduct the weekly liquidity auctions launched in April 2005, and raised reserve
requirements. The abolition of the tax on banking transactions in late 2005 resulted in
reduction of the cost of financial intermediation.

2

5.
During this period, the central bank continued to enhance governance of its
operations, following completion of the first external audit in June 2005. In this regard, the
BRB has taken advantage of the IMF’s safeguards assessment recommendations, to
operationalize the independent audit committee of the Boards of Directors, and conduct the
second annual external audit. Moreover, substantial progress was recorded in strengthening
prudential norms and banking supervision. On exchange rate policy, Burundi has made
further progress in liberalizing its exchange regime, including raising ceilings for the
invisibles in June 2005, as well as its conversion into indicative limits. The central bank has
also improved significantly its foreign exchange auctions, and the differential between the
official and parallel market rates has been practically eliminated.
6.
Performance was mixed on structural reforms. While the privatization program has
advanced more slowly, significant progress was achieved in implementing governance
reforms and improving institutional and legal framework, in addition to strong progress on
monetary, exchange system and fiscal reforms. On governance and transparency reforms, the
Audit Court (Cour des Comptes) published its first audit of the 2004 government accounts in
December 2005. It has also carried out specific audits of the Defense and Civil Service
Ministries, as well as advanced investigations into several specific cases. Further progress
includes the approval of a new bankruptcy and liquidation law by Parliament in November
last year.
7.
The privatization program, including in the coffee sector, decelerated in the second
half of 2005, and a number of factors explain this situation. The much needed technical
assistance was delayed, and the new government needed more time for consultation process
to build consensus. Nevertheless, in the transitional period to privatization in the coffee
sector, the authorities have implemented commendable measures to improve efficiency, and
in this connection, they have taken further steps to improve management and minimize
financial risks to farmers and the Treasury. The Coffee Marketing Board (OCIBU) realized
an operating surplus of FBu 19 billion or about 2.2 percent of GDP, of which more than 32
percent was directly redistributed to farmers, and 46 percent reserved for financing of the
2005/06 crop, as the government guarantee for bank credit to the coffee sector has been
abolished.
8.
Overall, performance under the authorities’ economic program are commendable, and
the program is on track. All end-June and end-December 2005 quantitative performance
criteria were met, except a temporary accumulation of external arrears in late 2005 which
have been cleared. The structural performance criterion for October 2005 on installation of a
computerized financial management information system (IFMIS) in the Ministry of Finance
was made operational in January 2006. Most structural benchmarks were implemented,
although some of them with minor delays, and credible corrective measures were initiated for
others. In addition, all the ten prior actions have been implemented in a timely manner. Given
this positive performance, the authorities request the completion of the third and fourth
reviews and the approval of the associated waivers, extension of the PRGF arrangement, as
well as additional interim assistance under the HIPC initiative.

3
Macroeconomic program for 2006, challenges and medium-term outlook
9.
The authorities are committed to consolidate the progress so far achieved in
stabilizing the economy, and are aware of the risks and enormous challenges that they still
face going forward. Theses include the need to tackle the post-conflict reconstruction and
rehabilitation needs, diversify the sources of growth and exports to set the economy on a
higher growth path, reduce the widespread poverty, and make significant progress towards
reaching the MDGs.
10
Prudent macroeconomic policies will continue to be implemented to contain
inflationary pressures. At the same time, the authorities will pursue their efforts in addressing
challenges on infrastructure bottlenecks and improving delivery of social services, which will
contribute to enhancement of economic productivity. They will also step up implementation
of their structural reform agenda, with a view to accelerating and sustaining growth. Burundi
is currently in the process of finalizing formulation of the full PRSP based on extensive
consultations with all stakeholders in the country, whose implementation will also help
address these challenges head on. The authorities expect economic growth to recover at
above 6 percent in 2006, and to continue growing at about the same rate over the medium
term. Inflation is projected to continue declining to low single digit levels. The authorities’
reform program is strong and its successful implementation requires the support of all
development partners, including the Fund, in terms of timely and predictable concessional
financing, as well as capacity building.
Fiscal Policy
11.
The objective of fiscal policy is to achieve fiscal sustainability in the medium term in
support of the low inflation target. With the support of the Fund and World Bank TA, they
have formulated an action plan of fiscal reforms to enhance public finance management.
These include reforms aimed at modernizing tax and customs administration, and
strengthening public expenditure management, as well as further improvements in
transparency of public finance operations. As reflected in the MEFP (matrix pages 49-50,
attachment I of the staff report), the authorities have taken commendable steps in
implementing a number of reform measures from the action plan, including the establishment
of the IFMIS in Ministry of Finance, which will be extended progressively to line Ministries.
12.
Continued improvements in revenue collection, coupled with further improvements in
public expenditure restructuring and external debt relief under the HIPC initiative, will help
create fiscal space to address the challenging and urgent social needs. The 2006 budget
includes additional expenditures, reflecting priorities defined in the I-PRSP, allocated from
interim debt relief and identified in consultation with the World Bank and IMF staff. Poverty
reducing expenditures are projected to rise significantly in 2006, following abolition of
school fees at primary education level since September 2005, as well as maternity charges
and health care fees for children under 5 years old, since January 2006. The authorities are
also determined to clear the audited domestic arrears in 2006, with a view to strengthening
confidence of the private sector and the banking system, as these arrears reflect in large part
the non performing assets in the banking sector.

4
Monetary and exchange rate policies
13.
The BRB is committed to sustaining its monetary stance with a view to further
reducing inflation. It has already taken steps to strengthen liquidity management, with the
introduction of reserve requirements for foreign exchange deposits in early 2006, and will
continue improving foreign exchange sales and liquidity auctions. The central bank will also
introduce and manage on behalf of the government new standardized and negotiable treasury
securities, and will reinforce banking supervision and restructuring. The BRB is confident
that these measures will slowdown monetary growth, while reviving credit to the private
sector.
14.
The exchange regime has been deeply liberalized over the recent years, and the BRB
is committed to implement the remaining measures so that it can achieve full convertibility in
the international current transactions as soon as possible. The managed floating exchange
rate regime has served Burundi well, and will continue to be applied. The BRB’s
interventions in the exchange market will be limited to achieving its foreign assets targets
consistent with the reserve money nominal anchor, and containing short-term volatility of the
exchange rate.
Structural reforms
15.
The authorities are determined to build a friendly business environment, with a view
to promoting private sector led growth. To this end, they will enhance and deepen
implementation of structural reforms aimed at ensuring economic recovery. As detailed in
the MEFP ( matrix pages 53-55, attachment I of the staff report), these comprise further
progress in good governance and transparency, improvements in regulatory and legal
framework for doing business, as well as reforms in key productive sectors, including
restructuring of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs). As regards privatization of coffee sector,
the authorities will establish an appropriate reform action plan with the support of World
Bank technical assistance, with the objective to ensure a competitive market structure at all
levels of the coffee sector, and that farmers operate freely. These reforms would also assist in
attracting long-awaited investment and private financing in this area.
Debt sustainability and the HIPC initiative
16.
The updated external debt sustainability assessment using the new low-income
country debt sustainability framework (DSF) shows that Burundi’s external debt will remain
unsustainable, even after the full use of HIPC assistance. The NPV of debt-to-exports ratio
remains above the 100 percent indicative threshold for a long period (2005-13), and it is not
expected to decrease to 76 percent before 2026, under the baseline scenario whose
assumptions are described in Box 1 (page 87, staff report, appendix VI). The assessment
indicates also that the additional debt relief under MDRI would reduce moderately the risk of
debt distress. Considering Burundi’s financing requirements for the formidable needs for
post-conflict reconstruction and poverty reduction, and given the high risks to the baseline
projection, the authorities would welcome exceptional efforts by the international community

5
to provide additional financial support, including by raising further interim relief. They are
taking necessary steps to implement the triggers selected for reaching the completion point
under the HIPC Initiative. They have developed a national debt management strategy, and
are advancing in strengthening external debt management capacity.
Conclusion
17.
Following the successful completion of the political transition, Burundi has achieved
remarkable progress in implementing its economic program, despite a very difficult postconflict environment. The authorities are, however, conscious of the daunting challenges
ahead, as poverty is still widespread with more than half of the population living in extreme
poverty conditions, and more still needs to be done to diversify the economic base and invest
in productivity-enhancing infrastructure to attain higher growth
18.
Despite the authorities’ strong commitment to making further progress in
implementing their economic reform agenda and consolidating macroeconomic stability to
sustain growth, the long period of conflict has weakened the administrative capacity of the
country. It is in this regard that they welcome the TA provided so far, and call on the
continued support of development partners including the IMF, to complement their effort.
The authorities strongly believe that a full time IMF Resident Representative, together with
reinforced TA would be very helpful in enhancing the authorities’ capacity to implement the
reform agenda, deliver the much needed social services, and meet the MDGs.
