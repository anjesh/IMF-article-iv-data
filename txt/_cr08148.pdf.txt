Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

The Greek economy has been buoyant for several years and growth is expected to
remain robust for some time. The risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. In
the near term, risks stem from a weaker external environment and a potential liquidity
squeeze of banks. Over the longer-term, a persistent loss of competitiveness raises the
prospect of a prolonged period of slow growth. Averting this risk requires improving
cost competitiveness through wage moderation, an environment that encourages
product upgrading, and a broadened effort to reform product and labor markets.

•

The Greek banking sector appears to be sound and has thus far remained largely
unaffected by the financial market turmoil. However, continued rapid credit growth
and increasing presence in southeastern Europe (SEE), financed partly by wholesale
funding, have increased banks’ exposure to credit, country, and liquidity risks.
Appropriate steps have been taken to strengthen supervision and foster cooperation
with SEE supervisors, but stress testing needs to be upgraded.

•

The authorities are pursuing further fiscal consolidation with the goal of
achieving a balanced budget by 2010. Given the high level of public debt and
anticipated aging pressures, further adjustment thereafter to a surplus position is
necessary. Revenue objectives for 2008–10 are ambitious; their achievement will
require further revenue enhancing measures. Reforms to tax administration and
expenditure management are being implemented, and will need to be broadened.

•

A gradualist approach is being taken on pension reform. The reform agenda is
narrow and the policy proposals are lacking full assessment of financing needs and
cost savings. While staff sees a need for greater ambition, the authorities view their
reform strategy as politically realistic.

•

Structural reforms have been put in place, but impediments to higher
productivity remain. Important initiatives are underway to improve the business
environment. However, enhancing competition and reducing labor market rigidities
remain challenges.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
The Greek economy has been buoyant for several years, and the gap in real per
capita income between Greece and the EU–15 has narrowed significantly. Real GDP

However, the external sector has been a drag on
growth; external imbalances have remained large throughout and widened (Figure 1,
Tables 1 and 2).
2.
Sustaining the strong growth momentum over the longer-term will require
addressing several challenges.
•

Rising labor costs are a threat to competitiveness and may ultimately act as a brake
on investment and employment growth. A substantial narrowing of the external
current account deficit is needed to stabilize the net foreign asset position.

The analysis in this report is based on the revised national accounts data (see Box 1). There are large
differences between national accounts and settlements-basis balance of payments data that are not easily
reconciled (see Box in Appendix II).

4
Box 1. National Accounts Revisions
EU regulation stipulates that member states change the base year for the national accounts at
least once every five years. For that purpose, and to resolve a number of reservations raised by
Eurostat regarding previous estimates, the National Statistical Service of Greece (NSSG)
carried out an in-depth revision of the national accounts with 2000 as the new base year. The
revision utilized new statistical data sources—in particular, the 2001 population census; an
update of the family budget survey; new surveys of enterprises in construction, hotels, retail
and wholesale commerce, and transport; and new estimates of rents, capital stock, and
depreciation. In October 2006, the NSSG announced a provisional increase of 25.7 percent in
the GDP level. However, following a review by Eurostat, the final revision involves an
increase in 2000 GDP of 9.6 percent.
While real growth rates remain roughly the same as those for the old GDP series, the
composition of growth is different. In particular, gross fixed investment and private
consumption are now estimated to be stronger while imports are a larger drag on growth.
ESA95-basis unemployment rate is estimated to be lower in the revised national accounts
framework.

•

Inflation inertia—around 3–3½ percent in recent
years—and the persistence of an inflation
differential with the euro area (Figure 2), while
partly driven by the convergence process, are also
symptomatic of rigidities in the labor and product
markets.

Immigration, an important source of labor supply
during the past few years, has begun to wane. Employment growth will depend
increasingly on the mobilization of the large unused potential labor input.

•

The current high level of government debt (93 percent of GDP) and the projected
increases in pension and health care costs related to population aging will adversely
affect debt sustainability. In addition, the rigidity of the expenditure structure renders
the budget vulnerable to shocks that could result in a sharp growth slowdown
(Figure 3).

•

The persistence of high nonperforming
loans (NPLs) in the face of rapid credit
growth, the rising exposure of Greek banks
in southeastern Europe (SEE), and their
growing reliance on wholesale funding
suggest increasing exposure of banks to
credit and liquidity risk. However, with
household indebtedness still relatively low,
strong credit growth can be expected to
continue (Figure 4).

3.
The authorities are seeking to address some of these challenges, and will need to
persevere with and broaden the reform efforts. The deterioration in the public finances in
the period leading up to the 2004 Olympic Games has been reversed, in compliance with the
Stability and Growth Pact’s excessive deficit procedure. The general government deficit fell
by about 5 percentage points of GDP over two years to 2½ percent of GDP in 2006, and was
contained at 2¾ percent of GDP in 2007 despite several unexpected one-off expenditures
amounting to about 1 percent of GDP. Also, measures have been initiated under the National
Reform Program for 2005–08 to strengthen tax administration and expenditure management,
enhance performance of state-owned enterprises, improve the business environment and
facilitate private sector development.

6
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
4.
Against this backdrop, the 2007 Article IV consultation discussions focused on
policies needed to maintain domestic economic and financial stability, through vigilance over
financial sector risks, steps to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability, and reforms to tackle the
structural constraints to sustained growth.
A. The Outlook
5.
Economic growth is expected to moderate in the near term but should remain
solid on the back of continued strong domestic demand. Although the pent-up demand for
housing is anticipated to fade, the investment outlook appears positive on account of healthy
corporate balance sheets, execution of projects benefiting from government incentives and
public-private partnerships, and absorption of EU funds under the Community Support
Framework. Consumer demand is also expected to remain robust. Thus, on the basis of the
Autumn 2007 common external assumptions of the European Commission, the authorities’
baseline scenario projects real GDP growth as remaining sustained at around 4 percent
during 2008–10.2 However, the subsequent deterioration in the external environment—
higher oil prices, the financial turmoil and associated slowdown in main partner countries,
and a stronger euro—will dampen Greece’s growth prospects. Accordingly, staff project
GDP growth slowing down to 3.7 percent in 2008, and averaging 3½ percent during 2009–10

This is broadly similar to the authorities’ alternate scenario in the SGP update report.

7
6.
The risks to the staff projections are tilted to the downside, stemming from
possible persistence of the global financial turmoil. Such a persistence could result in a
liquidity squeeze for banks dependent on wholesale funding and prompt them to scale back
business plans (see ¶14). The persistence of the turmoil also could hit export prospects harder
than presumed in the baseline scenario.
7.
The authorities see ample scope for sustained growth over the longer term
through reaping the benefits from Greece’s location and becoming a regional business
hub. In this context, they highlight the ongoing and planned investment in infrastructure. An
expansion of the Greek shipping fleet and construction of several large-scale energy
interconnection projects in the natural gas, electricity and oil sectors are underway. The
authorities’ strategy also entails developing ports, rail and road systems, and tourist
infrastructure through private participation. They agree that realizing the investment and
growth potential would require pressing ahead with structural reforms that create a conducive
policy environment and improved competitiveness.
8.
Inflationary pressures picked up in Q4–2007 owing to rising food and oil prices,
and the risks are to the upside. The authorities, concerned about the possible emergence of
second-round effects, have appealed to social partners and entrepreneurs to exercise restraint
in wage and price-setting. They were encouraged, however, by the narrowing of the inflation
differential with the euro area during 2007, and saw it as a sign of reduced structural
rigidities. Assuming no significant second-round effects and oil prices in line with the World
Economic Outlook projections, staff project average inflation to rise to 3.3 percent in
2008 and to moderate slightly thereafter.

As Greece is a member of a currency union, the assessment of external stability is reserved for the union as a
whole, and the staff report assesses only trends in competitiveness and balance of payments developments. The
euro at present appears to be on the strong side relative to medium-term fundamentals.

by about 10 percent and 17 percent, respectively, since EMU accession in 2001. Staff
estimates of competitiveness based on CGER methodologies also suggest a sizable gap in the
range of 30–40 percent in 2007.5
10.
The authorities recognized the negative implications of the steady deterioration
of competitiveness, but did not consider it an impediment in the near term. They
observed that Greek enterprises were restructuring and moving up the technology ladder and
that developments in employment and unemployment had been favorable. Reflecting this and
the increasing diversification of trade toward the rapidly growing countries in SEE, Greece’s
export market share has been broadly maintained since EMU entry in 2001. National
accounts data suggest a continuation of strong export performance in 2007, though bank
settlements data point to a substantial slowdown in the second half. The authorities further
noted that services exports were expanding rapidly, and they saw promising prospects for
sustained growth in this area.

many export-oriented labor-intensive manufacturing firms are increasingly relying on
outsourcing.6 Staff further noted that rising labor costs above productivity gains are
adversely affecting the profitability of the tourism sector which faces intense price
competition. Accordingly, staff stressed the importance of early efforts to improve cost
competitiveness through wage moderation and strong productivity growth, and to create an
environment conducive to investment in product upgrading.
12.
There was broad agreement that the current account deficit would remain
relatively large in the medium term. It is assumed that, in line with recent trends,
merchandise export market share will be maintained through product upgrading and
geographic diversification. For its part, the shipping sector should gain market share with the
expansion of the fleet. Import growth is likely to remain robust in view of the substantial
investment and new ships purchases in the pipeline. Accordingly, the current account deficit
is projected to remain around 14 percent of GDP during 2008–10 and fall slightly thereafter
once the outlays on new ships fade away (Table 4). Thus, Greece’s already large negative
international investment position will deteriorate further.

In view of Greece's EMU membership, the availability of external financing is
not a concern, but the correction of cumulating indebtedness could weigh appreciably
on growth going forward. While the risk of transmitting vulnerabilities to the euro area is
very small reflecting Greece’s small relative size,7 large persistent current account deficits
would increase the vulnerabilities to a reversal in market sentiment, leading to a corrective
retrenchment of private sector balance-sheets in the face of rising indebtedness, and a
possible appreciable rise in the cost of funding over time. These developments would have
significant negative implications for growth.

Cross-border banking supervision is being stepped up amid heightened concerns
over the potential consequences of a deceleration in global growth rates. Nine SEE
supervisory authorities have agreed to intensify collaboration on achieving convergence of
supervisory practices, including those related to risk assessment, money laundering and
financing of terrorism.9 Regarding exposures of Greek banks abroad, the BoG has adopted a
risk-based, multilayer supervisory framework, which includes on-site examinations and
setting country limits. The Basel II framework is scheduled to be introduced in March 2008,
and steady progress is being made in implementing the EU’s capital requirement Directives.
17.
Other aspects of the regulatory and supervisory framework are also being
addressed. The Private Insurance Supervisory Committee (PISC) became operational in
January 2008, and is adopting a risk-based approach to insurance supervision. The authorities
have taken some measures to address the deficiencies identified during the FATF assessment
in relation to the legal and supervisory frameworks for anti-money laundering and combating
financial terrorism. However, the remedial program being adopted by the authorities cannot
be finalized until a new law is in effect and relevant regulatory instruments are developed.
Staff urged the authorities to proceed quickly with the necessary staffing of the PISC and
related changes in legislation so that there are no supervisory gaps, and to intensify efforts to
achieve prompt compliance with the FATF standards.
D. Fiscal Policy
18.
The authorities are pursuing further fiscal consolidation with the goal of
achieving a balanced budget by 2010. The 2008 budget aims to reduce the general
government deficit to 1.6 percent of GDP through revenue measures (Table 9). Revenue
efforts will center on combating tax evasion through administrative measures, restructuring
taxation of heating oil, and reform of property taxes (Box 2). The saving in expenditure from
the elimination of the one-off expenditures incurred in 2007 will be offset by higher outlays
on wages and social transfers—the latter has increased as ratio to GDP by 0.6 percentage
point every year since 2005 and this trend will continue in 2008, making the expenditure
structure more rigid. The authorities expected fiscal consolidation in 2009–10 also to be
achieved from higher revenues, but have not specified the enabling measures. Saving from
improvements in expenditure management would be directed toward further reinforcing the
social welfare system, especially increasing targeted support to poor households. The
authorities also observed that achievement of a balanced budget by 2010 might not be
feasible if the pace of economic growth slowed in line with the staff scenario. Staff stressed
that further fiscal adjustment to a surplus position over the medium term was necessary to

Box 2. Tax Reform
The authorities have taken several steps since 2004 to simplify the tax system, broaden the
base, and tackle tax evasion. Specifically, they unified the taxation of interest income,
eliminated tax exemption on retained earnings, raised the VAT rate and extended it to real
estate transactions, lowered taxes for individuals and businesses, and strengthened tax
administration. The tax reform in 2008 builds on these efforts, and includes:
Personal income tax cuts. The two middle marginal tax rates of 29 percent and
39 percent will be reduced by 2 percentage points annually in 2008–09 to 25 percent and
35 percent, respectively.
Rationalizing real estate taxation. The inheritance and parental gift tax on properties of
less than euro 90,000 and the real estate tax on large properties are being abolished. These
will be replaced by a uniform 1 percent duty on property transfers and a new tax on
individual’s property (0.1 percent) and on legal entities’ property (0.6 percent). Rural
properties and first homes below 200 square meters and less than euro 300,000 in value
are exempt from tax.
Harmonizing gasoil taxation. To curb widespread excise fraud, the authorities will
eliminate the large differential in gasoil excise rates for heating and propellant use, and
reform its distribution system. To limit the adverse impact, a program for compensating
households will be introduced.
Improving tax compliance. A new Law on Tax Evasion passed in November 2007
provides for: the establishment of a National Council to guide efforts at combating tax
fraud and evasion; strengthening the structure of tax administration; tax deductions for
taxpayers who submit receipts for services; and the creation of a tax policy unit in the
Ministry of Economy and Finance.
Estimated revenue impact. The total revenue impact of the above-mentioned measures
in the 2008 budget is about 1 percent of GDP. (The authorities have not provided precise
revenue impact of the individual measures). The estimate is subject to downside risks.
There is uncertainty relating to the new property tax, especially as property registers
remain to be fully updated. The revenue impact of the new tax evasion law is likely to be
limited in the short term.

19.
The revenue objectives for 2008–10 are ambitious, with associated risks to the
fiscal deficit targets. However, the authorities emphasized that revenue developments would
be monitored closely, and measures would be taken if necessary to meet the fiscal deficit
target for 2008. Looking forward, staff recommended that the newly-established National
Committee for tackling tax evasion focus attention on increasing tax compliance through
simplifying tax laws and regulations, streamlining basic tax procedures, improving taxpayer
services, and further intensifying risk-based auditing. Also, consideration should be given to
increasing revenues through broadening the base of major taxes by phasing out distortionary
exemptions ahead of any increases in tax rates, as statutory rates in Greece are already quite
high.12
20.
The authorities are continuing with efforts to strengthen public expenditure
management and broaden its scope. Measures are being put in place to introduce greater
transparency and accountability in the operations and finances of local governments, public
hospitals, and the pension funds through the adoption of standard budgeting and monitoring

As Figure 3 shows, if real GDP growth dropped to 2 percent on average, the public debt-to-GDP ratio would
rise to 98 percent by 2013, compared with a decline to 72 percent under the baseline scenario.

frameworks. In the health sector, reforms are underway to consolidate the number of regional
authorities, upgrade management of public hospitals, improve pricing and costing
mechanisms, and introduce better controls on procurement. A pilot initiative in programbased budgeting has been launched for one line ministry in 2008, as a precursor to eventually
integrating this approach fully into budget preparation and execution. Staff encouraged the
authorities to also focus on developing a medium-term budget framework, extending the
coverage of the budget, improving cash management, and putting in place an appropriate
financial management information system. More generally, greater emphasis on effective and
timely implementation of reforms was desirable. In this context, staff noted that because of
slow progress in the preparatory organizational aspects of public enterprise reform there had
been little improvement in enterprise performance during the past two years.
21.
The authorities are following a gradualist approach on pension reform.13 Unless
the social security system is fundamentally reformed, the long-term costs of population aging
are expected to threaten the sustainability of the public finances. The completion of the
actuarial studies of the major pension funds has been further delayed, and the authorities are
proceeding with a narrowly focused reform agenda which is nonetheless already drawing
considerable protest. They have ruled out reduction of the replacement rate and increases in
the contribution rates. Instead, the focus is on obtaining efficiency gains through the merger
of pension funds, tightening provisions for early retirement (the list of “heavy and unhealthy”
occupations and the disability pension code would be reformed toward this end), increasing
the incentives for people to stay employed longer, and tackling contribution evasion. In the
absence of an assessment of the cost savings, it was not clear to what extent the current
reform proposals would suffice to restore the pension fund to financial viability. Staff
underscored the need for preparing and publishing detailed and realistic projections of the
costs of population aging in accordance with EU methodologies, and preparing a
comprehensive reform strategy on this basis. This would help promote an informed internal
debate, needed to foster a consensus in favor of a more ambitious reform. Toward this end,
staffing constraints and bureaucratic obstacles that have delayed data collection and analysis
needed to be addressed urgently. Staff also argued that the gradualist approach being pursued
would need deeper and more painful adjustments later, skew the tax burden toward future
generations, and require larger fiscal surpluses to achieve debt sustainability. The authorities
noted that their reform strategy was designed to be politically realistic.

13

The last pension reforms in Greece were enacted in 2002. The details of that round of reform and issues in
pension reform in Greece have been discussed earlier in IMF Country Reports 02/58 and 06/5.

especially on temporary employment. Staff also recommended strengthening active labor
market policies to increase labor mobility.

collective bargaining appear to be following the same
pattern, with adverse implications for preserving international cost competitiveness. The
authorities explained that a reform of the collective bargaining system is not on their agenda
as social consensus would be difficult to obtain simultaneously with consensus on pension
reform.
24.
The authorities are seeking to improve the business environment through
economic incentives and strengthening of the institutional framework. The business
sector is reaping the benefits of lower corporate tax rates, investment incentives for priority
sectors, a new bankruptcy code, an updated company law, and simplified licensing of
manufacturing businesses. The authorities are placing emphasis on reducing administrative

17
burdens and improving the quality of services provision. Land use regulations are being
updated to facilitate investment in renewable energy sources, tourism and industry. The
authorities are also continuing with the privatization program—a partial stake in the savings
bank and the telephone company was offered to institutional investors in 2007, and plans to
privatize air and sea ports are being developed. However, Greece still fares poorly on the
ease of doing business, with a rank of 100 among 178 countries, suggesting a need for further
reform efforts. In this context, staff welcomed plans to introduce legislation in 2008 aimed at
lessening bureaucracy in setting up businesses and sharply reducing business start-up time
for commercial enterprises.
25.
Enhancing competition, particularly in the network industries and in the
transport sector, remains a challenge (Figure 7). The stake of the state in key public
utilities remains high and price regulation is still pervasive. Unbundling of the operations of
the incumbents in the electricity and gas markets and opening the transport market to new
entrants should help foster competition in these sectors. Staff encouraged the authorities to
tackle price rigidities in the broader product market by ensuring that the Hellenic
Competition Commission is effectively organized and adequately staffed.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
The Greek economy has performed well during the past several years. Economic
activity has grown at a rapid pace, driven by strong domestic demand. Employment and
unemployment indicators have improved markedly. Fiscal imbalances have been
significantly reduced since 2004, and Greece exited from the EU’s excessive deficit
procedure in mid-2007. Structural reforms have been initiated to bolster fiscal performance
and improve the business environment. While cost competitiveness has deteriorated steadily,
the market share of goods exports has been maintained since EMU entry, owing to a move up
the technology ladder and increasing geographic diversification of trade. However, the
external sector has been a drag on growth, with large and widening current account deficits.
27.
Solid growth is expected to continue for some time, on the back of strong
domestic demand, but risks are tilted to the downside. In the near-term, the risks stem
primarily from a possibly weaker external environment and a liquidity squeeze for banks
dependent on wholesale funding. Over the longer term, a persistent deterioration of cost
competitiveness may ultimately pose a constraint to sustaining the growth momentum.
Exporters of low-tech and low-skill products and the tourism sector remain particularly
vulnerable to rising labor costs and growing competition. Furthermore, constraints to
employment and productivity growth remain on account of labor and product market
rigidities, as well as infrastructure deficiencies. Tackling these challenges will require wage
moderation, further investment in product upgrading, and persevering with and broadening
the efforts to reform the product and labor markets. Pursuing a gradualist reform agenda is
likely to increase underlying vulnerabilities and the need for deeper adjustments later.

18
Stimulating an informed public debate to build social and political consensus in favor of
more ambitious and early reforms is essential.
28.
The banking system appears to be sound and has been largely unaffected by the
global financial turmoil, but key risks will need to be monitored closely. Continued rapid
credit growth and the increasing presence in southeastern Europe, financed in part through
wholesale funding, has increased Greek banks’ exposure to credit, country, and liquidity
risks. Stress testing should be upgraded to take into account correlation of risks. Steps taken
to strengthen supervision and foster cooperation with SEE supervisory authorities are
appropriate and timely. In the insurance sector, the adoption of a risk-based approach to
supervision by the new supervisor is welcome.
29.
Fiscal consolidation should be sustained over the medium term in view of the
current high level of public debt and the prospective large aging related costs. The
authorities’ aim of achieving a balanced budget by 2010 is appropriate, but further
adjustment thereafter to a surplus position is necessary. The revenue target of the 2008
budget is ambitious, and the authorities will need to undertake considerable efforts to achieve
it and remain within the overall deficit target. Achieving budget balance by 2010 will require
further revenue enhancing measures and determined efforts to control spending.
30.
A primary focus of the fiscal consolidation strategy is on improving revenue
collections. The emphasis of tax reform in 2008 is on tackling tax evasion through
administrative measures, incentives and restructuring of a few taxes. However, improving tax
compliance will require further strengthening of tax administration. Consideration should
also be given to phasing out distortionary exemptions for all major taxes and simplifying the
rate structure.
31.
Important reforms to expenditure management have been initiated, and need to
be pursued further. Public entities are being made subject to greater transparency and
accountability in their operations, and the health care system is being restructured to increase
efficiency. Further reform should seek to extend the coverage of the budget, put in place an
appropriate financial management information system, and fully integrate program-based
budgeting into budget preparation and execution. The introduction of a medium-term budget
framework would also help to guide fiscal strategy and prioritize policy objectives.
32.
The authorities are rightly giving priority to pension reform to ensure long-term
fiscal sustainability, though greater ambition is needed. The reform agenda is narrowly
focused and the policy proposals are lacking a full assessment of the financing needs and
cost savings. The authorities should prepare and publish detailed and realistic projections of
the cost of population aging in accordance with EU methodologies, providing the needed
basis for a comprehensive reform of the pension system.

19
33.
Broader product and labor market reforms are key to regaining lost
competitiveness, increasing the employment rate, and promoting robust productivity
growth in a context of domestic economic stability. Important initiatives have been taken
recently to simplify the licensing processes and operations of enterprises and to provide
economic incentives to encourage investment. The authorities should reinforce their efforts
to simplify licensing processes further, privatize infrastructure facilities, and enhance
competition in the network industries and the transport sector. The Greek labor market
remains relatively rigid by international comparison. Reform should focus on enhancing the
flexibility of the wage setting system and easing the restrictiveness of employment protection
legislation.
34.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the normal
12-month cycle.

1/ Shaded areas represent actual data. Individual shocks are permanent one-half standard deviation shocks except for the
interest rate and growth shocks. The growth shock assumes that real GDP growth drops to 0.8 percent in 2008 and it recovers
gradually to 3.1 percent by 2013. Figures in the boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the
baseline and scenario being presented. Ten-year historical average for the variable is also shown.
2/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and primary balance.
3/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent and 10 percent of GDP shock to contingent liabilities occur in 2009, with real
depreciation defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic
inflation (based on GDP deflator).

APPENDIX II. GREECE: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Economic data are adequate for surveillance, but should be strengthened. Substantial
progress has been made in statistical methodologies and practices to fulfill responsibilities as
a member of the European Union and the euro area. Greece subscribed to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) on November 8, 2002. A data module of the Report on the
Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) was published in 2003, and it was updated
in 2004 and 2005 in the context of the Article IV staff report.
National accounts produced by the National Statistical Service of Greece (NSSG) have
recently been revised substantially, in part to comply with the European System of Accounts
(ESA95). The new benchmark year is 2000. The revision follows the availability of new
statistical sources, in particular the census of population, new structural surveys of
construction companies, hotels and restaurants, transportation, as well as an update of the
household budget survey.
The seasonal adjustment of quarterly national accounts estimates relies on indicator series
rather than standard techniques. The resulting series retain strong seasonal patterns which
render them inadequate for assessing short-term economic developments. The NSGG plans
to introduce properly seasonally adjusted quarterly national accounts.
Balance of payments data present some departures from the fifth edition of the Balance of
Payments Manual (BPM5), but progress has been made implementing the recommendations
of the 2003 data ROSC. Significant differences remain in comparison to national accountsbased current account data (see Box).
The NSSG compiles data on general government revenue, expenditure, and deficit on an
accrual basis in the context of the 1995 ESA Transmission Program and the Excessive Deficit
Procedure. The absence of financing data impedes checks on data consistency, including
reconciliation between the government deficit and debt, and between government finance
statistics and other macroeconomic datasets.
The interpretation of labor market developments continues to be hampered by difficulties in
covering immigrants, which constitute, compared with other EU countries, a relatively large
fraction of the labor market, and by the large size of the unrecorded economy, which the
recent national accounts revisions may not have fully captured.
Under the Coordinated Compilation Exercise for Financial Soundness Indicators conducted
by the Fund, the authorities recently produced a set of indicators broadly consistent with the
Fund’s FSI Compilation Guide.

41

Discrepancies in External Accounts Data
There is currently a large statistical discrepancy between national accounts and
balance of payments data, which cannot be easily reconciled. Based on national
accounts, the negative foreign balance has exceeded 10 percent of GDP and steadily
risen since 2001. In contrast, balance of payments data show more moderate
external imbalances that have widened only recently reflecting higher oil prices and
a temporary pick-up in investment in new ships. The discrepancy has been in the
range of 3–7 percent of GDP a year during 2000–06.
The large discrepancy reflects differences in data source and methodology for
external merchandise trade. National accounts are compiled using customs data
which are then adjusted in accordance with ESA 95 to include estimates for
triangular merchanting trade, illegal activities, defense, smuggling, and oil
transactions in free zones. The balance of payments is compiled on the basis of
bank settlements data.
With the reduction in the time lag in availability of customs data, the authorities are
planning to shift to this data source to compile the balance of payments.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
GREECE
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
Approved by Alessandro Leipold and Michael Hadjimichael
April 15, 2008
This supplement contains the authorities’ latest estimates for 2007 and updated information
on the economic outlook for Greece that have become available since the circulation of the
staff report for the Article IV consultation. The key changes are shown in the attached tables.
The information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal, though stronger projected
unit labor cost growth heightens concerns about eroding competitiveness going forward.
1.
Economic growth in 2007 remains the same as previous estimates but the
composition of growth has changed. Real GDP growth for 2007 is estimated at 4 percent.
Although still the main driver of growth, domestic demand growth is now lower because of
weaker investment resulting from a decline in residential construction and lower growth in
other investment components. Net external demand has improved relative to previous
estimates due to a deceleration of import growth.
2.
Both the authorities and staff have revised their forecasts in view of the further
deterioration of the global outlook. The authorities now project real GDP growth for
2008–09 at 3.6 percent, 0.4 percentage points lower than previous estimates. The main
factors behind this downward adjustment are slower export growth and weaker domestic
demand reflecting an expected tightening of credit conditions and the dampening effect of
higher inflation on real disposable income and consumption. Staff sees real GDP growth in
2008–09 lower than the authorities, at 3.3 percent, as a result of a less favorable external
environment. The staff projections in this supplement are lower than in the World Economic
Outlook because of a carry-forward of the lower investment evident in the revised figures for
2007. The current account deficit is, however, projected to improve relative to staff’s
previous estimates due to lower import growth.
3.
The authorities do not expect the fiscal outturn to be much different from their
baseline scenario. The 2007 general government deficit outturn is now estimated at
2.8 percent of GDP, 0.1 percent of GDP higher than previous estimates. For 2008–10, the
authorities’ envisaged deficit adjustment path has remained broadly unchanged, with

2

however a slightly different composition of revenue and expenditure. Staff projects the
general government deficit for 2008–10 to be higher than officially targeted by
0.1–0.4 percent of GDP mainly because of lower economic growth.
4.
Inflation has continued to accelerate in recent months and the inflation outlook
in 2008 is more negative than previously forecast. Inflation was 4.4 percent in March on a
year-on-year basis partly boosted by higher food prices. Given the rising inflationary
pressures during the first months of 2008 and higher food and oil prices, staff have revised up
their inflation forecast for 2008 from 3.3 percent to 3.7 percent. Inflation in 2009 is expected
to decline as carryover effects wane. Unit labor cost growth is expected to pick up in 2008 to
5.5 percent and, although declining, remain high in 2009.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April 30, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with Greece
On April, 18, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Greece.1
Background
The Greek economy has been buoyant for several years, supported by solid gains in
employment, substantial real wage increases, low interest rates, and rapid credit expansion. In
2007, real GDP rose by an estimated 4 percent driven by domestic demand, but the external
sector was a drag on growth.2 After peaking in 2004, the fiscal deficit fell sharply to under
3 percent of GDP in 2006 and was contained at 2.8 percent of GDP in 2007 despite several
unexpected one-off expenditures amounting to about 1 percent of GDP. Nevertheless, the
level of government debt, at 94 percent of GDP, remains high. Private sector credit has risen
rapidly but household indebtedness is still relatively low. Inflationary pressures and rising labor
costs have resulted in a steady deterioration in competitiveness, contributing to a large current
account deficit of 13.9 percent of GDP.
Economic growth is expected to moderate in the near term but should remain solid on the back
of continued strong domestic demand. However, the risks to the outlook are tilted to the
downside. In the near term, risks stem from a weaker external environment and a potential
liquidity squeeze of banks. Over the longer term, a persistent loss of competitiveness raises
the risk of a prolonged period of slow growth.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2

A revision of the national accounts data was completed recently, raising the level of output in
2000 by 9.6 percent.

2
The authorities are pursuing further fiscal consolidation with the goal of achieving a balanced
budget by 2010. The 2008 budget aims to reduce the general government deficit to 1.6
percent of GDP through ambitious revenue measures. However, the expenditure structure is
set to become more rigid as the elimination of the one-off expenditures incurred in 2007 will be
offset by higher outlays on wages and social transfers. The authorities are proceeding with a
narrowly focused agenda on pension reform, which is nonetheless already drawing
considerable protest.
The banking sector appears to be sound and has thus far remained largely unaffected by the
global financial market turmoil. However, continued rapid credit growth and increasing
presence in southeastern Europe, financed partly by wholesale funding, have increased banks’
exposure to credit, country, and liquidity risks. The Bank of Greece has responded to these
risks by increasing provisioning requirements, seeking a tightening of lending standards, and
stepping up cross-border banking supervision.
The authorities have introduced a number of structural reforms to improve labor and product
markets. These include easing overtime restrictions, reducing disincentives to accept
employment, a new bankruptcy code, an updated company law, and simplified licensing of
manufacturing businesses. More initiatives are in the works including reducing administrative
burdens and improving the quality of services provision. Nevertheless, the Greek labor market
is relatively rigid by international comparison and competition in product markets remains a
challenge.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the extended period of strong performance of the Greek
economy, which has significantly narrowed the gap in real per capita income between Greece
and the EU-15. Directors considered that, while economic prospects still appear relatively
strong in the near term, risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside, given the weaker
external environment and the deterioration of global financial conditions. Directors also
underscored that a persistent loss of cost competitiveness risks constraining Greece’s growth
in the medium term. Against this background, they encouraged the authorities to build the
social consensus needed to undertake more ambitious medium-term reforms.
Directors observed that the banking system appears sound and has remained unaffected by
the recent financial market turbulence to date. Nevertheless, financial sector vulnerabilities,
including those arising from continued rapid credit growth, rising exposures in southeastern
Europe, the still-high level of nonperforming loans, and possible need to rely on wholesale
funding will require close monitoring. In this context, Directors welcomed the Bank of Greece’s
efforts to strengthen provisioning requirements and lending standards, and called for
upgrading the stress-testing framework. Directors particularly welcomed steps to strengthen
cross-border banking supervision in cooperation with other supervisors in southeastern
Europe. They also commended the authorities for the adoption of a risk-based approach to
supervision by the new insurance supervisor.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to achieve a balanced budget by 2010, and
considered that further improvements in tax administration and a tighter control over spending
will be necessary to attain this target. Sustained fiscal consolidation thereafter to a surplus
position will be helpful for safeguarding debt sustainability and addressing the prospective
large aging costs. Directors called for the development of a medium-term budget framework to
help guide fiscal strategy and prioritize policy objectives.

3
Improved revenue collection will be a centerpiece of fiscal consolidation in 2008 and beyond.
Directors saw scope for broadening tax reform. Improving tax compliance by simplifying tax
laws and procedures and further intensifying risk-based auditing should be a priority. Directors
also encouraged the authorities to consider phasing out distortionary tax exemptions with a
view to broadening the tax base and simplifying the rate structure.
Directors emphasized the need for further reforms to expenditure management. They
welcomed the steps already taken to increase the transparency and accountability of public
entities and to improve efficiency in the health care system. Additional budget reforms should
include extension of the coverage of the budget, full integration of program-based budgeting
into budget preparation and execution, and introduction of appropriate financial management
information systems.
Directors agreed that comprehensive reform of the social security system will be required to
preserve the long-term sustainability of the public finances taking into account the costs of
population aging. They considered that the authorities’ pension reform agenda will need to be
broadened, with policy proposals based on a full assessment of financing needs and cost
savings. Directors encouraged the authorities to complete and publish detailed projections of
the cost of population aging in accordance with the EU methodologies, and to prepare an
adequately ambitious reform program on this basis.
Directors saw further reforms to product and labor markets as key to sustaining medium-term
growth and strengthening international competitiveness. They welcomed the progress already
made in product market reform, and encouraged the authorities to press ahead with further
measures. Areas for action include further extension of simplified business licensing
procedures, privatization of infrastructure facilities, and strengthened competition in the
network industries and the transport sector. Further initiatives in the labor market should
include reducing the restrictiveness of the employment protection legislation and increasing
the flexibility of the wage setting system. Directors stressed the importance of further steps to
improve the quality of statistical data.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Miranda Xafa, Alternate Executive Director for Greece
April 18, 2008

I would like to express my authorities’ appreciation to Mr. Banerjee, the mission chief, and
his able team for the fruitful discussions they have had during this year’s Article IV
consultation and for their excellent report. The authorities broadly agree with staff’s analysis
and recommendations, including on the challenges in the years ahead.
The policy setting
1. Three years ago, during the 2004 Article IV consultation, staff noted that the strong growth
of the Greek economy was partly due to a favorable external environment and to exceptional
factors, including joining the Euro-area and hosting of the 2004 Olympic Games. They
expressed concern that growth would decline as the impact of these factors waned. Luckily
this concern – which was shared by the authorities – did not materialize. Growth became
more sustainable in the past three years through a shift away from debt-financed
expansionary fiscal policy toward supply-side reforms aimed at increasing productivity and
potential growth. GDP growth averaged 4 percent in 2005-07, led by strong exports and
buoyant business fixed investment. Private investment has been supported by lower corporate
tax rates, investment incentives, public-private partnerships, and an improvement in the
business climate. These policies succeeded in sustaining the growth momentum and reducing
unemployment despite substantial fiscal tightening.
2. The December 2007 update of the Stability and Growth Program projected robust GDP
growth of 4 percent to be sustained in 2008-09. However, new challenges have arisen from
the credit crunch that has impacted financial stability and growth globally. Recognizing the
negative spillovers from a weaker external environment and soaring commodity prices, the
official estimate of GDP growth was revised to 3.6 percent in 2008 and 2009, and the
inflation forecast for 2008 was raised to 3.5 percent from 2.8 percent previously. These
revised projections are marginally less pessimistic than those presented in the Staff
Supplement, reflecting a somewhat more buoyant external environment.
Fiscal policy
3. Fiscal consolidation advanced significantly in 2006-07, bringing the general government
deficit below the 3 percent of GDP threshold, in line with the commitment under the EU
Excessive Deficit Procedure. This was achieved through spending restraint and improved tax
administration, while personal and corporate tax rates were cut. Following a cut in the
corporate tax rate to 25 percent, marginal tax rates on personal income – especially for
middle incomes – are being reduced over two years in 2008-09. Indirect tax revenues rose

2
faster than GDP in 2007, providing evidence that measures to combat tax evasion are
working.
4. Despite the weaker growth outlook, the fiscal targets for 2008 have not been revised as the
authorities see no room for countercyclical easing. The deficit is budgeted to decline to
1.6 percent of GDP in 2008, in line with the Government’s objective of achieving a balanced
budget by 2010. 1 On a cyclically adjusted basis the deficit is budgeted to decline to
2.5 percent of GDP in 2008, down from 3.5 percent in 2007 and 3.3 percent in 2006, i.e. by a
cumulative total of 0.8 percent of GDP in 2006-08. The adjustment effort is larger than
suggested by these figures as the budget no longer relies on one-off revenue measures, while
the 2007 budget includes emergency assistance of 0.5 percent of GDP following last
summer’s wildfires. Moreover, the 2008 cyclical component is currently being revised to
reflect the downward revision of GDP growth projections. Efforts to restrain expenditure in
2008 have been supported by new legislation governing fiscal audits and controls. So far,
controls only referred to the compliance of public spending with the Budget Law. Under the
new system, a General Directorate for Fiscal Audits is established along with internal audit
units within Ministries, local authorities and public entities with a budget exceeding
€3 million. The Directorate is expected to propose corrective measures whenever necessary
to keep total spending in line with the Budget. Improved budgetary procedures, including
program-based budgeting, are expected to improve the transparency, efficiency and control
of public expenditure in the medium term.
5. On the revenue side, property taxes are being reformed to broaden the tax base, and new
measures were adopted to fight tax evasion. Under a new law adopted last January, several
property levies are being merged into a single property tax of 0.1 percent payable annually.
To clamp down on tax evasion in fuel oils, the special consumption tax on motor fuel was
extended to heating oil, with consumers eligible for a full refund of the additional tax. A
National Committee for tackling tax evasion has been established, consisting of
representatives of the social partners and political parties in Parliament. The Committee will
submit proposals for measures to improve tax compliance and provide better service to
taxpayers. In parallel, staff recommendations for broadening the tax base (Selected Issues
paper II) will be examined by the newly-established Tax Analysis Unit at the Ministry of
Economy and Finance and a proposal will be submitted to the Minister.
All ratios are calculated on the basis of revised GDP figures, which exceed the old series by
almost 10 percent. The revised GDP series was made possible by new primary sources of
information that resulted in significant upward revisions of output in the construction and
services sectors. Efforts to strengthen national account statistics are ongoing, as newlyintroduced surveys are regularly conducted. In future, re-benchmarking will be undertaken
on a regular basis to avoid large revisions.

Public debt
6. Fiscal consolidation has contributed to a decline in the public debt burden from 98.6
percent of GDP in 2004 to 94.5 percent in 2007. Strong growth, privatization revenue and
primary surpluses contributed to the decline, although the assumption of liabilities of the
broader public sector added to the debt burden. Going forward, it is critical that public
enterprises and entities face harder budget constraints. Some of these continue to operate
while generating losses and accumulating arrears or defaulting on government-guaranteed
debt. A law was already passed in November 2005 that aims to increase the commercial
orientation of public enterprises and streamline their operations to reduce their reliance on
debt guarantees and budget transfers. The government also is planning to introduce greater
transparency and accountability in the operations and finances of local governments, public
hospitals and pension funds.
Pension reform
7. A pension reform law was approved by Parliament at end-March, triggering a wave of
protests. The reform aims at streamlining the administration of the pension system and
contributing to its long-term sustainability. The state-run, PAYG pension system suffers both
from extreme fragmentation and from a rising dependency ratio due to population aging. The
reform provides for a mega-merger of more than 100 separate funds into 13 main or
supplementary funds. While the statutory age of 65 for men and women remains unchanged,
the reform of early retirement provisions, along with incentives to prolong working life,
would tend to move the average effective retirement age, currently at 61, closer to the
statutory age of 65. The reform is expected to produce savings from both administrative costs
and from changes in early retirement provisions. Savings also will accrue from the
imposition of a limit on supplementary pensions to 20 percent of pensionable earnings. The
main impact of these measures will be felt from 2013, when the transition periods start
expiring. Total savings from the reform during the first two years are officially estimated at
some €2 billion, of which €1.5 billion from administrative cost savings and the rest from
changes in early retirement provisions and supplementary pensions, compared with pension
expenditures currently amounting to €24 billion annually (12.5 percent of GDP). The bulk of
administrative savings would accrue from the pooling of pension fund reserves into a single
asset management entity. Greater transparency and accountability would be introduced by a
committee that will audit and control the pension funds.
8. A key provision of the pension reform law is the creation of an intergenerational Social
Solidarity Fund to safeguard the pensions of future generations. The Fund’s resources will be
derived from several annual revenue streams: 10 percent of privatization revenue, 4 percent
of VAT revenues, and 10 percent of the earmarked taxes accruing to existing pension funds.
In its first year of operation in 2009, the fund is expected to collect about €900 million in
revenues (0.3 percent of GDP).

Competitiveness and the external sector
9. Greek exports have performed well in recent years, despite a persistently high inflation
differential with the Euro area that suggests declining price competitiveness. As highlighted
in the Selected Issues paper I, this strong performance reflects quality upgrades, export
specialization in high value-added services, and geographical orientation toward the fastgrowing Balkan markets. The focus on the Balkans – and Eastern Europe more broadly – has
made Greece one of the EU countries that have benefited the most from the transition in that
region and from the entry of Bulgaria and Romania into the EU in 2007. Greece’s early
economic and financial links with this fast-growing region through trade and direct
investment are thus paying off. Nevertheless, there is a clear risk that the ongoing financial
turbulence could slow externally-funded credit expansion and growth in the region, adversely
affecting Greece through both trade and financial links.
10. The widening of the current account deficit over the past decade is largely explained by
factors other than competitiveness. As Greece liberalized its financial system later than other
euro area countries, the demand stimulus from consumption smoothing coincided with the
stimulus from interest rate convergence in the run-up to EMU and from subsequent ECB
easing. The resulting surge in investment was accompanied by a fall in the savings ratio, as
financial liberalization reduced precautionary savings. Consumer and housing credit became
readily available at constantly falling rates, giving a big boost to domestic demand. As this
process winds down, the current account deficit will narrow. There is little policy makers can
do to correct the deficit besides continuing the fiscal consolidation path and implementing
supply-side reforms to raise productivity. The authorities share the staff’s view that structural
reforms have an important role to play in safeguarding competitiveness and raising potential
growth. To this end, they are already implementing reforms to strengthen competition in
product markets, facilitate the spread of ICT, improve the business climate, and promote
flexibility in labor markets. Further improvements in these areas remain essential to
accelerate real convergence.
Financial sector issues
11. Greek banks remained well-capitalized and highly profitable in 2007, suggesting that the
impact of the financial market turmoil has so far been minimal. Regulatory capital to riskweighted assets amounted to 12.7 percent at end-2007, well above the required minimum,
while ROE rose to 14.8 percent in 2007 from 12.8 percent in 2006. The Bank of Greece
calculates the total losses due to the turmoil at 0.7 percent of capital, of which 0.3 percent
derived from revaluation of securities directly affected from the turmoil and 0.4 percent from
higher funding costs. These modest losses reflect the negligible exposure of Greek banks to
the U.S. subprime mortgage sector, and the fact that Greek banks had taken advantage of
benign financial market conditions prior to the crisis to pre-fund their operations until mid2008. Rapid credit growth and persistently high NPLs led to increased write-offs and

5
improved risk monitoring by banks as they transition from Basel I to Basel II. As a result,
NPLs were reduced from 5.4 percent of total loans at end-2006 to 4.5 percent at end-2007.
12. Recognizing that funding and roll-over risk could become elevated if the crisis were
prolonged, the BoG conducted stress tests specifically designed to address liquidity concerns.
Banks were asked to calculate their Liquid Assets Ratios (LAR) for mid-2008 on the
assumption that their business expansion plans were fully implemented. In the event this ratio
fell below 20 percent under various stress scenaria, they were given the option of scaling
back their credit expansion or raising additional funding to restore the required minimum
LAR. Despite the grid lock in securitization markets, Greek banks have so far made very
limited use of the ECB discount window to raise funding using mortgage-backed securities
as collateral. Regarding the exposure of Greek banks operating in the Balkans, efforts
underway to take into account the correlation of FX and credit risk, as suggested by staff, are
complicated by lack of data.
