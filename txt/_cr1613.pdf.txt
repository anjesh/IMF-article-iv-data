IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Slovak Republic

On January 11, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Slovak Republic.
Slovakia remains among Europe’s stronger economies, with growth continuing to pick up in
2015, driven by strong domestic demand. A push to spend expiring EU funds has underpinned
rising investment while job creation and real wage growth have supported private consumption.
Unemployment has fallen significantly since 2013, but is still around 11 percent overall, and is
much higher for the long-term unemployed, youth, and women. Regional disparities also remain
substantial. The fiscal deficit has held steady between 2.5 and 3 percent of GDP in recent years,
and while public debt is manageable and easily financed, it is not far below domestic debt brake
thresholds. The banking sector has sound capital and liquidity buffers and private debt is limited,
but household borrowing has been rising rapidly.
The outlook is favorable with growth of 3–3.5 percent expected through the medium-term,
reflecting sustained domestic demand as well as further contributions from the important export
sector as substantial additional foreign auto sector investment is planned. Although Slovakia
enjoys substantial buffers, external factors present the greatest risks, especially if shocks were to
be transmitted via key trading partners. Negative headline inflation in 2015 is expected to turn
positive in 2016.
Discussions focused on: (i) comprehensive actions to reduce unemployment and sharp regional
disparities; (ii) high-quality fiscal measures to preserve room for maneuver under domestic debt
brakes while funding key priorities; and (iii) macroprudential policies to guard against risks from
rapid household credit growth and steps to promote capital market development.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the Slovak Republic’s solid economic performance, driven by a
strong pickup in domestic demand. Medium term prospects are favorable, particularly in light of
additional foreign investment in the automotive sector, although external factors pose downside
risks. Directors stressed the importance of addressing substantial regional disparities and still
high unemployment, including for the long term jobless, youth, and women.
Directors encouraged the authorities to pursue a comprehensive approach to spur investment and
employment in weaker regions, and to facilitate labor mobility. Policies should focus on
enhancing transportation infrastructure, strengthening the business climate by improving the
legal and procurement systems and governance, and promoting rental housing. Reducing the tax
wedge, especially for low wage or part time workers, enhancing education and training, and
bolstering the effectiveness of labor market policies, would encourage hiring, allay rising skill
shortages, and promote labor force participation. Gradual diversification of production and
export markets would also support long term growth prospects.
Directors commended the authorities’ commitment to fiscal sustainability. They called for high
quality and growth friendly fiscal consolidation over the medium term to ensure room for policy
maneuver under domestic debt rules and address challenges related to population aging, while
also tackling regional disparities and labor market challenges. In this regard, Directors
encouraged the authorities to persevere with efforts to strengthen revenue collection particularly
for value added and corporate income taxes, broaden the tax base including through a market
value based property tax, and achieve spending efficiencies, especially in the health sector.
While Directors acknowledged the important policy discipline provided by the Fiscal
Responsibility Act (FRA), there was support for revisiting some aspects of the framework over
time with a view to lessen potential negative economic effects without undermining discipline.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ continued prudent supervision of the financial system in the
context of the Single Supervisory Mechanism. Although the banking sector is sound and private
sector leverage is limited, rapid household credit growth calls for close monitoring. Directors
welcomed the National Bank of Slovakia’s ongoing initiatives in this area, and encouraged the
authorities to strengthen macroprudential measures, and to consider a positive counter cyclical
capital buffer should strong credit growth continue and broaden to the corporate sector. They
welcomed efforts to facilitate non-bank financing for firms and encouraged greater regional
integration.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
December 22, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context. The shift toward domestic demand-led growth in Slovakia intensified in 2015,
with output forecast to expand by more than 3 percent. Stepped-up use of EU funds is
supporting investment, while job growth and real wage gains are fueling private
consumption. Although Slovakia enjoys substantial buffers, external factors present the
greatest risks to the largely positive outlook, especially if shocks were to be transmitted
to the important export sector via key trading partners.
Boosting investment and employment. Labor market conditions have been improving,
but high unemployment, especially long-term and among youth and women, as well as
sharp regional disparities, remain key challenges. Comprehensive actions are needed to
build infrastructure in lagging regions, enhance the business climate, improve incentives
for working and hiring, and strengthen education and training amid skill shortages.
High-quality fiscal measures. Further fiscal adjustment is needed to ensure room for
policy maneuver under domestic debt brakes, while also funding key priorities. Policies
should focus on implementing high-quality measures to enhance revenue collection,
broaden the tax base, and achieve spending efficiencies.
Guarding against credit growth risks. The banking sector has sound capital and
liquidity buffers, and household debt remains limited. Nonetheless, rapid credit growth
among households calls for further strengthening of macroprudential measures and a
vigilant approach should fast credit expansion continue and broaden.

SLOVAK REPUBLIC

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. Solid Domestic Demand-Driven Growth
1.
Growth is strengthening, driven by
domestic demand (Figure 1 and Table 1). A dynamic
export sector made Slovakia one of the fastest
growing economies in Europe after the crisis, and
domestic demand has now picked up. A concerted
push to spend expiring EU funds has boosted public
investment, while accommodative ECB policies and
improving lending conditions have supported a
recovery in private investment. Job creation and real
wage growth have fueled private consumption. Export
growth remains strong, but imports have risen even
faster.
2.
The labor market is on the mend (Figure 2).
Job creation has accelerated and unemployment has
fallen, but regional disparities remain large, and skills
shortages are starting to put pressure on wages. Youth
and long-term unemployment, albeit declining, remain
high, and women’s labor force participation continues
to be low.

prices and declining administered energy prices, while
core inflation has hovered just below 0.5 percent.
Inflation expectations, however, remain well-anchored, and prices are forecast to rise as the output
gap closes. Risks from deflation remain low due to robust wage growth and limited leverage.

4.
The 2015 fiscal target is likely to be missed by a small amount (Figure 3, Tables 2–3).
Solid GDP growth and tax administration improvements have boosted revenue, and interest costs
remain low amidst ECB quantitative easing (QE). Nonetheless, the budget deficit is likely to
overshoot the 2015 target (2.5 percent of GDP) by a small amount (0.2 percent of GDP) owing to
spending overruns for wages, intermediate consumption, and healthcare, as well as sizeable EU
funds corrections. With the sale of state shares in Slovak Telekom in May (about 1 percent of GDP),
government debt is expected to decline to around 53 percent of GDP, keeping it just below strict
Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) debt brakes. Amid favorable market conditions, the authorities have
further lengthened the maturity of public debt, although the share of non-resident holdings remains
relatively high (Annex III).

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SLOVAK REPUBLIC

5.
The external position is broadly in line with fundamentals (Figures 4–6, Table 4, Box 1,
and Annex IV). With solid export performance, Slovakia’s market shares have continued to rise, but
buoyant domestic demand has boosted imports. The narrowing of the trade surplus has moved the
current account into a small deficit. External debt, which rose in recent years partly due to increases
in non-resident holdings of government debt, has stabilized. Overall, the real exchange rate is
assessed to be broadly in line with fundamentals.
6.
Household credit growth remains brisk despite macroprudential measures (Figure 7
and Table 5). Recent macroprudential recommendations by the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS)
have not slowed household credit growth, which is expanding by about 12 percent year-on-year,
although household debt remains low compared to peers. Corporate loans have picked up as
lending standards and interest rates have eased. Non-performing loans (NPLs) have increased in line
with total loan growth, leaving the low NPL ratio roughly stable; impaired assets are wellprovisioned on average. Bank profitability and capital buffers remain sound.
7.
The recent migration crisis has had limited impact on Slovakia. Relatively few refugees
have passed through or stayed in the country, perhaps reflecting low per-capita income and
benefits compared to other EU destinations. Nonetheless, the authorities have objected strongly to
the EU quota system, which would place around 1,000 migrants in the country. Slovakia has
allocated resources to help secure the EU’s external border and provide aid to refugees abroad.

B. Outlook and Risks
8.
Growth is expected to gather momentum, driven by new automotive investment.
Growth should accelerate from 3.4 percent this year to 3.6 percent in 2016 (closing the output gap),
and will be a little more than 3 percent over the longer term, generally in line with potential growth.
Despite lower public investment as EU funds drawings return to more normal levels, accommodative
monetary and credit conditions, weaker oil prices, and tightening capacity utilization should support
private investment. In addition, a fourth carmaker (Jaguar Land Rover) plans to invest almost
2 percent of GDP over 2016–17 in a new plant that would raise car production by one-third,
boosting net exports from 2018. Finally, improving labor market conditions and real wage growth
are likely to foster private consumption.
9.
A number of buffers help counter vulnerabilities, primarily to external shocks (Risk
Assessment Matrix, Annex I). A sound and liquid banking sector, low private sector leverage, and
limited public debt bolster resilience to shocks. If, however, growth were to falter among key trading
partners such as Germany—whether due to weakness in the euro area itself, a slowdown in China or
other emerging market economies, or tensions in Russia and Ukraine—Slovakia’s important export
sector would be affected, lowering growth and leading to an increase in the public debt ratio. On
the domestic side, rapid household credit growth could lead to financial sector risks, while high
long-term unemployment could erode human capital, undermine growth, and exacerbate
demographic challenges. The consequences of Volkswagen’s emissions scandal remain uncertain
but they represent an important downside risk given substantial operations in Slovakia (Box 2).

SLOVAK REPUBLIC

Box 1. External Assessment
Slovakia’s real exchange rate appears broadly in line
with fundamentals. The EBA-Lite current account model
suggests a marginal undervaluation of the real effective
exchange rate (REER) (4 percent). In contrast, the EBA-Lite
REER model seems a poor fit for Slovakia—the panel
estimations on which it is based do not capture the
dynamics of a catching-up economy—and points to a large
overvaluation (about 30 percent) despite solid trade
surpluses and growing export market shares. More tailored
REER analysis using a panel of peer transition economies
confirms limited undervaluation (7 percent).

Analysis suggests Slovakia’s policies are generally
appropriate. The small policy gap from the EBA-Lite model (0.7 percent) indicates that Slovakia’s fiscal,
external and financial policies are close to equilibrium, but the model estimates a current account norm of
negative 2.5 percent of GDP. The actual current account is broadly in balance, but the large negative errors
and omissions, possibly reflecting an overstatement of export prices, may blur the real picture. While the
norm might be consistent with Slovakia still catching up with more advanced economies, a current account
deficit would imply growing stress on the country’s net international investment and debt positions, and
hence on its external financing requirements—a risk flagged in the public sector debt sustainability analysis.

Capital and financial account. The downward trend in FDI inflows is estimated to have bottomed out in
2015, with a recovery projected in 2016–17, reflecting the planned investment of a fourth car maker. After a
period of exceptionally large inflows, portfolio investment declined in 2014–15, partly due to lower net
borrowing from abroad by the government. Net flows are projected to gradually converge to balance.
Foreign asset and liability position. External debt is forecast to reach 93 percent of GDP in 2015, while the
net international investment position would stabilize at negative 70 percent. External vulnerabilities are
mitigated by the long maturities of external debt and the large share of FDI among liabilities. Small current
account surpluses are nonetheless appropriate in the medium term given the negative net international
investment position.

Box 2. Slovakia’s Automotive Sector and Trade Profile
The automotive sector plays a crucial role in Slovakia’s economy. The automotive sector grew out of
large FDI inflows, attracted by competitive labor costs and a strategic location in the EU and at the heart of
Europe. The adoption of the euro in 2009 reduced exchange rate risk, thus providing an additional incentive.
The automotive industry accounts for 43 percent of Slovakia’s total industrial production, and world market
shares for Slovak vehicles have grown in recent years. The three car producers (Volkswagen, PSA PeugeotCitroën, and Kia) employ 80,000 workers; taking into account suppliers boosts auto industry employment to
200,000 (about 9 percent of total employment). In 2014, car production was just under 1 million vehicles,
making Slovakia the world’s largest per capita car producer. Volkswagen accounts for about 40 percent of
automobile production, while PSA Peugeot-Citroën and Kia have a share of 30 percent each. The core
automotive industry generates 17 percent of Slovakia’s gross value added, while suppliers account for an
additional 22 percent, suggesting potentially significant spillovers within the economy.

Slovakia’s trade is concentrated among relatively few countries. Five countries account for about
50 percent of total nominal exports: Germany (22 percent), Czech Republic (13 percent), Poland (8 percent),
Austria and Hungary (6 percent each). Similar concentration can be observed on the import side with
Germany ranking first (15 percent), followed by the Czech Republic (10 percent), and China (8 percent). If
only the car industry is considered, almost all exports are shipped to Europe, with some re-routed to Asia
and other markets via Germany. However, as an example, Slovakia’s share of domestic value added
consumed by China remains relatively low (around 2 percent).
Participation in global value chains (GVCs) has fostered convergence, but it also poses risks.
Specialization in more downstream stages of GVCs and in a few specific industries makes Slovakia
vulnerable to global market conditions.1/ For instance, it is estimated that a 10 percent fall in car exports
would shave 0.3-0.7 percentage points from GDP growth. Strong cost competition from neighboring
countries adds to the challenges. To reduce risks, Slovakia might try to move up GVCs while also seeking
gradually to diversify its production and trade partners, including by encouraging FDI from other countries
and in other sectors. To this end, improving the business environment, fostering R&D through greater
development of clusters, and upgrading skills and physical infrastructure are essential, while improving labor
market efficiency (both in terms of flexibility and mobility) would help the economy adjust more rapidly to
external shocks.

“German-Central European Supply Chain-Cluster Report,” IMF Country Report

There are as yet no signs of broad changes in economic policy direction ahead of March 2016
parliamentary elections, although relatively modest “social packages” of spending and tax measures
have been introduced.
Authorities’ views
10.
The authorities broadly agreed on the outlook and risks. They expect similarly solid
growth through the medium term, but treat the Jaguar Land Rover investment as a further upside
risk in their autumn forecasts, and foresee a somewhat faster decline in unemployment. They agree
on the real exchange rate being in line with fundamentals. Direct spillovers from a slowdown in
China or other emerging markets would likely be small, but indirect effects via major trading
partners could be more sizeable. While acknowledging risks associated with the Volkswagen
emissions scandal, high productivity at the company’s relatively new Slovak plants is viewed as an
important mitigating factor. The NBS stands ready to tighten macroprudential policies if needed
(see below). The authorities viewed the EU quota system as unworkable given migrants’ strong
desire to reach wealthier destination countries, but have provided temporary housing to migrants
awaiting asylum processing in Austria.

PROMOTING BROAD-BASED AND JOB-RICH GROWTH
Growth is strengthening and labor market conditions are improving. Nonetheless, high unemployment,
especially long-term and among youth and women, as well as sharp regional differences remain key
challenges. Spurring job-rich growth in lagging regions while addressing labor market exclusion and
long-term demographic challenges calls for a comprehensive approach focused on accelerating
infrastructure investment, lowering the tax wedge, orienting education toward workforce requirements,
strengthening active labor market policies (ALMPs), and improving the business climate.

Strong exports have powered Slovakia’s economy, but left some regions behind.
Despite Slovakia’s rapid economic convergence, regional disparities in terms of income and
employment remain among the largest in the EU. Jobs are mostly created in the wealthiest regions,
especially in or near Bratislava, where unemployment is low. Poor infrastructure discourages
investment and job creation in less dynamic areas, and regional disparities are aggravated by low
labor mobility, owing in part to high home-ownership and underdeveloped rental markets.

allowances, and easing regulations that discourage property owners from renting), could
promote labor mobility.

Economic disincentives help explain high
youth unemployment in Slovakia. While growth
has a powerful effect—indeed, youth
unemployment in Slovakia has clearly fallen as
growth has picked up in recent years—panelbased and country-specific analysis also highlight
the labor tax wedge, which has increased over the
past ten years, as an important factor
contributing to youth unemployment in Slovakia.
The gross replacement rate (GRR) also stands out
and may reflect similar effects to the extent that
high social contributions push up the GRR.1/
These results reinforce the general arguments for
reducing the relatively high tax wedge for lowincome and low-skill workers.2/

Youth unemployment remains a key concern
amidst improving labor market conditions.
Even though overall unemployment is falling
toward the EU average, more than two-thirds of
the young population remains excluded from the
job market, with the share of young people not in
education, employment, or training high relative
to EU peers. This suggests that for the young, skill
mismatches and a poor school-to-work transition
may exacerbate broader labor market challenges
(e.g., a high tax wedge), and not getting off to a
good career start can have a lasting impact on
individuals (e.g., diminished skills and attachment
to the workforce) and potential growth of the
economy.

temporary workers; total ALMP expenditure per unemployed; and ALMP spending on training,

Better education and training initiatives
should help address specific challenges faced
by new workforce entrants. Legislation has
sought to improve exchanges between schools and employers, including to tailor curriculums and vocational
training to business needs, and importantly, a dual system for vocational education and practical training
was launched in September 2015. EU-funded schemes have also helped create temporarily subsidized jobs
for 700 young job-seekers (slightly more than 1.2 percent of total youth unemployment).



Lowering the labor tax wedge, especially for lowwage or part-time workers, would foster labor
force participation and help reduce disincentives
to hiring. In this spirit, the reduction in the health
contribution allowance to offset the impact of the
minimum wage increase in early 2015 was
welcome.



Comparatively low levels of active labor market policy (ALMP) spending should be raised and
sustained, and the planned evaluation of the various ALMPs should be completed to help
maximize effectiveness.



Additional and more affordable childcare could improve female labor force participation.

Authorities’ views
14.
The authorities agreed that regional disparities, skill mismatches, and especially high
long-term unemployment, which can erode skills and undermine potential growth, are key
challenges. The government is taking or considering action in a number of areas:


Infrastructure and regional disparities. Stepped-up use of EU Funds is helping improve
infrastructure and some incentives are being offered for investment in weaker regions. Initiatives
to promote growth of the very limited rental housing market may be considered in the context
of a third social package.



Education and training. Financial incentives are being used to align better education and training
with labor market needs; the recently launched dual system for vocational education will be
scaled up in future years, and new curricula more relevant for potential jobs are being prepared;
and temporary subsidies are being provided for jobs for unemployed young people. Efforts are
also being made to support integration of marginalized communities.



Public Employment Service (PES) and ALMPs. The government is committed to reform the PES
and improve ALMP effectiveness. Steps have been taken to realize synergies through
centralization of PES activities and reallocation of employees toward high need areas to
strengthen the quality and efficiency of services. Reforms are to be implemented by 2020.



Labor taxes. In November 2013, the government introduced a twelve month exemption from
social security contributions for long-term unemployed returning to work. In January 2015, a
reduction in health contributions for low-paid workers was adopted, which helped offset the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

SLOVAK REPUBLIC

impact of an increase in the minimum wage. The authorities felt both measures have supported
the recent labor market upswing.


Female labor force participation. Kindergarten capacity is being expanded and the childcare
allowance has been increased modestly.

The authorities, however, cautioned that cultural and other non-economic factors meant near-term
progress was likely to be limited in areas such as labor mobility, female labor force participation, and
integration of marginalized groups.
15.
The government outlined a broad strategy to improve the business climate. Initiatives
are underway to assist development of start-ups, including a streamlined process for registration of
public companies. Steps have been taken to strengthen contract enforcement through
establishment of electronic registries of insolvent entities and disqualified persons. Use of an
electronic marketplace for selected public procurements is now mandatory, as is disclosure of
beneficial owners for companies interested in public procurement. A number of amendments have
been passed to speed up the judicial process and promote court specialization.

ENSURING HIGH QUALITY FISCAL CONSOLIDATION
After a substantial narrowing of fiscal imbalances through 2013 to exit the EU’s Excessive Deficit
Procedure (EDP), fiscal consolidation progress has petered out. While economic conditions could argue
for a supportive fiscal stance, other factors and especially the need for policy maneuver under FRA debt
brakes point to the need for fiscal adjustment over the medium term. Broadening the tax base,
enhancing revenue collection, and achieving spending efficiencies would help secure fiscal adjustment
while funding key priorities and allowing for lower taxes on factors of production.
16.
Institutional and structural factors point to the need for resuming fiscal consolidation.
After four year of consolidation through 2013, which culminated in EDP exit, fiscal policy has been
broadly neutral or even somewhat expansionary, with the deficit remaining between 2½ and
3 percent of GDP. Still high unemployment, large infrastructure needs, and subdued inflation could
argue for a supportive fiscal stance, and borrowing conditions are favorable. However, the negative
output gap is closing rapidly. In addition, for Slovakia, a prudent public debt ratio is likely to be
lower than the current level (Box 4). Moreover, to allow fiscal policy to play a counter-cyclical role—
crucial for a small open economy in a monetary union—a debt ratio safely below binding FRA debt
brakes is necessary, and the debt brakes will begin falling in 2018, eroding already narrow fiscal
space. Finally, lower debt is warranted in light of long-term fiscal challenges from one of the
steepest population aging rates in Europe—challenges that have been aggravated by repeated
opening of the private pension pillar.

Box 4. Should The Fiscal Responsibility Act Be Reformed? 1/
To shore up budget credibility, Slovakia adopted the FRA in 2011. The framework includes rules to
strengthen budget discipline, enhance accountability, and foster transparency.
Does the FRA provide a good fiscal rule?
In principle, debt rules can help improve countries’ fiscal discipline. However, they may heighten procyclicality and hamper the quality of fiscal adjustment when sanctions are substantial, as is the case for the
FRA. In order to allow automatic stabilizers to operate and avoid pro-cyclical sanctions, debt levels need to
be kept well below the thresholds.

The government submits to the Parliament a proposal of measures for debt reduction and the wages of

The Ministry of Finance reduces current year state budget expenditure by 3 percent (with specified exemptions such
as interest payments, EU funds, co-financing and EU budget contributions) while restrictions apply to the release of
funds from the reserves of the government and the Prime Minister. If the debt level exceeds this threshold for
consecutive years, the reduction happens only in the first year. In addition, the government must submit to the
parliament a general government budget for the subsequent year that does not increase the nominal expenditure
level (with previously mentioned specified exemptions); it applies to local governments as well.

1/ Starting in 2018, the debt ceilings will be gradually reduced by one percentage point of GDP each year to reach 40-50 percent of GDP by 2027.

Are FRA debt brakes reasonable?
Unfortunately, there is no clear-cut answer. Empirical evidence shows that the relationship between debt and
growth may be non-linear, suggesting country-specific thresholds beyond which negative effects kick in. For
Slovakia, which lacks independent monetary policy as a euro area member but also shares some
characteristics of an emerging economy, a prudent public debt ratio is likely to be below 50 percent of GDP.
Two additional considerations support this view: (i) despite one of the lowest debt-to-GDP ratios in the EU
and very narrow interest spreads, interest payments absorb about 5 percent of total revenue, which is
broadly in line with the EU average and reflects a relatively low level of revenue-to-GDP; (ii) given limited
absorption capacity of domestic markets, the share of government debt held by non-residents has steadily
risen, thereby increasing vulnerability to sudden stops.
Should the debt brakes be on a gross or a net basis?
In principle, gross debt should be tracked separately from government assets since sharp swings in prices
can distort underlying debt developments. Nonetheless, defining debt brakes on a gross basis may unduly
constrain a country’s debt management.

The 2016–18 budget plan sets ambitious fiscal targets to achieve a sharp adjustment
and will be challenging to implement. The government targets deficits of 1.9 percent of GDP in
2016 and 0.4 percent of GDP in 2017 (thereby reaching the EU medium-term objective (MTO) of a
structural deficit of 0.5 percent of GDP), and overall balance in 2018. The 2016 budget contains a
number of deficit-increasing measures as part of social packages such as a reduction of the VAT rate
on basic foodstuffs from 20 to 10 percent, gas price reimbursements for households, wage increases
for some public sector employees and healthcare staff, and increases in maternity benefits and
childcare allowances. Given that offsetting spending cuts, largely in government consumption, have
not been specified in great detail, staff’s baseline estimate is for a 2016 deficit of around 2.2 percent
of GDP. Further negative risks stem from a possible third social package (to be specified in
December and implemented if the current governing party remains in power), potential additional
EU funds corrections, or other outlays (e.g., there is significant interest in a PPP road project which
could entail initial costs). Under staff’s no-policy change baseline scenario (measures to meet the
2017 and 2018 targets are still to be specified and thus are not reflected), the deficit would fall
below 2 percent of GDP and the debt-to-GDP ratio would drop below 50 percent by 2020. A fiscal
adjustment path broadly in line with EU requirements (0.5 percent of GDP annual improvement in
the structural balance), and hence smoother than the one envisaged by the authorities, could be
preferable in that it would have a lower impact on near-term growth while still putting the debt ratio
on a safe downward trend, though this would imply postponing MTO achievement by two years.

High-quality and growth-friendly fiscal consolidation would call for:
Enhancing tax compliance. Slovakia has one of the largest VAT gaps in Europe and corporate
income tax (CIT) compliance could also be strengthened. Building on good VAT collection
progress in recent years, a one percentage point improvement in the effective VAT rate could
yield 0.5 percent of GDP. It will be important to minimize risks from the reduced VAT rate on
basic foodstuffs. As part of efforts to strengthen tax administration, plans to merge the tax,
customs, and social security agencies should be sped up.

Rebalancing the tax mix. Slovakia’s current tax
structure is distortive, with a comparatively high
reliance on social security contributions (SSCs).
The average tax wedge as well as the SSC share
is higher in Slovakia than the OECD average.
Although the CIT rate compares favorably with
other OECD countries, it is the highest among
the Visegrad countries. To preserve
competitiveness and foster job creation,
Slovakia should shift from labor and corporate
taxes toward the less distortive revenue sources

Funding priorities. The above-mentioned measures could secure needed fiscal adjustment while
still funding key spending priorities. In particular, Slovakia’s low level and quality of capital



Reducing state ownership. Even after full privatization of Slovak Telekom, state ownership
remains sizeable with (direct or indirect) participation in a number of companies, mainly in the
energy sector. Reducing state shareholdings would help lower debt in a growth-friendly way.

19.
Modifications could make the FRA a more growth-friendly fiscal discipline tool. More
gradual adjustment under the FRA would lessen potential pro-cyclicality, escape clauses could be
better tailored to the size and nature of shocks Slovakia might face (e.g., it could take a 2009-size
growth shock to trigger flexibility), and there might be less of a bias toward expenditure cuts.
Although a prudent debt ratio should be maintained, keeping the FRA debt thresholds at the
current levels would help preserve limited fiscal space. Netting out cash balances from government
debt could facilitate debt management, for example through cash buffers or pre-financing when
market conditions are favorable, but should be backed up by clear cash management guidelines.

Authorities’ views
20.
The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to sustainable public finances while
improving living standards.


Budget. The authorities are confident that improvements in tax compliance and expenditure
savings, mainly in healthcare and public administration, will achieve the 2016 fiscal target.
Moreover, early next year the government plans to start a major spending review program
based on value-for-money analysis. The authorities underscored the results achieved so far in
fighting tax evasion and fraud, especially regarding the VAT. In 2016, with a view to improving
VAT collection efficiency, the so-called reverse-charge mechanism will be introduced for the
construction sector, which has one of the highest VAT gaps. The government has also added
30 measures to its action plan to combat tax fraud aimed at enhancing collection.



Market-based real estate tax. Implementing a market-based real estate tax will take time. The
government is preparing reforms to upgrade the cadastre and to collect property transaction
prices, which have not been available since the transaction tax was abolished in 2004.



FRA reform. The benefits of reforms such as netting out cash balances were acknowledged, but
amending the FRA is unlikely in the near term.

stronger macro-prudential stance could be warranted.1 The low interest rate environment associated
with ECB QE calls for closer monitoring of non-bank financial institutions. Steps are needed to deepen
capital markets and improve access to finance.
21.
Accommodative monetary policy and robust domestic demand are fueling already
strong household borrowing. Falling interest margins have led banks to boost lending, especially
mortgages but also consumer loans, to maintain profitability. The increase in household debt, albeit
from a low base, is among the largest in the EU, partially reflecting equity withdrawals through loan
refinancing. In contrast, year-on-year credit from banks to non-financial corporates only recently
turned positive.

Together with low private leverage, banks’ sound capital and provision buffers
mitigate immediate vulnerabilities. Banks are well-capitalized, with the Tier 1 capital ratio at
16 percent and leverage at a moderate 7.8 percent. In addition, a capital add-on of 2–3 percent for
domestically systemically important banks will be phased in during 2016–18. Although NPLs have
edged up, loan loss provisions still cover almost 70 percent of all impaired loans despite a recent
slowdown in provisioning. The loan-to-deposit ratio is marginally above 90 percent, and liquid
assets are high at 30 percent of total assets. Low real interest rates, rising disposable income, and
broadly stable property prices are further mitigating factors.
23.
To limit the buildup of credit risk, a stronger macroprudential stance may be
warranted. NBS macroprudential recommendations are relatively lenient compared to those in
other countries and might be strengthened to

Introducing a debt-to-income ratio (DTI). The

to enhance the effectiveness of the LTV limit.



Lowering the LTV limit. With the planned
transposition of its macroprudential

should be lowered from 90 to 85 percent, thus
better aligning housing loan regulation with
that of peers.

standard normal distribution of the cyclical deviation from



Applying a counter-cyclical capital buffer
(CCB). If above-trend credit growth continues and broadens to the corporate sector, the
adoption of a CCB of at least 0.5 percent would be warranted.



Adopt more tailored supply-side measures to address real-estate-related exposures. Raising credit

exposures would raise the cost of mortgage loans without affecting non-financial corporate
borrowing. Implementation of the new European standards for loan classification would help, as
would mandatory verification of external appraisals by lenders to avoid inflated collateral
valuations.
24.
Preparation will help ensure effectiveness of the bank resolution framework. Although
there are no immediate risks, tests of the feasibility of resolution tools and cross-border
coordination would facilitate readiness under the new European framework, especially given the
large deposit base and the important role of foreign-owned banks. Allocation of the proceeds from
the bank levy to a dedicated resolution fund would help finance the national contribution to the
EU’s Single Resolution Fund (SRF).
25.
The low interest rate environment calls for close monitoring of non-bank financial
institutions. Falling investment returns and rising long-term liabilities have made asset-liability
matching of life insurance companies more difficult, potentially undermining the viability of
guarantee-based products. The authorities should facilitate the transition towards unit-linked
insurance products and explore the possibility of developing an industry-funded policyholder
protection scheme, especially in the absence of a resolution mechanism for non-bank financial
institutions.
26.
Capital market development and integration could improve access to financing. A
better functioning capital market could offer firms alternative sources of finance, provide additional
investment options for savers, and make it easier for banks to issue more long-term debt such as
covered bonds. A more stable approach to the second pension pillar, as well as regulations that
encourage more diversified investment strategies, could help foster institutional investors and
capital market development. Targeted efforts underway to promote financing for small and
innovative firms are welcome and could be further supported by an EU Capital Markets Union. Links
to other stock exchanges in the region should also be explored to promote market access.
Authorities’ views
27.
The NBS viewed the macro-prudential policy stance as appropriate but reaffirmed its
readiness to act if needed. While the direct impact on credit growth of current measures has been
limited, recommendations have improved lending standards in general. The NBS is currently
reviewing the possibility of introducing a CCB but has deferred any action until there is more
conclusive evidence of excessive credit growth, including a broadening to corporate borrowing. The
NBS considers macro-financial vulnerabilities associated with the low-interest rate environment
limited since most insurance companies have started offering non-guaranteed products. The
government plans to reduce capital gains taxes and transaction fees, including through
establishment of a new central depository, which would support domestic capital market
development.

Growth is picking up as domestic demand strengthens further. Rising investment,
reflecting especially stepped-up use of EU funds, as well as strong private consumption in the
context of a recovering labor market and real wage gains, have led to solid domestic demand-driven
growth. Although inflation is expected to remain slightly negative this year due to falling energy
costs, prices should rise in 2016 as the output gap closes.
29.
External factors present the greatest risks to Slovakia’s largely positive outlook. A
sound and liquid banking sector, low private sector leverage, and limited public debt enhance
resilience to shocks. If, however, key trading partners such as Germany were hit by adverse
developments—whether due to euro area weakness, a China or emerging market slowdown, or
tensions between Russia and Ukraine—Slovakia’s important export sector would be affected. On the
domestic side, rapid household credit growth could sow financial sector risks, while high long-term
unemployment could undermine potential growth.
30.
High unemployment, inactivity, and regional disparities call for a comprehensive
approach. Despite the recent pickup in job creation, the unemployment rate remains in double
digits, with particular challenges for the long-term unemployed, youth, and women. Enhancing
transportation infrastructure and strengthening the business climate would encourage investment in
weaker regions, and together with reforms to promote rental housing, could facilitate labor mobility.
Reducing the labor tax wedge, especially for low-wage or part-time workers, would encourage labor
force participation and hiring. Enhancing education and training, together with strengthening the
effectiveness of ALMPs, would allay rising skill shortages. Improved childcare options could facilitate
greater workforce participation by women.
31.
High-quality fiscal measures are needed to ensure room for policy maneuver while
advancing priorities. A moderate pace of further fiscal adjustment would ensure sufficient
headroom under domestic debt rules so that fiscal policy could play a counter-cyclical role in the
future, and would help address longer-term fiscal challenges associated with population aging.
Enhancing revenue collection, broadening the tax base including through a market value-based real
estate tax, and achieving spending efficiencies, especially in the health sector and through a review
of social benefits, would help secure needed adjustment while funding key priorities. These include
steps to address labor market challenges and regional disparities, and to reduce the tax burden on
production factors. Reducing still sizeable state shareholdings would enable further growth-friendly
debt reduction.
32.
Modifications to the FRA should be considered to lessen potential negative economic
effects while maintaining fiscal discipline. Possible changes include a more gradual pace of
adjustment when debt brakes are crossed, more realistic escape clauses, netting out cash balances,
and less bias toward expenditure cuts. Keeping current debt brake levels (50–60 percent of GDP)
rather than allowing them to progressively fall starting in 2018 as stipulated under the FRA would
help preserve fiscal space.

33.
Additional macroprudential measures would help guard against risks from rapid credit
growth. Although household debt is relatively low and banks enjoy sound capital and liquidity
buffers, to limit financial stability risks, the LTV limit should be lowered and clear guidance should be
issued on a maximum DTI ratio. If above-trend credit growth continues and broadens to the
corporate sector, a counter-cyclical capital buffer of at least 0.5 percent would be warranted. In the
near term, more targeted measures on real estate-related exposures should be considered.
34.
Bank resolution tools should be tested. Although there are no immediate risks on the
horizon, the new European resolution framework and cross-border coordination should be tested,
especially given the importance of deposit funding and foreign-owned banks. Bank levy proceeds
should be placed in a dedicated resolution fund to be used for Slovakia’s SRF contribution.
35.
Low interest rates call for close monitoring of non-bank financial institutions. With
exceptionally low interest rates potentially undermining the viability of guarantee-based products
for life insurers, development of an industry-funded policyholder protection scheme should be
explored.
36.
Further capital market development would enhance access to finance. Steps to facilitate
financing for small and innovative firms and plans to reduce capital gains taxes and transaction fees
are welcome, and could be complemented by an EU Capital Markets Union and links to other stock
exchanges. A more stable second pension pillar would encourage growth of institutional investors.
37.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with the Slovak Republic take place on the
standard 12–month cycle.

Annex I. Slovak Republic: Risk Assessment Matrix1/
External Risks
Tighter or more volatile global
financial conditions (short term)
 Sharp asset price adjustment
and decompression of credit
spreads. Investors reassess
underlying risk and respond to
unanticipated changes in growth
prospects, Fed policy rate path,
and increases in U.S. term premia,
with poor market liquidity
amplifying the effect on volatility.
 Euro area bond market
contagion. Sovereign and
financial sector stress re-emerges
across the Euro area due to
protracted policy uncertainty and
delays in debt servicing by Greece,
faltering reforms, and political and
social upheaval.
Structurally weak growth in key
advanced and emerging
economies (the “new mediocre”)
 Euro area: Weak demand and
persistently low inflation from a
failure to fully address crisis
legacies and undertake structural
reforms, leading to low mediumterm growth and accumulation of
financial imbalances. (medium
term)
 Emerging markets, including
China. Maturing of the cycle,
misallocation of investment and
excess corporate leverage
(including in FX) fueled by a
prolonged period of easy global
financial conditions, and
insufficient progress with reforms
leads to a significant mediumterm growth slowdown. (medium
term)
 Sharp China slowdown in 201516. Growth falls significantly
below target, possibly due to a
severe housing downturn or a
shock in the shadow banking
sector. (short term)

Medium

Low

 Interest costs could rise, but
from very low levels.
 External borrowing might
become more difficult. Nonresidents hold about twothirds of government debt,
but the stock is relatively
low and in euro or hedged,
and financing needs are
declining.
 The Slovak banking sector is
deposit-funded and enjoys
robust capitalization.
 Lower exports and growth if
trading partners are
substantially affected.
High (euro area)
Medium (EMs incl. China)
 Strong trade links to Europe,
especially Germany, would
hit exports and growth,
exacerbating unemployment
(e.g., a 1 percent fall in euro
area GDP could lower Slovak
industrial production by
7 percent within a year).2/
 Weaker EM/China growth
would be primarily felt
indirectly, to the extent key
trading partners are
affected.
 Public debt dynamics are
especially sensitive to
growth shocks and debt
brakes harmful to growth
could be breached.
 Banks’ asset quality could
deteriorate due to weaker
growth and higher
unemployment.

 Draw on cash balances if
needed.

 Slow diversification of
holders of government
debt and turn to
domestic banking sector
as a backstop.
 Persevere on fiscal
adjustment.
 Improve labor market
and business climate to
boost growth, including
through stronger
domestic demand.

 Over long-term, diversify
exports and FDI.
 Improve labor market
and business climate to
attract FDI and boost
growth, including
through stronger
domestic demand.
 Implement high-quality
fiscal measures to avoid
debt ceilings.
 Draw on strong provision
and capital buffers.

External Risks
Political fragmentation erodes
the globalization process and
fosters inefficiency (short term)
 Russia/Ukraine: the mounting
conflict depresses business
confidence and heightens risk
aversion, amid disturbances in
global financial, trade and
commodity markets.

Domestic Risks
Prolonged high unemployment
(medium term)

Relative
Likelihood
Medium

Impact if Realized
Medium

 Trade and financial links
with Ukraine are limited, but
Slovakia is largely

significantly affected.

Policy Response

 Sustained high

 Improve labor market

unemployment could inhibit
recovery in domestic
demand and lower growth.
 Hysteresis effects could
exacerbate unfavorable
demographics and lower
potential growth.
 Public debt is especially
sensitive to growth shocks.

and strengthen business
climate through
investment in weaker
regions, active labor
market policies, and
better education and
training.
 Persevere on fiscal
adjustment.

Medium

 An increase in nonperforming loans would
require higher provisioning,
eroding bank profits and
capital with negative
implications for lending and
growth; however, capital
and liquidity levels are
currently strong, and private
debt is low.
 The real estate market
would be negatively
affected.

 Strengthen
macroprudential
measures such as loanto-value requirements
and accompany with
debt-to-income ratios.
Further build capital
buffers.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely
to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks
surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10
and
30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and
overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and
materialize jointly.

Annex II. Slovak Republic: Authorities’ Response to Past IMF
Policy Recommendations
IMF 2014 Article IV Recommendations

Authorities’ Response

Achieving High-quality Fiscal Consolidation







Improve VAT collection efficiency, and reduce tax
evasion.
Introduce a property value-based real estate tax.
Move more quickly to a higher retirement age and
raise the overall retirement age to strengthen the
pension system.
Lower debt through sale of state shares in
companies.
Improve spending efficiency (especially in the
healthcare sector).








Reducing tax evasion and VAT efficiency are top
priorities and have benefited from FAD analysis.
An ambitious action plan to combat tax fraud is
being implemented.
Work on a property value-based real estate tax is
underway, but implementation is unlikely before
2016.
Raising the retirement age is not desirable due to
low life expectancy and small expected savings.
State shares in Slovak Telekom were sold and the
proceeds were used to reduce outstanding debt.

Boosting Growth and Reducing Unemployment





Address high unemployment by lowering labor
taxes, strengthening active labor market policies
(ALMPs), improving education, and training, and
enhancing mobility
Use EU Funds effectively.
Improve investment climate by strengthening
infrastructure and governance, lowering
administrative burdens for businesses and
ensuring a predictable legal climate, including with
respect to labor regulations.










The government is committed to reducing
unemployment, and has taken steps to streamline
and improve ALMPs.
Health insurance contributions have been reduced
and benefits can be claimed concurrent with work
to encourage hiring and work for the low-income
labor force.
Education and training initiatives, including to
create a dual vocational education and training
system, are underway.
Efforts to improve government efficiency and to
facilitate financing for SMEs are underway.
Labor Code changes to allow extension of
collective bargaining agreements are unlikely to
affect unemployment.

Preserving Financial Stability






Lower the bank levy in line with other European
countries and allocate proceeds to a well-defined
special resolution fund.
Enhance the supervisory framework through a
more well-specified intervention and resolution
framework, in line with European directives and
banking union developments.
Adopt a regulation on loan-to-value and debt-toincome ratios to prevent an excessive build-up of
credit risk.







The proceeds of the bank levy are available for
resolution if needed and the levy rate will
gradually decline with the accumulation of
resources.
All the recent EU directives (CRD IV, etc.) have
been transposed into national legislation. Risks are
low and closely-tracked by the NBS.
The NBS introduced a set of recommendations
regarding loan-to-value ratios, real estate
collateral values, and customer repayment ability.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SLOVAK REPUBLIC

STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of data provided to the Fund are adequate for
surveillance purposes. From the point of view of macroeconomic analysis and policy making,
significant data improvements have been made, particularly in the national accounts. A data ROSC
mission during February–March 2004 found that the integrity, methodological soundness, and
reliability of the data were satisfactory, despite some shortcomings in the data revision policy. With
the adoption of the European System of Accounts (ESA) 2010 in September 2014, past statistical
discrepancies between the supply and demand sides of GDP have been resolved. Weaknesses in the
data on prices and volumes of imports and exports have also been addressed. Nevertheless, errors
and omissions in the balance of payments statistics remain large and reported financial account
flows are subject to large volatility. The Slovak Republic has subscribed to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since 1996 and observes or exceeds all related standards.
2.
With regard to timeliness and public access, the authorities in general follow a free
and open data publication policy. Data are promptly released to news services, and are also
published regularly in various monthly and quarterly statistical publications, and on the internet
according to a preannounced schedule. Data on core surveillance variables are provided regularly to
the Fund, and with minimal lags: a week or less for foreign exchange reserves; a day for monthly
state budget implementation data; 10 days to a month for consumer prices, reserve money, broad
money, and interest rates; two months for foreign trade data; and about three months for other
fiscal, balance of payments, and national accounts data.

Fiscal Sector
3.
The compilation of general government statistics is in line with the new ESA 2010
methodology. The Ministry of Finance began compiling its fiscal accounts according to ESA 2010
standards in 2014 and reports general government net lending/borrowing and gross debt on a
quarterly basis. Monthly reconciliation of government operations above and below the line is
restricted to state budget transactions on a cash basis. A modern treasury system has been
operating since January 2004.
External Sector
4.
External sector statistics are generally of good quality, and are reported on a timely
basis to the Fund. However, errors and omissions in the balance of payments statistics are large
and reported financial account flows are subject to large volatility. The statistical authorities are
aware of these issues and are working to address them. The statistical authorities started to submit
data to the Fund following the standard of the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and
International Investment Position Manual (BPM6) in September 2014 and have provided data back
to 2004.

Monetary Sector
5.

Monetary statistics are of good quality and are reported on a timely basis to the Fund.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the Slovak Republic
January 11, 2016

This statement provides additional information on developments that took place as the staff
report was being finalized. The information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.


Third social package: At the December conference of the governing Smer-SD party, the
Prime Minister outlined a third social package to be implemented during 2016-2020
should Smer-SD retain power after the general election in March 2016. The cost of the
proposals (about €1 billion or a little above 1 percent of GDP) is larger than expected and
exceeds the combined cost of the two previous packages. The package would aim to:
- create 100,000 new jobs by 2020 through an array of measures including support for
lagging regions, families, agriculture, construction, and expansion of nursery schools;
- improve second- and third-class roads;
- reduce health insurance contributions for low-wage workers;
- build rental apartments for young people with specific low-cost flats for new teachers,
renovate student dormitories, and reduce student housing costs;
- increase support for low-income pensioners, caregivers, and students; and
- raise the number of police officers and special military forces.
The government would prepare implementing legislation in 2016. The Prime Minister
indicated that higher revenues from stronger economic growth and better tax collection
would finance the package while still allowing a balanced budget to be achieved in 2018.



Jaguar Land Rover: On December 11, 2015, the Slovak government and the carmaker
Jaguar Land Rover finalized an investment agreement for construction of a new factory
in Nitra. The approximately €1.4 billion investment is in line with assumptions in the
staff report. Construction will start in 2016 with the plant expected to become operational
in 2018 and directly employ about 2,800 people.



Power producer Slovenské Elektrárne (SE): On December 18, 2015, the Italian energy
company Enel agreed to sell its 66 percent stake in SE (currently valued at about
€750 million) to the Czech energy company EPH in a two-stage deal, with the second
part taking place only after completion of the delayed expansion of the Mochovce nuclear
plant. The government retains options in the second stage of the deal to acquire an
additional 17 percent stake, which would make it the majority shareholder with 51
percent of total capital, or to buy up to 100 percent of SE's shares under a right of first
refusal.

Statement by Ibrahim Canakci, Executive Director for Slovak Republic
and Marek Jakoby, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
January 11, 2016
The Slovak authorities appreciate the candid and useful discussions with the IMF team during
the 2015 Article IV Consultation meetings. The staff report and the informative Selected Issues
paper cover well the developments of and the outlook for the Slovak economy, and provide a fair
picture of the policy challenges facing the authorities.
Overview
The Slovak economy has been performing well in a weak external environment, comparing
favorably with the Eurozone as well as the European Union. Following 2.5 percent growth in
2014, economic activity has been accelerating in the course of 2015, reaching 3.7 percent in the
third quarter (y/y) with robust domestic demand, and most notably public investment providing
key contributions. Public investment accelerated particularly with respect to the end of the
availability of EU funds within the 2007-13 programming period.
A major positive development has been the continued improvement in major labor market
indicators throughout 2015 as employment increased by 2.6 percent in the first three quarters and
the unemployment rate declined to 11.3 percent in the third quarter against 12.9 percent a year
ago. The stagnating overall price level (with a modest decline into negative territory in the
second half of 2015) due primarily to declining energy prices helped push real wage growth to
over 3 percent in the third quarter, supporting private consumption.
The 2016 state budget is based on the assumption of 3.1 percent growth of GDP to be driven by
the acceleration of private consumption while export growth is expected to weaken reflecting the
slow growth in the main trading partners. Inflation is expected to pick up only modestly to 0.9
percent. Both real wage and employment gains should positively contribute to consumption
growth with a somewhat lower saving rate providing additional impulse. While an acceleration
of investment in the private sector is expected in 2016 it will merely compensate for the lower
public investment due to the base effect of 2015. The Ministry of Finance projects further
increases of GDP growth to 3.6 percent in 2017 and 2018. The negative output gap, estimated at
0.8 percent in 2015, should decline to 0.4 percent in 2016 and be closed in 2017. The risks to the
outlook primarily stem from the external environment.
Unlike in the staff report, the government’s GDP growth projections are conservative in the
sense that they do not include the envisaged positive impact of the now confirmed investment of
the fourth car manufacturer (Jaguar-Land Rover) which thus presents an upside risk to actual
growth and should also lift potential growth currently estimated by the Ministry of Finance at 2.6
percent.
Fiscal Policy
The solid economic performance and the effectiveness of the measures aimed at tax revenue
efficiency helped bringing tax revenues to above the budgeted levels in both 2014 and 2015.

2
However, higher revenues have not fully counter-balanced the increase in investment spending,
healthcare outlays and the negative effect of the correction of EU funds in 2015. This is expected
to result in an end-2015 general government deficit of 2.7 percent of GDP, slightly higher than
the budgeted 2.5 percent of GDP.
The Slovak government remains committed to fiscal consolidation to ensure the sustainability of
public finances. The path envisaged under the approved 2016-18 general government budget
targeting the gradual reduction of the headline deficit to 1.9 percent of GDP in 2016, to 0.4
percent in 2017 and to zero in 2018, is ambitious but feasible. It is also in line with Slovakia’s
EU commitments and the domestic fiscal responsibility act. The structural deficit should decline
from 2.1 percent in 2015 to no more than 0.5 percent of GDP in 2017, thus meeting Slovakia’s
medium-term objective (MTO). General government debt is expected to gradually decline from
52.8 percent of GDP at the end of 2014 to 48.9 percent of GDP in 2018. The envisaged
adjustment relies primarily on the spending side, with intermediate consumption accounting for
the bulk of the adjustment. The ongoing “ESO” reform, seeking more efficient public
administration and the improvement in public procurement should be the key sources of the
savings.
The authorities are aware that credible fiscal adjustment is essential for maintaining a high credit
rating and favorable market financing terms and for preventing the materialization of the risk
linked to the high share of non-resident holdings of Slovak government debt. At the same time,
the authorities have been pursuing policies towards economic and social goals in line with the
program manifesto and the National Reform Program. The measures included in several “social
packages”, including the reduction of the VAT from 20 to 10 percent on selected staple foods in
effect since January 1, aim at spreading the benefits of solid economic performance particularly
to the lower-income groups and lagging regions. In addition, measures such as higher day care
allowances or investments in public day care capacities are also expected to support female labor
market participation.
The government is committed to the continued improvement of tax collection efficiency and tax
compliance as a key source of additional revenue. The authorities appreciate the very useful
technical assistance provided by the FAD in 2012 on the assessment on the VAT Gap and the
design of the action plan of 50 measures to mitigate tax evasion, particularly in VAT, by
strengthening prevention and control, and stricter penalties. Recognizing the developing nature
of tax fraud the government approved in 2015 the amended action plan with further 30 measures.
With a substantial segment of fraud linked to cross-border activities the authorities recognize the
need for the effective frameworks for international cooperation and exchange of information.
Besides revenue collection, tax policy measures also aim at improving the business environment,
e.g. introduction of a reverse charge for VAT payments in construction (liability of the buyer
rather than the seller for the VAT) or the cash accounting scheme (VAT payment liability upon
receipt of payment rather than at the time of invoice issuance) for small enterprises; and
shortening of VAT refund periods. The government is also committed to improving the quality
of spending by introducing the comprehensive and regular expenditure reviews to promote a
value-for-money concept across all budgetary chapters. The pilot expenditure reviews have been
launched, also with the support from the FAD for the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of
Finance.

Financial Sector
The Slovak banking sector remains healthy and resilient to potential stresses, with solid levels of
key indicators regarding capital, liquidity, asset quality and profitability.
At the same time, the authorities are aware of the developments that could create vulnerabilities,
particularly with respect to the continued strong growth of household credit (over 13 percent in
the first three quarters of 2015). After a three-year stagnation, corporate credit started to pick up
modestly in mid-2015.
The National Bank of Slovakia (NBS), as the banks’ regulator and supervisor in the framework
of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), regards the existing prudential rules, including the
recommendations guiding the maximum loan-to-value (LTV) levels on new housing loans, limits
on new loans with very long maturity, and stress-testing the housing loan portfolios to an
increase in interest rates and the deterioration of macroeconomic situation, as sufficient at the
current juncture. In addition, the recently adopted act on housing loans which will come into
effect in March 2016 tightens lending standards, mandating the banks to assess the borrowers’
repayment capacity including at the time of significant loan top-up, disregarding the value of
collateral. However, the NBS intends sending a stronger signal to the market by incorporating
the recommendations into binding legislation and possibly tightening the prudential limits in
2016 should the strong growth continue. In addition, such legislation would also enable the
introduction of debt-to-income (DTI) limits if needed. The NBS also recognizes the rising need
for an increase of the counter-cyclical capital buffer from its current zero level, particularly if
corporate credit growth shows signs of excessive growth as well.
Despite the adverse impact on the protracted period of low interest rates on insurance companies
the sector remains relatively stable. The NBS currently does not see the need for macroprudential
measures for insurance companies at this juncture, but stresses the importance of their prudent
behavior, particularly with respect to payment of dividends in cases of weakening solvency.
Structural Issues
Despite the improvement in headline labor market indicators the Slovak authorities consider the
significant structural challenges as well described in the staff report, particularly the high longterm and youth unemployment rates as well as the low labor participation of women. A set of
measures has been adopted to improve incentives on both the demand and supply side of the
labor market including a health contribution allowance for low-income workers, subsidies for the
creation of jobs for the youth or re-training programs. The recent internal staff reallocation in
labor offices has led to the improved ratio of clients to the contact point employees. The
government is planning to comprehensively assess the efficiency of the all active labor market
policies to further improve the system. The dual education scheme, aiming at better matching
vocational education with the needs of businesses, has been off to a good start and the
participation of businesses and students is expected to gradually increase.

Recognizing that private sector investment and economic activity are central to employment
creation, the Slovak authorities put strong emphasis on the further enhancement in transport
infrastructure, particularly the completion of the motorway and expressway network,
improvement in the business environment, including by lowering the administration burden on
entrepreneurs, as well as support to start-ups and research activities.
