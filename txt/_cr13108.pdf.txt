STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 20, 2012

Context: After a decade of strong and inclusive growth, supported by prudent policies and a
positive external environment, the economy is slowing toward potential. However, inflation
is well above target and rising, and external risks cloud the outlook.
Focus: Discussions focused on how best to tackle inflation while managing external head
winds and tail winds and related spillover risks, and, for the medium term, how to enhance
resilience to shocks and boost long-term growth.
Near-term policy mix: Baseline: Bringing actual and expected inflation toward target will
require action on several fronts. Further monetary tightening will be needed but the pace
should depend on the evolution of the economy and risks. Moderate wage growth will be
essential, including in the 2013 wage negotiation round. On the fiscal side, there is scope for
firmer spending restraint to support monetary policy and secure the target to reduce public
debt to about 45 percent of GDP by 2015. Continued exchange rate flexibility is also
important. In a downturn: International reserves can be used to contain overshooting.
Monetary policy easing could proceed so long as inflation expectations have become
reasonably anchored. Fiscal automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate though in a
lasting downturn fiscal space would be limited by the need to preserve prudent debt
dynamics. The government has built substantial liquidity buffers that can be used in a
“sudden stop.”
Medium term: Prospects for strong and stable growth would be bolstered by further
improvements to the macroeconomic policy framework, financial deepening (drawing on the
accompanying FSAP Update), and other productivity-enhancing reforms.
Past advice: There is a long-shared view on broad macroeconomic policy priorities. In
recent consultations the Fund has placed greater emphasis on reducing inflation to the
target range to help de-dollarization and open up space for monetary policy easing during
downturns. The Fund has also called for restraint on current public expenditures, in part to
help monetary policy.

THE SETTING
1.
Uruguay has put in a spectacular recovery
since its financial crisis in 2002. With the strongest
decade-long growth spell on record, Uruguay’s per
capita income has more than doubled from pre-2002
levels in purchasing power terms, employment is at
historic highs, and social indicators have improved
(Figure 1). In 2012, Uruguay regained investment-grade
rating. This recovery, set in motion by a large exchange
rate and real wage adjustment, has been supported by
important policy reforms, prudent macroeconomic
policies, and active social policies (Box 1). It has also
been achieved in a largely supportive international
environment.

2.
The near-term outlook is positive, but with risks and policy challenges. Uruguay has
extensive trade, investment, and financial links to the region and the rest of the world (Annex I). It is
now buffeted by conflicting global and regional influences: terms of trade and global financing
conditions remain favorable, but demand is sagging in Europe and in the key partner, Argentina
(whose restrictive trade and foreign currency policies are also taking a toll on Uruguay). Risks are
two sided and relate to further spillovers from abroad and to domestic wage and cost
developments. Meanwhile, monetary policy is grappling with difficult trade-offs: despite slowing
growth and a closing output gap, inflation is stuck above target and rising, and inflation
expectations remain stubbornly above the inflation target. Moreover, swelling capital inflows and
appreciation against Brazil and Argentina have caused concern about peso strength.
3.
Medium-term challenges include bolstering the economy’s resilience to shocks and
fostering productivity growth. In addition to continued prudent macroeconomic policies, it will be
important to shore up key infrastructure (e.g., energy, roads, ports), promote a dynamic and deeper
(but stable) financial system, enhance the policy framework, and ensure a competitive business
environment.
4.
The political cycle should be propitious for continued sound policies and progress with
reforms. Presidential elections are not until late 2014. At the same time, divergences of views on
economic policy within the broad Frente Amplio government coalition (consisting of 21 groups) are
injecting some elements of unpredictability into policy making.

5.
Output is slowing toward potential. Staff projects growth at 3½ percent in 2012, down
from 5.7 percent in 2011 and 8.9 percent in 2010. On this basis, the output gap will close in 2012.
6.
While domestic demand remains buoyant, negative spillovers and idiosyncratic factors
have caused a somewhat sharper-than-expected slowdown.


Domestic demand. After slowing in 2011, domestic demand showed new vim in the first half
of 2012. Construction of a large pulp mill boosted investment, while strong real wage
growth fueled consumption. More recently, though, consumer confidence indicators (and
the increase in reserve requirements) point to moderation ahead (Figure 2).



Spillovers. Exports remain firm in dollar terms thanks in part to still-rising export prices and
strong demand in Asia. However, export volumes to the EU and Argentina fell by 22 percent
and 12 percent, respectively, during January-August 2012 from the same period in 2011,
while export volumes to Brazil were flat.



Idiosyncratic factors. 2012 growth is affected by the carry-over from the shutdown of the
state-oil refinery (ANCAP) in late 2011, and by the drought that forced the state electricity
company, UTE, in early 2012 to rely more on petroleum power with lower value-added than
hydropower. These events cut about half a percentage point from growth in 2012.

Inflation is well above the target despite monetary tightening. From September 2010
through end-2011, the Banco Central del Uruguay (BCU) increased its policy rate by a cumulative
250 basis points, raised average reserve requirements, and introduced marginal reserve
requirements.1 The BCU left the rate on pause for most of 2012, partly on growing capital inflows
1

In May 2011, the BCU raised average reserve requirements on local and foreign currency deposits (levels vary with
maturity) and introduced marginal requirements (15 percent for local currency deposits and 27 percent for foreign
currency deposits). Marginal requirements were raised, effective August 1, 2012, to 20 and 40 percent, respectively.

and currency appreciation concerns; in September it notched up the rate by another 25 basis points
to 9 percent as inflation pressures mounted. But the monetary tightening has not succeeded in
bringing actual and expected inflation toward the target (Box 2 and Figure 3). Indeed, inflation has
jumped in recent months and reached 9.1 percent in October 2012 (y/y), pushing further above the
4–6 percent target range. Although the latest jump is due to food prices and energy-related price
adjustments, inflation is broad based (staff’s estimate of core inflation was 8.8 percent in October)
and reflects brisk domestic demand, a tight labor market, extensive wage indexation, a monetary
stance that is not sufficiently tight, and a target that is not anchoring expectations within the range.
8.
Starting in March 2012, a spike in portfolio
inflows has sharpened monetary policy trade-offs.
In the context of ample global liquidity, a favorable
outlook for Uruguay—epitomized by the upgrade to
investment grade—and rate cuts in Brazil, Uruguay
saw a sharp spike in capital flows into central bank
and government papers (the only liquid capital
market instruments in Uruguay). To manage surging
capital inflows, appreciation pressures, and inflation
the authorities have responded as follows:



Monetary/exchange rate policy. The
authorities have continued to allow the peso to fluctuate, albeit with episodic intervention to
lean against rapid appreciation. With the sharp depreciation of the Brazilian real in the
spring of 2012, the authorities became wary about the strength of the peso. But with

goods by 10 percent and to keep all other prices (with a few exceptions) frozen until end2012. The impact on inflation is estimated at about 1 percentage point.
9.
The fiscal deficit has widened significantly in 2012, mostly due to temporary factors.
The overall fiscal deficit is projected to widen to 2.3 percent of GDP in 2012, from 0.9 percent in
2011. According to the authorities, about 1.2 percentage points come from the drought-induced
cost overruns in UTE and a one-off payment to foreign institutions.2 These outlays do not imply
fiscal impulse, but the recurring drought-related deficits in UTE pose fiscal risks that need to be
tackled. At the same time, revenues have been robust (including through further reductions in tax
evasion), allowing a strong expansion in primary spending, which rose by about 10 percent in real
terms in the first nine months of 2012 over the same period in 2011.
10.
Though more mixed than a year ago, Uruguay’s external stability risks remain
contained. Although the currency has strengthened against those of Argentina and Brazil, causing
competitiveness concerns in some sectors, staff does not see a generalized competitiveness
problem, and balance of payments risks appear contained (Box 4 and Figure 4). That said, a further
significant and sustained real appreciation is
possible if strong capital inflows continue, and

A sound but dollarized banking system. Banks are very liquid, funded by retail deposits, and
carry low non-performing loans. The FSAP Update’s stress tests show adequate capital to
handle a range of shocks, though capital ratios of a few private banks would fall moderately
below the 8 percent regulatory floor in an adverse scenario.3 Deposit and credit dollarization
are on a long-term downward trend, but remain high at
71 and 56 percent, respectively. One vulnerability is the share (34 percent) of foreign
currency loans to borrowers without a natural foreign exchange hedge (largely in the

The adverse scenario entails a 3.6 percent fall in real GDP, 20 percent currency depreciation, 9.4 percent inflation,
and increments of 200 and 60 basis points in country risk and international interest rates, respectively. The stress
tests capture the effects from banks’ foreign exchange lending to unhedged borrowers. The capital shortfall seems
manageable (capital ratios would not fall below 6.5 percent). As of January 2013, the BCU is requiring a capital
surcharge for operational and systemic risks.



construction and service sectors). On the other hand, Argentinean deposits in Uruguayan
banks—a key factor in the 2002 crisis––are not as important today: they have fallen from
$8.5 billion (43 percent of GDP) in 2001 to $3.9 billion (8.3 percent of GDP) in mid-2012, and
are more than covered by banks’ foreign assets.
No apparent bubbles. Capital inflows have not fueled a credit expansion. Last year’s
consumer credit boom has lost steam after BCU tightened policies and as the riskier outlook
dented demand. As for real estate, anecdotal evidence suggests Uruguay is expensive
compared with other countries in upper market segments, but available data (limited to
Montevideo) do not suggest broader price bubbles (Figure 6). While it is unclear if (and by
how much) prices might be misaligned in Uruguay as a whole, a sharp price correction
would crimp domestic demand and hurt construction activity, but would not trigger major
ripple effects in the banking system, as most real estate is cash or FDI financed.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
12.
The baseline near-term outlook remains favorable with output projected at potential.
In staff’s baseline scenario, which is similar to that of the authorities, growth stabilizes around
potential (4 percent a year). Large investments, in particular in the energy and pulp sectors, will
boost growth while private consumption is projected to moderate somewhat. The negative
contribution from net exports is expected to shrink as consumer imports slow and exports benefit
from projected gradual recoveries in Argentina and Brazil and world growth more broadly.
13.
But the baseline is clouded by risks from the twisting global and regional outlook and
from domestic inflation and cost developments. Annex I looks at spillovers more closely.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

URUGUAY



Risks from the region. Brazil and (especially)
Argentina affect Uruguay—directly and as
transmitters of global shocks—via trade,
tourism, investment, and (to a lesser extent)
financial links. At this time, the main regional
risk stems from further spillovers from
Argentina on exports, the upcoming tourism
season, and on FDI into real estate.

of trade and regional partners, and possibly
also FDI. The key financial link is the large presence of Spanish banks Santander and BBVA
(the second and third largest banks in Uruguay by assets). But like other subsidiaries, they
are well-capitalized, liquid, and rely on a large domestic deposit base for funding.



Sharp fall in main export prices. A fall in the prices of non-oil commodities—say, triggered by
a larger-than-envisaged slowdown in China—would significantly affect Uruguay’s exports
(roughly two-thirds of exports are commodity related) and growth directly, and via knock-on
effects from Argentina and Brazil (which are exposed to similar terms-of-trade shocks).



Excessive wage growth. Excessive growth in wages in the coming years would boost private
consumption, fuel inflation, and cause further real appreciation. The ensuing loss of
competitiveness would hurt exports and growth prospects, raising the risk of a hard landing.

Uruguay is in a reasonably good position to cope with negative spillovers; however,
policy space is limited.



Modest amplifiers. The banking system’s foreign exchange exposure to un-hedged
borrowers could amplify shocks. But other financial risks are small, external imbalances are
modest, and the exchange rate is floating and does not appear overvalued.



Large liquidity buffers. BCU’s international
reserves stand at $12½ billion (27 percent of
2011 GDP) and include the counterpart to a
$2½ billion liquidity buffer the government
has built. In addition, the government has

But limited policy space. The high inflation
limits the scope for monetary easing in a downturn. On the fiscal side, there is some more
room for maneuver, though gross debt dynamics remain sensitive to growth and exchange
rate shocks (see Annex II). The net debt position is less sensitive because of dollar assets.

15.
Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment of the outlook
and risks. They consider Uruguay well-prepared to face the challenging global conditions and the
eventual spillovers to the region. They—as well as most private sector analysts—believe that a sharp
drop in key export prices constitutes a main risk to the outlook (by impact) although with low
probability in the coming years. The authorities follow developments in Argentina very closely,
particularly those that may affect tourism, FDI, and certain manufacturing export sectors. The
authorities were confident that the upcoming wage round would deliver prudent wage agreements
in line with productivity growth. While the authorities agreed that the currency does not appear
overvalued on a trade-weighted basis, they considered it important to avoid (including via foreign
exchange intervention) possible sharp currency movements that could have negative effects on
competitiveness in the short run.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. The Appropiate Near-Term Stance
16.
The combination of inflation persistently above target and rising short-term capital
inflows has sharpened monetary policy trade-offs. In the context of Uruguay’s open capital
account, swelling short-term capital inflows have made the monetary policy dilemma between
reducing inflation and avoiding a large nominal appreciation starker.

Banks’ large net foreign asset position is a structural characteristic associated with the high degree of deposit
dollarization. It does not imply large net foreign exchange exposure, which is tightly regulated.

17.
Tackling inflation is the overriding near-term policy priority. Inflation and inflation
expectations anchored to the mid-point of the target range—not just closer to the upper band—
would create room for monetary easing in future downturns and in response to surges in capital
inflows, and help foster de-dollarization and de-indexation of the economy. The authorities stressed
their commitment to bringing down inflation, and pointed to the monetary tightening undertaken
so far and their broadly neutral fiscal stance. They expected a dampening impact on inflation from
the economic slowdown underway, the recent peso appreciation, and from the voluntary cuts and
freezes in basic consumer goods prices.
18.
Staff welcomed the recent monetary tightening via increases in reserve requirements
and the policy rate, and recommended maintaining a tightening bias to lower actual and
expected inflation toward the target range. The pace of policy rate increases should depend on
the evolution of the economy, including the output gap and the exchange rate. Reserve
requirements could also be tightened, if needed. Since there would likely be some further nominal
appreciation, which should help bring down inflation, competitiveness should be monitored
carefully. At the same time, most real appreciation in recent years has come from Uruguay’s
persistently higher inflation than in partner countries, so the dilemma between avoiding nominal
appreciation and reducing inflation should not be exaggerated from a medium-term
competitiveness perspective (see Figure 4). Staff also suggested enhancements to the monetary
policy framework to help guide expectations (see Section C). The authorities expect a moderation in
inflation in coming months, but did not rule out further monetary tightening, if needed. They
stressed that, meanwhile, they will continue to monitor developments, including with regard to the
slowdown in consumer credit (and its effect on inflation) and possible competitiveness concerns.
19.
Given monetary policy trade-offs, staff argued that fighting inflation and coping with
capital inflows will require concerted action on several fronts. Discussions focused on: further
fiscal restraint, especially on spending, to moderate domestic demand; prudent wage growth to
contain costs; foreign exchange intervention to limit exchange rate overshooting amid strong capital
inflows; active debt management to reduce dollar debt further; expanded foreign investment
options for pension funds; and capital flow management measures.
20.
On fiscal policy, staff encouraged greater
spending restraint to support monetary policy. A
broadly neutral stance would be appropriate given the
closing output gap, but in the context of high inflation
and capital inflows, staff argued that the optimal strategy
would be to rein in the very rapid real primary spending
growth to moderate domestic demand, alleviate
appreciation pressures, and support disinflation. The
authorities thought that a neutral fiscal stance was
appropriate, and that fiscal policy would have a limited
effect on inflation in the near term. They did not consider
it necessary to alter fiscal plans in the short run.

21.
Greater spending restraint would also help secure the authorities’ debt reduction
target. The mid-year 2012 budget targets a reduction in gross public debt to about 45 percent of
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

URUGUAY

GDP by 2015.5 However, based on the updated fiscal outlook for 2012, staff projects gross public
debt at closer to 50 percent of GDP in 2015. Furthermore, until the structural reforms in the energy
sector are implemented, the fiscal accounts remain exposed to drought-related volatility in UTE’s
revenues.6 Staff argued that, in the meantime, the budget should rely on a greater contribution from
the central government to achieve the debt target. Hence, a tight grip on spending would be
important. The authorities explained that as part of the normal process of revising the fiscal
projections, they continue to aim at reducing debt to 45 percent of GDP by 2015, a target that they
consider fully achievable.
22.
Prudent wage increases are essential to ensure competitiveness, especially if locked
into multi-year agreements. This will require cooperation by wage setters in the important 2013
wage round (covering about 80 percent of country-wide wages) but also a clear government stance,
given its “tie-breaking” deciding role in the tripartite negotiation framework. The authorities were
confident wage agreements would be prudent and emphasized that the challenges stem mostly
from the tight labor market (evidenced by the historically low unemployment) with shortages in
some sectors. Staff welcomed the efforts to align real wages with sector-specific productivity
growth, even if this may be difficult to implement in practice in all sectors. Staff also noted that it will
be important that multi-year wage agreements preserve flexibility in case of an economic downturn.
23.
Staff was skeptical about recent initiatives to cut and freeze prices of consumer goods.
The authorities considered that the cut/freeze of consumer goods prices would help prevent a
temporary surge in food prices from feeding into core inflation. In staff’s view, this measure creates
distortions without addressing the root cause of inflation. The extensive and hard-wired wage
indexation is a key reason price shocks feed into wages and core inflation. Pervasive indexation also
exacerbates Uruguay’s high employment and output volatility. The authorities acknowledged these
difficulties with wage indexation, but considered it an important part of the implicit social pact.
24.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ commitment to the floating exchange rate regime, a
key component of the policy framework. Given the comfortable reserves position, there is no
need to accumulate more reserves for prudential reasons. Staff suggested that intervention be
limited to avoiding excessive swings in the exchange rate. The authorities considered that the global
situation with ample liquidity and the small size of the market gave them little choice but to be
active. To help cope with inflows, staff also encouraged continued pro-active public debt
management, including through operations to reduce further external dollar debt. There is also a
case for expanding the foreign investment mandate for pension funds.
25.
The recently introduced capital flow management measure is an innovation in
Uruguay’s policy framework (Box 5). The BCU noted that the temporary reserve requirement
applies only to foreign purchases of its monetary policy instrument; the surge in such purchases
interfered with monetary policy operations. It is too early to say how effective the measure will be.

5

The authorities’ target for gross public debt by end-2015 has been raised from 40 to 45 percent of GDP to reflect
the borrowing associated with the build-up of government liquidity buffers. Net debt is unchanged.
6

An Energy Stabilization Fund has helped smooth volatility of UTE’s revenues this year, but it is now depleted.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

URUGUAY

Early indications suggest it has dampened demand for BCU paper but increased demand for
government debt. Hence, the measure may not have much effect on overall short-term portfolio
inflows in the end. The authorities indicated they have no plans to adopt further measures to curb
capital inflows, and they saw the open capital account as a key feature of Uruguay’s economic and
financial landscape.

B. Coping with Spillovers
26.
It was agreed that if external shocks materialize, the macroeconomic policy response
should be pragmatic and prudent.


Exchange rate policy. The floating exchange rate should be the first line of defense and a key
absorber of most shocks, in particular if terms of trade experience a sharp and persistent
decline. To guard against balance sheet and inflation risks—given high dollarization and
indexation—the ample reserves could be used to contain the overshooting.



Liquidity. Banks are very liquid, in particular in dollars, and do not depend on wholesale
funding. Hence, the likelihood that the BCU would need to intervene to contain liquidity
pressures is small, even in the event of a run on nonresident deposits.



Monetary policy. High inflation limits the monetary policy room for maneuver. In a crisis, the
immediate inflationary effects of a sharp depreciation would likely dominate the deflationary
effect of a sharp fall in demand (as in 2002). Staff suggested that policy rate cuts proceed so
long as inflation expectations have become reasonably anchored. As in the past, reserve
requirements could be cut to mitigate a credit crunch.



Fiscal policy. Automatic stabilizers (mainly tax revenue) should be allowed to operate though
not unimpeded in a lasting downturn so as to preserve prudent debt dynamics. It would be
important to protect social spending.

C. Policies to Bolster Growth Prospects and Reinforce Resilience to Shocks
27.
Uruguay’s medium-term outlook is also favorable but with challenges. The authorities’
projection of 4 percent growth a year should be feasible. However, it will require sustained
productivity growth and/or higher investment as labor will not provide much boost: working-age
population is projected to grow by a meager ½ percent a year and unemployment is already low.
Moreover, although Uruguay’s economy has become more resilient over the past decade, it has a
history of booms and busts—in large part due to external shocks—and output and employment
volatility is still high (partly due to extensive wage indexation).

28.
Action in a number of areas would help bolster prospects for strong and inclusive
growth prospects and lower output volatility. In addition to continued prudent macroeconomic
policies, it would be important to enhance further elements of the macroeconomic policy
framework, promote a dynamic and deeper (but stable) financial system, and ensure a competitive
business environment.
29.
Strengthening aspects of the macroeconomic policy framework further can help
reinforce the economy’s resilience to shocks.


Monetary policy. Inflation expectations have yet to become anchored within the inflation
target. Many market participants doubt the authorities’ commitment to the 4–6 percent
target and see them tolerant of inflation until it approaches 10 percent. This perception
limits the BCU’s ability to respond to shocks. In addition to a steadfast focus on bringing
actual and expected inflation to target, the framework’s traction on expectations could be
strengthened with more comprehensive communication of how the BCU sees the inflation
outlook and how its policy actions will lead inflation to the target (including through
publication of the BCU’s conditional inflation forecast). Predictability of monetary policy
could also be enhanced with monthly rather than quarterly policy meetings, the standard
frequency of most inflation targeting central banks.7 The authorities took note of the staff’s
views, as they consider further changes to the framework.



Fiscal framework. The top-down approach to budget planning and anchoring it in a debt
target are two strengths of Uruguay’s fiscal framework. To strengthen this framework
further, staff encouraged the authorities to consider casting the budget on a rolling five-year
horizon and to include even longer horizons for certain items (e.g., social spending). In this
context, it will be important to tackle the contingent fiscal liabilities in the state-owned
insurance company, Banco de Seguros del Estado, arising from the indexation of pensions to
wages (while BSE’s assets are mostly indexed to inflation). The authorities are well-aware of
this issue and are reviewing the situation. They noted that the attendant liabilities will not
start to become important until around 2020.

30.
There was agreement that a sound, resilient, and more dynamic financial system
would support long-term growth. The 2012 FSAP Update noted the landmark legal, regulatory,
and institutional reforms since the 2006 FSAP, as well as significant improvement in banking
supervision, progress on Basel II, a shift toward risk-based supervision, and the achievement of
meeting most of the Basel Core Principles (one remaining area for improvement relates to the risk
assessment methodology). At the same time, the financial sector’s contribution to economic growth
remains limited, and the Update identified potential areas for reform (Box 6). The authorities are still
reviewing the FSAP assessment and recommendations.
31.
There is scope to strengthen resilience further by building on recent progress. Over the
past year, the BCU has raised capital requirements relating to operational and systemic risk (effective
January 2013)—and the authorities consider making further enhancements in that direction,
introduced requirements for non-bank financial institutions to report their activities (in line with staff
advice), and modified the method for calculating dynamic provisions to reduce pro-cyclicality. The
FSAP Update also recommended strengthening crisis preparedness and contingency planning. Staff
welcomed that the Financial Stability Council—established in 2011 as the coordinator of safety net
and macro-prudential policies—is commissioning research on macro-prudential issues. Finally, staff
stressed the importance of adequate funding and staffing for effective financial supervision, as
discussed in the Update.
32.

It would also be important to deepen financial markets.



Deeper capital markets. The underdeveloped domestic capital market makes it difficult for
Uruguay to reap the benefits of portfolio inflows by channeling them to productive use. In
addition, ample and growing savings in domestic pension funds are outgrowing the capacity
of the local capital market. To develop a capital market that attracts potential issuers and
investors, and promotes efficient allocation of financial resources, staff suggested that the
authorities press ahead on developing a strategy. On pensions, the FSAP Update
recommended expanding the foreign investment mandate for pension funds and
encouraging participation in domestic alternatives to government bonds (such as equities
and Private-Public Partnership projects) to enhance returns and diversification and start
providing members with portfolio options along their working life tailored to their needs.



A more dynamic banking system. The FSAP Update highlighted a number of factors that limit
banking sector efficiency and competition. One is the dominant role and preferential status
of the state-owned Banco Republica Oriental del Uruguay (BROU), with more than half of
banking system assets. Another is high labor costs and operating constraints. To promote a
more dynamic, yet sound, banking system, the authorities should consider measures to level
the playing field among banks.

33.
Ensuring a competitive and dynamic business environment will require attention to a
few key areas: 8

Trends and Determinants,” by C. Perez and N. Melgar.



A competitive infrastructure. Major projects in the energy sector—involving private and
public investments— will improve the energy supply by 2015, making half of the electricity
supply based on renewable sources and help reduce drought risks for UTE. There have been
delays in tackling key infrastructure gaps (e.g., roads, ports) through Private-Public
Partnerships but the authorities expected these projects to move ahead over the coming
years.



A dynamic labor market. A well-functioning labor market is essential to spur productivity
growth, support the evolving competitive structure of the economy, and facilitate
adjustment to shocks. However, the World Economic Forum’s 2012–13 Global
Competitiveness Report ranks labor market efficiency (in particular, flexibility in wage
determination, cooperation in labor-employers relations, pay and productivity, and hiring
and firing practices) as the most difficult aspect of doing business in Uruguay. Staff
suggested that the authorities evaluate the experience with the regulations introduced in
recent years and consider changes to ensure a labor market commensurate with the needs
of a dynamic economy, while ensuring appropriate protection for workers. The authorities
considered that efforts to link wages more closely to productivity growth in upcoming wage
negotiations would enhance the labor market further.

34.
The mission welcomed the progress on meeting international tax standards and in
strengthening further Uruguay’s AML/CFT regime. To comply with international tax standards,
the government has established seven double-taxation treaties and one tax information sharing
treaty (and several more of each are pending Parliamentary approvals in Uruguay and/or the partner
country). Importantly, an information exchange treaty with Argentina that includes double taxation
components has been submitted to Parliament. As for AML/CFT, as noted in the FSAP Update, the
authorities adopted in August 2012 a new National Strategy against money laundering and
amended the 2009 law to expand the scope for information sharing on terrorist financing.

STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
Uruguay has experienced a decade of record-strong and inclusive growth. This record is
a result of prudent macroeconomic policies, institutional reforms, and favorable external factors, and
has resulted in significant welfare gains.
36.
The outlook is favorable but with risks and challenges. Growth is slowing toward
potential, but inflation remains well above target. Inflation reflects robust domestic demand,
insufficiently tight monetary policy, extensive wage indexation, food price shocks, and an inflation
targeting framework that is not anchoring expectations. Short-term capital inflows are presenting
monetary policy with difficult choices between lowering inflation and avoiding a sharp appreciation.
And the economy is being affected by global and regional headwinds and tailwinds. Risks to the
outlook are two-sided and relate to further spillovers from abroad and domestic wage and cost
developments.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

URUGUAY

37.
Uruguay is in a reasonably good position to tackle these challenges but policy space is
limited. The financial system is small, sound, and liquid, and there are no generalized credit or real
estate bubbles in the economy. Deft debt management has reduced public debt vulnerabilities
significantly. And the central bank and the government have substantial foreign exchange buffers to
help cushion large shocks. While Uruguay has lost competitiveness vis-à-vis some trading partners
over the last year, the peso still seems broadly in line with fundamentals, though a sharp and
sustained real appreciation could alter this assessment.
38.
Tackling inflation is a priority. Having inflation and inflation expectations stable at the
mid-point of the target range would create room for monetary policy to respond to downturns and
capital inflows, and help reduce dollarization and indexation.
39.
Thus, staff supports the recent increases in the policy rate and reserve requirements.
While this is not the time for aggressive monetary tightening, maintaining a tightening bias to lower
actual and expected inflation toward the mid-point of target range is appropriate. However, the
pace of tightening should depend on the evolution of the economy and risks. The target’s influence
on inflation expectations could be strengthened with more explicit communication of the BCU’s
likely direction of policy stance, its conditional inflation forecast, and how it would respond to
shocks. More frequent policy meetings would also be useful.
40.
But monetary policy cannot fight inflation alone, given capital inflow concerns;
concerted efforts on other fronts are also necessary. In particular, fiscal policy could better
support monetary policy. At the same time, recent initiatives to cut/freeze some consumer prices
create distortions without addressing the root causes of inflation. In the view of the mission,
extensive wage indexation is a key reason why price shocks feed into wages and core inflation.
41.
Near-term fiscal policy could better support monetary policy. A neutral stance would in
principle be appropriate given the cycle, but a stronger counter-cyclical stance should be considered
to help monetary policy. While the larger deficit in 2012 is mostly on account of factors that do not
imply fiscal impulse, there has also been a substantial increase in real spending. Slower spending
would help moderate domestic demand, alleviate real appreciation pressures, and support
disinflation. It would also help secure the authorities’ target of reducing public debt to 45 percent of
GDP by 2015.
42.
Prudent wage growth is also essential. The upcoming wage negotiation round is key
given its wide coverage and its multi-year focus. The attempts to link real wage growth with sector
productivity growth are welcome, even though it will be challenging in practice. Flexibility to
reconsider wage agreements in case of an economic downturn will be important.
43.
Staff acknowledges the circumstances in which the recent temporary capital flow
management measure was introduced. The measure can be justified given the sharp spike in
foreign demand for central bank paper. Though it remains to be seen how effective the measure will
be in increasing monetary policy space, it would be important to use any such space to tackle
inflation.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

URUGUAY

44.
The floating exchange rate is a crucial part of the policy framework and a key shock
absorber. There is no clear need for further reserve accumulation for prudential reasons. However,
occasional intervention may be appropriate to avoid excessive exchange rate swings. Sector-specific
competitiveness problems are best handled through structural policies.
45.
In the case of downside external shocks, the policy response should be prudent and
pragmatic (as in the past). The floating exchange rate should be the first defense. Monetary easing
could proceed so long as inflation expectations have become reasonably anchored. As in the past,
reserve requirements could be cut to mitigate the risk of a credit crunch. Automatic fiscal stabilizers
should be allowed to operate, though in a lasting downturn the fiscal space would be limited by the
need to preserve prudent debt dynamics. The sizable liquidity buffers can be used in a sudden stop.
46.
A long-term policy challenge is to bolster growth prospects and reduce output
volatility. Actions on many fronts will be needed. Infrastructure plans in the energy and
transportation sectors are welcome. Ensuring a dynamic labor market is also important for fostering
productivity growth and facilitating adjustment to shocks, while ensuring appropriate protection for
workers.
47.
The prudent fiscal policy management could be enhanced further in view of mediumterm challenges. The budget could usefully be cast on a rolling five-year horizon and include even
longer horizons for certain items (e.g., social spending). In this context, it is appropriate that the
contingent liabilities in Banco de Seguros del Estado are receiving attention.
48.
There is scope to strengthen financial sector resilience further and bolster mediumterm growth by building on recent progress, drawing on the recent FSAP Update. A strategy to
develop a capital market that promotes efficient allocation of financial resources is needed. In the
area of pensions, it would be opportune to review the foreign investment mandate for pension
funds, and to start providing pension savers with different portfolio options tailored to their needs.
It will also be important to enhance financial crisis preparedness and contingency planning, and
ensure adequate funding for supervision. Finally, a dynamic, yet sound, banking system would
benefit from a more level playing field among banks.
49.

Staff proposes that Uruguay remains on the 12-month Article IV consultation cycle.

Box 2. Uruguay: The Monetary Policy Stance 1/


Despite significant monetary tightening, the policy
rate (9 percent) remains below the level consistent with
keeping actual and expected inflation at the target range
within the 18-months policy horizon. The rate is also below
levels consistent with benchmarks such as the Taylor rule or
the level predicted by an estimated Taylor-rule linking BCU’s
policy rate to the output and inflation gaps for the period
1997Q1–2012Q22/. Measures of the neutral interest rate
(calculated as potential output growth plus actual or
expected inflation) are also some 400 basis points above the
current policy rate. At the same time, the gap between the
actual and the “predicted” policy interest rates likely
overstates the tightening needed to bring inflation to target
given the other policy actions (e.g., with respect to reserve
requirements).

Box 3. Uruguay: Recent Debt Management Operations
Pro-active debt management has improved the structure of Uruguay’s public debt significantly,
reducing vulnerabilities and contributing to the development of the local bond market. Importantly, in
recent years, the fraction of central government debt that is foreign currency denominated has been
reduced to below 50 percent.
Key debt operations in the past year include:

A large multi-purpose liability management operation in December 2011 consisting of an offer to
exchange various foreign currency-denominated bonds with new 2028 Global inflation-indexed (UI) bonds.

In the local market, the authorities are improving transparency and predictability, and intensifying
the issuance of benchmark bonds. The debt management office announced for the first time a six-month
issuance program equivalent to $600 million, including a 3-year nominal peso note maturing in 2015 and
two UI notes of 5 and 10-year maturities (due 2017 and 2022 respectively). The 3-year peso note will be
issued every month, and each of the UI notes every two months.

A primary dealer system is under consideration to encourage secondary-market trading and
improve liquidity. Reducing the frequency of regular auctions is also expected to enhance activity in the
secondary market and improve the efficiency of the yield curve.

There is also an effort to consolidate the market for securities issued by the central bank and the
Treasury and reduce sterilization costs. In March 2012, the Ministry of Finance carried out an exchange
operation, issuing local-currency and UI securities in exchange for BCU papers.

Box 4. Uruguay: Assessment of External Stability Risks
Staff’s assessment is that balance of payments risks
remain contained.

International Investment Position
(In percent of GDP)


Uruguay’s real effective exchange rate has appreciated
over the last decade and is now about 15 percent above its pre2002 crisis level. But productivity and global price gains in the
tradable sector have raised the equilibrium rate and CGER and
EBA estimates suggest that the peso is broadly aligned with
fundamentals and the current account is close to its estimated
medium-term norm.

Although a recent widening of the current account deficit
may suggest that the peso is on the strong side, at 3 percent of
GDP, the deficit is not so large as to raise immediate stability
concerns, especially since it is more than financed by FDI
(6.7 percent of GDP in 2012). And exports (except to Argentina
and Europe) remain robust. For the medium term, the deficit is
projected to stabilize at around 2 percent of GDP.


The growing importance of portfolio inflows, while welcome, is raising Uruguay’s exposure to
sudden stops. This risk is contained by the relatively small stock of short-term external liabilities and the
substantial foreign exchange reserves of the BCU and banks.

More broadly, the net international investment position has remained stable and gross assets and
liabilities have declined in recent years.

–––––––––––––––––––––––
Note: The MB approach calculates the difference between the medium-term current account (CA) balance and an estimated
equilibrium CA "norm". The ES approach calculates the difference between the actual CA balance and the NFA-stabilizing CA
balance. The real exchange rate gap is calculated to bring the current account balance in line with its NFA-stabilizing level or
medium-term MB norm. The ERER is estimated as a function of medium-term fundamentals. The new EBA approach (see
details in the IMF’s Pilot External Sector Report, July 2012) suggests that Uruguay’s CA balance is about 2 percentage points of
GDP above the estimated norm under desirable policies, implying a modest undervaluation of the REER (about 3.5 percent).

Box 5. Uruguay: The Recent Capital Flow Management Measure
On October 1 2012, the BCU introduced a capital flow management measure. Uruguay has a longstanding record of an open capital account. Since spring 2012, Uruguay has seen a sharp increase in
portfolio inflows, almost exclusively into government securities and central bank paper (letras de
regulación monetaria). To discourage flows into letras—which the BCU saw as interfering with its monetary
policy operations—the BCU introduced a 40 percent reserve requirement on non-resident purchases of
this instrument effective October 1. The reserve requirement does not apply to foreign purchases of other
instruments, including government securities. Hence, it is not intended or designed to stem all short-term
capital inflows. It is too early to say how effective the measure will be.
The context for this measure is as follows:


The Uruguayan peso is broadly in line with long-run fundamentals (see Box 4).


Uruguay has accumulated substantial foreign exchange reserves, which at 27 percent of GDP,
exceed most measures of prudential levels, including the Fund’s reserve metric (see Box 4). Intervention
has been limited after the measure and the peso has appreciated somewhat.

With inflation (9.1 percent) above the official target (4–6 percent), there is no room to lower policy
rates in Uruguay to discourage capital inflows. Indeed, further tightening appears necessary. While fiscal
policy is broadly neutral, a somewhat tighter stance would help support monetary policy in reducing
inflation. However, there is little scope to alter fiscal policy in a major way in the short run.


The BCU has stated it is a temporary measure.


The measure is designed to deal with the surging inflows into the BCU’s monetary policy
instrument that, according to the BCU, were undermining the efficiency of monetary operations. Since it is
the monetary policy instrument, the measure was not applied to residents’ purchases.

The capital inflows are not financing an expansion in bank credit. Hence, changes in the macroprudential framework were not necessary.

ANNEX I. SPILLOVERS FROM ABROAD-HOW IMPORTANT ARE THEY FOR
URUGUAY'S GDP?
Uruguay is a small, very open economy affected by developments in the global economy through
trade, tourism, and investment flows, as well as
Business Cycles in Argentina, Brazil, and
commodity price fluctuations. Its two key
Uruguay 1/
partners, Argentina and Brazil, account for about
15

a third of merchandise exports. During the last
10
decade, Argentina’s share has fallen from 18 to 7
5
0
percent, while that of Brazil has stayed around
-5
20 percent. The last decade also saw a growing
-10
share of emerging Asia and other Latin American
-15
countries in Uruguay’s exports. In addition to
-20
being a key trade partner, Argentina is also an

(percent of trend).
the importance of various external shocks for
Uruguay’s output fluctuations, and the extent to
which global shocks are transmitted to Uruguay via Argentina and Brazil.
To estimate the responses of the Uruguayan economy to external shocks, we follow the
methodology used in Chapter 4 of the April 2012 Western Hemisphere Regional Economic Outlook
(REO). We estimate a vector autoregressive (VAR) model that includes Uruguay’s real GDP growth
and a set of external variables: global GDP growth, GDP growth in Argentina, GDP growth in Brazil,
commodity prices, and global financial conditions (as measured by the VIX).1 The model is estimated
using quarterly data for the period 1990Q1–2011Q4.2
The VAR is run in three specifications. In the first specification, all variables are considered
endogenous. In the second specification, Brazil’s GDP enters as exogenous. In the third specification,
Argentina’s GDP enters as exogenous. In the second and third specifications, the estimated
responses to global shocks exclude the impact that is transmitted through Brazil and Argentina,
respectively. Thus, comparing the estimated response to global shocks in the first and second (third)
models gives the share of the global shock transmitted through Brazil (Argentina). These shares
reflect both the sensitivity of Brazil’s (Argentina’s) output to global shocks, and the effect of that
response on Uruguay.
_________________________________
1

Commodity prices are measured by a broad price index, in real terms and stripped of exchange rate effects (as in
“Intra-regional spillovers in South America; Is Brazil systemic after all?” by G. Adler and S. Sosa, IMF Working Paper
12/145, June 2012).
2
The model is estimated in first differences of log levels (except the VIX, which is in levels), using two lags. Structural
parameters are identified by Choleski decomposition. The ordering, from more exogenous to more endogenous
variables, is as follows: first the global variables, second, growth in Brazil and Argentina, and finally, Uruguayan
output.

37

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

URUGUAY

The impulse responses in Figure A1.2 confirm that Uruguay is subject to spillovers from Brazil.
Shocks are transmitted quickly, and most of the response takes place within the first four quarters,
and then it fades. Positive shocks to global GDP and commodity prices also have expansionary
effects on Uruguay’s GDP, while a rise in the VIX has contractionary effects. Finally, spillovers from
Argentina stand out as particularly important. The impact on Uruguay from a shock to Argentina’s
GDP is bigger and more persistent than the impact from a shock to Brazil’s GDP.
The peak cumulative impact of a 1 percentage point increase in Brazil’s growth is about
0.2 percentage points for Uruguay, and it peaks within 1–2 quarters. The effect from a shock of the
same magnitude in Argentina and the rest of the world are 1.1 and 1.3 percentage points,
respectively. However, the sensitivity to growth in

1/ Shaded areas represent actual data. Individual shocks are permanent one-half standard deviation shocks. Figures
in the boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the baseline and scenario being presented.
Ten-year historical average for the variable is also shown.
2/ For historical scenarios, the historical averages are calculated over the ten-year period, and the information is
used to project debt dynamics five years ahead.
3/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and primary balance.
4/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent and 10 percent of GDP shock to contingent liabilities occur in 2012,
with real depreciation defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local
currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangement. The currency is the Uruguayan peso (Ur$). Uruguay has
followed an independently floating exchange rate regime since July 29, 2002. Since September 2007,
monetary policy uses the policy rate, and no longer monetary targets, as intermediate instrument. In
2008, Uruguay’s de facto exchange rate regime was reclassified from a managed float with no
predetermined path for the exchange rate to a floating exchange rate regime. On October 31, 2012,
the exchange rate in the official market was Ur$19.906 per U.S. dollar. Uruguay has accepted the
obligations of Article VIII and maintains an exchange rate system free of restrictions on payments
and transfers for current international transactions.

ANNEX III. RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of September 31, 2012)
The Inter-American Development Bank’s Board of Executive Directors approved in August 2011 the
new Country Strategy with Uruguay (2010–2015). Sovereign-guaranteed lending under the new
program is expected to reach approximately US$1.8 billion, which is considered to be consistent
with Uruguay’s five year budget. The program includes additional non reimbursable financing for
technical assistance and analytical work. Lending under the previous Country Strategy (2005–2009)
reached approximately US$1.3 billion.
Under the new Strategy, the national authorities and the Bank identified the following priority
sectors in which the IDB Group would focus both its financial and non-financial products and
services: (i) transport; (ii) energy; (iii) water, sanitation, and solid waste; (iv) science and technology;
(v) social protection; (vi) education and job training; (vii) agribusiness; (viii) services exports; (ix)
public management and finances; and (x) urban development and citizen security. It is also expected
that all four of the Bank’s private sector windows will approve loans and technical assistance in the
energy, transport, agribusiness and global services sectors. The strategic areas were selected taking
into account: (i) a context of strong economic growth, which imposes heavy investment
requirements on a number of sectors; (ii) business opportunities, which in turn contribute to the
Bank’s institutional goals within the framework of the 9th General Capital Increase; (iii) greater
complementarity between the multilateral financial institutions working in Uruguay; (iv) the Bank’s
accumulated operational experience and technical knowledge from having worked for several
decades in the country; and (v) the government’s interest for continued IDB engagement.
As of September 30th 2012, the Bank’s portfolio in Uruguay includes loans for the financing of 45
projects; five of which are without sovereign guarantee. The lending portfolio amounts to
US$1,693.0MM, of which US$866.9MM are pending disbursement. Disbursements in 2012 are
expected to total US$137MM. The current portfolio includes lending to support the Government in
the following sectors: infrastructure and environment (18 loans adding US$726.2MM and
representing 43% of the approved amounts); social sector (4 loans adding US$97.2MM, representing
6% of the approved amounts); institutional capacity and finance (15 loans adding US$295.8MM and
representing 17% of the approved amounts) and integration and trade (3 loans, adding
6

URUGUAY

US$27.0 MM; 2% of the approved amounts). The portfolio also includes 5 loans to the private sector
for US$547MM (32% of the approved amounts).
In 2012, the Bank approved loans to the public sector in the areas of transportation (US$80MM),
local development and municipal management (US$70MM), water and sanitation (US$36.25MM),
entrepreneurship (US$8MM), public safety (US$5MM), institutional capacity (US$3 MM) as well as a
non-sovereign guaranteed loan of US$65MM loan to an agribusiness company.

ANNEX IV. STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of November 12, 2012)

I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but broadly adequate for surveillance. Most
affected area is national accounts.
National Accounts: In 2009, the Uruguayan authorities completed a revision of national
accounts statistics, in which they updated the benchmark year (from 1983 to 1997 and 2005) and
adopted the System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA93). However, national accounts statistics still
have a number of shortcomings, limited coverage of the enterprise survey, long publication lags,
inadequate information on the informal economy, extensive use of fixed input-output ratios from
1997, and incomplete quarterly accounts. Household consumption is not independently derived
and changes in inventories are obtained as residuals. The central bank (BCU) compiles and
disseminates annual GDP estimates in current and at previous year prices by the production and
expenditure approaches, as well as quarterly constant price GDP estimates by the production and
expenditure approaches. Gross national income, gross disposable income and gross savings are
also available annually.
Consumer Prices: Both the consumer and wholesale price indices are reported on a regular and
timely basis for publication in the IFS. The new base period for the consumer price index is
December 2010 = 100. The CPI has national coverage and includes nearly fifty thousand price
quotations. It does not cover either the implicit rent or the net acquisitions of owner-occupied
dwellings. The base of the wholesale price index has been updated to 2001. Producer price
indices (March 2010 =100) for national products have been recently disseminated. The PPI does
not cover services and exported output. The authorities do not provide trade price and volume
indices for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS).
Government Finance Statistics: Official data on the central administration, the state enterprises
and the social security system are complete and current, but there are problems with the
timeliness of the data on local governments. There are also problems with the timeliness of
financing and debt data reported for inclusion in the Fund’s statistical publications. Information
on a monthly and quarterly basis for financing and debt data respectively, are disseminated on
the BCU website from 1999 onwards for the central government and total public sector, but no
information is reported for publication in the International Financial Statistics. The information
reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook covers transactions on
revenue and expense for the consolidated central government (data on revenue and expense for
local governments have not been reported since 1994), and the general government’s operations
on financial assets and liabilities, both in terms of flows (financing) and stocks (debt).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

URUGUAY

I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Monetary and financial statistics are prepared in accordance
with the IMF's Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (2000). Authorities report monetary data
for the central bank, other depository corporations, and other financial corporations (OFCs) using
the standardized reporting forms (SRFs). However, data for the OFCs are limited to off-shore
financial institutions. A mission could be fielded in FY 2014 to expand the institutional coverage
of the OFCs and compile the SRF for OFCs with full institutional coverage. Authorities reported
annual financial soundness indicators (FSIs) for 2008, 2009, and 2010, but only 2008 data have
been disseminated due to unresolved problems in the 2009 and 2010 data. Historical series,
revisions to 2009 and 2010 data, and updates have not been submitted.
External Sector Statistics: Balance of payments statements are compiled and published on a
quarterly basis. Data are compiled following the recommendations of the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual. Uruguay compiles and reports to STA quarterly data on balance of
payments and annual data on the international investment position (IIP) for publication in the IFS
and the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook. New surveys are allowing for improved
coverage of the private sector in the IIP.
Uruguay started disseminating the international reserves and foreign currency liquidity data
template on the Fund’s external website in 2005. The BCU also disseminates quarterly external
debt statistics on its website, although not in the format envisaged by the SDDS.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Uruguay subscribed to the SDDS in
February 2004 and is in observance.

Data ROSC published on October 1, 2001.
A data ROSC mission on CPI and NA was
conducted in August 2012.

III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
Annual GFS are regularly reported to STA for publication in the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook. No high frequency GFS are reported for publication in the International Financial
Statistics.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Uruguay

On December 10, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the 2012 Article IV consultation with Uruguay, and considered and endorsed the
staff appraisal without a meeting.1
Background
Uruguay has experienced a decade of record-strong growth since its 2002 crisis. This record is
a result of prudent macroeconomic policies, institutional reforms, and favorable external
factors, and it has resulted in significant welfare gains.
The economy is now slowing toward potential. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth is
projected at 3½ percent in 2012 and 4 percent in 2013. Annual inflation (9.1 percent in
October) remains well above the target range (4-6 percent). Recently, the central bank
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,

usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff
prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the
discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors,
and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in
summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

tightened reserve requirements and notched up the policy interest rate, after a pause following
significant monetary tightening in December 2011. At the same time, burgeoning portfolio
inflows have created currency appreciation pressures. Effective October 2012, the central
bank introduced a reserve requirement on foreign purchases of central bank securities. The
fiscal deficit has widened in 2012 mostly due to one-off factors.
The baseline outlook is positive but with risks and challenges. Uruguay’s economic and
financial vulnerabilities are relatively small, and the government has reduced debt
vulnerabilities significantly and built important financial buffers. Still, policy space is limited by
inflation and debt considerations, and the economy is exposed to the risk of a deteriorating
global outlook and risks from domestic wage and cost pressures. The longer-term policy
challenge is to bolster growth prospects and reduce output volatility.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the Article IV consultation with Uruguay, Executive Directors endorsed staff’s
appraisal as follows:
Uruguay has experienced a decade of record-strong and inclusive growth. This record is a
result of prudent macroeconomic policies, institutional reforms, and favorable external factors,
and has resulted in significant welfare gains.
The outlook is favorable but with risks and challenges. Growth is slowing toward potential, but
inflation remains well above target. Inflation reflects robust domestic demand, insufficiently
tight monetary policy, extensive wage indexation, food price shocks, and an inflation targeting
framework that is not anchoring expectations. Short-term capital inflows are presenting
monetary policy with difficult choices between lowering inflation and avoiding a sharp
appreciation. And the economy is being affected by global and regional headwinds and
tailwinds. Risks to the outlook are two-sided and relate to further spillovers from abroad and
domestic wage and cost developments.
Uruguay is in a reasonably good position to tackle these challenges but policy space is limited.
The financial system is small, sound, and liquid, and there are no generalized credit or real
estate bubbles in the economy. Deft debt management has reduced public debt vulnerabilities
significantly. And the central bank and the government have substantial foreign exchange
buffers to help cushion large shocks. While Uruguay has lost competitiveness vis-à-vis some
trading partners over the last year, the peso still seems broadly in line with fundamentals,
though a sharp and sustained real appreciation could alter this assessment.

3
Tackling inflation is a priority. Having inflation and inflation expectations stable at the mid-point
of the target range would create room for monetary policy to respond to downturns and capital
inflows, and help reduce dollarization and indexation.
Thus, staff supports the recent increases in the policy rate and reserve requirements. While
this is not the time for aggressive monetary tightening, maintaining a tightening bias to lower
actual and expected inflation toward the mid-point of target range is appropriate. However, the
pace of tightening should depend on the evolution of the economy and risks. The target’s
influence on inflation expectations could be strengthened with more explicit communication of
the BCU’s likely direction of policy stance, its conditional inflation forecast, and how it would
respond to shocks. More frequent policy meetings would also be useful.
But monetary policy cannot fight inflation alone, given capital inflow concerns; concerted
efforts on other fronts are also necessary. In particular, fiscal policy could better support
monetary policy. At the same time, recent initiatives to cut/freeze some consumer prices
create distortions without addressing the root causes of inflation. In the view of the mission,
extensive wage indexation is a key reason why price shocks feed into wages and core
inflation.
Near-term fiscal policy could better support monetary policy. A neutral stance would in
principle be appropriate given the cycle, but a stronger counter-cyclical stance should be
considered to help monetary policy. While the larger deficit in 2012 is mostly on account of
factors that do not imply fiscal impulse, there has also been a substantial increase in real
spending. Slower spending would help moderate domestic demand, alleviate real appreciation
pressures, and support disinflation. It would also help secure the authorities’ target of reducing
public debt to 45 percent of GDP by 2015.
Prudent wage growth is also essential. The upcoming wage negotiation round is key given its
wide coverage and its multi-year focus. The attempts to link real wage growth with sector
productivity growth are welcome, even though it will be challenging in practice. Flexibility to
reconsider wage agreements in case of an economic downturn will be important.
Staff acknowledges the circumstances in which the recent temporary capital flow management
measure was introduced. The measure can be justified given the sharp spike in foreign
demand for central bank paper. Though it remains to be seen how effective the measure will
be in increasing monetary policy space, it would be important to use any additional space to
tackle inflation.

4
The floating exchange rate is a crucial part of the policy framework and a key shock absorber.
There is no clear need for further reserve accumulation for prudential reasons. However,
occasional intervention may be appropriate to avoid excessive exchange rate swings. Sectorspecific competitiveness problems are best handled through structural policies.
In the case of downside external shocks, the policy response should be prudent and pragmatic
(as in the past). The floating exchange rate should be the first defense. Monetary easing could
proceed so long as inflation expectations have become reasonably anchored. As in the past,
reserve requirements could be cut to mitigate the risk of a credit crunch. Automatic fiscal
stabilizers should be allowed to operate, though in a lasting downturn the fiscal space would
be limited by the need to preserve prudent debt dynamics. The sizable liquidity buffers can be
used in a sudden stop.
A long-term policy challenge is to bolster growth prospects and reduce output volatility. Actions
on many fronts will be needed. Infrastructure plans in the energy and transportation sectors
are welcome. Ensuring a dynamic labor market is also important for fostering productivity
growth and facilitating adjustment to shocks, while ensuring appropriate protection for workers.
The prudent fiscal policy management could be enhanced further in view of medium-term
challenges. The budget could usefully be cast on a rolling five-year horizon and include even
longer horizons for certain items (e.g., social spending). In this context, it is appropriate that
the contingent liabilities in Banco de Seguros del Estado are receiving attention.
There is scope to strengthen financial sector resilience further and bolster medium-term
growth by building on recent progress, drawing on the recent FSAP Update. A strategy to
develop a capital market that promotes efficient allocation of financial resources is needed. In
the area of pensions, it would be opportune to review the foreign investment mandate for
pension funds, and to start providing pension savers with different portfolio options tailored to
their needs. It will also be important to enhance financial crisis preparedness and contingency
planning, and ensure adequate funding for supervision. Finally, a dynamic, yet sound, banking
system would benefit from a more level playing field among banks.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
