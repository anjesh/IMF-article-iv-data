private sector analysts, and academics. Mr. Swinburne (MFD) joined the
mission for wrap-up meetings on the FSAP. Mr. Solheim, the Executive
Director, participated in the discussions.

•

Norway has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the
Articles of Agreement. Its payment system is free of restrictions on current
transactions. Norway’s statistics are satisfactory for surveillance. Norway is a
member of the European Economic Area (EEA), which provides for free
movement of goods, services, labor, and capital with the European Union.

•

A minority center right coalition took office in September 2001. National
elections are scheduled for September 2005.

•

At the time of the last consultation, concluded on March 22, 2004 (PIN 04/30),
Executive Directors commended Norway’s strong economic and policy record.
Directors strongly encouraged the authorities to take advantage of the recovery
to reduce the structural non-oil central government budget deficit to 4 percent
of Government Petroleum Fund assets, in accordance with the fiscal guidelines.
In view of population aging, they urged the authorities to reform pensions and
examine further measures to ensure long-term sustainability. Directors
welcomed recent measures to enhance labor supply while calling for reform of
the sickness and disability programs.

•

The authorities intend to publish this report.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
•

Economic growth rebounded strongly from a brief slowdown that began in late 2002.
GDP is expected to grow at above-potential rates in both 2005 and 2006. As a result,
the output gap is expected to close this year, and inflationary pressures to begin to
rise. In addition, declines in the prices of some domestic services and imported goods,
which have held inflation well below the 2.5 percent target, appear to be waning.

•

Petroleum revenues guarantee strong fiscal and current account surpluses for many
years. However, the non-oil central government structural deficit has consistently
exceeded the target set in Norway’s fiscal guidelines, and the 2005 budget involves
further slippage despite strong growth and high oil prices.

Policy discussions and assessment
•

The monetary stance should begin to tighten in the course of this year. This is widely
anticipated by private sector analysts, especially after Norges Bank, in late February,
signaled a shift from a policy of maintaining low rates.

•

The inflation targeting framework, in place since 2001, has been gaining credibility,
and recent changes have further improved transparency. Nevertheless, exchange rate
appreciation remains a concern of many in Norway, and the authorities should
therefore continue their efforts to communicate both the framework and policy stance.

•

The authorities should make a greater effort to close the gap between the deficit and
the rule specified by the fiscal guidelines (which were also adopted in 2001).
Otherwise, the credibility of the guidelines may be jeopardized, which could put
unwanted upward pressure on the currency. In this vein, staff also recommended the
adoption of a medium-term fiscal plan. Staff welcomed the tax reform in the 2005
budget, but argued for higher property taxes.

•

The FSAP found the financial system in good health and well supervised. Concern
was expressed that the high growth of consumer debt could, over time, pose an
increasing risk. The FSSA makes a number of recommendations.

•

Labor market performance, while strong by international comparison, may be
threatened by the rapid growth of the sickness and disability programs. The former
was tightened somewhat, and time lost from sickness fell last year, but more
administrative measures will probably be needed and staff recommends the
authorities re-examine very high replacement rates. Product markets are becoming
more competitive, and the new competition law should help. However, progress in
reducing the very high level of state ownership has been slow.

-4-

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Norway has enjoyed strong economic performance, underpinned by a sound
macroeconomic policy framework (Figure 1).
•

Real GDP growth has generally outpaced the EU average and labor markets perform
very well by international comparison, with relatively high employment and
participation rates, and low unemployment rates (Table 1). Norway’s policy
initiatives have in many, though not all, cases been consistent with Fund
recommendations (Box 1).

•

Large oil and gas revenues—Norway is the third largest oil exporter in the world—
ensure substantial fiscal and current account surpluses for many years (Table 2). The
bulk of these revenues have been invested abroad by the Government Petroleum Fund
(GPF), and fiscal guidelines are in place to control the non-oil fiscal deficit (Box 2),
although the key 4-percent rule has not been met in the three years (2002–04) since
its inception.

•

Monetary policy has achieved low and stable core inflation. Since 2001, policy has
been governed by a flexible inflation target.1 Norges Bank (NB) aims for a core
inflation rate of 2.5 percent over a 1-to-3 year horizon (changed last year from a
2-year horizon to allow for situations for which a somewhat larger horizon is
appropriate).

2.
The economy has recovered strongly from a mild slowdown in late 2002. In a
successful bid to contain rising wage demands, NB held its policy rate near 7 percent through
most of 2002, resulting in a significant appreciation of the krone and slower economic
activity. With inflationary pressure easing, NB reversed course in late 2002 and cut interest
rates sharply through 2003, unwinding the currency appreciation. In March 2004, the
intervention rate was set at 1.75 percent, where it has remained since (Figure 2). This
supportive monetary stance, high oil prices (which stimulated investment), rising house
prices, strengthening consumer and business confidence, and an improved world economy all
contributed to a 3.5 percent increase in real mainland GDP in 2004, well above the staff
estimate of potential of 2½ percent.2

See the 2002 staff report (IMF Country Report 03/77), Box 1; and J. Soikkeli “The inflation targeting
framework in Norway” (IMF working paper 02/184).

2

Henceforth, “GDP” will refer to mainland GDP—excluding the oil and gas sector. In 2004, total GDP grew
less than (mainland) GDP because of planned oilfield maintenance and, to a lesser extent, brief strikes.

Box 1. Policy Recommendations and Implementation
Monetary policy. In light of very low inflation, the Fund recommended maintaining a
supportive stance until the recovery took hold, a policy Norges Bank has followed. The Fund
has also recommended policy transparency, which has been enhanced by the governor’s
appearances before parliament, continued outside evaluation of policy by Norges Bank
Watch, and, more recently, publishing the monetary strategy document at the beginning of
the strategy period.
Fiscal policy. The Fund recommended the non-oil central government structural budget
deficit be reduced more rapidly to 4 percent of the Government Petroleum Fund (as specified
in Norway’s fiscal guidelines). However, the 2005 budget involved further slippage relative
to that target. Nor have the authorities introduced a multi-year fiscal plan. On the other hand,
consistent with Fund recommendations, they have submitted to parliament the package of
reforms proposed by a high level pension commission, and have in the 2005 budget
implemented most of the recommendations of a high level tax commission, including a
reduction in labor taxation.
Structural policy. Consistent with Fund recommendations, somewhat tighter administrative
controls were placed on the sickness program, but the authorities have not considered
lowering the high replacement rates. On product markets, competition has increased, perhaps
reflecting in part the new competition law, but progress in privatization has been limited.

- 10 -

Box 2. The Fiscal Policy Framework
To deal with the very large and growing inflow of petroleum revenue, Norway
established the Government Petroleum Fund (GPF) in 1990. Formally an account with
Norges Bank, which manages it, the GPF has, since 1995, invested the bulk of
petroleum revenue abroad in a portfolio of stocks and bonds. Annual reports detail the
investment strategy and performance relative to a benchmark set by the government. In
early 2005, the assets of the GPF were 78 percent of GDP.
Fiscal guidelines, adopted in 2001 and effective beginning with the 2002 budget,
specify that the non-oil central government structural deficit be 4 percent (the assumed
long-run real rate of return) of the assets of the GPF.1 Temporary deviations from this
4-percent rule are permitted over the business cycle, or in the event of extraordinary
changes in the value of the GPF.
The fiscal guidelines were designed to meet a number of policy objectives. The first is
intergenerational equity. Petroleum extraction can be viewed as a transformation, rather
than the creation, of wealth from natural resources to financial assets; the 4-percent rule
preserves the real value of those assets. The second is to allow some current spending
of oil revenue, in part to meet political pressures. Since the GPF will continue to grow
for some decades, the guidelines imply the non-oil budget will have a small, but
persistent, expansionary bias. The third is to mitigate the possible Dutch disease effects
of spending oil revenues immediately; this also explains why the GPF is invested
abroad. And the fourth is to insulate the annual budget from shifts in oil prices and the
like, while maintaining a role for fiscal policy in macroeconomic stabilization; this
explains the role of the temporary deviations.

The labor market is tightening, but wage pressures remain contained (Figure 3).
Employment has picked up, while the unemployment rate edged down to 4.4 percent in
January 2005, from 4.6 percent in mid-2003. The economic slowdown, subsequent low
inflation, and labor inflows from the enlarged EU reduced nominal wage increases to
3¾ percent in 2004, compared with more than 5 percent a year during 1999–2003. Real
wages rose significantly because of very low rates of inflation, but productivity-improving
rationalizations recently undertaken by enterprises left unit costs broadly stable. In a longer
perspective, however, high wage increases relative to trading partners have caused a
deterioration in competitiveness, raising concerns about the health of the export and importcompeting sectors (the “exposed sector”)
4.
Inflation has been surprisingly low, in part because of structural factors. Core
inflation has been near 1 percent, well below the inflation target, since late 2003. This
development has surprised virtually all observers, including Fund staff and NB. While the
emergence of excess capacity in 2003 reduced inflationary pressures, two structural factors
played an unexpectedly important role in holding down prices. Import prices have been
falling, reflecting trends in world prices of some manufactures (especially electronics and
clothing) and an increasing share of imports from low-price countries (principally China and
India); and domestic competitive forces intensified in the retail, air transportation, and
telecommunication sectors, cutting margins and consumer prices.3

Discussions on macroeconomic policies focused on the appropriate monetary stance in view
of recent and prospective economic developments, the need to adhere to the fiscal rule, and
pension reform. Discussions on structural reforms centered on the sickness and disability
programs and, for product markets, on competition and privatization.

world economy would, of course, adversely affect
Norway, both through exports and, perhaps, falling oil prices. Finally, inflation could rise
faster than expected should the structural factors that have restrained prices suddenly
dissipate.
Monetary policy
8.
The mission argued that inflationary pressures were beginning to surface and
NB should therefore start withdrawing monetary stimulus during 2005. With a closing
output gap and tightening labor markets, pressures on prices and wages would rise. The
baseline inflation forecast from the model developed in Chapter I of the selected issues paper
is similar to that in NB Inflation Report 1/05. Contractual wages are governed by two-year
settlements, and with 2005 being an interim year, wage increases were set to be moderate.
However, continued robust growth would mean that the more important negotiations for
2006–07 would take place in the context of tighter labor markets. The mission noted that the
substantial falls in import and service prices appeared to have largely come to an end, which
would tend to boost the inflation numbers. Finally, low interest rates have helped fuel very
high credit growth, especially to households, which provided a further impetus to growth and
could eventually prove a risk to the financial system.
Import price declines are easing.

Domestic services prices are no longer falling.

9.
The authorities broadly agreed with this analysis, and private analysts were
anticipating interest rate increases about mid-year. The authorities emphasized that the
period of very low rates had been appropriate, especially in order to prevent deflationary
expectations from taking hold. However, in the governor’s annual address in late February,
NB signaled a shift toward a policy of gradual tightening by emphasizing that interest rates,
which were well below normal, had succeeded in stimulating economic activity, and noting
that other central banks had already begun to raise rates.5 Private-sector analysts reacted to
this speech by moving forward their estimate of when rates would begin to rise from
September to mid-year.
10.
The flexible inflation targeting framework appears to have gained credibility.
Staff analysis suggests that NB successfully implemented the inflation target and the
transition from the previous exchange-rate stabilization policy was smooth.6 According to
surveys, medium-term inflation expectations are anchored near 2.5 percent and in the
authorities’ view the framework was well accepted and understood. The mission’s
discussions with private-sector analysts revealed progress in this regard compared to past
years, but also the perception that NB has been, and should be, careful to avoid an exchange
rate appreciation.7
11.
Transparency has been further improved. NB now publishes the monetary policy
strategy document with the inflation report—that is, at the beginning rather than the end of
the strategy period—and provides more details regarding the interest-rate decision in the
press release following policy meetings. The mission suggested that transparency might be
further enhanced by publishing minutes of the policy meetings, as some other central banks
do. The authorities argued this would be inappropriate, noting that the practice is far from
universal, NB press releases are already informative, and NB’s Executive Board is composed
mainly of part-time members.

5

The last point should be seen in the context of earlier statements by NB that it would not raise rates ahead of
other central banks, which were meant to signal that the accommodative stance would continue.
6

Chapter 2 of the selected issues paper estimates monetary policy reaction functions for a number of inflation
targeting countries, including Norway. It shows that NB has been targeting inflation, rather than output or the
exchange rate, and its credibility has increased over time.
7

See, for example, “Norges Bank Watch 2005,” which argues not only for the primacy of the inflation target,
but also that NB should apply it more flexibly in order to help stabilize the exchange rate.

- 19 -

Fiscal policy
12.
The key issue was the persistent deviation from the 4-percent fiscal rule, and the
effect on fiscal credibility. Since its inception in 2002, the rule has never been met. The
mission agreed with the authorities that

contrast, had the 2004 budget’s
medium-term deficit path been maintained, higher oil revenues would have closed the gap in
2007. The authorities agreed that this slippage was difficult to square with the guidelines.
13.
Against this backdrop, the mission argued that slippage relative to the 2005
budget needed to be avoided. Any increases in oil revenues should be used to narrow the
gap with the 4-percent rule (rather than to increase the non-oil deficit), and savings from
unexpectedly lower spending on sickness benefits should be used for deficit reduction. Also,
the mission judged that restraint in the 2006 budget would be critical in ensuring the return to
the 4-percent rule. The authorities agreed that slippage or further deviation from the rule next
year would be difficult to reconcile with the fiscal guidelines.
14.
The mission recommended returning to the 4-percent rule sooner than envisaged
in the budget. In the mission’s view, continued breaches of the rule, especially when not
warranted by the circumstances envisaged in the broader guidelines, risked undermining the
credibility of medium-term fiscal policy. This, in turn, could put unwanted upward pressure
on the real exchange rate, aggravating possible “Dutch disease” effects, the evidence for
which is somewhat mixed.8 Wage increases have tended to outstrip those elsewhere and the
real exchange rate, on a unit labor cost basis, has appreciated substantially in recent years. In
2004, the nominal exchange rate was about 33 percent overvalued compared to PPP (based
on WEO data). On the other hand, staff equilibrium current account analysis suggests the
krone is undervalued by 10–25 percent. Also, as stressed by the authorities, Norwegian
8

framework has tended to mitigate these effects.

- 20 -

industry seems to have dealt with any pressures: while manufacturing has declined in
importance over the years, this decline has not been larger than in other advanced economies.
The authorities pointed out, however, that this benign outcome may reflect the degree of
fiscal restraint in place: that is, Norway’s (non-oil) deficit has not risen significantly more
than in trading-partner countries. The authorities reported there were no adverse market
reaction to the 2005 budget, and emphasized their commitment to return to the 4-percent rule.
15.
The mission recommended a medium-term fiscal plan to buttress the existing
fiscal guidelines. Many other countries, including Sweden and Denmark, have successfully
used such frameworks to guide annual budgetary processes toward medium-term objectives.
The details of these policies vary, but key components include multi-year spending ceilings
and deficit objectives, as well as concrete measures to achieve them. The authorities replied
that they had considered this option, but decided against opening up the issue of fiscal
guidelines, in part because the outcome might be looser, not tighter, policy. They also noted
that they publish three-year fiscal projections, though these are not binding targets, and that
the current government had met its commitment to hold spending growth below the growth
of mainland GDP.
16.
The 2005 budget also included a tax reform package. The reform package, which
largely follows the recommendations of a high-level advisory committee, addresses the
growing problem of tax arbitrage between labor and capital income, in part by lowering labor
taxes; exempts companies from taxation of dividends and capital gains on shares (which will
fulfill the non-discrimination requirements of the EEA); and reduces the wealth tax. It also
raises the normal and reduced VAT rates by 1 percentage point, to 25 and 7 percent (but the
rate on food falls from 12 to 11 percent). However, the government did not implement the
committee’s recommendation to raise property taxes, which are low by international
comparison, but instead increased the advantage of housing by eliminating the tax on
imputed rent. The authorities noted that the imputed-rent tax was quite small and signaled a
reform to allow municipalities more scope to raise property taxes. On an accrual basis, the
reforms will reduce revenue by 0.3 percent of GDP in 2005.
B. Long-Term Fiscal Sustainability and Pension Reform
17.
The staff and the authorities agreed that the key long-term fiscal issue facing
Norway, as in many other countries, is the rise in spending associated with population
aging. According to official estimates, aging-related spending, mainly pensions, will rise by
almost 10 percent of GDP by 2050, one of the largest increases in Europe.9 Also, on current
9

The size of the increase mainly reflects the immaturity of the system. Many current pensioners are not earning
full benefits because they did not contribute for the 40 years needed to qualify, but they are being replaced by
those who did. Demographics are not particularly adverse. According to UN estimates, by 2050 the old-age
dependency ratio will rise by 17 percentage points in Norway, compared to 24 percentage points in western
Europe, 15 percentage points in Sweden, and 16 percentage points in Denmark. According to OECD data,
replacement rates are slightly below the OECD average (68.7 percent for an average earner).

- 21 -

estimates the return from petroleum wealth will fall short of covering the increase, even if the
4-percent rule is followed (Appendix I). Against this backdrop, the mission emphasized the
importance of adopting the government’s pension reform package this year (Box 3).
18.
The proposed reform package would cut long-term outlays, while the provisions
for life-expectancy adjustment and flexible retirement would also enhance work
incentives. To make these measures more effective, the mission recommended supporting
them by: (i) realigning the replacement rates of the disability program with those of the new
Box 3. Pension Reform
Following the lead of other Nordic countries, notably Sweden, the government has
proposed reforms to reduce costs and improve work incentives. These are based on
recommendations of the Pension Commission, which reported a year ago. Key costcutting reforms are: (i) relating pension benefits to lifetime income instead of the best
20 years; (ii) linking pension payments to life expectancy; and (iii) indexing pensions to
the average of wages and prices instead of wages. The first should also improve work
incentives by making pensions more actuarially fair. To strengthen long-term fiscal
discipline, the government also proposes to link the GPF and pensions by presenting in
the budget developments in the GPF and the National Pension Fund in relation to pension
obligations.
The Pension Commission estimated that these reforms would improve the fiscal
balance by 2–3 percent of GDP by 2050. While much of the reduction is due to the

substantial government subsidy to early retirement programs. The mission agreed with the
authorities that linking the GPF to pensions could help insulate it from political spending
pressures, but emphasized the importance of continuing to invest the funds abroad to avoid
“Dutch disease” effects. At the time of the consultation, both officials and private-sector
analysts were optimistic that the reforms would pass largely as proposed before the
September election.

Analysis by the authorities and staff implies, however, that further measures will
be required. Although long-term estimates of petroleum wealth are subject to great

C. Financial System
20.
Norway’s financial system is well managed, well supervised, and sound overall.
The recent Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) found that Norwegian banks are
currently well positioned to deal with potential risk factors, with sound capital positions,
strengthened risk management practices, and improved profitability (Figure 4). The insurance
and pensions sectors have reinforced their financial positions, assisted by stronger global
equity markets. However, life insurance companies and pension funds continue to face a
challenging environment and remain susceptible to adverse market movements.
21.
The rising level of household debt may become, over time, an increasingly
important risk factor. While overall debt servicing costs relative to incomes are not
currently high by historical standards, they are expected to rise; moreover, the distribution of
both debt and household asset buffers point to some groups, such as the young, being more
vulnerable than others. Given prospective increases in debt levels, a sharp rise in interest
rates––especially if coupled with significant declines in house prices or in household incomes
and employment––could hurt the banking sector. Since mortgage defaults are usually a last
resort, the main transmission mechanism may be that higher mortgage interest payments will
squeeze households, causing a fall in demand, which raises business-sector credit risk.
22.
The FSAP confirmed that Norway’s main payments system and its supervisory
arrangements compare very favorably with international standards. Unified financial
supervision is provided by the Financial Services Authority (FSA), which has adequate de
facto powers to ensure financial stability. The FSAP did, nevertheless, recommend a number
of measures (Box 4).

- 23 -

Box 4. FSAP: Summary of Key Recommendations1
Shorter-term stability-related issues
• Continue carefully monitoring the evolution of household debt and the housing
market; and examine whether banks have concentrations of exposures to more
vulnerable sub-groups of household borrowers.
• Given the reduced risk weighting of mortgages under Basel II, carefully consider
whether additional capital requirements for banks should be required under
“Pillar 2.”
• Continue to carefully monitor the risk of spillovers, in extreme events, resulting
from the two-tier payments arrangements (many smaller banks settle through
other banks rather than with NB), and examine the scope for increasing the use of
collateral in interbank market exposures
• Further reduce market and liquidity risks in the securities settlement and retail
payments systems.
• Continue working with other Nordic authorities to refine the framework for crossborder crisis management and coordination of last-resort lending; domestically,
ensure appropriately coordinated contingency plans in the unlikely event of a
major problem at the largest, partly state-owned bank, DNB-NOR.
Structural and longer-term issues
• Reexamine key aspects of the deposit guarantee arrangements, including whether
and how to achieve greater international comparability in coverage levels.
• Examine whether the netting of medium and smaller-sized interbank payments
could be phased out.
• Review the continued desirability of state ownership in DNB-NOR. In the

interim, consider further entrenching appropriate commercial autonomy and
accountability for the bank.

D. Structural Issues
23.
Though the labor market performs well (Figure 5), the sickness and disability
programs are an increasing cause for concern. These programs have expanded
substantially in the past decade, reducing available labor input (although total hours worked
shows no clear trend) and placing an increasing strain on public finances: outlays of the
National Insurance Scheme were 13.5 percent of GDP in 2004. Last year, hours lost to
sickness fell, probably reflecting tighter medical examinations, which began in July, 2004.
This fall, while encouraging, was small relative to past increases and the mission expressed
concern that it might not be sustained. The mission, therefore, argued for a review of the very
high replacement rates—100 percent for the sickness program—as well as tighter
administrative controls. The authorities suggested that raising the share of employers’
contributions to financing the sickness scheme would discourage firms from shifting
employees into the scheme.
Enrollment in welfare programs has risen.

The mission argued that further decentralizing wage bargains would enhance
economic efficiency. The narrow dispersion of wages may have impeded the reallocation of
labor and blunt incentives to accumulate human capital.11 The authorities argued that any
decentralization should be part of a wider reform package, as it could otherwise intensify
pressure for wage increases, leading to macroeconomic imbalances. They also noted that a
committee was reconsidering the 1977 employment protection law with a view to allowing
more flexibility in the labor market; new legislation was expected to be approved by the fall.

Product market performance appears to be improving, as competition has
increased. Last year, the competition law was strengthened and aligned with relevant EU
law. The Competition Authority has been active in a number of sectors, most recently
restricting pricing agreements on books. Public ownership remains very high, however,
including in a number of commercial enterprises. Significant institutional changes have been
implemented in recent years to insulate state-owned enterprises from political influence and
ensure that they operate on a purely commercial basis and on an equal footing with the
private sector. Nevertheless, the mission argued that state ownership in the commercial sector
should be reduced, since at levels prevalent in Norway it might lead to the perception of an
uneven playing field and, in any case, precluded normal buyouts and takeovers, important
mechanisms of corporate governance.
26.
Overall, Norway has a liberal external trade regime. In the context of the Doha
Development Agenda, Norway is seeking to improve market access for non-agricultural
products through comprehensive reductions of tariffs, further liberalize the services sector,
substantially reduce fisheries subsidies, and narrow the scope for protectionism under the
Anti-Dumping Agreement. However, agriculture products produced in Norway (which tend

- 28 -

to compete with European rather than developing country exports) remain heavily protected,
and the mission reiterated its long-standing advice to lower these barriers. The authorities
argued that agricultural protection was key to addressing non-trade concerns, such as rural
settlement, the environment, and food security. Norway’s ODA for 2005 is expected to be
about 1 percent of GNI, making it one of the few countries to exceed the UN target of 0.7
percent of GNI.
27.
The authorities expressed interest in a less frequent consultation cycle, in order
to allow the Fund to redeploy resources. The authorities emphasized the high value they
place on Fund surveillance, given also that they are not subject to EC surveillance. At the
same time, they judged that Norway is neither vulnerable nor systemically important, and
noted that main policy requirements did not change significantly from year-to-year. They
thus saw a case for moving from the current 12-month to an 18- or 24-month cycle. Staff
agreed that conditions appear conducive to some resource savings in the conduct of
surveillance over Norway in the coming years. In lieu of shifting to a longer cycle, with
implications for the continuity of surveillance, it noted instead the possibility of adopting the
less work-intensive procedure allowed under current guidelines and already used, to varying
degrees, for some Nordic countries.12 This consists in holding every other year shorter
discussions focused on issues of more immediate concern (with a concluding statement),
smaller mission teams, shorter staff reports, no other documentation, and lapse-of-time
conclusion by the Board (as per SM/96/214, Supplement 1).
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
The Norwegian economy continues to perform well on all fronts, underpinned by
a strong policy framework. Growth picked up strongly in 2004, after slowing the previous
year, and is expected to continue to be robust this year and next. Employment is also picking
up and the unemployment rate has begun to edge down. Core inflation has been well below
the 2.5 percent inflation target, reflecting the emergence of excess capacity during the
slowdown and a consequent moderation in wage pressures, but also falling prices for some
imported consumer goods and increases in domestic competition.
29.
The supportive monetary stance has been appropriate in view of very low
inflation, but the process of gradually withdrawing monetary stimulus should begin in
the course of the year. Robust economic growth has all but eliminated available economic
slack and indications are that the structural factors that have been holding prices down are
waning. Looking forward, with the next two-year wage settlement being negotiated in 2006,
it will be important to keep inflationary pressures in check. As Norges Bank raises interest
rates, pressures for currency appreciation are likely to intensify somewhat. This would be
part of the monetary transmission process and does not argue against a necessary tightening.
12

Finland and Sweden in 2000, and Sweden and Norway itself in 2002 (only as regards the lapse-of-time aspect
in the latter case).

- 29 -

The size of the appreciation, however, would be muted if the policy tightening is steady and
gradual, and is well communicated to markets.
30.
The framework of flexible inflation targeting and floating exchange rate is
serving Norway well. It is transparent and gaining credibility, although the authorities
should continue their efforts to enhance communication. Inflation rate expectations,
communications with market analysts, and the staff’s own work all suggest the inflation
targeting framework had become increasingly accepted. The authorities should continue to
build on this success by consistently explaining policy to markets, in particular by
emphasizing that the exchange rate is not an independent policy target. Recent measures to
further improve policy transparency are welcome, including the decision to publish the
monetary policy strategy document at the beginning of the strategy period and to provide a
more detailed discussion of interest rate decisions.
31.
While fiscal policy has been broadly prudent, and has thus helped mitigate any
“Dutch disease” problems, the recurring deviations from the key fiscal rule should be
corrected sooner than now envisaged. The real appreciation of the krone in recent years
has tended to put pressure on the exposed sector, but policies to limit non-oil deficits and
invest the bulk of petroleum revenues abroad appear to have mitigated Dutch disease effects.
Nevertheless, overruns relative to the 4-percent rule in 2004 and, especially, 2005 are
difficult to justify, either economically or in terms of the fiscal guidelines. If repeated or
increased, such deviations could undermine the credibility of this successful fiscal policy.
The authorities should, therefore, take advantage of current buoyant economic conditions to
return to the rule significantly sooner than currently envisaged. In 2005, slippage relative to
the budget should be avoided, any windfalls from higher oil prices should be used to narrow
the gap with the 4-percent rule, and lower-than-expected outlays on the sickness program
should be used to cut the deficit. The 2006 budget will also be crucial, as it offers an
opportunity to recover some of the ground lost in 2005.
32.
The fiscal guidelines should be buttressed by a medium-term fiscal plan. Key
components of such a plan should include spending ceilings and deficit objectives, as well as
concrete measures to achieve them. In Norway, a medium-term plan would at this point be
particularly useful to map out a specific and credible path for returning to the 4-percent rule.
Moreover, some of the building blocks are already in place: the Ministry of Finance has
begun publishing multi–year fiscal projections; and the government has adhered to its policy
of holding spending growth below GDP growth.
33.
The 2005 tax reforms are welcome, as they promise to reduce distortions and
promote employment. Nevertheless, they have resulted in housing becoming even more
favored than before, an issue that needs to be addressed in the next round of reforms. Also,
further tax reform should be accompanied by corresponding spending restraint, both to
hasten the return to the 4-percent fiscal rule and, over the longer term, ensure the
preservation of the GPF for future generations.

- 30 -

34.
The government’s proposed pension reforms are commendable. The measures
will help to contain cost increases while safeguarding adequate standards of living for the
retired. Perhaps more important, work incentives will improve, sustaining the tax base and
easing the financial strain on the pension program. To ensure that such benefits materialize,
complementary reforms to align disability and early retirement replacement rates and to
withdraw public subsidies from early retirement programs should be implemented as soon as
possible. Linking the GPF to pensions will help protect it from spending pressures, but to
avoid “Dutch disease” effects the policy of investing the assets abroad should be continued.
Finally, fully resolving the pension problem will require sustained effort beyond the current
reforms, and the process of developing the necessary policies should begin as soon as
possible.
35.
The Norwegian labor market performs well. However, the expanding sickness and
disability programs threaten to undermine the labor force and are burdening the public
finances. The decline in hours lost to sickness in 2004 is encouraging, but may not be
sustained. Continued progress in this area will, therefore, most probably require further
tightening of administrative controls to ensure only those who are truly sick or disabled
qualify, and a re-examination of the very high replacement rate.
36.
Regarding product markets, the increase in competitive forces and
modernization of the competition law are welcome, although state ownership remains
high. Competition needs to be fostered further, through further deregulation, vigorous action
by the strengthened Competition Authority, and greater progress on privatization of stateowned commercial enterprises. On this last point, the significant efforts in recent years to
ensure that such enterprises are run on a purely commercial basis are welcome. Nevertheless,
a perception that the playing field is not fully level is bound to remain, and, by precluding
normal takeovers, state ownership frustrates an increasingly important mechanism of
corporate governance. Therefore, further progress on privatization is warranted.
37.
The FSAP concluded that the financial system is sound and well supervised, but
also offered recommendations to ensure continued strong performance. One risk
identified by both staff and the financial supervisor is the rapid rise in household debt, which
over time will become an increasing risk factor. The authorities are monitoring developments
very closely—their financial stability analyses and publications are exemplary—and will of
course need to continue doing so. To ensure continued strong performance and supervision,
the recommendations in the accompanying FSSA should be implemented as soon as possible.
38.
While Norway’s trade regime is generally quite liberal, high agricultural trade
barriers should be reduced. The resulting trade distortions are minor in a global context,
but the cost to Norwegian consumers, in terms of higher prices and limits on choice, is
significant. Norway’s commitment to official development aid, which exceeds the UN target
of 0.7 percent of GDP, is commendable.
39.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Norway be held on the
standard 12-month cycle, but—subject to continued favorable economic conditions—the

- 31 -

staff would envisage reduced Board documentation and propose conclusion of the
consultation on a lapse-of-time basis.

- 32 -

APPENDIX I

LONG-RUN FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY
1.
In the next four decades or so, declining petroleum revenues and rising pension costs
will increasingly threaten the long-run sustainability of Norway’s public finances. The flow
of income from oil and gas wealth will generate sizable fiscal surpluses for many years to
come. However, government net cash flow from petroleum products is projected to begin to
decline in the next few years, and to dwindle to about 1 percent of GDP after 2050.13 (Figure
1). Pension expenditure, on the other hand, is projected to rise from 9¾ percent of GDP today
to about 19½ percent of GDP in 2050.
2.
This appendix summarizes the results of four simulations of long-run fiscal
sustainability, based on the assumption outlined in the Box.
Technical Assumptions
Historical data are from official sources. Fiscal data are from the central government budget, which is
on a cash bases and is therefore more consistent with net cash flows from oil and the GPF, and cashbased pension expenditure. The deviation from the 4-percent fiscal rule in the 2005 budget is assumed
to be closed by policies in addition to those considered in these simulations. Non-oil revenues are
assumed to be constant in relation to GDP at their 2005 level, as are non-pension expenditures (except
in the final simulation). The potential growth rate of GDP is assumed to be 2¼ percent. The real
return on the GPF is assumed to be 4 percent. The baseline assumes the 2005 budget oil projection;
that is, the price in 2005 is about $37 per barrel. As an alternative, a price of $47 a barrel, consistent
with the spring 2005 World Economic Outlook, is considered.

3.
The first three simulations examine the sustainability of the public finances under
different pension reform and oil price assumptions. Sustainability is described in terms of the
“financing gap”, which is the available flow of government revenue less pension expenditure.
The available revenue is, in turn, non-oil revenue less non-pension expenditure plus the
expected return (4 percent) on the GPF. So long as the financing gap is non-negative,
pensions are affordable. But a negative financing gap, which is not sustainable, implies the
4 percent rule must be violated, either directly by dipping into the GPF, or indirectly by
issuing government debt.
4.
If the government’s current reform proposal were not implemented, the financing gap
would turn negative before 2020 (Figure 2, point A) and rise to about 7 percent of GDP by
2050. However, implementing the reform proposal would significantly reduce the size of the
financing gap, which would turn negative in 2030 (Figure 3, point B) and rise to about
4 percent of GDP by 2050. If, in addition, future oil prices are assumed to be higher than the

baseline, in line with the spring WEO, the financing gap does not turn negative until 2038
(Figure 3, point C) and is only about 2 percent of GDP in 2050.
5.
A final simulation considers the growth of non-pension spending needed to stave off
a negative financing gap until 2050 (Figure 4, point D), assuming the current reform
proposals are adopted and the current WEO oil prices. One such path is an annual growth
rate of real non-pension expenditure of 1.6 percent from 2006 to 2015, and of 2.25 percent
(that is, trend GDP growth) thereafter. Even in this case, however, the gap turns negative
after 2050.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
NORWAY
Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by European Department
Approved by Reza Moghadam and Martin Fetherston
June 1, 2005
1.
This supplement presents information on the revised 2005 budget, which was
released on May 13, and on an agreement on pension reform concluded on May 26.
Regarding the revised budget, a key change is that the fiscal rule is to be met in 2008, rather
than 2010 in the original budget, in line with staff recommendations. Updated tables from the
staff report are attached in Appendix I. The new information does not change the staff
appraisal.
I. THE REVISED 2005 BUDGET
Underlying assumptions for 2005
2.
Compared with the original 2005 budget, the revised budget assumes real mainland
GDP growth to be ½ percentage point higher and incorporates significantly higher oil prices,
which imply higher net petroleum revenue to the government (Table 1).1
The 2004 outturn
3.
The central government non-oil budget deficit in 2004 was revised from 5.5 percent
of GDP to 6.1 percent of GDP, mainly owing to downward revisions to non-oil revenues of
½ percent of GDP. These revisions involved transitory changes to corporate tax revenues
and, as a result, the non-oil structural budget balance remained largely unchanged, at
4.5 percent of GDP. Spending was revised down by 0.1 percent of GDP. Oil revenues were
revised downward by 0.3 percent of GDP.

1

Henceforth, GDP refers to mainland GDP.

Changes for 2005
4.
Compared with the original 2005 budget, higher oil prices result in an appreciably
larger overall budget surplus (including petroleum revenues; Table 2). However, the non-oil
budget deficit is expected to remain little changed, at Nkr 74 billion or 5.4 percent of GDP.
An Nkr 4.8 billion (0.6 percent of GDP) decline in non-oil revenues was expected to be
almost exactly offset by a decline in expenditures, mainly because of a reduction in transfers
to households.2 The non-oil structural budget deficit was revised downward very slightly.
5.
Compared with the 2004 outturn, the revised 2005 non-oil deficit is expected to
narrow by 0.7 percent of GDP, while the structural non-oil budget deficit will rise by
¼ percent of GDP. Non-oil revenues are expected to remain unchanged in percent of GDP,
as strong economic growth offsets declines in tax revenues attributable to net tax cuts. Nonoil expenditures are expected to decrease by 0.7 percent of GDP owing to reductions in
2

The decline in tax revenues in the revised budget, compared with the original budget, is in part related to a
1 percentage point reduction in VAT rate on food, instead of the 1 percentage point increase assumed in the
original budget. This change is expected to reduce revenues by Nkr 1.2 billion in 2005.

Medium-term projections and the fiscal rule
6.
Higher oil prices and the higher overall budget
surplus will result in more rapid growth in the
Government Petroleum Fund, compared to what is
assumed in the original budget (the solid line versus the
dashed line in the accompanying figure). Since in 2005–
08, the structural non-oil central government deficits are
assumed to be little changed (the shaded bars versus the
striped bars)—that is, the extra oil revenues are to be
saved, not spent—the deviation from the fiscal rule
would disappear in 2008, two years earlier than in the

accords with the recommendations in the staff appraisal.
II. PENSION REFORM
7.
On May 26, parliament agreed a pension reform which largely follows the
government’s proposal. In particular: benefits will be indexed to the simple average of wages
and prices, rather than wages as now; benefits will be adjusted for life expectancy; benefits
will be based on lifetime earnings; and the 40-year cap on insurable earnings will be
abolished. However, benefits will be relatively higher for lower income workers, compared
to the government’s proposal, and, more importantly, the flexible retirement age was not
adopted, but will be the subject of further study regarding its interaction with early retirement
schemes. These measures will help to ease the future pension burden. However, it will be
important to adopt the flexible retirement provisions to increase beneficial labor supply
effects. Such effects would be further enhanced by withdrawing tax support for early
retirement and insuring that disability and retirement benefits are aligned.
8.
Though not strictly part of the public pension reform, it was also agreed to establish
mandatory minimum requirements for second pillar (occupational) pensions, beginning on
January 1, 2006. The resulting broader second pillar system will help to diversify retirement
income, relieving some of the burden from the public scheme.

.

Recall that the fiscal rule sets the structural non-oil central government deficit to 4 percent of the assets of the
GPF. The two lines in the text figure are 4 percent of the projected assets of the GPF.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with Norway
On June 3, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Norway.1
Background
Norway’s strong economic performance in recent years has been underpinned by a sound
macroeconomic policy framework. In 2001 Norway adopted an inflation targeting framework,
as well as fiscal guidelines (effective for the 2002 budget) designed to preserve petroleum
revenue for future generations. This revenue, which guarantees substantial fiscal and current
account surpluses for some years, is invested abroad in financial assets by the Government
Petroleum Fund (GPF).
Real mainland GDP growth rebounded strongly in 2004, after a slowdown that began in late
2002. Very supportive monetary conditions—the central bank intervention rate as been
1.75 percent for over a year—high oil prices, rising house prices, strengthening consumer and
business confidence, and an improved world economy all contributed to the pickup in activity.
At the same time, core inflation has been well below the 2.5 percent target rate for some time,
reflecting the slack that opened up during the slowdown, but also important structural factors:
falling prices for some imports, because of a shift in imports toward low-cost countries, and for
some domestic services, because of increased competition.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.
1

-2The outlook for 2005 and 2006 is promising, with most of the factors that propelled the economy
forward last year expected to continue into the near future. Growth is likely to fall off somewhat
in 2006, as very high levels of petroleum investment may not be sustained and there is a
widespread expectation that the central bank will begin to tighten its policy stance. With the
output gap closing and the structural factors that have been holding prices down waning,
inflation is set to begin to rise. Nonetheless, wage increases so far in 2005 have been
moderate, as inflation continued to be low and the unemployment rate has edged down only
gradually.
The non-oil fiscal deficit has widened somewhat in the past two years on a structural basis,
despite strong growth, and pressures for spending more of the petroleum revenue are strong.
The 2005 budget foresaw a further deviation from fiscal rule setting the central government nonoil structural deficit at 4 percent of the assets of the GPF (part of the guidelines governing fiscal
policy), despite higher oil prices, and therefore a larger stock of assets, than had been expected
last year.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended Norway’s strong fiscal and monetary policy framework and the success
in avoiding any adverse effects of the oil wealth. Directors welcomed the economic recovery
that has taken hold since 2004. They noted that robust growth and low unemployment have
been underpinned by the accommodative monetary stance, rapid credit expansion, and high
world oil prices. Inflation has remained low, with core inflation well below the inflation target,
reflecting the lagged effects of the 2002–03 downturn and structural factors that have lowered
the prices of some imports and domestic services. Looking forward, Directors agreed that the
expansion would continue into next year and beyond, barring a downturn in the world economy
or a large drop in oil prices.
Directors considered that the flexible inflation targeting regime has served Norway well, and
welcomed the further refinements that were implemented in the past year. Publishing the
monetary policy strategy document at the beginning of the strategy period and expanding the
discussion of interest rate decisions should enhance transparency. Directors noted that inflation
targeting has become increasingly credible and accepted, and encouraged the authorities to
continue their efforts to explain the monetary policy framework and communicate policy
decisions to markets.
Against the backdrop of strong growth, and consistent with the inflation targeting framework,
Directors agreed that a gradual and measured withdrawal of monetary stimulus should begin in
the course of this year. They noted that slack in labor and product markets is diminishing,
and that the structural factors holding prices down may be waning. They also expressed
concern that labor markets could become overheated in 2006, a year when two-year wage
bargains would be concluded. Directors recognized that monetary tightening could put upward
pressure on the currency, but did not see this prospect as justifying continued expansionary
policies in the face of the current cyclical upturn.

-3Directors agreed that the fiscal guidelines—which require that the non-oil central government
structural budget deficit be set equal to the long-run real return on the assets of the Government
Petroleum Fund, assumed to be 4 percent—have helped to sustain broadly prudent fiscal
policy. They appreciated the authorities’ efforts to contain the non-oil deficit by restraining
spending growth. In this regard, they welcomed the revised 2005 budget, which will use extra oil
revenues to reduce the non-oil deficit, thereby bringing forward the date when the fiscal
guidelines are achieved to 2008. At the same time, however, Directors emphasized the need for
continued fiscal restraint, especially in the run-up to the elections later this year, to deal with the
projected costs of population aging. They were concerned that the further breaching of the fiscal
rule might damage the credibility of fiscal policy. They therefore called on the authorities to take
advantage of the current favorable economic climate to comply with the fiscal guidelines as
quickly as possible. Most Directors further recommended that the guidelines be reinforced by a
medium-term fiscal plan, building on existing multi-year fiscal projections and ceilings for
spending growth. Directors welcomed the 2005 tax reform, which eliminates some distortions
and promotes employment. However, they noted that weaknesses in the tax structure remain—
particularly the bias in favor of residential investment—and that spending restraint will be
needed to offset the expected adverse revenue effect.
Noting that rising pension costs are the major threat to long-term fiscal sustainability in Norway,
Directors welcomed the recent decision by parliament to adopt much of the government’s
reform package, which should help to contain costs and improve work incentives. They urged
that that the flexible retirement age provisions of the package also be adopted, and agreed that
the Government Petroleum Fund—which will be linked to pensions in the government’s
reform—should continue to be invested abroad. Finally, Directors noted that further measures
beyond the current proposal will be needed to ensure long-term sustainability.
Directors welcomed the conclusion of the Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) that
the financial system is sound, competitive, and well-managed. They commended the authorities
on the strong system of financial supervision, and on the close coordination of financial
supervision among the Nordic countries in view of the important cross-border financial linkages.
They recommended that the authorities implement the reforms laid out in the FSSA, to help
ensure continued financial-sector strength and resilience. Directors cautioned, however, that a
continuation of the rapid pace of credit expansion, and the associated rise in household debt,
could, over time, pose an increasing risk, and urged the authorities to continue to monitor credit
developments closely.
Directors agreed that Norwegian labor markets perform very well. However, to check the
expansion of sickness and disability programs, which could undermine employment,
they recommended further tightening of administrative controls and reconsideration of very high
replacement rates. Directors welcomed the new competition law and the increased competition
in Norwegian product markets, and urged that this momentum be sustained, including through
vigorous action by the competition authority. Directors considered that further privatization
would be beneficial, in view of the still-high degree of state ownership, although they recognized
that policies have been put in place to help to ensure that state-owned enterprises operate on a
commercial basis.

Directors commended the generous level of Norway’s development assistance, which is well
above the UN target. They welcomed Norway’s support for multilateral trade liberalization and
its own generally low trade barriers, while encouraging reduction of still-high barriers to
agricultural imports.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Jon A. Solheim, Executive Director for Norway
June 3, 2005

On behalf of my Norwegian authorities, I would like to thank staff for a thorough and well
written report on the Norwegian economy. My authorities broadly concur with staff’s
analysis.
Economic outlook – recent projections
After slowing around the beginning of 2003, growth in the mainland economy (i.e. excluding
petroleum and shipping) picked up from the second half of 2003. The upswing in the
mainland economy is reflected in the labor market. Employment has picked up, but at a
slower pace than one should expect from the strong GDP-growth. In recent years, the number
of persons on sick leave has increased substantially to a very high level. However, the sick
leave fell appreciably through 2004, and has negatively affected the demand for labor. The
EU enlargement last year has increased labor immigration to Norway. The increase in labor
supply has dampened the decline in unemployment. The seasonally adjusted unemployment
rate was 4.5 percent in the first quarter of this year.
The inflation rate continues to be low, but is expected to pick up again in the period ahead.
Wage growth has declined markedly since 2002. It was 3.6 percent in 2004 and is expected
to decline further in 2005.
In 2005, growth in the mainland economy is expected to continue well above trend.
Household demand, housing starts and investments in the petroleum sector are the main
driving forces in the expansion. The upswing has gradually become more broadly based, with
a more positive outlook for the export sector and the manufacturing industries. Growth in
mainland fixed business investment is also stronger than previously expected. Strong
economic growth is expected to result in more pronounced employment growth and a gradual
decline in the unemployment rate this year. Further out, growth in Mainland Norway GDP is
forecasted to slow reflecting the projected fall in investments in the oil sector and gradually
higher interest rates.
Monetary policy
My authorities note staff’s assessment that the supportive monetary stance has been
appropriate in view of a very low inflation. The advice that the process of gradually
withdrawing monetary stimulus should begin in the course of the year is also noted. Norges
Bank’s key rate, the sight deposit rate, is at a historically low level. Since March 2004, the
rate has been kept at 1.75 percent. Real interest rates are also low.
The monetary assessment presented in the Inflation Report in March indicated that the
interest rate will rise after a period and at a gradual pace. The assessments were based on
market participants’ expectations that the interest rate would be increased in the summer. On
the monetary policy meeting on May 25, the Executive Board of Norges Bank confirmed that
the outlook for inflation and activity had not changed substantially since the March Inflation

-2Report. A development where the interest rate rises gradually – in small, not too frequent
steps – was considered to provide a good balance between the different objectives.
According to the account of the background for the last monetary policy meeting on May 25,
the Executive Board, as an alternative, considered increasing the interest rate already at that
meeting. Nevertheless, the Executive Board did not find grounds – given the prospects of
continued low inflation for a period ahead – to deviate from expectations in the money and
foreign exchange markets at present.
As staff points out, Norges Bank operates a flexible inflation targeting regime, so that weight
is given to both variability in inflation and variability in output and employment. In July
2004, Norges Bank adjusted the formulations as to the horizon for monetary policy.
The present formulation is: ”Norges Bank sets the interest rate with a view to stabilizing
inflation at the target within a reasonable time horizon, normally 1-3 years. The relevant time
horizon will depend on disturbances to which the economy is exposed, and how they affect
the path for inflation and the real economy ahead.” While Norges Bank viewed the previous
formulation as giving sufficient flexibility, the new formulation better expresses the
prevailing conduct of monetary policy.
The selected issues paper on Implicit and Explicit Targets suggests that Norges Bank has
reacted to inflation only, and not to the output gap. Norges Bank believes that the choice of
data sample and the econometric method may have biased the results. In a similar study at
Norges Bank, based on data from the beginning of 1999, the growth gap enters an estimated
relation between the interest rate and macroeconomic variables.
My authorities note that staff welcomes recent measures to improve policy transparency,
including the decision to publish the monetary policy strategy document at the beginning of
the strategy period and to provide a more detailed discussion of interest rates decisions
including a discussion of what interest rate options that were considered. In addition, the
Inflation Report, web publication, press conferences and speeches provide an account of
economic developments that are of importance to the Executive Board’s assessments and
interest rate decisions. Underlying each interest rate decision is the monetary policy strategy
drawn up by the Executive Board every four months. The strategy includes an assessment of
the appropriate interest rate level in the four months ahead and is published in the Inflation
Report without delay.
Fiscal Policy
As noted by staff, the Norwegian fiscal framework aims at a non-oil deficit that over time
equals expected real return of the Government Petroleum Fund, estimated at 4 percent. This
implies a gradual increase in the spending of petroleum incomes.
A gradual phasing in petroleum revenues towards a sustainable level is an important
precaution against the Dutch disease. As noted by staff in the selected issues paper on the
Government Petroleum Fund and the Dutch Disease, the decline in the Norwegian

-3manufacturing share of (mainland) value added has so far not been significantly different
from what is typically found in other developed countries.
The fiscal guidelines also aim at contributing to a stable development in the economy in the
short and medium term. Therefore, the guidelines allow transitory deviations from the 4
percent path over the business cycle, and in the event of extraordinary large changes in the
value of the Government Petroleum Fund. For some years now, the structural deficit has been
larger than 4 percent of the Government Petroleum Fund, partly as a consequence of weak
development in asset prices in 2002 and adverse cyclical conditions. The credibility of fiscal
policy seems to have been generally unaffected, in part because there seems to have been a
general acceptance that fiscal policy has been less expansionary than indicated by the change
in the structural budget deficit. Indeed, fiscal policy has generally had a neutral effect on
overall demand, marginally positive in 2002 and 2003, and neutral in 2004 and 2005.
As cyclical conditions now improve, my authorities share staff’s view that spending of
petroleum revenues should move towards the 4 percent track. The Government recently took
a step in this direction by proposing to slightly reduce the structural deficit as part of the
revision of the 2005 budget. In deciding how rapid this adjustment should be, the
Government has to take into account the economic conditions and the fact that the income of
the Petroleum Fund increases over time. Given present oil price forecasts, a constant level of
the structural deficit in the years ahead will bring spending in line with expected return on the
Government Petroleum Fund in 2008.
Staff argues for the introduction of a medium term fiscal plan to support the fiscal guidelines,
for example in the form of multi-year spending ceilings. As noted by staff, the presentation
of fiscal policy is now supplemented by medium term budget projections. This measure
should be evaluated before contemplating specific moves towards a binding expenditure rule.
The fiscal rule sets a sustainable path for the non-oil structural deficit. Given this deficit,
spending must adjust to income as ageing of the population sets in. A pension reform
therefore is an important step to ensure long run fiscal sustainability, although it must be
supplemented by additional spending restraint or increased revenues in the future.
Pension reform
The Storting (Parliament) reached on May 26 an agreement on a pension reform. Important
proposals from the White Paper on the reform of the National Insurance Scheme are
maintained in this agreement. The impact of the pension reform on the link between
contributions and benefits will strengthen the elderly’s work incentives and increase the
pension system’s financial sustainability. The agreement implies a need for more analysis
before a final decision can be made on the flexible retirement scheme. The analysis should
include further clarification of the interaction between the Contractual Early Retirement
Scheme and the National Insurance Scheme.
The agreement will introduce some changes in the link between pre-retirement earnings and
pension entitlements compared both to the original proposal and the current system, in the
direction of a more compressed structure with lower replacement rates for higher incomes

-4and higher rates for low incomes. It is also agreed that employers shall be required to provide
supplementary occupational pensions which meet certain minimum standards. For the public
sector occupational pension scheme, the agreement spells out that the current compensation
ratio of two thirds of final pay should be kept unchanged. However, adjustments of these
schemes to include the new life expectancy devisor and changed indexation, as in the new
National Insurance, are supported by the Storting.
Tax reform
As noted by staff, the 2005 budget included the first step of a three-year tax reform. The
reform is necessary in order to reduce the growing problem of tax arbitrage between labor
and capital income and to address the possible conflict between present system for
eliminating double taxation of share income and Norway’s obligations to the EEA agreement
(European Economic Area). Furthermore, the reform aims at making work more profitable
and simplifying the tax system by scaling back some allowance schemes and special
provisions.
The reform proposal includes lower marginal tax rates on labor income and increased
marginal tax rate on share income exceeding a risk free rent. The goal is to solve the income
shifting problem, without introducing a tax discrimination of investments in the corporate
sector. Increased taxation of share income will be combined with a reduction of the wealth
tax. The Government has promised to halve the wealth tax by 2007, with the aim of
elimination subsequently.
As noted by staff, the tax on imputed rent from housing was abolished from 2005. The rules
concerning this tax base have had arbitrary implications, and it would be most difficult to
define a valuation system that would not have unreasonable implications.
The Government has proposed that the tax reform is accompanied by a cut in net tax on
income and wealth over the fiscal years 2005 to 2007, corresponding to almost 0.8 percent of
GDP in 2003. Apart from a net tax cut, the changes in the tax system in 2005 were partly
financed by a 1 percentage point rise in normal and reduced VAT-rates.
Structural Policy
A large number of structural reforms have been implemented in Norway over the last two
decades. The main objective has been to improve the efficiency of financial and product
markets. In later years, more attention has been directed towards reforms in the production of
public services. In some sectors, however, further deregulations are on the agenda. In
December 2004, the Government submitted a proposal to the Storting for full liberalization
of the postal market in Norway as of January 1, 2007. The proposal outlines the main
principles for a new regulatory framework in the postal sector adapted to a fully liberalized
postal market.
In general, and with the exception of agriculture and to some extent fisheries, product market
deregulations have reached a stage where a vigorous and active application of competition
policy may be more needed than large sector reforms. Further steps to strengthen the
competition policy were, as mentioned by staff, taken when the new competition law came
into force last year.

-5The Government shares staff’s view that state ownership in the commercial sector should be
reduced. Privatization has been pursued gradually and on a pragmatic basis. The Norwegian
electricity market is one of the most competitive in the world, even if most companies are
publicly owned.
It is noted that staff recommends to review the desirability of state ownership in DnB-NOR.
FSSA
The FSAP exercise confirms that the Norwegian financial system is well managed, well
supervised and sound overall.
My authorities take note on the view that rising household debt levels represent a risk factor,
and that the combination of guaranteed-return products and low interest rates represents a
challenge for pension providers.
Staff concludes that the financial supervisory authority, Kredittilsynet, has operational
independence. My authorities note that staff recommends increasing the level of powers
delegated to Kredittilsynet in order to help ensure that effective operational independence is
maintained in the future. The issue of delegating licensing and authorization authority is
examined frequently. Norway’s constitutional system, where the minister is responsible to
the legislature for financial supervision, does, however, limit the possibilities for excluding
ministerial oversight and decision-making.
Also, staff recommends considering formalizing somewhat further the coordination between
the three institutions involved in financial stability; Norges Bank, Kredittilsynet and the
Ministry of Finance. My authorities agree that the division of tasks related to financial
stability between Kredittilsynet and Norges Bank could be examined. A contractual
arrangement between the Ministry and two public institutions under the Ministry’s authority
is, however, not deemed appropriate within a constitutional system where the Minister of
Finance is responsible to the legislature (Parliament) for financial stability.
Moreover, staff recommends reviewing key parameters of bank deposit insurance
arrangements. As mentioned in the report, the Government maintains the position that the
current Norwegian deposit guarantee system is well designed. The EU is currently discussing
different issues related to deposit guarantee systems, and the corresponding EU directive in
this field. As an EEA Member State, Norway participates in this process, and will have to
take the outcome of the discussions into account.
Next Article IV consultation
My authorities duly note staff’s proposal that the next consultation be held on a standard 12month cycle, with reduced Board documentation and conclusion of the consultation on a
lapse-of-time basis. Norway is neither vulnerable nor systemically important. A move to a
longer cycle will allow all parties involved in Article IV consultations to deploy resources.
Given this, my authorities maintain their interest of moving to an 18- or 24-month cycle.
