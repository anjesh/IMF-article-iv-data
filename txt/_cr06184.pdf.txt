Area covered
by the
consultation

As in the past, the consultation covered only the government-controlled areas on the
“right bank” of the Dniestr River, and did not consider the areas not under the
government’s control on the “left bank,” hereinafter referred to as Transnistria.

PRGF

The authorities are requesting financial assistance under a three-year PRGF
arrangement in the amount of SDR 80.08 million (65 percent of quota) with
equally-phased, semiannual disbursements.

Exchange
system

Moldova has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4, of the
Fund’s Articles of Agreement. Its exchange system remains free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions (Appendix I).

Donor
coordination

The mission liaised with the World Bank (which fielded a parallel mission to
discuss a possible PRSC, Appendix II), the EBRD (Appendix III), the UNDP and
other donors, particularly the European Commission (which also fielded a parallel
mission).

Data

National Bureau of Statistics (http://www.statistica.md/), National Bank of Moldova
(http://www.bnm.org/english/index_en.html), Ministry of Finance (www.moldova.md).
Despite some weaknesses, data provision is adequate for surveillance, and Moldova
is close to subscription to the SDDS (Appendix IV).

Outreach and
publication

The mission met with members of parliament, trade unions, industry, the financial
sector, NGOs, and the academic community. A press briefing was held at the end of
the mission and—for the first time—the Concluding Statement was published
(http://www.imf.org/external/np/ms/2005/121605.htm). The authorities have agreed to
publication of the staff report and all program documents.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Moldova’s European aspirations have renewed the impetus for reforms. Reelection of
the government in 2005 on a pro-Europe, pro-reform platform has done much to build a
consensus on the need to accelerate reforms and seek a new IMF arrangement. The European
Union-Moldova Action Plan, signed in February 2005, provides a platform consistent with
the authorities’ EGPRSP for advancing a broad agenda of measures designed to improve
Moldova’s long-run growth prospects.
The policy discussions focused on the following themes:
•

The need to maintain macroeconomic stability in the face of external uncertainties.
There was agreement on the need to target single-digit inflation in the context of
rising prices for energy imports, as well as strong remittance inflows and growing
foreign aid. Staff felt that the fiscal stance (deficit well below 1 percent of GDP) was
appropriate, and there was agreement on the need to allow greater exchange rate
flexibility. The authorities stand ready to tighten monetary policy if necessary to
achieve their inflation objective.

•

The importance of financial sector stability and development. There was consensus
on the need to enhance the independence of the National Bank of Moldova, including
by establishing price stability as its primary objective, and to promote competition in
the banking system as a means of improving the efficiency of financial
intermediation. Staff argued that transparency of ownership in the banking sector
should be enhanced, and welcomed the long-awaited arrival in Moldova of significant
foreign banking institutions. In this context, there was agreement that the time has
arrived to develop an exit strategy for the state-owned Banca de Economii (BEM).

•

The large unfinished agenda of structural reforms. The authorities are committed to
completing the transition process by advancing reforms designed to delineate what
should be the appropriate role of the government in the economy. Key measures
underway include: modernization of the tax administration; regulatory and public
administration reform; improving corporate governance and transparency for stateowned enterprises (as well as reinvigorated privatization); and trade liberalization.

Staff supports the authorities’ request for a new three-year PRGF arrangement. The
accompanying Letter of Intent and Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies contain
policy commitments appropriate to maintain macroeconomic stability and to accelerate the
economic reform agenda.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Elections in March–April, 2005 returned President Voronin of the Communist
Party to power, albeit with a slimmer majority than during his first term. The government
ran on a pro-European platform, promising faster reforms and placing much emphasis on the
signing in February 2005 of an Action Plan agreed with the European Union that is
consistent with the Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (EGPRSP). At
the same time, relations with Russia remain difficult, given the on-going impasse over
Transnistria.1
2.
Moldova’s newfound European aspirations have provided much-needed impetus
to the authorities’ stabilization and reform efforts. In concluding the 2004 Article IV
consultation, the Executive Board noted that Moldova would need to demonstrate a track
record of improved policy implementation before discussions on a new PRGF-supported
program could begin. Following the elections, staff urged the authorities to establish this
track record by taking the following concrete actions:
•

Maintaining tight fiscal policy (deficit of no more than ½ percent of GDP in 2005);

•

Tightening monetary policy to credibly target single-digit inflation by end-2005; and

•

Accelerating structural reforms, particularly in the areas of public administration
reform, modernization of fiscal and public enterprise management, and trade policy
liberalization.

Implementation of these actions through September was sufficient to demonstrate the
authorities’ strengthened policy efforts, opening the way for discussions in December and
February on a new IMF-supported program.
3.
These discussions culminated in a request for a new three-year PRGF
arrangement. Consistent with their Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy
(EGPRSP), the proposed program emphasizes maintenance of macroeconomic stability in the
face of continued strong foreign exchange inflows, as well as development of the financial
sector and structural reforms aimed at advancing the transition process by clarifying the role
of the state in the economy.

Box 1. Implementation of Past Fund Policy Recommendations
As suggested by the disappointing performance under the 2001–03 PRGF arrangement,
responsiveness to Fund advice has been mixed over the years. This said, in 2004–05, the authorities
seemed to internalize some of the messages of previous consultations.
Receptivity to IMF advice has been stronger in the core areas of fiscal, monetary, and financial sector
polices than on structural issues. The stance of fiscal policy has generally been tight, while the
monetary authorities have now begun to place greater emphasis on the inflation objective.
Until recently, structural reforms had stalled, but with the signing of the EU-Moldova Action Plan,
there are renewed signs of progress. In the financial sector, the authorities have sought to implement a
number of recommendations from the FSAP, including those aimed to bolster transparency in
ownership structures. They are moving ahead with fiscal management and public administration
reforms, and seek to improve the business environment by eliminating unnecessary regulations.

II. BACKGROUND
4.
Moldova was hit hard by the regional financial crisis in 1998. The former Soviet
Union had been the destination for about two thirds of Moldovan exports, and when these
markets contracted sharply, Moldova faced a significant demand shock. The cumulative GDP
loss reached 10 percent during 1998–99, and the poverty rate rose to over 70 percent in 1999
(from 47 percent in 1997). The exchange rate depreciated sharply, leading external debt to
rise by almost 50 percentage points of GDP during 1997–2000.
5.
The adverse developments led many Moldovans to seek employment
opportunities abroad—both in
the EU and in nearby countries

7.
There are signs that the current growth model is reaching its limit. Labor
shortages have begun to emerge in some sectors, and delayed investment has hampered
modernization in others. Moreover, fairly gradual financial sector development has meant
that intermediation is weak, which—coupled with the weak business environment—has
further complicated Moldova’s growth outlook.
8.
Migration has tended to ameliorate poverty, as those working abroad supported
their families by providing strong and growing remittances. These inflows rose from below
10 percent of GDP before the 1998 crisis to over 30 percent in 2005. Poverty levels fell
correspondingly, declining to 28 percent by 2004. However, progress toward the Millennium
Development Goals in other areas has been mixed. While Moldova’s achievements have

-9-

been notable in reducing infant mortality and increasing access to improved water supplies,
relatively less progress has been noted recently in raising secondary school enrollment ratios,
improving access to sanitation, or combating HIV/AIDS.

III. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
9.
Higher energy prices complicated the macroeconomic picture in 2005. Although
overall GDP growth remained strong at 7 percent, its composition shifted further away from
the traded sector, which was particularly affected by the rise in petroleum prices. The
slowdown in export growth and the higher energy import bill contributed to a worsening in
the current account balance. Inflation performance improved despite the higher energy
prices, falling to 10 percent (y-o-y) in December 2005 (from a peak of 14 percent in April),
aided by a slower growth in prices for food products, and a stronger macroeconomic policy
discipline.
10.
Fiscal and monetary policy were tightened. Substantial overperformance on the
VAT translated into a stronger fiscal stance (a surplus of 1.7 percent of GDP). In turn, the
NBM stepped up sales of NBM certificates, as well as making more active use of deposit
auctions. Sterilization efforts intensified in the second and third quarters before easing in the
fourth quarter, as the NBM moderated its foreign exchange purchases in light of an energyrelated weakening in the BoP position. The NBM’s balance on sterilization operations rose
from an average of 1.1 percent of GDP in 2004 to an average of 2.9 in 2005.3 As a result,
reserve money growth slowed during the year, falling to 16½ percent at end-September,
before rising seasonally in December. At the same time, broad money growth remained
strong (at 35 percent for the year as a whole). Lending and deposit rates have remained high,
despite plentiful liquidity on the T-bill and interbank markets—suggesting that competition
in the financial sector is weak.
3

The cost of these operations was about Lei 50 million (0.1 percent of GDP) in 2005, compared with an
estimated realized NBM profit of about Lei 160 million.

12.
The current account deficit deteriorated significantly in 2005, owing in large
part to the impact of higher energy prices. Energy (particularly fuel oil) imports rose in
value terms by about 50 percent in 2005 (about 3.5 percent of GDP), while export growth
slowed modestly. Moldova’s chief exports are agricultural products, particularly wine, most
of which is shipped to Russia. There were periodic episodes of trade disruption with Russia,
reportedly on phyto-sanitary grounds, for meat and fruits and vegetables. Nevertheless, the
overall impact of these limitations on Moldova’s balance of payments is unclear, arguably
because exporters have found indirect ways to deliver commodities to Russian markets (e.g.,
through Ukraine or Belarus).
13.
The external debt outlook continued to improve, although arrears were
accumulated to Paris Club creditors. External debt fell as a share of GDP from over
100 percent in 2001 to about 55 percent by 2005, owing largely to strong growth and real
exchange rate appreciation, as well as prudent borrowing and several favorable restructuring
arrangements. Although the authorities began to service interest falling due to Paris Club
creditors in 2004, principal falling due has not been paid (Annex). Moreover, the authorities
have not serviced the debt attributed to Transnistria that they assumed under a 2000
agreement with Russia.

Based on data for November 2004-November 2005, Moldova was reclassified a de facto peg in the Annual
Report on Exchange Arrangements in January 2006.

The authorities began to step
up their structural reform efforts in
2005. Many of the measures taken were
aimed at preparing the agenda for the
new program, including an initial
functional review of the public
administration, an inventory of state
assets and an assessment of the
privatization process, and preparation of
a public finance management reform
with World Bank support. Nevertheless,
the authorities acknowledged that in
some areas they are well behind their
peers in Southeastern Europe and even
the CIS, and it is to address this fact that
they have sought a new PRGF
arrangement.

IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
15.
The three main themes of the consultation—and the issues the program aims to
address—are the following:
•

Supporting growth and poverty reduction by maintaining macroeconomic stability,
particularly in the face of strong inflows of remittances and sharply higher prices for
imported energy;

•

Improving the performance of the financial sector, including by building on the
lessons of last year’s FSAP; and

•

Clarifying the role of government in the economy, thus advancing the transition
process.
A. Moldova’s Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy

16.
Consistent with the EGPRSP, the authorities’ key medium-term objective is to
create the conditions for durable, private sector-led, pro-poor growth, taking advantage
of Moldova’s favorable location and strong inflows of remittances from abroad. The
authorities acknowledged that macroeconomic stability is a necessary condition for growth,
and thus for poverty alleviation. They were also concerned that growth in recent years has
emphasized consumption at the expense of investment, and thus may not prove durable. They
pointed to the need to rebuild infrastructure that has deteriorated over the 15 years of
transition, particularly rural roads and gas distribution. In response to the mission’s emphasis
on private sector investment and the need to improve the business environment, the
authorities pointed to their efforts to eliminate needless regulations (the “guillotine initiative”
—see section III.D) and reduce the tax burden.

The authorities have prepared an annual progress report for their EGPRSP.5
They want to avoid duplication of effort by monitoring the EGPRSP in a way consistent with
the European Union-Moldova Action Plan (Box 2). The authorities’ intention is that the
update evaluates the past year’s results in light of poverty reduction and economic
development objectives. Staff endorsed

over the medium term as the appropriate
way to create more room for private
sector expansion, and thus foster growth. The authorities agreed, noting that the World Bank
is preparing a new Public Expenditure Review (PER), and that they are in the early stages of
a comprehensive public administration reform aimed in part at a significant downsizing of
the government apparatus.
B. Macroeconomic Framework
18.
Growth is expected to slow gradually in 2006 and over the medium term, partly
in response to higher oil prices, as well as emerging labor shortages. Under the program, real
GDP growth is projected to fall to 6 percent in 2006, and to 5 percent over the medium term.
But achieving even this outcome will depend on a continued recovery in investment,
particularly of the private sector.
19.
There was agreement that monetary and fiscal policies should aim for a
measured pace of disinflation. The program envisages an inflation objective of 9 percent
(y-o-y) in 2006, falling to 7 percent by 2008, despite continued high and rising inflows of
remittances (up to $1.3 billion a year by 2008) and foreign aid that will complicate
achievement of this moderate goal (MEFP ¶16). The authorities argued that achieving a more
ambitious inflation objective would likely come at the expense of slower growth, delays in
achieving the MDGs (Table 7), or both.6 At the same time, the authorities noted the limits to
each of the levers available to them:

•

Monetary policy will shoulder the brunt of the disinflation effort, but thin financial
markets limit the NBM’s ability to sterilize large inflows.

•

Fiscal policy can provide only limited support for achievement of the inflation
objective as Moldova remains the poorest country in Europe, with extensive
infrastructure development needs, much of which are financed by external assistance
through the budget.7 Staff noted, however, that there is still scope to contain the
growth of current spending.

•

The authorities agreed that greater flexibility in the exchange rate regime would
contribute to the disinflation effort but noted that, in the near term, upward pressure
on the exchange rate stemming from remittances is likely to be offset by the impact of
higher energy prices.

20.
Energy price rises are a major downside risk to the outlook. Fuel oil import prices
rose by an estimated 44 percent in 2005, and natural gas prices have increased by about
40 percent in early 2006. For the past several years, Moldova purchased natural gas from
Russia at about $80/thousand cubic meters (tcm), well below the prices faced by Western and
Central Europe, but higher than paid by other countries in the former Soviet Union. A price
of $110/tcm was agreed upon for the first half of 2006. A price of $160/tcm, originally
proposed by Russia, would add about 2 percentage points of GDP to the underlying trade
deficit, and lead to higher inflation and somewhat slower growth in 2006.

7

Excluding foreign-financed project spending, the general government is expected to run a primary surplus of
almost 2 percent of GDP in 2006.

- 19 -

Fiscal policy
21.
There was agreement that the underlying budget deficit (after grants) should be
no more than 0.5 percent of GDP for the medium term (Box 3). The 2006 budget foresees
a slightly larger deficit (0.8 percent of GDP), owing to the disbursement of an EU grant of
about 0.3 percent of GDP in the last days of 2005. With general government debt falling to
about one third of GDP in 2006 (from over 80 percent in 2001), a slightly higher deficit
would not jeopardize medium-term fiscal sustainability. Nevertheless, while noting that
demand-management considerations militate against a higher deficit, the authorities were
anxious to note that further large energy price increases could give rise to a need to revisit the
agreed fiscal stance (MEFP ¶18).

The fiscal target in 2006 is substantially looser than the outturn for 2005. Staff
expressed concern regarding the
swing in the deficit (from a

the swing in the fiscal stance
stems from one-off factors, including the disbursement of a grant from the EU in the last
days of December, for which expenditures were already allocated in the 2006 budget (adding
0.6 percent of GDP to the fiscal swing), and a change in the composition of imports that

- 20 -

should stem the VAT overperformance.8 The authorities also noted that, with the energyrelated weakening in the BoP, there was likely to be less need for the budget to support the
goals of monetary policy. Finally, staff acknowledged that the authorities have persistently
overperformed against their budget deficit targets in recent years, suggesting that the balance
of risks in this case implies the 2006 deficit outturn will likely be much better than allowed in
the budget.
Box 3. Fiscal Space and the 2006 Budget
After a precipitous drop in the late 1990s, public sector spending has recovered in recent years. Although some
in Moldova, including a few foreign donors, would like to see a further expansion in the “fiscal space” available
for poverty reduction, this needs to be balanced against the concern that the private sector is being crowded out,
to the detriment of Moldova’s long-run growth prospects.
Thus, in line with the theme to clarify and limit the role of the state in the economy, staff supported the 2006
budget provision to reduce the overall tax burden through lower direct tax rates. The authorities argued that
lower rates on direct taxes will encourage businesses and individuals to leave the shadow economy, while
shifting incidence toward consumption. The corporate income tax rate has been reduced from 18 percent to
15 percent, and the individual income tax rates from 9, 14, and 20 percent to 8, 13, and 18 percent, respectively.
At the same time, the VAT tax base has been broadened through removal of some of the exemptions, and
specific excise rates have been indexed to inflation.

23.
With strong Presidential support, the authorities agreed to pass on the cost of
higher energy imports to households and enterprises. Thus, natural gas tariffs were raised
by 40 percent in February, broadly consistent with the increase in natural gas prices for the
first quarter. At this level of natural gas prices (about $110/tcm), the authorities agreed to
cover the cost of any additional budgetary transfers to low income households within the
existing fiscal envelope (MEFP ¶22). Further sharp price increases might call for a revision
of the macroeconomic framework, as well as efforts to improve targeting of social transfers
to help the poor.9
24.
Revenue growth is expected to continue being driven by robust indirect taxes
(MEFP ¶19). More than half of the 6½ percent of GDP increase in tax revenue from 2002 to
2005 stemmed from VAT, excises (in both cases, most of which come from imports), and
duties.10 This trend represents, in effect, one way that a portion of Moldova’s strong
remittance inflows is being channeled to the budget, and thereby to poverty reduction and
infrastructure development, since import growth has itself largely been financed by
remittances.

8

With much higher natural gas imports, the structure of imports is shifting from consumption goods to energy,
which is subject to lower VAT rates.

9

FAD plans to field a poverty and social impact analysis mission later in the year to examine this question.

10

Imports rose by 14 percentage points of GDP over that period.

- 21 -

25.
Looking ahead, the authorities are committed to modernizing the system of tax
administration, aiming to improve the efficiency of tax collection by reducing compliance
costs and by greater reliance on indirect means of assessing tax obligations (MEFP ¶21).
With technical assistance from the IMF, they are preparing a comprehensive tax
administration reform strategy—as required under the EU-Moldova Action Plan. Further, the
authorities concurred with staff that the Council of Creditors (a political body headed by the
prime minister, which periodically restructures tax and other debts) should be replaced by an
apolitical system relying on State Tax Inspectorate and the bankruptcy courts, as appropriate
(MEFP ¶39).
26.
There was agreement that expenditure restraint would be important to ensure
sustainable public finances and a competitive business environment over the medium
term. The composition of expenditure will remain heavily tilted toward social spending
(chiefly education, health and pensions), which is expected to rise modestly, from 24 percent
of GDP in 2005 to about 25 percent of GDP in 2008 (inclusive of the health and social
insurance funds), thus comprising almost ⅔ of general government expenditures. The
authorities favor an increase in infrastructure investment, but are looking to stepped-up
inflows of donor assistance to avoid having to compromise the social policy objectives of the
EGPRSP (or relax the fiscal stance).
27.
The 2006 budget contains a significant increase in public sector wages. Staff
argued against the increase, which is estimated at about 1 percent of GDP, on the grounds
that it would make the authorities’ plans for higher infrastructure investment more difficult.11
However, the authorities countered that the new law on budget sector wages reestablished
order in a budget sector wage structure that had become internally inconsistent through years
of ad hoc increases for individual sectors, and that it involved a significant element of catchup. They also pointed to the difficulty in retaining qualified staff, and suggested that without
an increase in remuneration they could not credibly combat corruption in the public sector.
Nevertheless, looking to 2007–08, the authorities agreed to limit public sector wage growth
to the envelope set by the MTEF and agreed with the IMF.
28.
The finances of the social insurance fund (SF) have been a particular area of
concern. In a pre-election move, pensions were increased by an average of 25 percent in
November 2004, with the result that the SF ran a deficit throughout 2005. The authorities
took some measures on the revenue side, and increased transfers from the central government
budget, to cover most of the shortfall. Although SF finances should stabilize in 2006—owing
to additional revenue measures (mainly in agriculture), as well as a pension indexation
formula that links benefits to both CPI and wage growth—staff argued that a structural
imbalance is growing in the SF. Population aging, combined with large numbers of
Moldovans working abroad (and not captured in the SF tax net), means that Moldova’s payas-you-go pension system is forced to maintain high payroll tax rates. This tax on labor in
turn provides an additional incentive to worker exodus. The authorities agreed, therefore, to
develop a plan during 2006 to put the SF on a sustainable financial basis over the medium
term (MEFP ¶23).
11

Data on the economic classification of general government expenditures are unfortunately not very reliable.

despite strong wage growth in recent years,
Moldovan salary levels remain well below neighboring countries.

Measures of the equilibrium real exchange rate continue to show that the leu has some room to appreciate,
although recent energy price increases imply that this margin has narrowed. See M. Cuc, “External
Competitiveness,” Chapter 3 of Republic of Moldova: Selected Issues (IMF Country Report No. 05/54).

into the treasury account in the NBM.
In addition, during 2006 the authorities will explore the option of securitizing the pre-2004
stock of government debt to the NBM (equal to Lei 1.7 billion), in order to enhance the
NBM’s ability to conduct open-market operations. The NBM will stand ready to tighten
monetary policy further, if necessary, in order to achieve their inflation objective.
32.
The authorities and staff agreed that NBM independence needs to be
strengthened. They noted that the NBM law at present requires the bank to strive for
“stability of the national currency,” which can be interpreted to mean either the exchange rate
or inflation. To clarify this problem of dual objectives, the authorities are amending the NBM
law to specify that price stability is the Bank’s primary objective (MEFP ¶24). The revised
law will also enhance NBM independence by prohibiting direct credit to government, and by
strengthening the independence of NBM board members in the performance of their normal
duties.14
Trade policy
33.
Moldova, a WTO member, has a relatively open trade regime. The unweighted
average import duty is 5.7 percent, and imports of goods are equal to about three fourths of
annual GDP. However, export restrictions, particularly for grain products, have long been
controversial. Under the program, the authorities have agreed to eliminate the restriction that
grain exports must formally be transacted on the privately owned Moldovan Commodity
Exchange (MEFP ¶40), and they report that informal restrictions have been lifted on the
mode of transportation (e.g., by rail, rather than by truck) for exports. The authorities argued
that the main reason for these restrictions was to combat tax evasion (underinvoicing),

13

In 2005, for the first time, the government began to repay loans previously extended by the NBM, and
beginning in 2006, it will no longer oblige the NBM to make quarterly transfers of profits (with transfers
coming instead after the end of the financial year, on the basis of audited accounts).
14

At the next opportunity, the authorities intend to propose amending the Constitution to include an explicit
reference to the independence of the National Bank, and clarify its role in the conduct of monetary policy.

and they noted that, with the development of a comprehensive new tax administration
modernization strategy, the export restrictions were no longer necessary.
34.
The authorities noted their concern that the impending EU accession of Bulgaria
and Romania could have an adverse impact on Moldova’s export prospects. While
Bulgaria absorbs a relatively small proportion of Moldovan products (less than 1 percent),
Romania is the destination for about 10 percent of total exports. The chief commodities sold
by Moldova to Romania have been agricultural products, and textiles, most of which will
face higher duties when Romania joins the EU. The authorities have reached an agreement
on GSP+ treatment with the EU, and are seeking to negotiate concessional access to EU
markets for some of the products excluded by GSP+.
Debt strategy
35.
The authorities have prepared a strategy for normalizing relations with external
creditors. Arrears stood at $56 million at end-2005 (2 percent of GDP), and are owed mostly
to Russia, with smaller amounts due to the U.S., Japan, Germany and Italy. The authorities
hope to use the resources in an escrow account established in the 2005 and 2006 budgets
(equal to Lei 200 million, or $15.6 million) to clear a portion of their arrears, which are
expected to rise to $65 million by end-April 2006. They hope to secure a rescheduling for the
remainder, along with a flow rescheduling of debt service falling due during the program
period.15 Preliminary indications from donors suggest that the residual financing gap for
2006 can be filled. Nevertheless, the authorities understand that additional fiscal adjustment
would be needed, should projected aid flows not materialize.
36.
The results of the updated low-income country DSA, done jointly by Bank and
Fund staff, indicate that Moldova faces short-term liquidity difficulties, rather than a
structural debt sustainability problem. Reengagement of the IFIs and the international
donor community with fresh concessional financing and possibly rescheduling of its external
debt, including arrears, would alleviate the liquidity problem and free up resources for other
development needs.
C. Financial Sector Stability and Performance
37.
Financial stability indicators remain generally strong. Capital adequacy and
liquidity ratios are sound, and NPLs remain well under 10 percent, although loans “under
supervision” remain high at about 39 percent (Table 6). Banking system profitability is
robust, but there are signs for concern. Dollarization is high at over 40 percent of deposits
(slightly less than 20 percent of which are denominated in euros), and monetization and
financial sector development remain modest, but not out of line with Moldova’s level of per
capita income.

15

In the program, staff have assumed rescheduling of about ¾ of the arrears at end-April.

Last year’s FSAP pointed to a lack of transparency in bank ownership, a
concern echoed by the EBRD.16 Opaque ownership increases the possibility that the NBM
will miss instances of related-party lending. In response, the authorities have sought to

- 27 -

implement a number of the FSAP recommendations (MEFP ¶26). Under the legislation
passed in 2005, the threshold above which owners of banks must meet the “fit and proper”
test was lowered from 10 percent to 5 percent. Although this change applies only to new
shareholders, not retroactively, it does apply when existing shareholders buy or sell any
shares, and thus should increase transparency over time.
39.
There was agreement on the importance of promoting competition in the
Moldovan banking system. High levels of profitability, while welcome, indicate that
entrance by foreign banks might stimulate Moldovan banks to enhance services and thus
facilitate intermediation. While the authorities noted that the Moldovan legal framework
accommodates the entry of foreign banks, there was an acknowledgement that foreign banks
are now more welcome than in the past. In this regard, staff welcomed the fact that several
western European banks were establishing a presence in Moldova.17
40.
The government’s announcement of its medium-term objective of privatizing
Banca de Economii (BEM) to a strategic banking investor is an important step (MEFP
¶27). With a large branch network, strong household deposit base, and healthy loan portfolio,
staff argued that putting BEM in the hands of an experienced international bank would do
much to promote competition in the banking system. During 2006, the authorities will select
on a competitive basis an internationally-reputable company to perform a valuation of the
bank; the valuation will be done in 2007, after which the bank will be brought to market. In
the meantime, the authorities will refrain from affording BEM any special treatment,
including in the form of tax preferences, prudential forbearance, or placement of government
deposits.
41.
The authorities are taking steps to enhance the effectiveness of their AML/CFT
regime (MEFP ¶28). They agreed to pass legislation requiring banks to report on suspicious
transactions carried out between nonresidents, and they plan to respond to recommendations
in the January 2005 MONEYVAL evaluation by preparing a thorough reform of the AML
framework, for which they plan to request IMF technical assistance.
D. Structural Reform Agenda
42.
There was agreement that the authorities’ macroeconomic and development
objectives required implementation of an ambitious structural reform agenda. By
making progress on a set of reforms aimed at improving the business environment and
clarifying the role of the state in the economy, the authorities felt they could also improve
their credibility and thus demonstrate program ownership. Most of the reforms envisaged in
the government’s program fall in the category of steps designed to bring the 15-year
transition process nearer to closure by establishing what the government should do, and what
should be left to the private sector. For example, they are embarking on a multi-year effort to
modernize the public administration, with assistance from international development partners

like the World Bank, UNDP and SIDA (MEFP ¶30). This effort, which aims to downsize in
certain areas to make room for the staffing increases in other areas needed to bring
Moldova’s institutions in line with European norms, will begin with detailed functional
reviews of all central government agencies during 2006. At the same time, the legal
framework for the civil service is being modernized—with the aim of reducing corruption—
via legislation meant to prevent conflicts-of-interest and to ensure the civil service is
managed on apolitical grounds (MEFP ¶31).
43.
The authorities see their regulatory reform as being integral to the public
administration reform (MEFP ¶32). By eliminating unnecessary barriers to business
activity, the regulatory reform should permit redeployment of civil servants to higher priority
tasks (while eliminating the temptation for corruption). Key features of the reform include
simplifying procedures for business registration and eliminating the need for many licenses
and permits. Under their “guillotine” procedure, over 1000 regulations were examined by a
committee including representatives of the business community and civil society, and over
100 were eliminated outright. The next step in this process is to apply the “guillotine” to the
laws that gave rise to these regulations in the first place, and to introduce a regulatory impact
assessment system to ensure that they do not simply reappear (MEFP ¶33).
44.
Public expenditure management is to be modernized in the context of a
comprehensive World Bank project. The IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) is
assisting with some aspects of this effort, chiefly related to treasury management and budget
classification. In this context, there was agreement that the remaining commercial bank
accounts of budget units (and the Social and Health Funds) should—in stages—be moved to
the treasury single account (TSA) in the NBM (MEFP ¶35). FAD is also assisting the
authorities to implement a system to track poverty-related spending through the treasury.
45.
The authorities agreed that management of state-owned enterprises (SOE)
should be brought into line with best international practice. In this, they benefited from
participation in the second stage of FAD’s pilot study on extending coverage of fiscal
indicators to the SOE sector.18 The authorities have developed a plan to introduce corporate
governance principles in those SOEs that remain unincorporated, and to introduce greater
transparency regarding the financial performance of all SOEs. In particular, management of
SOEs that are not corporatized will be shifted from the branch ministries to Boards on which
the ministries of finance and economy comprise a majority (MEFP ¶36). Beginning with the
2008 budget process, detailed information on SOE financial performance will be presented to
parliament, which thereby will be better placed to assess whether dividends should be paid or
whether the SOEs should in fact be privatized (MEFP ¶37).
V. PROGRAM ISSUES
46.
The authorities are requesting access to Fund resources under a three-year
PRGF arrangement. Consistent with Moldova’s balance of payments need, cumulative
18

access would equal 65 percent of quota (SDR 80 million) under the proposed program
(Table 9).19 Disbursements would be phased in equal semiannual tranches (Table 11) on
completion of reviews. The program would be monitored by quantitative performance
criteria on net international reserves and net domestic assets of the NBM, the general
government cash deficit,20 and nonconcessional foreign borrowing. Intermediate quarterly
indicative targets have been set for these variables, as well as reserve money. Proposed
structural performance criteria and benchmarks are in the Fund’s areas of expertise and are
critical to achievement of the macroeconomic objectives of the program; they focus on the
financial sector, tax administration, public finance and enterprise management, and trade
liberalization (MEFP Table 1). These measures are aimed at ensuring macroeconomic
stability, clarifying the role of the state in the economy (thus bringing the transition process
nearer to closure), and stimulating financial sector development to promote growth.
Box 4. Medium-term Risks and Vulnerabilities
Staff expects growth to slow over the medium term, falling to about 5 percent per annum, given the
impact of higher energy prices and emerging labor market shortages. Preventing a further
deceleration depends on maintaining macroeconomic stability and on an acceleration in the
implementation of structural reforms designed to improve the business environment. Much also
depends on Moldova’s ability to regularize its external debt outlook in 2006. Other significant risks
include:
•

Natural gas prices could rise rapidly to European levels;

•

Farm exports to neighboring countries could be disrupted, possibly owing to a breakdown in
talks on Transnistria;

•

The authorities might again place greater weight on exchange rate stability than on
disinflation; and

•

Implementation of the program reform agenda could once again prove disappointing.

47.
The proposed program entails significant political and implementation risks, but
these are much reduced in comparison with the past (Box 4). The political environment is
stable, the current government now has four years of experience in managing the economy,
and the next round of elections are several years away. Moreover, Moldova’s European
aspirations provide comfort that the reform agenda will be advanced as planned.
Nevertheless, in light of the disappointing experience with the 2001–03 PRGF arrangement,
the program entails a relatively large number of prior actions, structural performance criteria,

19

There is uncertainty regarding the amount of likely rescheduling by the Paris Club, and the amount of new
financing from donors (including the EU and the World Bank). Additional financing would be used in the first
instance to support infrastructure spending needed for poverty reduction, and then to bolster reserves, while
shortfalls in relief—or donor financing—would be absorbed through further fiscal adjustment.

Inclusive of externally-financed project loans, as well as grants.

and benchmarks designed to safeguard Fund resources by anchoring disbursements to reform
implementation.21
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
48.
Moldova’s growth performance over the past five years has been good. Growth
was financed in part by strong inflows of remittances from Moldovans working abroad,
blunting the impact of continued structural impediments. While the fact that so many
Moldovans felt the need to leave the country to earn a living partly reflects lack of economic
opportunities at home, their remittances provided income support to their families,
contributing to lower levels of poverty and improved performance towards the MDGs.
49.
The challenge now is to build on these favorable developments and set the stage
for robust growth over the medium term. In this context, the EU-Moldova Action Plan is
crucial to sustain the needed consensus on the authorities’ ambitious reform agenda.
Moldova’s European aspirations lie behind the renewed emphasis on reforms in recent years.
Further, the Action Plan is consistent with the EGPRSP, and it will be important for the
authorities to find ways to implement and monitor both plans in a way that avoids taxing
their limited administrative capacity.
50.
The proposed macroeconomic framework is appropriately ambitious, targeting
a gradual reduction of inflation from high single-digit levels at present. It is nevertheless
subject to uncertainties and risks, including significantly higher prices for imported natural
gas, and the authorities will need to stand ready to adjust policies if needed to deliver their
inflation objective. Deeper financial markets, stemming from greater competition in the
banking sector, will help to ensure that the authorities can make use of the levers at their
disposal, including deposit auctions, sales of central bank paper, and open-market operations
with government securities.
51.
The authorities also need to be prepared to allow greater exchange rate
flexibility—in both directions—to minimize risks to the disinflation path. More
flexibility in the exchange rate will help ensure that external competitiveness remains
adequate, while also providing a buffer against external shocks. Amending the law on the
National Bank to establish price stability as its key objective is therefore a welcome step, but
it will then be important to align Moldova’s de facto exchange rate regime with its de jure
regime.
52.
Modest fiscal deficits are an appropriate compromise in the face of competing
pressures. Although on macroeconomic grounds the stance of fiscal policy needs to be tight
to support the inflation objective and limit the BoP deterioration, Moldova is a poor country
with extensive development needs. Deficits of 0.8 percent of GDP in 2006, falling to
0.5 percent over the medium term, balance macroeconomic considerations and debt
sustainability against the need for concessional foreign borrowing for infrastructure
development. In this regard, the authorities’ efforts to reduce the tax burden and modernize
21

- 33 -

tax administration are welcome. Still, with expenditures at almost 40 percent of GDP, the
size of government in Moldova is large when compared with other countries at a similar level
of per capita income. Hence, the large increase in public sector wages in 2006 was
regrettable, and the authorities are urged to ensure that, for the medium term, the wage
profile remains consistent with the MTEF, and thus with their growth objectives. Moreover,
repeating the fiscal overperformance of recent years—by expenditure restraint and saving
any excess revenue—appears feasible and would help support the disinflation objective. By
reducing the footprint of the state in the economy, the authorities can limit corruption and
help make Moldova an attractive destination for investment. In this context, it will be
important to ensure that assistance to the poor to deal with higher energy prices is welltargeted.
53.
Improving public sector management is a priority. Moldova needs to carry
forward public finance management reforms, such as the extension of the single treasury
account and greater transparency in the budget process. These reforms will ensure that public
resources are managed well and in a transparent way, which will also provide comfort to
donors. In this regard, establishing a system to track poverty-related expenditures is very
welcome.
54.
Modernization of public enterprise management is a key element of the
authorities’ reform agenda. Steps to revitalize the privatization process and strengthening
corporate governance in those firms where the state retains a majority share are
commendable. Improved transparency regarding the financial performance of the public
enterprise sector will help build ownership for the privatization process, as parliament and
the public understand the true opportunity cost of keeping taxpayer resources tied up in
poorly performing state enterprises.
55.
The authorities are right to focus on financial sector performance as a key
bottleneck to growth. Although financial sector stability indicators are healthy, it may
derive as much from a lack of competition and dynamism in the Moldovan banking system
as from prudential motives. Thus, ensuring greater transparency in banking ownership
remains an important priority. Without a clear understanding of who are the ultimate
beneficial owners of banking sector assets, the NBM is in a weak position to guard against
risky practices, such as related-party lending, that could lead to financial sector instability.
Strengthening the independence of the NBM should also help it to aggressively supervise
financial institutions, even if their owners have politically-powerful connections.
56.
The recent arrival of foreign banks in Moldova is welcome but long-overdue, as
it will bring new technology and fresh capital, as well as stimulate competition in the
Moldovan financial sector. The authorities’ decision to privatize BEM to a strategic
banking investor is an important step in this direction. In the meantime, by avoiding the use
of BEM for quasi-fiscal purposes, or providing it with any special treatment, the authorities
will see that there is little point in retaining state ownership of it.
57.
Improving the AML/CFT regime will be an important corollary to the steps to
promote financial sector development. Strengthening the AML law by requiring banks to
report on suspicious transactions carried out between nonresidents will ensure that Moldova
does not become a destination for criminal funds, which would have damaged the reputation

- 34 -

of the Moldovan banking system. Over time, a more fundamental reform of the AML/CFT
regime is needed.
58.
As a small, open economy facing a challenging balance of payments outlook,
Moldova cannot afford restrictions on exports. The decision to remove the requirement
that grain exports be transacted on the Moldovan Commodity Exchange is therefore
welcome. Efforts to combat underinvoicing should focus on more traditional steps by the
State Tax Inspectorate, including use of indirect methods of assessing tax liabilities.
59.
The authorities are urged to resolve their external arrears problem
expeditiously. Establishing an escrow account in the 2005 and 2006 budgets was a welcome
step toward regularizing financial relations with creditor countries. Looking ahead, it will be
important to ensure that prudent debt management practices are followed, particularly once
financing availability picks up following the regularization of arrears.
60.
Overall, the proposed program is appropriately ambitious. The authorities have
demonstrated a good track record of implementation during 2005, and the support of the
international community—particularly the European Union in the form of the EU-Moldova
Action Plan—is reinforcing ownership at the highest levels for the proposed reform agenda.
Civil society has been consulted through the EGPRSP process, and the Moldovan public
seems supportive of the authorities’ efforts to bring Moldovan institutions in line with
European norms. On this basis, staff recommends approval of the authorities’ request for the
use of Fund resources under the three-year PRGF arrangement.
61.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Moldova take place within
24 months subject to the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles in program
countries.

ANNEX

MOLDOVA—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. Background
1.
Moldova’s total external debt at end-2005 is estimated at US$1.6 billion or
55 percent of GDP, down from 64 percent in 2004.22 The public and publicly-guaranteed
(PPG) external debt stock was reduced from 35 percent of GDP to 28 percent. It declined in
dollar terms as well, partly because of appreciation of the US dollar with respect to other
currencies (SDR, Euro, Yen), but also because of net repayments to creditors and
cancellation of state guarantees on some of EBRD loans.23 The NPV of external debt-toexports is estimated to have fallen from 114 percent to 101 percent. Debt service indicators
have also improved with the PPG debt service-to-exports ratio declining from 9 percent to
7 percent. Domestic currency public debt is modest at about 10 percent of GDP (end–2005).
B. External Debt Sustainability
2.
The baseline projection shows further strengthening of the debt position throughout
the period. The NPV of external debt-to-GDP ratio and debt-to-exports is expected to
stabilize at about 8 percent and 16 percent, respectively, by 2025. The debt-service ratio is
also projected to continue to decline and remain well within the debt burden thresholds as
defined by the World Bank’s CPIA-based classification.24 The alternative scenarios and
stress tests do not significantly alter the medium and long-term path of external debt
dynamics indicating the robustness of the conclusions.
C. Public Debt Sustainability
3.
The ratio of public debt to GDP has also declined significantly in recent years.
Public debt is estimated to be 39 percent at end-2005, compared to 74.8 percent in 2002,
reflecting strong growth and real exchange rate appreciation. Consistent with the authorities’
medium term fiscal program, the baseline scenario projects a further decline in the debt-toGDP ratio, with the NPV of public sector debt-to-GDP ratio declining to 10 percent by 2025.
The alternative scenarios and stress tests also show declining ratios over time, with the
exception of the alternative scenario with permanently lower GDP growth (2.7 percent longrun growth vs. 4 percent in the baseline) and the stress test with GDP growth at its 10-year
historical average minus one standard deviation in 2006–07 (implying a growth rate of
22

This consists of $821 million in public and publicly guaranteed debt (28 percent of GDP) including
$56.3 million in arrears (1.9 percent of GDP), $488 million in private debt (17 percent of GDP) and
$286.6 million in energy arrears (10 percent of GDP). Private debt and energy arrears are estimates of the
authorities.

23

EBRD loans to Giurgiulesti Oil Terminal and Vininvest have been transferred to private investors in debt-forequity swap transactions, thereby relieving the government of any obligations to the EBRD on these loans.

24

According to the classification, Moldova is among poor performers, implying the following critical
thresholds: NPV/exports = 100 percent, NPV/GDP = 30 percent, NPV/revenues = 200 percent, debt
service/exports = 15 percent, debt service/revenues = 25 percent.

-3.4 percent for these two years). The results based on historical averages are not good
proxies for expected future developments in Moldova, as this period covers the transition
period as well as the 1998 regional financial crisis. Further, since the DSAs are static
exercises, the results assume that spending would not adjust to this lower growth. However,
the alternative scenario with permanently lower GDP growth emphasizes the importance for
Moldova to continue to improve future growth prospects in order to maintain public debt
sustainability.
D. Conclusions
4.
Rather than a structural debt sustainability problem, Moldova faces short-term
liquidity difficulties, which stem from the projected financing gaps and the stock of arrears
owed to bilateral creditors, chiefly to Russia, the U.S. and Japan. Reengagement of IFI’s and
the international donor community with fresh concessional financing and possibly
rescheduling of its external debt, including arrears, would alleviate the liquidity problem and
free up resources for other development needs.

2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments devided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

APPENDIX I

Safeguards Assessments:

Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the National Bank of Moldova (NBM) is
subject to an assessment with respect to the proposed PRGF arrangement, which should be
completed by the first program review. The necessary documentation has been received and
the assessment is under way.
The NBM was subject to a safeguards assessment in conjunction with the PRGF
Arrangement that expired on December 20, 2003. The previous assessment was completed
on June 12, 2002, and determined that the NBM’s procedures and controls to manage
resources, including IMF disbursements, were not adequate in all areas of the IMF’s
safeguards framework. Specific remedial actions to address identified vulnerabilities were
recommended and the authorities confirmed that all proposed priority measures have been
implemented.
VIII.

Exchange Arrangement:

Moldova has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4, of the Fund’s
Articles of Agreement. Its exchange system remains free of restrictions on payments and
transfers for current international transactions.
Moldova’s exchange rate regime was reclassified as a de facto peg (to the U.S. dollar) in
January 2006.
Prior to the introduction of the Moldovan leu on November 29, 1993, the Russian ruble
(supplemented by NBM-issued ruble denominated coupons) was the legal tender in Moldova.
The government introduced the leu at a conversion rate of one leu equal to 1,000 Moldovan
rubles and an exchange rate of one dollar equal to lei 3.85. The leu remained broadly stable
around MDL 4.75/$ until mid-October 1998. It has since depreciated against the dollar and
traded at MDL 12.97=$1 on February 28, 2006.
Foreign exchange was initially traded on the Chişinău Interbank Foreign Currency Exchange
(CIFCE). Operations of the CIFCE started at the beginning of 1993, and daily auctions
commenced in early February 1995. An active foreign exchange cash market exists within
authorized banks and foreign exchange bureaus. From November 16, 1993 through endOctober 1998, the U.S. dollar exchange rate established in the CIFCE was the official
exchange rate quoted by the NBM. Since November 2, 1998, the official rate as announced
by the NBM is determined as the weighted average of all daily market transactions. The
NBM quotes exchange rates of the leu for other currencies on the basis of the leu-U.S. dollar
rate and the cross-rate relationships between the U.S. dollar and the currencies concerned in
the international market.
IX.

Article IV Consultation:

Moldova is currently on a 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was
concluded on February 7, 2005 (IMF Country Reports Nos. 05/48 and 05/53).

FSAP Participation:

Moldova received an FSAP mission in May 2004; the FSSA was presented to the Board at
the time of the 2004 Article IV discussions.
XI.

Use of Fund Resources:

On February 4, 1993, Moldova purchased Fund resources totaling SDR 13.5 million,
equivalent to 15 percent of quota under the Compensatory and Contingency Financing
Facilities (CCFF). This was followed by a first drawing under the Systemic Transformation
Facility (STF) of SDR 22.5 million, equivalent to 25 percent of quota, which was approved
by the Board on September 16, 1993. On December 17, 1993 the Board approved a purchase
of Fund resources under a stand-by arrangement (SBA) in the amount of SDR 51.75 million
and the drawing of the second tranche of the STF totaling SDR 22.5 million. On December
19, 1994, Moldova made a second purchase under the CCFF totaling SDR 12.2 million,
equivalent to 13.5 percent of quota, in conjunction with the second review of the SBA that
expired at end-March 1995. The Board approved a successor SBA for Moldova in an amount
totaling SDR 58.50 million (equivalent to 65 percent of quota) on March 22, 1995. Three
purchases, totaling SDR 32.4 million (equivalent to 36 percent of quota), were made under
the arrangement. An Extended Arrangement amounting to SDR 135 million (equivalent to
150 percent of old quota) was approved by the Executive Board on May 20, 1996. At the
time of the third review, the program was extended by one year to May 19, 2000. While the
fourth review was completed, the program expired on May 19, 2000 without the completion
of the scheduled last review because parliament rejected twice an important program
condition. Five purchases totaling SDR 87.5 million (equivalent to 97 percent of old quota)
were made under the EFF arrangement. A PRGF arrangement was approved on December
21, 2000 in the amount of SDR 110.88 million (equivalent to 90 percent of quota). SDR 9.24
million was disbursed on December 29, 2000, followed by SDR 9.24 million on February 23,
2001, and SDR 9.24 million on July 26, 2002. The arrangement expired in December 2003
with only one review completed.

APPENDIX II

MOLDOVA—IMF-WORLD BANK RELATIONS
(As of March 8, 2006)
Country Director: Mr. Paul Bermingham
A.

Telephone: +380 44 490 06671

Partnership in Moldova’s Development Strategy

1.
The government and other major stakeholders consider poverty reduction to be the
major development challenge facing Moldova. In May 2004 the government completed a full
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, calling it—the Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (EGPRSP) to emphasize the centrality of growth to poverty reduction. The
document describes the participatory process underpinning the development of the strategy,
provides a diagnostic of poverty, and presents sector programs and policy measures for
sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction. The Joint Staff Advisory Note assessing
the EGPRSP was discussed by the Boards of the World Bank and the IMF in
November 2004.
2.
The IMF has taken the lead in assisting Moldova in promoting and maintaining
macroeconomic stability through prudent monetary and financial policies. In this regard the
Fund has encouraged the Moldovan authorities to implement a policy reform agenda that
would attract the needed level of concessional foreign financing from bilateral and
multilateral creditors and encourage the international community to reschedule Moldova’s
external debt to enhance debt sustainability. The Fund has supported Moldova’s economic
reform program since 1993. A three-year program under the PRGF facility was approved in
December 2000. The first PRGF review was not completed until Mid-2002 as a result of
disruptions stemming from a change in government in early 2001. Several attempts to
complete the second review have failed owing to the incomplete implementation of agreed
actions. The program expired at the end of 2003, leaving ¾ of the available funds
undisbursed.
3.
The World Bank has taken the lead in the policy dialogue on a number of structural
issues relevant to economic growth and poverty reduction, including private sector
development, infrastructure, health, education, social protection, and agricultural sector
reforms. A range of instruments is used to conduct this dialogue. Since 1994, four structural
adjustment operations have been carried out, which aimed at supporting structural reforms in
the areas of financial discipline, cash privatization, de-monopolization and privatization of
the energy sector and telecom, and urban and rural land markets. The First Structural
Adjustment Loan ($60 million) was approved in December 1994. The Second Structural
Adjustment Loan and Credit ($100 million, of which IDA credit of $45 million) was
approved in 1997. The third tranche was cancelled and replaced with a $40 million Structural
Adjustment Credit (approved on June 24, 1999). The second tranche of the SAC was
accompanied by a $10 million budget support grant from the Dutch Government. A
supplement of $5 million was disbursed in December 2001 to help the government fill a
financial gap created by ice storm damages of November 2000. A Third Structural
Adjustment Credit ($30 million) was approved in June 2002. Lack of progress in structural
reforms resulted in the credit expiring in September 2003 with 2/3 of the credit undisbursed.
Adjustment operations have been combined with sector projects in rural finance, energy,

- 62 -

APPENDIX II

agriculture, environment, health, education, social protection and private sector development.
Recent analytical work of the Bank includes a Public Expenditure Management Review, an
Investment Climate Assessment, a Country Procurement Assessment Review, a Country
Financial Accountability Assessment, a Trade Diagnostic Study, the second Poverty
Assessment, an Education Policy Note, a Health Policy Note, an Agricultural Note as well as
Country Economic Memorandum entitled Moldova: Opportunities for Accelerated Growth.
Bank is also providing technical assistance to the government in the areas of poverty
monitoring, civil service reform and governance, and social protection.
4.
In a number of areas—social sectors, environment, infrastructure—the Bank takes the
lead in the dialogue. The Bank also is leading the areas of support for the private sector
development and agricultural sector reform and Bank analysis serves as input into the Fund
program. In other areas—trade and customs reform, financial sector policies, public sector
management—both institutions work together. Finally, in areas like fiscal, monetary, and
exchange rate policies, and tax administration, the IMF takes the lead.
B.

IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
Areas in which the World Bank leads

5.
Areas in which the Bank leads the policy dialogue are social sectors, infrastructure,
and environment. In the social sphere, the Bank has carried out Poverty Assessments to
monitor and evaluate progress in alleviating poverty. A second poverty assessment has
recently been completed. A Social Protection Management Project supports the
implementation of comprehensive reform of the public pension system and the introduction
of a regulatory framework for private pension funds. The project also supports the
implementation of the new organizational structure for social insurance. The Bank has also
supported two Social Investment Fund (SIF) Projects to assist in the building of local
community and municipal capacity and skills through the rehabilitation of social
infrastructure. The SIF also focuses on improving the delivery of social services, creating
short-term employment and opportunities in rural areas by financing small-scale public
works and supporting micro-business development.
6.
In health, the ongoing Health Investment Fund Project is focused on improving the
health status of the Moldovan population and increasing the quality and efficiency of public
health services by improving access to essential services by the poor. The Moldova AIDS
Control Project aims at improving Moldova’s health status and assists in achieving the
health-related Millennium Development Goals by reducing mortality, morbidity, and
transmission of HIV/AIDs.
7.
In education, the Quality Education in Rural Areas Project, builds upon recently
closed General Education Project and supports the Government's education program to
enhance the quality of teaching and learning, increase access and equity, improve the
efficiency in public spending for education, and strengthen education planning and
monitoring.
8.
With regards to infrastructure development, the Bank is concentrating on upgrading
basic utility services impacting the population at large and the poor in particular. The Energy

- 63 -

APPENDIX II

II Project has two main components: (i) power system infrastructure—investments to
upgrade and rehabilitate metering, dispatch and communications, selected priority
rehabilitation of the electricity of the electricity transmission network, and institutional
development and regulation of the electricity market; and (ii) heating supply and
consumption—investments in improving heating supply and energy efficiency in selected
public buildings. A Pilot Water Supply and Sanitation Project is aimed at enhancing the
welfare of the population living in some of the poorest rural areas and medium-sized towns
and cities by improving the quality, efficiency, and sustainability of water supply and
sanitation services by rehabilitating and improving operations of selected water and sewage
systems to increase service quality and efficiency, improving the financial viability and
commercial practices of the participating utilities, and involving the private sector in the
sector.
9.
The Bank has supported a number of environmental projects. The Agriculture
Pollution Control Project focuses on significantly increasing the use of environmentally
friendly agricultural practices by farmers and agro-industry thereby reducing nutrient
discharge from agricultural sources into the Danube River and Black Sea. A number of
technical assistance activities are also under implementation. A Biodiversity Strategy
Development is assisting the government in implementing Articles 6 and 8 of the Convention
on Biological Diversity. The project also supports the formulation and adoption of strategies
and actions for the protection and sustainable use of bio-diversity, through a participatory
process involving the public and private sectors and local NGOs. Similarly, the recently
closed Biodiversity Conservation Project addressed national environmental priorities of
improved water quality and habitat management of the Nistru River.
10.
In the area of rural and agricultural development, the Bank’s First Cadastre
Project has initiated the first cadastre, implemented a rural land registration system, and
helped develop the institutional framework to complete and manage the legal cadastre in
urban areas. The project helped establish a system of clear and enforceable ownership rights
so as to promote the privatization of land the development of real markets in Moldova. The
two Rural Investment and Services Projects increase rural incomes and living standards by
promoting rural entrepreneurship, agricultural production, economic diversification, and
trade in the rural areas. The projects provide public investment support to alleviate key
institutional constraints in farmer’s group formation, supporting development of marketing
institutions and infrastructure for improved access to input and output markets, and
developing a rural advisory service. The projects also provide investment and working
capital at commercial terms to support a broad range of agribusiness.
11.
While the Bank has taken the lead in the areas described above, the IMF has a strong
interest in these areas since many of these reforms are critical to achieving macroeconomic
stabilization and enhancing growth prospects. Accordingly, there is a high degree of
consultation and coordination between the two institutions on these matters.
Areas of shared responsibility
12.

The Bank and Fund are working jointly in a number of areas:

- 64 -

APPENDIX II

13.
Private Sector Development. While substantial progress in improving Moldova’s
business environment has been made, a challenging reform agenda remains. Both the Bank
and the Fund have focused on this agenda in their assistance programs, including SAC III
and PRGF arrangement and the surveillance exercise. The Bank has undertaken a number of
studies, including the Investment Climate Assessment, the Business Environment and
Enterprise Performance Survey (together with EBRD), a Diagnostic Review of the
Environment for Foreign Investment, and a number of Costs of Doing Business Surveys, to
gauge ongoing developments in this area and determine the most important impediments to
private sector development. The Bank’s Private Sector Development II (PSD II) Project
strengthens the competitiveness of private and public enterprises in Moldova through the
hands-on training of local managers abroad (human capital investment) and creation of a
Competitiveness Center (market information and benchmarking). The recently approved
Competitiveness Enhancement Project builds upon successes of the PSD II credit by
providing support for the business environment improvement and modernization of the
standardization and metrology system. The IFC has promoted financial sector development
by extending credit lines to a number of private banks for on-lending to private sector. The
Fund has focused on policies needed to maintain a stable macroeconomic environment and
remove obstacles to growth, thus encouraging private sector activities. A number of technical
assistance missions have been undertaken to improve banking legislation and banking
supervision, including the joint Financial Sector Assessment Program.
14.
In the area of Public Sector Management, the Bank’s Public Economic Management
Review, Country Procurement Assessment Review and Country Financial Accountability
Assessment examine fiscal adjustment and reform efforts in the social sectors and suggest
policy measures to strengthen public expenditure management and actions needed to build
capacity for increased government effectiveness. The recently completed Country Economic
Memorandum, entitled Moldova: Opportunities for accelerated growth contains
recommendations for improving the macroeconomic environment, enhancing the
opportunities presented by the large inflow of remittances, creating a more dynamic and
diversified private sector. The Bank’s project Trade and Transportation Facilitation in
Southeast Europe (part of the Stability Pact initiative), aims to strengthen and modernize the
Customs Administration and other border control agencies with the objective reducing nontariff costs to trade and transport and preventing smuggling and corruption at border
crossings. The Public Finance Management Project will help the Moldovan Authorities to
develop a budget planning and execution system by institutionalizing the medium-term
expenditure planning and modernizing budget classification; will assist in upgrading the
internal control and audit system in the central government bodies. The Fund has also
provided technical assistance to improve custom and administration, government financial
statistics, and public expenditure policies.
Areas in which the IMF leads
15.
The Fund takes the lead in the formulation and execution of fiscal and monetary
policies, external policies, and issues involving economic and financial statistics. In the
budgetary area, the Fund leads the dialogue on fiscal matters, taking the lead on tax policy
and reforms.

In these areas the Bank takes into account the policy recommendations of the IMF
and ensures that its own policy advice is consistent.
C.

The World Bank Group Strategy

17.
The Bank has developed a Country Assistance Strategy for Moldova for the period of
FY04-FY08. The main objective of the new CAS is to support the implementation of the
government’s EGPRSP and capitalize on the gains of previous assistance programs. Board
discussion of the CAS took place in December 2004. A CAS Progress Report will be
presented for the Executive Board’s review in FY07. It will assess the implementation of the
Strategy and discuss possible adjustments to the program for the remaining period of the
CAS.

APPENDIX III

MOLDOVA—RELATIONS WITH THE EBRD
(As of 28 February 2006)
The EBRD’s strategy in Moldova is aimed primarily at supporting private sector
development in the country and increasing policy dialogue with the authorities. The EBRD is
providing support to (i) the financial sector through credit lines, the participation in the
equity of local banks, microfinance products, expansion of its trade facilitation program, and
the provision of new financial products, such as leasing and mortgage financing; (ii) private
enterprises through credit lines and co-financing with local banks, offering privatization and
post-privatization support, facilitating FDI either by investing alongside strategic investors or
assisting the development of local companies, and the expansion of programs that provide
advisory services; and (iii) infrastructure through support for private operators, and public
utilities with a special focus on improvement of the regulatory and operational environment.
In the context of implementing Moldova’s Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction
Strategy and the EU-Moldova Action Plan, the Bank is working with other institutions in
increasing its policy dialogue with the authorities on improving the business climate and
regulatory environment in the country. The EBRD’s Early Transition Country (ETC)
Initiative provides specific financing instruments adapted to the needs of seven CIS
countries, including Moldova, where post-Soviet transition from command to market
economies and democracies has been slower.
Forty four projects have been signed totaling €209.4 million of EBRD resources, including:
(i) a wine export promotion project, which is targeting the main Moldovan wineries and glass
producer, through restructuring of the sector (€24.6 million) and equity investment into a
glass producer (€6.4 million); (ii) an energy efficiency project for upgrading the heating
distribution networks in Chisinau (€7.8 million); (iii) several credit lines and equity
investment for Moldova-Agroindbank for on-lending to small and medium enterprises
(€29.3 million in total); (iv) several credit lines, a co-financing facility and equity investment
for Victoriabank (€12.5 million in total); (v) a credit line and a co-financing facility for
Mobiasbanca (€4.2 million); (vi) credit lines for Moldinconbank and Banca Sociala
(€9.2 million in total);(v) a project for linking Moldovan satellite earth stations to the
Eurovision Network (€0.8 million); (vi) a road rehabilitation loan (€9.6 million); (vii) partial
financing for construction of a new oil terminal at Giurgulesti (€9.6 million); (viii) credit
facilities for micro enterprises through local banks (€2.9 million); (ix) rehabilitating
Chisinau’s water services (€17.6 million); (x) Chisinau Airport Modernization (€7.4 million);
(xi) trade facilitation program for Victoriabank, Moldova-Agroindbank, Moldindconbank,
Mobiasbanca and Banca Sociala (regional TFP—€10.2 million in total); (xii) equity
participation in and a loan to ProCredit and a loan to Rural Finance Corporation – two microfinance companies (€3.2 million in total); and (xiii) equity participation and loan financing
for three privatized power distribution companies (€26.9 million).
In addition to banking projects, some 72 Technical Cooperation projects have been
completed or approved (totaling €12.6 million).

APPENDIX IV

MOLDOVA—STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Economic and financial data provided to the Fund are generally adequate for
surveillance and program monitoring. In July 2005, a ROSC Data Module found that while
the quality of macroeconomic statistics has improved significantly in many areas in the past
few years, accuracy and reliability need to be enhanced further regarding compilation of
fiscal and national accounts statistics.
2.
Moldova has been a GDDS participant since February 2003. The authorities have
expressed interest in subscribing to the SDDS and nominated a national SDDS coordinator in
August 2005. An SDDS mission from STA visited Chisinau (November 16–23, 2005) to
assess Moldova’s data dissemination practices and advise authorities on subscription to the
SDDS. Moldova is making good progress in implementing the recommendations of the
SDDS mission.
3.
National accounts statistics are prepared according to the 1993 SNA methodology.
Estimates do not include the Transnistria region for which data have not been collected
since 1991. GDP is estimated from the production and the expenditure sides, annually and
quarterly. The data are prepared in current and constant (previous-year) prices, and annual
data are revised—in two stages—as updated information becomes available. However, the
quarterly data remain unadjusted, thus limiting their consistency with the revised annual data.
Overall, the national accounts statistics need improvement in the following areas: (i)
improving the accuracy of the data sources (quarterly reporting of all basic statistics on a
discrete basis, industrial production index and price indices following international
standards); (ii) benchmarking the annual and the quarterly data; and (iii) estimating the
consumption of fixed capital in line with international standards.
4.
Price statistics still have several shortcomings. Price collection for the CPI and PPI is
limited geographically and new observations are not imputed. The weights of the CPI basket,
underestimate the share of durable goods. The PPI is not a transaction price index, and covers
a small population of industrial establishments. The industrial production index is compiled
from data in constant prices adjusted to price changes by establishments themselves.
5.
Labor market statistics remain inadequate for analyzing macroeconomic
developments: (i) unemployment data following ILO methodology are not available; and
(ii) wage data do not include fringe benefits, which form an important part of workers’
compensation.
6.
Fiscal statistics. A 1999 GFS technical assistance mission assisted the authorities in
resolving data issues in the classification of accounts. Mission recommendations that still
need to be implemented are: (i) improving the consolidation of general government data; (ii)
reclassifying the financing data by type of debt holder and by type of debt instrument; and
(iii) reporting of monthly fiscal data to STA for publication in International Financial
Statistics by the MoF, based on correspondent accounts at the National Bank of Moldova
(NBM). In addition, World Bank technical assistance was provided to improve the budgetary
reports of local authorities as well as the Social Fund. The authorities reported data in the
GFSM 2001 format for publication in the 2003 GFS Yearbook; however, they could not be

- 68 -

APPENDIX IV

published due to serious data issues. Authorities have addressed these shortcomings and data
for 2004 will be published in the 2005 GFS Yearbook.
7.
Balance of payments. The compilation methodology follows the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual. Problems remain related to: (i) under-reporting of imports and
exports; (ii) collection of data on services; (iii) measurement of private capital inflows,
including direct investment data; and (iv) treatment of transactions with Transnistria.
Moldova disseminates quarterly international investment position statistics.
8.
Monetary and financial statistics have improved, following a series of technical
assistance missions from the Fund. A new chart of accounts for the NBM was introduced in
1996 and commercial banks adopted a new chart of accounts and moved to IAS effective
January l, 1998. A monetary and financial statistics mission in April 2004 found that while
monetary data were broadly in line with international statistical standards and of a generally
good quality, shortcomings remained in the compilation of some monetary statistics
aggregates. A follow-up in May 2005 found that the authorities implemented most of the
April 2004 mission’s recommendations, assisted the authorities in implementing the new
standardized report forms (SRFs), and initiated work toward establishing and Integrated
Monetary Database (IMD) for joint use by EUR and STA. The authorities reported test data
in the SRFs, which are being processed by STA.

PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA
Chisinau, April 6, 2006
DEAR MR. DE RATO,
I would like to take this opportunity to express my support for the economic program
prepared by the Government and the National Bank of Moldova. The Memorandum of
Economic and Financial Policies is based on the medium-term objectives established in the
Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (EGPRSP), and is consistent with
the Republic of Moldova-European Union Action Plan.
The Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies aims to ensure macroeconomic
stability, which is a precondition for economic growth, and to promote structural economic
reforms designed to improve the attractiveness of the Republic of Moldova as a destination
for investment. Without economic growth, it will not be possible to achieve our poverty
reduction objectives, including Moldova’s Millennium Development Goals.
Moldova’s international and European aspirations clearly depend on our ability to raise living
standard and reform the public institutions in accordance with the European standards. With
this goal in mind, I pledge my continuing support for the economic reform efforts outlined in
the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies.
Sincerely yours,
Signature

Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. de Rato:
On behalf of the government and the National Bank of Moldova, we are pleased to submit
herewith the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP). The main objectives
of our program over the medium-term are set out in the Economic Growth and Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (EGPRSP) and in the Republic of Moldova–European Union
Action Plan, and aim at achieving the Millennium Development Goals. These plans envisage
creating conditions for sustainable and inclusive economic growth that reduces poverty.
In support of our medium-term program, we hereby request a new three-year arrangement
under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility in a total amount of SDR 80.08 million
(equivalent to 65 percent of Moldova’s quota). We request that the first disbursement under
the arrangement, in an amount equivalent to SDR 11.44 million, be made available following
the approval of the new PRGF arrangement by the Executive Board of the IMF.
We believe that the policies set forth in the attached MEFP are adequate to achieve the
objectives of the program, but are prepared to take any other measures that may become
appropriate for this purpose. We will consult with the IMF on the adoption of these
measures, in advance of revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance with
the IMF’s policies on such consultation.
We will communicate to the IMF the information needed to monitor progress in
implementing the program. Reviews with the IMF will be conducted throughout the period of
the arrangement to evaluate the macroeconomic and structural reform policies and
implementation of the program and to reach new understandings, as necessary. The first
review will cover the progress made during the first six months of the program and is
expected to take place before end-January 2007.
We are committed to disseminating the MEFP as well as the Technical Memorandum of
Understanding and authorize the IMF to publish its staff report, which will be examined by
the Executive Board.

ATTACHMENT III

MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
A. Introduction
1.
The strong growth performance over the past four years has marked the transition
from a decade of economic decline and rising poverty to a stage of robust growth and
improving living standards. During the period of 2001–04, real GDP increased by more than
30 percent and the absolute poverty rate fell by 41 percent to a level of 27 percent in 2004.
Inflation, although somewhat higher than desirable—owing to both internal and external
factors—has been brought down to near single-digit levels. The exchange rate of the leu has
remained stable and the reserves of the National Bank have increased considerably. Robust
economic growth as well as prudent limits on external borrowing have reduced the ratio of
public and publicly-guaranteed debt from 79 percent of GDP in 2000 to about 33 percent of
GDP in 2005.
2.
These achievements were made possible by maintaining prudent fiscal policies,
focused on improving fiscal administration. Tax revenues increased by more than
6 percentage points of GDP from 2001 to 2005. Although corporate and personal income tax
rates have gradually been reduced since 2002, revenue collections on these taxes have
continued to increase, both in nominal and real terms.
3.
Nevertheless, GDP per capita remains low, and living standards are far inferior to
those in the European Union. This has triggered massive labor migration, and this
phenomenon has given rise to new social and macroeconomic problems. According to the
2004 census, about 371,000 Moldovan citizens (19 percent of the labor force) now make
their living abroad. Remittances, estimated at about 30 percent of GDP, stimulate
consumption but also complicate the conduct of monetary and foreign exchange policy.
A concomitant problem is the dilemma that labor migration poses for pension system
finances, as the tax base for mandatory social insurance contributions is reduced accordingly.
4.
In line with our Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EGPRSP) and
the European Union-Republic of Moldova Action Plan, the government and National Bank
are committed to promoting economic growth based on enhanced productivity and improved
competitiveness. To this end, the authorities intend to accelerate the pace of structural
reforms aimed at ensuring sustainable economic growth based on robust private sector
investment, stronger competitiveness, an efficient public administration, and improvements
in the businesses environment.
5.
To implement the ambitious reform agenda discussed below, the authorities are
counting on the technical and financial assistance of the international community.
B. Recent Macroeconomic Developments
6.
Macroeconomic stability and robust growth continued during 2005. Real GDP grew
by about 7 percent, while inflation fell to 10 percent (December-to-December). Fiscal policy
remained tight, as general government revenues grew by almost 3 percentage points of GDP
over the 2004 level. The surplus of the general government grew to about 1½ percent of
GDP, in part because the government established a special account on which resources have
been accumulated and aimed at reducing our arrears on external debt to Paris Club creditors.
Moreover, in 2005 for the first time since independence, the government started to repay the

- 74 -

ATTACHMENT III

credits received previously from the National Bank of Moldova (in the amount of
Lei 127 million, or 0.3 percent of GDP).
7.
The budgetary process has been improved due to the implementation of our MediumTerm Expenditure Framework (MTEF), and by preparing estimates of the consolidated
general government, including the state and local government budgets, the social insurance
budget and the compulsory medical insurance budget, as well as extrabudgetary funds. In
order to broaden the tax base, VAT exemptions have been eliminated on agriculture, as well
as on the import and supply of pesticides and fertilizers, equipment, technology and
complimentary parts. The VAT rate on medicine has been increased from zero percent to
8 percent.
8.
In the absence of external financing for budget support, external debt service became
a serious burden for the budget, reaching 40 percent of the total state budget revenues.
Throughout 2003–05, the general government recorded primary surpluses of about
2½ percent of GDP, and Moldova’s external debt indicators improved significantly.
Although external arrears have been cleared to commercial and some bilateral official
creditors, the government has not been in a position to make principal payments or clear
arrears to Paris Club creditors.
9.
The key challenge of monetary policy during 2005 was managing the pressure of
foreign currency inflows. These inflows were mainly associated with remittances, and they
had a significant impact on inflation and the exchange rate. During most of 2005, there was
upward pressure on the leu, and it took considerable effort on the part of the NBM to bring
inflation back down from near 15 percent in Q1 to almost single-digit levels by year-end
(despite strong growth in energy sector prices).
10.
The NBM maintains a floating exchange rate regime, intervening only to smooth out
excessive volatility in the exchange rate. During 2005, the real effective exchange rate of the
leu registered an appreciation of 2.4 percentage points, relative to December 2004. Reserves
grew by almost $130 million in 2005, reaching 2.2 months of prospective imports at endDecember.
11.
At the same time, Moldova’s external vulnerability continued to grow. Largely
owing to the impact of higher energy prices, the trade balance deteriorated by almost
9 percentage points of GDP during 2005. This worsening was partially compensated by other
items, leading to a growth in the current account deficit of about 4 percentage points of GDP.
Diversification of Moldova’s export markets remains limited, reflecting our continued
dependence on traditional CIS markets, which in 2005 absorbed about 51 percent of total
Moldovan exports (only about 30 percent went to EU markets). Trade relations were also
complicated during 2005 by restrictions in Russia on imports of meat and farm product from
Moldova .
12.
Banking sector stability has been maintained over the past few years. Following the
2004 FSAP, parliament adopted amendments to the Law on the National Bank of Moldova
and the Law on Financial Institutions aimed at bringing them more closely in line with
European Union banking directives and modern central banking practices. The FSAP
concluded that financial sector stability indicators are strong, and that, in general terms,
Moldova respects the Basel core principles regarding effective banking supervision.
Generally, the banking sector demonstrates impressive levels of revenues, capitalization and

- 75 -

ATTACHMENT III

liquidity, as well as a low level of nonperforming assets. The NBM’s application of
different analytical and stress tests have identified no systemic vulnerabilities of the banking
sector.
C. Program Objectives
13.
The main objectives of the government’s program over the medium term are set out
in the Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (EGPRSP) and in the
Republic of Moldova—European Union Action Plan, and aim at achieving the Millennium
Development Goals. These plans envisage creating conditions ensuring sustainable and
inclusive economic growth that reduces poverty in Moldova.
14.
The government realizes that consumption currently represents the major source of
GDP growth, and that productivity needs to become the driving force for growth. In turn,
improvements in productivity and competitiveness can only be ensured by improving the
investment climate, rehabilitating infrastructure—including through increasing public
investment—while also divesting from and improving the management of state assets.
15.
Developing and implementing a comprehensive structural adjustment program and
ensuring the promotion of efficient policies in the future will be facilitated by the
modernization of the central public administration, optimization of the decision-making
process, strengthening the management of public finances and improving human resource
management, including through the reform of the public sector wage system.
16.
The macroeconomic program for the next three years aims at maintaining inflation in
the single digit range, gradually reducing it to about 7 percent by end-2008. Except for
2006, the budget deficit will not exceed 0.5 percent of GDP, while the current account deficit
is projected to be in the neighborhood of 5 percent of GDP. The NBM will aim to increase
foreign exchange reserves to at least three months of imports by end-2008. The government
is committed to normalize financial relations with Paris Club creditors, including by seeking
a possible debt restructuring.
17.
The government intends to closely monitor the evolution of poverty and to accelerate
reforms of the social assistance system which, together with the help of international
development partners and robust economic growth, will allow for the further poverty
reduction consistent with the EGPRSP.
D. Fiscal Policy
18.
Fiscal policy over the coming years will be directed toward encouraging economic
growth and ensuring debt sustainability. The program envisages a budget deficit of
0.8 percent of GDP in 2006, followed by deficits that will not exceed 0.5 percent of GDP
during 2007–08. Any funds released as a result of external debt restructuring through the
Paris Club would be directed to poverty reduction. As in previous years, the government
intends to attain a primary surplus in order to restore external debt sustainability. In this
regard, continuous efforts will be undertaken to: (i) improve tax administration, (ii)
rationalize discretionary expenditures, (iii) reduce tax exemptions, and (iv) improve access
to concessional external resources. Nevertheless, despite the government’s intention to
maintain tight fiscal policy, the possibility of external shocks—such as a sudden jump in
energy prices—could make it appropriate to review our deficit target, in consultation with
the IMF staff.

- 76 -

ATTACHMENT III

19.
Coming on the heels of strong revenue growth in 2004–05, tax receipts are expected
to remain in the neighborhood of 32 percent of GDP during the next three years. While
income tax rates were reduced in January 2006, VAT tax exemptions equal to
Lei 300 million were cancelled, and excise tax rates for some goods were indexed to
inflation. Overall general government revenues are expected to remain at about 37 percent of
GDP throughout the program period.
20.
An important objective of the medium-term expenditure framework is to identify
resources for increased public investment. This objective will be accomplished through
rationalization of budget expenditures in line with recommendations to be made in the public
expenditure review being conducted in 2006 with the support of the World Bank, and by
ensuring greater access to concessional external funding. Social expenditures are not
expected to diminish throughout the program. Additionally, strategic budget planning will be
strengthened to ensure financing of EGPRSP priorities.
21.
The government is determined to develop and implement a comprehensive tax
administration reform, with assistance of the IMF, that will aim to reduce the administrative
burden of the tax system as a means of stimulating business development. The strategy,
which will be adopted by September 30, 2006, will focus on a risk-based approach to audit
and enforcement, improvements to the VAT refund process and will promote the use of
indirect methods of assessing tax liability, including as a means of combating underinvoicing
in external trade.
22.
The authorities affirm their intention to promote pass-through of higher prices for
imported energy products to the tariffs paid by households, enterprises, and budget
institutions. Nevertheless, continued growth in energy prices could give rise to a demand for
additional transfers to poorer households, which would need to be accommodated within the
agreed deficit target. In this regard the government is looking for support from the IMF and
the World Bank in the form of a poverty and social impact assessment of growing energy
prices, as well as in the development of efficient subsidy mechanisms in this respect.
23.
The finances of the state social insurance fund budget deteriorated in 2005, in part
because of pension increases in late 2004. Thus, in January 2006 the government began to
implement a reform of agricultural pensions, and included judges and prosecutors in the state
social insurance system. The authorities are committed to continue with the implementation
of individual record keeping of state social insurance contributions. In order to ensure the
financial sustainability of the social insurance budget, by 2008 we plan to introduce a new
system to estimate benefits, including pensions, based on an applicant’s contributions to the
social insurance budget. In the meantime, by December 31, 2006, the government—with
technical assistance from the international financial institutions—will develop a plan to
ensure that the finances of the Social Fund are placed on a sustainable basis over the medium
term (beginning with implementation in the 2008 budget cycle).
E. Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
24.
From 2006, the National Bank of Moldova will orient monetary policy toward
maintaining price stability in the single-digit range, recognizing that as a result, interest rates
may need to rise and exchange rate fluctuations could increase. At present, the Law on the
National Bank assigns the NBM the responsibility of ensuring the stability of the national
currency, which can be interpreted to mean either the exchange rate or the price level. To

- 77 -

ATTACHMENT III

eliminate this problem of dual objectives, by July 31, 2006, the Law on the National Bank
will be amended to clarify that the Bank’s primary objective and responsibility is price
stability. The amended law will also bolster the independence of the National Bank by
prohibiting direct credit to government, and by strengthening the independence of NBM
board members in the performance of their tasks and duties. At the next opportunity, the
authorities also intend to propose an amendment to the Constitution to include an explicit
reference to the independence of the National Bank of Moldova, and to clarify the NBM’s
role in the conduct of monetary policy.
25.
The authorities intend to tighten monetary policies in order to ensure achievement of
the inflation objective for 2006. Base money is projected to grow at a rate of 16 percent
(December-to-December), in the context of which the NBM will continue to make use of
indirect methods of monetary policy, such as deposit auctions and open-market operations,
to achieve the inflation objective. In support of this objective, by March 31, 2006, the central
government will move the deposits of the state budget (which does not include the Social
Fund, the Health Fund, the special revenue and extrabudgetary funds, and up to MDL 100
million set aside to clear arrears on external debt) from the commercial banks to the NBM.
During 2006, the NBM will stand ready to further tighten the stance of monetary policy if, in
consultation with the IMF staff, such tightening is deemed necessary to ensure achievement
of the inflation objective. To enhance the NBM’s ability to conduct open-market operations,
the NBM and the government—with technical assistance from the IMF—will study the
desirability of converting the pre-2004 stock of outstanding direct central bank credits to
government into marketable securities with maturities that are consistent with budgetary debt
sustainability.
26.
The National Bank intends to ensure financial sector stability and to promote
sustainable development in the banking sector. In particular, changes in financial sector
legislation were adopted in 2005 aimed at implementing recommendations of the FSAP,
including lowering the threshold above which shareholders in banks need to be assessed as
fit and proper. The revised legislation requires that the fit and proper test applies to all
changes in ownership, which will improve the ability of the NBM to guard against relatedparty lending and owners who act in concert.
27.
As recommended by the FSAP, the government is developing an exit strategy for
those banks where the state has a significant shareholding, including Banca de Economii
(BEM). Thus, the government’s intention is to privatize BEM to a strategic banking investor
who will bring new technology, strengthened management and fresh capital to the bank, and
stimulate competition in the Moldovan banking system. The government will begin this
process with an independent evaluation of the market value of BEM, conducted by an
internationally reputable firm (the tender to be announced May 1, 2006, with bids to be
submitted by August 31, 2006, and the tender winner announced by year-end), and
completed in 2007. In the meantime, neither the government nor the NBM will provide
preferential treatment to the bank, including as regards taxation, prudential regulation, or
access to resources.
28.
The government and the National Bank of Moldova will continue implementation of
the objectives set in EGPRSP and EU-Moldova Action Plan with respect to financial and
banking sector. In particular, Moldova remains firmly committed to the global effort to
combat money-laundering and the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). In this regard, the

- 78 -

ATTACHMENT III

authorities plan to develop a comprehensive plan to strengthen our AML/CFT regime, for
which we plan to request the assistance of MONEYVAL and the IMF. In the near term, by
March 31, 2006, the AML/CFT law will be amended to require that suspicious
transactions—regardless of whether they take place between residents or nonresidents—be
reported by financial institutions to Moldova’s financial intelligence unit (the CCECC).
F. Structural Reforms
29.
The main principle of the program is clarification of the role of the state in the
economy. With this in mind, the key pillars of the structural reform agenda of the
government and the National Bank are: (i) public administration reform; (ii) regulatory
reform; (iii) improvements in public finance management; and (iv) improving management
and divestiture of public assets.
Public administration reform
30.
A major effort in the context of structural reforms is the implementation of the
central public administration reform, which has the objective of establishing an efficient
central public administration that operates according to the principles of good governance
applied by European Union member-states. The reform calls for the reorganization of central
public administration, optimization of the decision-making process, and improvement of
human resource management. A strategy for Central Public Administration Reform was
developed during the second half of 2005 in a process that involved all of the key
stakeholders, including international development partners, and adopted by the government
in December. The Strategy calls for: (i) redefining the competencies and functions of central
specialized authorities of public administration; and (ii) reconfiguring the structure of the
central executive institutions to better achieve the government’s priorities. The first stage of
the reform—a preliminary functional analysis of key central ministries and public
administration agencies, and the assessment of the decision-making process of the central
public administration—has been done. The second stage will be a detailed functional
analysis of the central public administration agencies that covers the remaining agencies (not
covered in the first stage) and extends down to local levels of central public administration
(to be completed by December 31, 2006). Based on the functional review, the government
will propose changes in personnel levels for individual agencies, recognizing that some
agencies may experience downsizing, while others could be increased—especially in order
to facilitate cooperation with European institutions.
31.
The Strategy envisages preparation of a draft law on the civil service that would
regulate the following: (i) the functioning of the central administrative agency responsible
for managing the civil service employment; (ii) the hiring and promotion of civil servants on
a competitive basis; and (iii) the separation of political and administrative functions. The
draft law will be submitted to parliament by December 31, 2006. The Strategy also envisages
elaboration and government adoption of a Code of Ethics of a public functionary by
September 30, 2006. The government affirms its intention to implement the law on budget
sector wages gradually, within the resource limits foreseen in the annual budgets and agreed
with the IMF staff.

- 79 -

ATTACHMENT III

Regulatory reform
32.
Regulatory reform is an important element of the public administration reform, which
has the objective of creating an open and flexible business environment with low costs to
facilitate investments and innovations in business. This reform envisages two major stages:
(i) deregulation and simplification; and (ii) consolidation of good regulation capacities of
governmental institutions. To that end, a number of actions pertaining to the first stage were
undertaken in 2003–05: (i) simplification and centralization of licensing procedures;
(ii) simplification of the procedure for business registration; and (iii) reduction of conflicts of
interest between the role of inspections and the interests of individuals working in inspecting
agencies. Under this “guillotine” process, the number of authorizations, permits, licenses and
certificates that entrepreneurs need in order to operate was significantly reduced (and most
now need to be provided free of charge, within a fixed number of days). For example, the
number of activities requiring authorizations and licenses was reduced from 360 to 49, and
their term extended.
33.
The government is developing a draft National Strategy designed to make the
regulatory reform a continuous process, and which is to be approved by June 30, 2006.
According to the Strategy, the second stage of the regulatory “guillotine” will begin with the
approval by the parliament of the law on the basic principles and mechanisms of regulating
entrepreneurial activity in the first half of 2006 and will be accomplished in early 2008. This
law will provide for the revision and simplification of the legal framework regulating the
entrepreneurial activity. The Strategy also envisages improving transparency and the
application of laws and regulations by establishing a regulatory impact assessment (RIA)
system by September 30, 2006. Likewise, using the example of the one-stop shop for the
registration of enterprises, a similar mechanism will be put in place for licensing by
September 30, 2006.
Public finance management
34.
The government will continue to improve public finance management by undertaking
reforms necessary to align Moldovan fiscal institutions and legislation to EU requirements.
The government’s Public Finance Management Project, implemented with the support of the
World Bank and other development partners, aims to introduce best international practices of
budget preparation, execution, reporting, accounting, financial control and audit, and
developing an integrated public finance management information system.
35.
In order to improve cash management, the government has closed the regional
revenue accounts of the social fund in commercial banks, using instead the accounts
established in the treasury. The government also plans to close the cash accounts of the State
Tax Inspectorate in the commercial banks and establish a system to allow the treasury to
monitor, on a monthly basis, all remaining accounts of budget institutions in the commercial
banks (by March 31, 2006). In the meantime, by September 30, 2006, the government will
prepare a plan—with technical assistance of the IMF—to transfer the expenditure accounts
of the Social and Health Insurance Funds and the special (own) revenue accounts of budget
institutions to the treasury (e.g., the remaining accounts in the commercial banks will be
zeroed out on a daily basis) in 2007. By 2010, when the integrated public finance
management information system is fully in place, payments of the Social and Health
Insurance Funds will be executed by the treasury.

- 80 -

ATTACHMENT III

Privatization and state asset management
36.
The government intends to improve the management of state assets and revitalize the
privatization process. To this end, during 2005 the government carried out a full inventory
and evaluation of the performance of state assets in the economy, and conducted a thorough
analysis of the privatization methods that have been used in Moldova. On the basis of these
studies, we have developed a concept paper on management and divestiture of public
property that envisages corporatization of enterprises subject to privatization in the near
term, and implementation of the principle of corporate governance in all other state
enterprises. Although it is not intended to corporatize all state-owned enterprises
immediately (owing to cost considerations), these firms will be placed in conditions similar
to joint stock companies. For example, they will calculate and, if appropriate, pay dividends,
and will be managed by a board on which the majority of members will be representatives of
the ministry of finance and ministry of economy and trade.
37.
In order to promote budgetary transparency, the ministry of finance will conduct an
annual analysis of the financial results of state enterprises and joint stock companies with
state participation, in conformity with the IMF’s 2001 Government Finance Statistics
manual. Beginning with the budget process for 2008, the analysis of the financial results of
these enterprises cover all state enterprises and joint stock companies with a state share of
more than 51 percent. The results of this analysis will be submitted to the parliament as
background material to the Explanatory Note for the draft Law on the state budget.
By September 30, 2006, the government will take a decision to create a unit in the ministry
of finance with the aim of carrying out this work. To effect these changes, amendments to
the Law of State Enterprise will be submitted to parliament by June 30, 2006 and passed by
December 31, 2006. During the first half of 2008, the government will assess the results of
these reforms, and if necessary will propose full corporatization of all state enterprises.
38.
In order to accelerate the divestiture process, the government is considering a variety
of mechanisms, including public-private partnerships. We intend to amend government
decrees with the intention of streamlining the privatization process during the first quarter of
2006, and we plan to revise and submit to parliament an expanded list of enterprises to be
included in the privatization program on the basis of the analysis conducted in 2005.
Moreover, a draft law on managing and divestiture of public property (including a public
enterprise reporting framework based on the 2001 Government Finance Statistics manual)
and of amendments to the Law Public Debt requiring mandatory reporting to the Ministry of
Finance of all state-owned enterprise debts, will be submitted to parliament by September
30, 2006, and passed by December 31, 2006.
39.
The government believes that the procedure currently applied to restructuring
insolvent enterprises through the Council of Creditors needs to be improved. With the aim of
reducing the budgetary impact of tax arrears accumulated by unprofitable enterprises, as well
as with the goal of eliminating unfair competition, the government intends to propose
amendments to the Law of Insolvency (No. 632-XV dated November 14, 2001), which will
envisage replacing the Council of Creditors with a new system for handling insolvency by
the start of 2007. In the meantime, the government will establish September 30, 2006 as the
deadline, after expiry of which the Council of Creditors will not approve new cases of debt
restructuring. Moreover, from February to September of 2006, the Council of Creditors will
sign new restructuring agreements for a total amount of debt not to exceed Lei 100 million,

- 81 -

ATTACHMENT III

and with full repayment of each of the restructured debt not to exceed three years. To this
end, we shall consider new agreements those that did not yet enter post-moratorium phases,
that is, agreements referring to completely new cases and to cases for which the Council of
Creditors had not approved restructuring plans before January 31, 2006. The Council of
Creditors will be abolished by December 31, 2006, and its responsibilities for monitoring
previously approved restructuring agreements will be allocated to the State Tax Inspectorate
and the corresponding courts. At the same time, the government intends to improve—with
the assistance of IMF—the legislative, regulatory and institutional framework concerning
bankruptcy procedures.
40.
The government intends to develop a new strategy of promoting exports aimed at
improving Moldova’s ability to penetrate external markets. In particular, we hope to
diversify our commodity markets by reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers impeding
development of external trade. The Asycuda World Informational System has been
implemented at all custom offices since August 1, 2005, and the government intends to
develop a strategy for customs risk management with the aim of creating risk profiles.
Similarly, the requirement that grain exports must be transacted on the Moldovan
Commodity Exchange will be abolished by September 30, 2006, and similar requirements
will not be introduced for other export products. In addition, there are no restrictions
specifying the mode of transportation (trains vs. truck) for agricultural products. At the same
time, planned improvements in tax administration (noted above) will strengthen the capacity
of the State Tax Inspectorate to combat the problem of underinvoicing.
41.
Moldova is fully committed to implementation of the EU-Moldova Action Plan,
signed in February 2005. The Plan covers almost all of the areas of political, economic and
social activities of the state, and is consistent with the EGPRSP. In order to avoid duplication
of effort, the Government intends to coordinate the implementation and monitoring of both
plans in a consistent manner, in consultation with the European Commission, the World
Bank, the IMF and other stakeholders.

The general government is defined as comprising the central and local government
budgets. The central government includes also the Social Insurance Fund, the Health

- 88 -

ATTACHMENT IV

Insurance Fund, special and extrabudgetary funds, and foreign-financed investment projects.
The local government includes also special and extrabudgetary funds. The authorities will
inform the Fund staff of any new special or extrabudgetary funds that may be created during
the program period to carry out operations of a fiscal nature and will ensure that these will be
included in the general government. Excluded are any government-owned entities with a
separate legal status. Net credit of the banking system to general government is defined as
outstanding claims of the banking system on the general government (exclusive of the claims
associated with accrued interest, tax and social contribution payments by commercial banks,
and foreign financed on-lending by banks), including overdrafts, direct credit and holdings
of government securities, less deposits of the general government (excluding accrued interest
on government deposits, and including the accounts for foreign-financed investment
projects).27 The Ministry of Finance will provide data on the holdings of government
securities and foreign-financed investment projects.
12.
The quarterly limits on the overall cash deficit of the general government are
cumulative and will be monitored from the financing side as the sum of net credit of the
banking system to the general government (excluding the change in the stock of government
securities issued to recapitalize the central bank), the general government’s net placement of
securities outside the domestic banking system, other net credit from the domestic nonbanking sector to the general government, the general government’s receipt of disbursements
from external debt28 for direct budgetary support and for specific projects minus
amortization paid, and privatization proceeds stemming from the sale of the general
government’s assets, after deduction of the costs directly associated with the sale of these
assets. The calculation of the deficit as specified in this TMU may need to be reviewed, once
planned amendments to the Chart of Accounts are introduced in April, 2006.
13.
Government securities in the form of zero-coupon obligations sold at a discount to
face value will be treated as financing items in the fiscal accounts, in the amount actually
received from buyers. At the time of redemption, the sales value will be recorded as
amortization, and the difference between amortization so defined and the face value will be
recorded as domestic interest payments.
14.
External-debt limits apply to (i) the contracting or guaranteeing of short-term nonconcessional external debt (with an original maturity of up to and including one year) and
(ii) contracting or guaranteeing of non-concessional medium- and long-term debt with
original maturities of more than one year. Short-term debt includes all short term obligations,
excluding import trade credits. Short-term debt denominated in currencies other than the
U.S. dollar shall be valued in U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of
disbursement. Medium- and long-term debt denominated in currencies other than the
U.S. dollar shall be valued in U.S. dollars at actual cross-exchange rates.
27

For the calculation of the net credit of the banking system to general government the following accounts will
be excluded: 1731, 1732, 1733, 1735, 1761, 1762, 1763, 1801, 1802, 1805, 1807, 2711, 2717, 2721, 2727,
2732, 2733, 2796, 2801 and 2802.
28

Debt is defined as in footnote 29 in the section on limits on external debt.

- 89 -

ATTACHMENT IV

15.
The term debt has the meaning set forth in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on
Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (Decision No. 12274-(00/85), adopted
August 24, 2000).29 This performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined above, but
also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received.
16.
For purpose of the program, the guarantee of a debt arises from any explicit legal
obligation of the government or the NBM or any other agency acting on behalf of the
government to service such a debt in the event of nonpayment by the recipient.
17.
Concessionality will be calculated using currency-specific discount rates based on
the OECD commercial interest reference rates (CIRRs). The ten-year average of CIRRs will
be used as the discount rate to assess the concessionality of loans of an original maturity of
at least 15 years, and a six-month average of CIRRs will be used to assess the
concessionality of loans with original maturities of less than 15 years. To both the ten-year
and six-month averages, the following margins will be added: 0.75 percent for repayment
periods of less than 15 years; 1 percent for 15–19 years; 1.15 percent for 20–30 years; and
1.25 percent for over 30 years. Under this definition, only loans with a grant element
equivalent to 35 percent or more will be excluded from the borrowing limits. The debt limits
will not apply to loans classified as international reserve liabilities of the NBM.
18.
For the purposes of the program, external payments arrears will consist of all overdue
debt-service obligations (i.e. payments of principal or interest) arising in respect of any debt
contracted or guaranteed or assumed by the government of the Republic of Moldova, or the
NBM, or any agency acting on behalf of the government of the Republic of Moldova. The
ceiling on new external payments arrears shall apply on a continuous basis throughout the
period of the arrangement. It shall not apply to external payments arrears arising from
external debt being renegotiated with external creditors, including Paris Club creditors; and
more specifically, to external payments arrears in respect of which a creditor has agreed that
no payment needs to be made pending negotiations.
19.
Expenditure arrears are defined as the difference between payment obligations due,
and actual payments made. They can arise on any expenditure item, including transfers, debt
service, wages, pensions, energy payments and goods and services. Expenditure arrears for
goods and services to suppliers are defined as obligations to suppliers, which are due but not
paid for more than 30 days and are non-disputed. Arrears between the state budget, local
government, social and health funds, and all extrabudgetary funds are not counted towards
the expenditure arrears’ ceiling on the general government.
29

Debt is defined as a current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through
the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to
make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future point(s) in
time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Arrears,
penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual
obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt
under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.”

- 90 -

ATTACHMENT IV

IV. ADJUSTERS
20.
In the event that privatization receipts exceed the program assumptions, this will
trigger consultations with Fund staff to agree on their use.
21.
In case disbursements of external loans exceed the program assumptions, the limits
on the overall cash deficit of the general government will be increased by the corresponding
magnitude up to a cumulative cap of lei 125 million. In case of shortfalls, the limits will be
decreased by the full amount.
22.
The limits on net domestic assets of the NBM will be increased by the face value of
government securities issued for recapitalization of the NBM and decreased by the face
value of repayment of government securities previously issued for the same purpose.

Statement by the IM Staff Representative
May 5, 2006
1.
This statement summarizes developments in Moldova since the issuance of the
staff report for the 2006 Article IV consultation and request for a three-year
arrangement under the PRGF. The additional information does not change the thrust of the
staff appraisal.
2.
Recent economic data have been broadly in line with projections. Year-on-year
inflation accelerated to 10.9 percent in March, reflecting the pass-through of higher natural
gas import prices to domestic consumers (domestic natural gas rates increased by close to
40 percent in March). The NBM has kept the stance of monetary policy tight; at end-March,
reserve money was up by only 6.3 percent year-on-year, with the reduction coming through
stepped-up sterilization operations. Excess liquidity has continued to decline, and short-term
interest rates have moved up. The general government reported a surplus of 0.4 percent of
GDP in the first quarter, against a projected deficit of 0.6 percent of GDP.
3.
Preliminary data for the 2005 balance of payments show a larger deterioration
in the current account than was estimated in the staff report. According to these
preliminary data, the current account deficit was 101⁄2 percent of GDP, compared with
51⁄2 percent of GDP in the staff report. However, in previous years preliminary data have also
indicated a large current account deficit that was subsequently revised downward (by an
average of 3 percent of GDP in 2001-04), so historical experience suggest that a similar
revision is likely to occur when these data are finalized during the summer. In particular,
errors and omissions are large and positive at 6.6 percent of GDP, suggesting that some
inflows have yet to be classified.
4.
Although the final current account data for 2005 are likely to demonstrate a
more positive outcome, the deterioration underscores staff concerns about the risks to
Moldova’s balance of payments going forward. These risks have been exacerbated by a
recent ban by Russia on imports of Georgian and Moldovan wine and spirits, reportedly on
public health grounds. In the case of Moldova, wine and spirits comprise about 30 percent of
total exports, of which more than three-fourths traditionally go to Russia. The authorities
hope to resolve this dispute in the near future, and in the meantime are keeping a close eye on
financial sector stability, as about 15 percent of outstanding bank credit is related to the wine
sector.
5.
Official creditors have provided financing assurances. It is expected that the Paris
Club will take up Moldova’s request for debt rescheduling after the IMF Board meeting.
6.
All prior actions have been implemented. All end-March quantitative targets were
met by comfortable margins, except for the floor on reserves, which was met with a small
margin. Government accounts were transferred from commercial banks to the NBM as
planned, and cash accounts of the State Tax Inspectorate and the regional revenue accounts
of the Social Fund in the commercial banks were closed. The AML law was amended to
revoke the changes passed late in 2005. Revisions to the NBM law were submitted to
Parliament, and the government announced a tender for an independent evaluation of BEM in
the April 29, 2006, issue of The Economist.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Moldova
On May 5, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Moldova.1
Background
Economic growth has continued to be robust, although the drivers of growth—household
consumption and construction—remain heavily dependent on inflows of remittances (now
equal to some 30 percent of GDP), as well as strong wage growth. Real GDP growth in
2005 was over 7 percent, as it has been since early in the decade. Inflation has gradually
abated. After peaking at over 14 percent in April 2005, it fell to 10 percent (year-on-year) in
December, despite a sharp pickup in energy prices in mid-2005.
Fiscal policy has remained tight. The general government posted a cash surplus of about
1.7 percent of GDP in 2005, about twice the level of 2004, and considerably tighter than the
deficit predicted in the revised 2005 budget (½ percent of GDP). The main factors driving
this fiscal performance were better-than-expected Value Added Tax revenues, delays in
implementing foreign-financed project investments, disbursement of a grant from the
European Union on December 29 for which expenditures had been included in the 2006
budget, and some spending restraint on the part of the government.
Monetary policy was tightened in 2005, despite continued strong inflows of remittances.
Sterilization efforts were stepped up in the second and third quarters before easing in the
fourth quarter, as the balance of payments weakened in light of higher energy prices and
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

-2the National Bank of Moldova (NBM) moderated its foreign exchange purchases. The
NBM’s balance on sterilization operations rose from an average of 1.1 percent of GDP in
2004 to an average of 2.9 in 2005, reaching 3.5 percent of GDP at end-February 2006. As a
result, reserve money growth slowed during the year, falling to 16½ percent at endSeptember, before rising seasonally in December. At the same time, broad money growth
remained strong (at 35 percent for the year as a whole). Lending and deposit rates have
remained high, despite plentiful liquidity on the
T-bill and interbank markets. Financial sector soundness indicators have remained
generally strong, reflecting partly strong economic performance of the recent years.
Moldova appears to follow an asymmetric, managed floating exchange rate regime. Since
early 2004, it would appear that downward pressure is accommodated while upward
pressure is absorbed by the NBM through purchases of foreign exchange. The leu
appreciated in real effective terms in 2004, but with a weaker balance of payments and
lower inflation than in key trading partners, this tendency leveled off in 2005. Reserves have
grown as well, doubling in dollar terms since end-2003, though as a share of imports they
remain modest at about 2.2 months.
The trade balance deteriorated significantly in 2005, owing in large part to the impact of
higher energy prices. Energy (particularly fuel oil) imports rose in value terms by about 50
percent in 2005 (to about 5 percent of GDP), while export growth slowed modestly. The
structural reform agenda has been reinvigorated by Moldova’s aspirations for closer
integration with Europe. The European Union–Moldova Action Plan, signed in February
2005, provides, along with the authorities’ EGPRSP, a road map for advancing a broad
reform agenda, including in areas public administration, public expenditure management,
and management of state enterprises.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the strong economic growth and significant poverty reduction
in recent years, the moderation of inflation, and the strengthened fiscal position, and
commended Moldova’s authorities for their commitment to structural reforms and balanced
macroeconomic policies. At the same time, they noted that growth has been fueled mainly
by domestic spending, which was financed by workers’ remittances. Directors agreed that
maintaining macroeconomic stability in light of robust inflows of remittances while
diversifying the economy and bringing poverty further down remain the key challenges
going forward. They also stressed the importance of improving the business environment to
support greater private sector investment and thus to help reverse the large migration of
labor and strengthen the external position.
Directors commended the authorities for their disciplined macroeconomic policies and
considered that the short-term fiscal stance constituted an appropriate balance between the
objective of supporting disinflation and meeting the need for larger public investment and
social spending. Looking ahead, most Directors encouraged the authorities to repeat the
fiscal overperformance of recent years, though some Directors favored devoting revenue in
excess of budgeted amounts to poverty reduction and infrastructure spending if the
macroeconomic environment permits it.

-3Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to modernize public sector management to
improve the efficiency of government operations. They observed given the large size of the
government, that the public administration reform currently underway should lead to a
leaner, more focused, and transparent government structure. While Directors welcomed the
decision to fully pass through energy price changes, they expressed concern about the
large increases in public sector wages in 2006 and urged the authorities to ensure that the
wage profile remains consistent with priorities identified in the medium-term expenditure
framework.
Directors welcomed the decline in inflation during 2005. Nevertheless, they noted that
inflationary pressures remain, particularly in light of the increasing energy prices and the
tightening labor market, and urged the authorities to be prepared to tighten monetary policy.
Directors also encouraged the authorities to permit greater exchange rate flexibility to
minimize risks to the disinflation path and facilitate the economy’s resilience to balance-ofpayments shocks. In this context, they welcomed the authorities’ decision to amend the
National Bank law to establish price stability as its key objective and stressed that this
legislative change needs to be matched by steps in monetary policy implementation.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ renewed push for structural reforms and underscored
their importance to sustain the economic revival and maintain external competitiveness.
They stressed the importance to improve the environment for private initiative and
investment also by reducing licensing and registration requirements and other
administrative barriers and strengthen the legal and institutional framework and
governance. They encouraged the authorities to accelerate implementation of the structural
policies envisaged in their EGPRSP to encourage investment, reverse the current
emigration trend, and use the strategy to make progress in achieving the Millennium
Development Goals. Directors also noted that the EU-Moldova Action Plan—which is
consistent with the EGPRSP—will serve as a useful roadmap for the ambitious reform
agenda.
Directors noted that financial sector stability indicators were largely positive, but urged the
authorities to address remaining vulnerabilities. They emphasized the crucial importance of
financial sector development to underpin economic and employment growth. Directors
considered that Moldova’s financial sector, and the economy more broadly, would benefit
from a presence of reputable international banking institutions. In this context, they
welcomed the authorities’ intention to privatize Banca de Economii. Directors also
commended the authorities for strengthening the Anti-Money Laundering/Combating
Financing of Terrorism framework and their objective of bringing it in line with best practices
over the medium term.
Directors welcomed the sustained improvement in Moldova’s external debt position and
expressed hope that Moldova will be able to normalize its relations with Paris Club creditors
and restructure its stock of arrears in the near future, underscoring that this would facilitate
access to fresh donor financial support.

-4Directors were encouraged by Moldova’s subscription to the Fund’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard as an important step to further improve transparency, timeliness,
and comprehensiveness of economic and financial data.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 5, 2006

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF approves US$118.2 Million Arrangement Under the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility with Moldova
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a new three-year
arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) for an amount equivalent
to SDR 80.08 million (about US$118.2 million) for Moldova. The approval of the arrangement
enables Moldova to draw the equivalent of SDR 11.44 million (about US$16.9 million)
immediately.
Following the Executive Board discussion, Mr. Takatoshi Kato, Deputy Managing Director
and Acting Chair, said:
“Moldova’s macroeconomic performance in the past year has been encouraging. Growth
remained robust and inflation was brought down to near single-digit levels. The fiscal position
remained strong and the external debt position improved. Emerging risks to the balance of
payments outlook—stemming primarily from energy import price increases—have been
contained thus far. The outlook for growth remains encouraging, but this requires continued
polices to safeguard macroeconomic stability and make progress in improving the investment
climate and modernizing its economic infrastructure.
“The authorities’ Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper and the Moldova-EU
Action plan provide a solid basis for the medium-term policy framework that will support
conditions for durable, private sector-led, and pro-poor growth.
“The macroeconomic framework which underpins the authorities’ program is appropriately
ambitious, aiming for further gradual disinflation in the coming years. To achieve this objective,
monetary policy will need to accommodate greater exchange rate flexibility to minimize risks to
the disinflation path and to provide a buffer against external shocks. The authorities’ decision to
amend the National Bank law to establish price stability as its key objective is a welcome step
and will support a forward-looking monetary policy implementation. The fiscal program strikes
the appropriate balance between the objective of supporting disinflation and meeting the
country’s extensive developmental needs. Moreover, it will be important to maintain a
disciplined path of public sector wage increases in line with the medium-term expenditure
framework.

-2-

“The program envisages ambitious structural reforms. Public sector management will be
strengthened through improved corporate governance of state enterprises, privatization and
public administration reform, while the business environment will be enhanced through the
modernization of bankruptcy procedures, the streamlining of regulations, and the removal of
restrictions on grain exports. The financial sector will be strengthened by improvements in
transparency, a reduction in government interference, and the promotion of greater competition,
including through the support of market access for reputable foreign banks. Strict
implementation of the measures should facilitate renewed inflows of external assistance to the
Republic of Moldova, and thus contribute to stronger economic growth and poverty reduction, ”
Mr. Kato said.
ANNEX
Recent Economic Developments
Higher energy prices complicated the macroeconomic picture in 2005. Although overall GDP
growth remained strong at 7 percent, its composition shifted further away from the traded sector,
which was particularly affected by the rise in petroleum prices. Despite the higher energy prices
inflation performance improved, falling to 10 percent (year-on-year) in December 2005.
Fiscal and monetary policy were tightened. Substantial over performance on the value added tax
translated into a stronger fiscal policy stance (a surplus of 1.7 percent of GDP).
Since mid-2004, downward pressure on the currency has been accommodated but upward
pressure was absorbed by the national Bank of Moldova through purchases of foreign exchange.
International reserves have grown as well, though as a share of imports they remain modest.
The current account deficit deteriorated significantly in 2005, owing in large part to the impact of
higher energy prices. Energy (particularly fuel oil) imports rose in value terms by about
50 percent in 2005 (about 3.5 percent of GDP), while export growth slowed modestly.
The external debt outlook continued to improve, although arrears were accumulated to Paris
Club creditors. External debt fell as share of GDP from over 100 percent in 2001 to about
55 percent by 2005, owing largely to strong growth and real exchange rate appreciation, as well
prudent debt management and several favorable restructuring arrangements.
Program Summary
The program is designed to address the following main objectives: support growth and poverty
reduction by maintaining macroeconomic stability, particularly in the face of strong inflows of
remittances and sharply higher prices for imported energy; improve the performance of the
financial sector, including by building on the lessons of last year’s financial sector Assessment
Program; and clarify the role of the government in the economy, thus advancing the transition
process.

-3-

The program is consistent with the European Union-Moldova Action Plan, signed in February
2005 and the authorities’ Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, which
provide for advancing a broad agenda of measures designed to improve Moldova’s long-run
growth prospects.
Growth is expected to slow somewhat in 2006 and over the medium term, partly in response to
higher oil process, as well as emerging labor shortages. Under the program, real GDP growth is
projected to fall to 6 percent in 2006, and to 5 percent over the medium term. Achieving this
outcome will depend on a continued recovery in investment, particularly of the private sector.
The program envisages an inflation objective of 9 percent (year-on-year) in 2006, falling to
7 percent by 2008, despite continued high and rising inflows of remittances (up to $1.3 billion a
year by 2008) and foreign aid that may complicate achievement of this goal.
The underlying budget deficit (after grants) should be no more than 0.5 percent of GDP for the
medium term. The 2006 budget foresees a slightly larger deficit (0.8 percent of GDP), owing to
an advanced disbursement of an EU grant of about 0.3 percent of GDP in the last days of 2005,
for which the corresponding spending was already included in the 2006 budget.With general
government debt falling to about one third of GDP in 2006 (from over 80 percent in 2001), a
slightly higher deficit would not jeopardize medium-term fiscal sustainability.

Statement by Jeroen Kremers, Executive Director for Republic of Moldova
and Vladimir Munteanu, Advisor to Executive Director
May 5, 2006
On behalf of the Moldovan authorities, I would like to express appreciation to
Management and staff for their continued support to Moldova in surmounting transition
challenges. The authorities agree with the thrust of the staff appraisal, and believe that it
adequately describes the economic developments in Moldova as well as the challenges facing
the country.
Recent economic developments
Moldova’s strong economic performance over the last four years has marked the
progression from a decade of economic decline and rising poverty to a stage of robust growth
and improving living standards. Real GDP increased by more than 30 percent during 200104, and the absolute poverty rate fell from about 70 percent in 1999 to 27 percent in 2004.
Sound fiscal and monetary policies have helped to subdue inflation, maintain stability of the
leu, and achieve budget surpluses, while robust growth in combination with prudent debt
management have contributed to substantial improvement in Moldova’s external debt
indicators. Furthermore, Moldova’s European aspirations have provided much-needed
momentum to the authorities’ structural reform efforts and commitment to combat
corruption. These efforts were underpinned by signing in February 2005 the EU-Moldova
Action Plan, and evidenced by improvement in Moldova’s Corruption Perception Index
(CPI) from 2.3 to 2.91. At the same time, higher energy prices2 and deterioration in trade
terms contributed to a worsening in the external current account.
Notwithstanding encouraging economic performance since 2001, the GDP per capita
remains low, and living standards are by far inferior to those in the European Union. This has
triggered massive labor migration3, and created additional social and macroeconomic
problems.
Going forward, Moldova’s challenge is to build on recent favorable developments
and to set the stage for sustained growth in the medium term. While the near-term outlook
remains fairly positive with the real GDP growth projected at 5-6 percent, and inflation
expected to decline further, the authorities are not satisfied with the quality of growth and
concur with staff that the current growth model is reaching its limit. Labor shortages in some
sectors and delayed investments hindering development in others in the context of emerging,
but still low institutional capacity, a weak financial intermediation and business environment
are the main challenges facing the country. The government’s priority is to address these
challenges, which are rightly emphasized in the staff papers. To this extent, the authorities
1

In 2005 Moldova ranked 95 on Transparency International CPI, compared to 117 in 2004.

2

Moldova relies fully on imported energy recourses which account for about 16 percent of GDP.

3

According to the 2004 census, about 371,000 Moldovan citizens (19 percent of the labor force) now make
their living abroad. The actual number of migrant workers is believed to be much higher.

-2have embarked on an ambitious reform agenda that is in line with the EU-Moldova Action
Plan and with the Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (EGPRSP).
Relations with the Fund
In the absence of a Fund supported program since mid-2004 the authorities have
increasingly relied on Fund advice for their economic policies, and maintained
macroeconomic indicators consistent with the IMF parameters. The authorities attach great
value to a close relationship with the Fund and believe that their efforts aimed at creating
conditions for a sustainable growth, as well as implementation of the EU-Moldova Action
Plan, EGPRSP and achieving the Millennium Development Goals would be successful if
complemented by an IMF supported PRGF Arrangement.
By implementing all prior actions, the authorities have reconfirmed their commitment
to sound economic and financial policies. Moreover, this was the first time that the
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) has been entirely prepared by the
authorities, indicating their ownership of the program. Also, the President affirmed his strong
support for the program by signing a letter to that effect. Against this background, they
request support for a three-year PRGF program. In the spirit of transparency the authorities
consented to publication of the staff report and all program documents in their Letter of
Intent of April 14, 2006.
The new economic program represents a new stage in Moldova’s transition to a
market economy, its relations with the International Financial Institutions including the IMF,
and its further integration in the global economy. In this vein, the government’s
macroeconomic program aims at deepening the reform agenda and maintaining inflation in
the single digit range. The budget deficit will not exceed 1/2 percent of GDP, except slightly
in 2006 when the deviation is explained by disbursement of an external grant on December
29, 2005, for which the corresponding spending was already included in the 2006 budget.
The current account deficit is projected to be around 5 percent of GDP. However, the
preliminary data for the 2005 balance of payments show a larger deterioration in the current
account than was estimated in the staff report. The National Bank of Moldova (NBM) will
maintain a tight monetary policy stance and aim to gradually increase foreign exchange
reserves to at least three months of imports over the program period. Also, the government is
committed to normalize financial relations with Paris Club creditors by seeking a possible
debt restructuring.
Fiscal policy
Moldova has a good track record of fiscal consolidation by realizing budget surpluses
during three consecutive years. These achievements were possible thanks also to improved
tax administration that resulted in revenue increase by more than 6 percentage points of GDP
from 2001 to 2005.
In 2005 fiscal policy remained tight, and the surplus of the general government grew
to about 11⁄2 percent of GDP, in part reflecting the accumulation of resources to reduce
arrears to Paris Club creditors. The budgetary process has been improved with the
implementation of the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). In order to broaden

-3the tax base, VAT exemptions have been eliminated on agriculture, import of pesticides and
fertilizers, equipment, technology and spare parts. The VAT rate on medicine has been
increased from zero to 8 percent.
The authorities note staff’s attention for a somewhat higher fiscal target (deficit of 0.8
percent of GDP) for 2006, but believe that this will not jeopardize fiscal sustainability, given
that the 2005 large surplus was in part due to one-off factors. As in the past, the authorities
intend to maintain tight fiscal policy and attain a primary surplus in order to further underpin
external debt sustainability. If extra funds become available as a result of higher revenues or
due to external debt restructuring, the authorities prefer to use them for poverty reduction
and badly needed investment projects. However, the authorities understand that the budget
has a role to play in disinflation, and will stand ready to tighten the stance of fiscal policy if
needed, to ensure that the inflation objective is achieved. At the same time, the possibility of
external shocks could make it appropriate to review the deficit target, in consultation with
the IMF staff.
Looking ahead, the authorities are committed to further improve the efficiency of the
tax administration system. With technical assistance from the Fund, a comprehensive tax
administration reform strategy is under preparation as stipulated in the EU-Moldova Action
Plan. Together with other measures this will create adequate conditions for the long-due
replacement of the Council of Creditors with a new system relying on the state tax
inspectorate and bankruptcy courts.
On the expenditure front, the authorities concur with staff that expenditure restraint is
key to ensuring sustainable public finances and a competitive business environment over the
medium term. An important objective of the medium-term expenditure framework is to
identify resources for increased public investment. This objective will be accomplished
through rationalization of budget expenditures, and by ensuring greater access to
concessional external funding. At the same time, social expenditures are not expected to
diminish throughout the program. While remaining committed to promote pass-through of
higher prices for imported energy products to the final consumers, the authorities seek
support from the IMF and the World Bank to assess the social impact from rising energy
prices, as well as to develop efficient compensation mechanisms for the poor.
The authorities are concerned about the deterioration of the state social insurance fund
finances in 2005, and remain committed to continue with the implementation of individual
record keeping of state social insurance contributions. As a first step, in January 2006 the
government began the implementation of the reform of agricultural pensions, and included
judges and prosecutors in the state social insurance system.
External debt strategy
In the absence of external financing for budget support and given negative net cash
flows during 2001-2005, external debt service became a serious burden for the budget,
reaching no less than 40 percent of the total state budget revenues. Although external arrears
have been cleared to commercial and some bilateral official creditors, the Government has
not been in a position to make principal payments or clear arrears to Paris Club creditors. The
government is committed to normalize financial relations with Paris Club creditors by

-4seeking a possible debt restructuring. To this effect, funds have been accumulated in an
escrow account since 2005 for the payment of a portion of arrears. Also, the authorities are
preparing a new law that will introduce conditions for a more comprehensive debt
management according to international standards.
While Moldova’s debt indicators are projected to improve further, the country’s
external vulnerability continues to grow. Largely owing to the impact of higher energy
prices, and uncertainties related to trade with the traditional partners, the trade balance
deteriorated sharply as preliminary data for 2005 indicate. Diversification of Moldova’s
export markets remains limited, reflecting continued dependence on traditional CIS markets,
which absorbed about half of Moldova’s total exports. Given the impact on Moldova’s
Balance of Payments of the recent ban on imports of Moldovan wine to Russia, the
authorities may request a downward revision of the program’s target on NFA.
Monetary policy
The main challenge facing the NBM has been containing inflationary pressures,
fueled by strong remittances4 and increasing energy prices, while operating in rather thin
financial markets. The NBM has tightened monetary policy in 2005, stepping up sterilization
efforts. Reserve money growth slowed from 48 percent (year-on-year) at end-January to near
20 percent in the fourth quarter.
Under the Fund program, the NBM will orient monetary policy toward maintaining
price stability in the single-digit range, by using all available instruments and allowing for
greater exchange rate flexibility. The NBM has submitted to parliament amendments to the
central bank law aimed to clarify that the Bank’s primary objective is price stability. In
support of this objective, the government has moved the deposits of the state budget from the
commercial banks to the NBM, and has requested the Fund’s assistance in exploring the
option of securitizing the pre-2004 stock of Government debt to the NBM.
Safeguarding the NBM’s independence and strengthening its financial soundness
remain key. In this vein, and in line with Fund recommendations, the revised law will
prohibit direct credit to the government and will strengthen the independence of the NBM
board members. At the next opportunity, the authorities also intend to propose an
amendment to the Constitution to include an explicit reference to the independence of the
National Bank of Moldova, and to clarify its role in the conduct of monetary policy.
The financial sector remains generally sound, with strong capital adequacy and
liquidity ratios, and robust profitability. In order to further ensure financial sector stability,
and to enhance the sector’s sustainable development, in line with the 2004 FSAP, parliament
has adopted amendments to the Law on the National Bank of Moldova and the Law on
Financial Institutions aimed at bringing them more in line with European Union standards
and best international practices. These changes provide for an adequate framework to ensure
greater transparency in bank ownership and should enhance the NBM’s ability to guard
against risky practices, in particular related party lending.

Remittances from Moldovans working abroad are estimated at about 30 percent of GDP.

-5While financial sector stability indicators are healthy, the authorities concur with staff
that there could be more competition to further stimulate and financial intermediation. Staff
is correctly pointing out that arrival of foreign banks in Moldova would be beneficial, as this
will bring new technology, fresh capital and stimulate competition. An important step in this
direction is the authorities’ decision to develop an exit strategy from banks with state-owned
capital, including Banca de Economii.
Also, the authorities are taking steps to further enhance the effectiveness of the
AML/CFT regime, among other measures by preparing a thorough reform of the AML
framework in line with the MONEYVAL recommendations.
Structural reforms
The authorities recognize that the program’s macroeconomic and development
objectives require implementation of an ambitious reform agenda including clarification of
the role of the state in the economy. In this context, the key pillars of the structural reform
program are public administration reform, regulatory reform, improvements in public finance
management, and enhancing management and divestiture of public assets.
An important effort in the context of structural reforms is the implementation of the
central public administration reform, which aims at establishing an efficient central public
administration that functions according to the principles of good governance applied by
European Union member-states. An integral part of the public administration reform is the
regulatory reform, which focuses on improving the business environment by eliminating
impediments to business activity. The next step in this regard will be abolishing laws that led
to the appearance of unnecessary regulations and introduction of a regulatory impact
assessment system to prevent reappearance of these regulations.
In order to bring management of the state-owned enterprises in line with the best
international practices, the authorities have developed a plan to introduce corporate
governance principles in state-owned enterprise (SOE). To this end, they carried out a full
inventory and evaluation of the performance of the state assets, and on this basis developed a
concept paper on management and divestiture of public property.
Last but not least, the authorities attach great importance to combating corruption. A
major aspect of this effort is modernization of the legal framework for civil service that will
promote legislation aimed at preventing conflict-of-interests and ensuring that civil service is
managed on apolitical grounds. Furthermore, on April 25 the Constitutional Court approved a
draft law on modification of the Constitution, in order to require public functionaries to prove
the legality of their assets.
