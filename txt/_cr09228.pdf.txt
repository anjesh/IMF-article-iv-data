Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Focus: Economic and financial stabilization; developing exit strategies to eventually unwind
extraordinary policy support; and dealing with the long-term legacies of the crisis (weak financial
supervision and regulation, massive fiscal imbalances, and damaged household balance sheets).

•

Assessment: Considerable progress has been made toward stabilizing the financial system, though
significant strains remain. The sharp contraction in economic activity is ending, aided by substantial
macroeconomic stimulus. However, the recovery is likely to be gradual, and downside risks prevail.

•

Policy advice:
o Stabilization: the priority is fully healing the financial system. Vigilance is warranted in light
of remaining downside risks. Macroeconomic policies can respond further if risks
materialize.
o

Exiting extraordinary support: key elements include developing strategies to withdraw public
support from the financial system, and to shrink the Fed’s balance sheet, to position it to pull
back on monetary stimulus when a sustainable recovery is underway. Smooth communication
will be key to set market expectations.

o

Long-term legacies: broad and thorough reforms to financial regulation are needed to deal
with the shortcomings exposed by the crisis. Substantial fiscal adjustment will be needed to
stabilize public debt, along with measures to contain health care costs. Household balancesheet adjustment will likely weigh on growth over the medium term while narrowing the
external imbalance, with global implications.

•

Authorities’ views: The authorities broadly agreed on the challenges, although staff’s fiscal outlook
implied a more significant needed fiscal adjustment. That said, fiscal stabilization is a major focus for
policies, and exit strategies increasingly so. Reforms to financial regulation are another priority.

•

Analytical work: Background studies cover fiscal risks, spillovers to interest rates in emerging
markets, crisis effects on potential growth, and reform of financial regulation and supervision.

Staff: The team comprised David Robinson (head), Charles Kramer, Marcello Estevão, Oya Celasun,
Andrea Maechler, Koshy Mathai, and Lev Ratnovski (WHD), John Kiff and Paul Mills (MCM), and
Ashok Vir Bhatia (SPR). Erica Tsounta (WHD), Miguel Segoviano and Christian Capuano (MCM)
provided supporting analysis. Brad McDonald (SPR) contributed analysis of trade policy.

I. BACKDROP: THE GREAT IMMODERATION
1.
At the root of the crisis, investors, intermediaries, and regulators failed to grasp
both the weaknesses in the securitization model and the attendant risks posed by
dramatic growth in increasingly complex securitization. Between 2002 and 2006, assetbacked securities (ABS) issuance more than doubled to $840 billion—roughly the size of
bank credit flows—financed by domestic and foreign investors. While greatly facilitating the
expansion of credit, securitization activity also reduced transparency about the distribution of
risks, increased reliance on ratings (which bred complacency about risks in high-rated
securities), and moved risk outside the core banking system (Box 1). In addition, skewed
incentives eroded underwriting standards on underlying loans, although this did not become
apparent until later.
2. Falling volatility led market participants and regulators to underestimate risks,
particularly in the housing market (Figure 1). Low volatility also reinforced a prevailing
view that financial innovation was beneficial in spreading risk to peripheral (and presumably,
non-systemic) institutions. Relatedly, prudential supervision and regulation focused heavily
on the core banking system, although its share of financial intermediation shrank as
securitization burgeoned. Meanwhile, continuously rising house prices became the new
norm, and rising home ownership was attributed to improved access to credit. In tandem, the
share of the overall financial sector in corporate profits reached a historical high of about
twice its long-run average, apparently validating the view that financial innovation enhanced
efficiency (Figure 2).
3. At a macro level, a seemingly virtuous circle developed—especially in the real
estate market (Figure 3). Home mortgage lending rose over 50 percent during 2002−05; the
share of Alt-A and subprime loans surged to a third of new mortgage originations in 2005
compared with less than 10 percent at the start of the decade. The government-sponsored
mortgage enterprises (GSEs) rapidly expanded both their securitization of prime mortgages
and their purchases of nonprime mortgage-backed debt. As the credit-fueled housing bubble
inflated, rising real estate prices fed consumption out of housing wealth; saving out of
disposable income fell and briefly turned negative during 2005.
4. But over 2006 and 2007, cracks began to appear in both financial markets and the
broad economy. Real estate prices and residential investment peaked, and as the housing
downturn gathered pace, default rates on subprime mortgages rose and then surged. The
deteriorating real estate market put increasing stress on intermediaries: in August 2007,
measures of banking system stress—the Libor-OIS and TED spreads—jumped to as high as
100−200 basis points, 5 to 10 times pre-crisis levels, while spreads on credit default swaps
for major banks began a steady upward trend. Against the background of growing financial
strains that increasingly affected real activity, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate by
100 bps over the second half of 2007, but the macro-financial feedback loop nevertheless
intensified; and by end-year, the economy was in recession.

Box 1. The Life and Death (and Rebirth?) of Securitization
Securitization made the U.S. financial system brittle. First, by creating a direct link between U.S. retail
borrowers and investors (including those abroad), it increased the supply of mortgage finance, and fuelled the
housing boom. Second, by creating a long production line—from lender to bundler to servicer to investor—it
gave rise to severe principal/agent problems and
information asymmetries, allowing credit standards

share of their total income from a narrow set of
issuers that dominated the bundling business, used often flawed methodologies and data inputs (themselves
difficult for investors to evaluate, given the limited transparency). As a result, investors severely
underestimated risks; and no one anticipated the scope and depth of subsequent downgrades. Also, in the face
of soaring delinquencies on the underlying loans, servicers lacked the resources and incentives to carry out the
most appropriate loss mitigation strategies (see Kiff and Klyuev, IMF Staff Position Note 2009/02).
Several initiatives are underway to address these problems (see also the discussion of past steps in IMF
Country Report 08/255, including pp 31–32):
•

•

•

Aligning incentives: The Treasury’s June 17 Regulatory Reform paper proposes that originators retain
five percent of the credit risk of securitized exposures, and the House Mortgage Reform and AntiPredatory Lending Act would make bundlers legally liable for poor underwriting. The Treasury paper
also proposes to link securitizers’ compensation to the longer-term performance of the securitized assets.
Disclosure: The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may propose revisions to rules and forms to
improve offering and disclosure requirements for asset-backed securities. The American Securitization
Forum is leading industry efforts to improve disclosure practices.
Rating agencies: The Treasury paper also calls for rating agencies to differentiate ratings on ABS from
those on other debt and for improved disclosure, including ratings performance metrics. In December
2004, the International Organization of Securities Commissions issued a credit rating agency code of
conduct, calling for firewalls between sales and analytic functions, and the SEC made more specific
regulations in 2008. Also in 2008, rating agencies agreed with the New York Attorney General to
implement a fee-for-service revenue model for MBS ratings—with originators required to pay the
agencies whether or not they were ultimately selected to rate the security (to reduce “ratings shopping”).

These may be useful steps, but more can be done. The Regulatory Reform proposes improved transparency,
as well as risk-retention requirements that will help strengthen incentives for sound underwriting, although
care must be taken to manage attendant risks in the core banking system. Encouraging simpler, more
standardized, better capitalized structures through market codes of conduct or regulatory action could facilitate
investor due diligence, and reduce the risk of mistakes in the ratings process. In addition, a broader legal “safe
harbor” for servicers to modify underlying loans would protect them from lawsuits, better enabling them to
pursue loss-mitigation efforts aimed at maximizing the value of the pool.

5. From late 2007 into 2008, the virtuous cycle turned vicious. Off-balance-sheet
vehicles meant to keep risks at arms’ length deteriorated sharply, and banks supported the
vehicles to stem reputational risks—putting their own balance sheets at risk. A major
investment bank (Bear Stearns) failed owing to mortgage exposure, and its purchase was
facilitated by the Fed. CDS spreads spiked briefly. Worsening labor market conditions and a
continued housing-market rout weighed on consumer spending (Figure 4). The authorities
responded with fiscal stimulus of over 1 percent of GDP (tax rebates that took effect in late
April), and monetary policy rate cuts to 2 percent, while providing ample liquidity. Housing
initiatives included expanded Federal Housing Administration (FHA) guarantees aimed at
limiting preventable foreclosures that were pressuring housing prices (and thus household
and financial institution balance sheets).
II. THE CRISIS BREAKS
6. In the second half of 2008, financial pressure escalated further, coming to a head
with the failure of Lehman Brothers in September. Despite sizeable liquidity injections,
market strains remained high, while housing market stress continued to impact financial
institutions (notably, the large thrift IndyMac failed). The two housing GSEs, Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac, were placed into conservatorship on September 6, with the government
committing substantial financial resources to both institutions. Over three days in midSeptember, the troubled investment bank Merrill Lynch was sold to Bank of America, and
AIG (a global insurance group with huge derivatives positions) received $85 billion in
emergency Fed financing secured by its assets. Most significantly, another investment bank,
Lehman Brothers, came under extreme stress. Given the absence of a framework for orderly
resolution of systemic nonbanks, with no private buyer forthcoming, and as the Fed assessed
Lehman’s collateral as insufficient to back emergency lending, Lehman—in contrast to Bear
Stearns—entered bankruptcy.
7. The failure of Lehman Brothers triggered the worst bout of financial instability
since the Great Depression. Concerns about exposures to counterparties, highlighted by the
collapse of Lehman, triggered massive turbulence in global interbank markets. LIBOR-OIS
and TED spreads shot up to 350 and 500 basis points respectively, as interbank transactions
in U.S. dollars and other major currencies (even on a secured basis) virtually disappeared
beyond overnight maturities. A money-market fund holding Lehman paper fell below $1 per
share, triggering a run on money-market funds. This in turn caused the CP market (in which
such funds invested) to dry up; outstanding financial-institution CP fell by more than a third
while spreads doubled. Issuance of asset-backed securities, already declining, plummeted. In
late September, the largest U.S. thrift failed, and another large U.S. bank was acquired. The
drying-up of liquidity fed systemic concerns; financial institution CDS spreads shot up to
over 400 basis points (Figure 5). In tandem, equity markets collapsed as financial stocks sold
off abruptly, and equity volatility spiked.

8. The financial shock in the United States echoed around the world. Globally, the
“flight-to-quality” dynamic already underway intensified, as international investors sold
private U.S. debt and rotated heavily into Treasury debt, and U.S. investors repatriated
overseas holdings. Yields on l0-year Treasuries plunged and yields on short-term bills
dropped to virtually zero, while the dollar strengthened. Meanwhile, banks tightened
corporate loan standards at record rates to preserve their rapidly deteriorating balance sheets.
Corporate bond spreads shot up while stocks plummeted to multi-year lows, amid intense
risk aversion and concerns about solvency of major borrowers (Figure 6). With mounting
stress at their financing arms and plummeting car sales exacerbating longstanding structural
problems, U.S. automakers sought official financial help (Box 2).
9. The wave of financial instability then crashed over the broader real economy
(Figure 7). In the United States, the unemployment rate surged, with monthly job losses
cresting at 741,000 in January. Consumer confidence plunged to record lows and spending
on durable goods contracted by over 20 percent in the fourth quarter (q/q, SAAR).
Nonresidential and residential investment shrank sharply, as overall GDP declined by
6¼ percent in the fourth quarter. Falling house prices created numerous “underwater”
mortgages—i.e. owing more than the house is worth (estimates vary from about 8 million to
20 million households)—accompanied by a sharp rise in foreclosures. Output and trade also
declined sharply, both for the United States and the rest of the world, with particularly
pronounced effects on manufacturing exporters (Box 3).
10. In response, U.S. macroeconomic policy shifted to a war footing:
•

Support for financial stability: in October 2008, $700 billion was appropriated for a
Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), ultimately used to provide capital injections
to stressed financial institutions and support market facilities. The authorities also
guaranteed selected balance sheet assets of Citibank (November) and Bank of
America (January). The Treasury guaranteed money market mutual funds, while the
FDIC and NCUA expanded deposit insurance coverage from $100,000 to $250,000
per depositor per bank, provided a temporary guarantee of non-interest-bearing
transaction accounts over $250,000, and guaranteed new bank debt for a fee. In
February 2009, the Treasury announced a Financial Stability Plan including stress
tests, further capital injections, and asset purchases; implementation has progressed
subsequently.

•

Unconventional monetary easing: in October 2008, the Fed participated in a
coordinated rate cut with 5 other major central banks. In December, the Fed lowered
its target rate to a range of 0–25 basis points, an all-time low, communicating in
January 2009 that conditions were likely to warrant an exceptionally low rate for an
extended period (Figure 8). It also ramped up its series of “credit easing” facilities to
unfreeze segments of credit markets, particularly focused on securitized consumer
credit, commercial paper, and money markets. In March 2009, it announced stepped-

Box. 2. The Motor Vehicles Sector
Although the financial crisis proved to be the blow that forced two major U.S. auto manufacturers into
bankruptcy, the situation at the three major auto companies—General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler—had
been getting bleaker for some time. The U.S. auto manufacturers have been steadily losing market share
to imported brands over the past 15 years. They faced structural problems including high labor costs and
oversized dealer networks. Compounding their problems, sharp increases in oil and gasoline prices
further suppressed sales of domestic automobiles from an average of 13½ million units over 1995–2005
to 12½ million over 2006–07.
The onset of the financial crisis had dire implications for the auto industry. Worldwide, auto production
decreased 3.7 percent to 70½ million units, with the share of the three U.S. manufacturers decreasing
from 25 percent to 22 percent. In the United States, unit sales of domestic automobiles have collapsed to
6–8 million per month since October—the lowest levels since 1982—reflecting increased
unemployment, decreased household wealth, and a spike in interest rates on auto loans. In line with
weak sales, production of motor vehicles and parts dropped about 38 percent in May 2009 year-on-year
(by comparison, output in other U.S. manufacturing industries decreased about 14 percent during the
same period). International trade in autos and parts has also collapsed, with the value of total U.S. trade
(imports plus exports) down 45 percent since last August. Finally, since August, motor vehicle and parts
payrolls have decreased 25 percent and auto-retailer employment will be impacted, as both GM and
Chrysler pare their dealer networks substantially. The problems of the U.S. auto sector spilled over to
Mexico, where motor vehicle output has plummeted 45½ percent between August 2008 and March 2009
and employment in the transportation equipment sector dropped 17 percent.
These developments forced Chrysler and GM to appeal to the government for emergency financing in
late 2008 and ultimately to file for bankruptcy protection. Chrysler’s case, which was filed on April 30th,
was completed on June 10th, with the United Auto Workers’ retirees’ medical trust and Fiat S.p.A.
owning major shares in the reorganized Chrysler, and the U.S. and Canadian governments retaining
small stakes. The GM bankruptcy is still proceeding, but according to the firm’s reorganization plan, it is
expected to emerge from bankruptcy majorityMotor Vehicle Output and Trade

bankruptcy. The Canadian government and the
government of Ontario have provided $2.4 billion to support the Chrysler restructuring and have offered
$9.5 billion to support the GM bankruptcy. In Germany, Opel (formerly owned by GM) received a $2.1
billion bridge loan to facilitate a merger, and the government has guaranteed $4.2 billion in Opel’s loans.

Box 3. International Spillovers
The U.S. financial and economic turmoil has been transmitted rapidly to the rest of the world:
•
Falling U.S. imports have hit manufacturing and commodity exporters (see Figure on next page).
Weakening aggregate demand and tighter finance have collapsed trade flows, pressuring manufacturing
exporters such as Japan and triggering a plunge in commodity prices (the United States accounts for almost a
fourth of world oil demand). Over the longer term, softer consumer demand will weigh on consumer goods
exporters and their suppliers, particularly in Asia. At the same time, rising infrastructure spending could
benefit net capital goods exporters such as Germany.
•
U.S. financial strains had repercussions abroad. GFSR estimates of distress dependence matrices
between major U.S. banks and those in emerging markets suggest pockets of high vulnerability, with
correlations sometimes above 0.5. In addition, owing largely to their high exposures to the United States,
some European countries (e.g., Ireland) remain particularly vulnerable to the deteriorating credit quality of
U.S. banks. Also, U.S. banks pulled back from international markets in the fourth quarter (Table below), at
the same time that dollar appreciation has raised the cost of servicing foreign currency obligations.
•
U.S. remittances have fallen sharply. As the United States is the largest recipient of immigrants in
the world (around 40 million)—accounting for an eighth of its population—the current recession has
reduced remittances, and thus income, in many countries. This is particularly notable in Latin America and
the Caribbean, including in some economies already under severe stress and with high poverty rates. The
World Bank has projected that remittances to developing countries could fall by 5–8 percent in 2009.
•
Tourism dependent economies have been adversely affected as well. With over 40 million U.S.
tourists every year (and the second largest tourism expenditure in the world after Germany), economies
dependent on U.S. tourism have been particularly affected by the crisis and the depreciating dollar. The
Caribbean and Central America have been particularly affected, as almost a third of their tourism flows
originate from the United States.

sheet doubled in size to over $2 trillion, with the potential to exceed $4 trillion if
facilities reached their caps.
•

Housing market support: the Hope for Homeowners program initiated in October
2008 offered FHA guarantees for mortgages written down to more sustainable levels,
while the Making Home Affordable plan announced in February 2009 offered
subsidies to support sustainable mortgage modifications. In addition, the government
introduced a tax break for first-time home buyers, while the housing GSEs ramped up
support for mortgage markets (see Box 4).

•

Fiscal stimulus: in February 2009, the authorities launched a fiscal stimulus totaling
over 5 percent of one year’s GDP over 2009–2011, consistent with the strategy
agreed among the G-20, and comprising tax cuts, sizeable infrastructure spending,
and aid to states and the vulnerable (Box 5 and Figure 9).

11. Following two quarters of sharply declining activity, the combination of massive
macroeconomic stimulus and interventions in financial markets began to stabilize
financial and economic conditions. GDP fell by 6¼ percent in the fourth quarter of 2008
and 5¾ percent in the first quarter of 2009. More recent higher-frequency indicators suggest,
however, that the decline in economic activity is moderating and that the economy would
shrink less rapidly in the second quarter and post modest growth in the rest of 2009. In credit
markets, spreads have tightened substantially but remain above normal levels, while highgrade corporate issuance has rebounded (although private securitization remains moribund).
Meanwhile, equity markets have rallied on the back of a better outlook; indeed, the
improvement in financial conditions overall is surprisingly strong, in light of the modestly
improved—and still weak—near-term economic prospects.

Box 4. Housing-Price Dynamics and Policy Responses
The housing bubble burst in early 2007, following impressive price growth since the early
2000s. Early payment defaults started to mount, triggering foreclosures that depressed home
prices, impacting household real estate net wealth (down almost 40 percent by over
$4.5 trillion from the housing peak) and the ability to tap home equity, thus causing
consumption to decline (the propensity to consume out of housing wealth is between 4 and
7 cents per dollar). Together with collapsing residential investment, weak consumption
dragged down domestic demand, employment, and income. In turn, negative equity made it
difficult to refinance or sell a house, inflating delinquencies and foreclosures (now at their
highest levels since the Great Depression), with one fifth of all homes sold in the past 12
months in foreclosure and an estimated one in eight homes in short sale. This vicious circle
hindered labor mobility while further lowering house prices (houses near foreclosed properties
suffer an additional 1 to 9 percent price fall).
Several initiatives have been undertaken to tackle the housing market collapse, with
varying degrees of success. The Hope for Homeowners (H4H) program—activated in October
2008 (to expire in September 2011)—achieved limited success, blamed in part on its tight
guidelines for participation. The program aimed to refinance 400,000 underwater borrowers
into affordable government-backed loans but received only 1,000 applications, with only a
handful of refinancings undertaken. The February 2009 Making Home Affordable plan aimed
to make mortgage payments more affordable for up to nine million homeowners, and included
(i) measures to support low mortgage rates by strengthening confidence in Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac; (ii) a Home Affordable Refinance Program, which will provide new access to
refinancing for up to 5 million homeowners; and, (iii) a Home Affordable Modification
Program, which will reduce monthly payments on existing first lien mortgages for up to
4 million at-risk homeowners. and provide financial incentives for servicers and investors to
perform sustainable modifications. The Making Home Affordable Program also introduced
standardized, streamlined modifications, and provided incentive payments to encourage less
costly short sales or “deed in lieu” of
foreclosures.

While these programs have been important
steps, negative equity remains a concern.
With estimates of underwater households
ranging from 8½ million to over 20 million,
policies (such as subsidies) to directly address
the complicated negative equity issue should
be considered. Most mortgage analysts
acknowledge that negative equity combined
with rising unemployment are the primary
drivers of default risks (data point to a
positive and strong correlation between
foreclosures and number of underwater
homeowners).

Box 5. Fiscal Stimulus
President Obama and the Congress launched in February 2009 an economic stimulus package estimated
to cost $787 billion over the fiscal years 2009–19. The package includes $70 billion in alternative minimum
tax (AMT) relief that was widely expected to be enacted and was incorporated into staff’s pre-stimulus baseline.
Excluding the AMT patch, the stimulus is projected to total $652 billion in fiscal years 2009–11 (Table 1).
¾

Tax provisions make up 39 percent of the stimulus in the fiscal years 2009−11.1 More than
45 percent of the tax relief occurs through the Making Work Pay credit for working individuals. Other
tax provisions include refunds for low-income families and families with children, credits for education
and first-time home buyers, energy incentives, and business tax incentives. The FY2010 budget blueprint
proposed to make permanent a number of the tax relief provisions.

¾

Aid to states and education spending take up about 29 percent. The plan includes aid to states for
Medicaid and funds to shore up state budgets, mainly for education. It also includes funds for student
grants, special education, and education for the disabled.

¾

Social safety spending accounts for about 15 percent, and includes help for the unemployed and
struggling families, health insurance assistance for the unemployed, and nutritional assistance.

¾

The remaining 17 percent comprises investment. Of this, about 1/3 is spending on transport,
housing, and urban development. Other items include health information technology, health research,
investments in energy and water, upgrading government buildings, and homeland security and defense.

By mid-June 2009, $147 billion of stimulus funds were made available, and almost $50 billion had been
paid out. The largest recipients were the Department of Education (mostly for education-related state aid), the
Department of Health and Human Services (mainly for state Medicaid support), and the Department of Labor
(mostly for unemployment compensation), and the Social Security Administration (mostly for economic
recovery payments to Social Security and Supplemental Security Income beneficiaries).
Staff projects the stimulus plan to boost the level of real GDP by 1.1 percent in 2009, 1.3 percent in 2010,
and 0.7 percent in 2011, relative to a no-stimulus scenario. Real GDP in the following three years would receive
a boost of less than 0.3 percent.

The plan is expected to raise revenues from 2012 onwards, so the percentage of tax provisions in the overall
package excluding the AMT patch is closer to 30 percent in fiscal years 2009–19.

implications for the outlook of financial
conditions and stimulus in train, was that growth would turn sustainably positive only in the
second quarter of 2010, with the unemployment rate continuing to rise through mid-2010 and
peak at over 10 percent. Rising economic slack would weigh on core CPI inflation, leading it
to bottom out at ½ percent in the first half of 2010. Staff projections are more pessimistic
than consensus for 2010, consistent with analysis in the World Economic Outlook and prior
U.S. Article IV reports that housing and financial busts generate prolonged recessions.
13. The team saw the near-term outlook as highly uncertain, with risks to the
downside despite the significantly reduced tail risk of financial instability. On the upside,
the strong policy response could spark a more typical rapid recovery, with a virtuous circle of
rising confidence and strengthening financial conditions. On the downside, continued
household deleveraging may weigh on consumption, with credit tight and unemployment

rising. Real estate markets are another source of risk; house prices had fallen closer to
equilibrium, but the risk of overshooting remained as foreclosures ran apace. Further
residential house price declines would pressure household and financial institution balance
sheets, and the deterioration in commercial real estate may have further to run. Worsening
economic conditions more generally could erode confidence and financial conditions. For
example, corporate defaults could accelerate, impacting financial conditions and curbing
economic activity. Risks may also emanate from abroad, notably the risk of protectionism if
global growth falters. Deflation, a tail risk, could materialize if a large shock widened the
output gap and destabilized inflation expectations.
14. The authorities were in the process of revising their forecasts, but were—to
varying degrees—more optimistic than the team. The tail risk of systemic financial
collapse had been greatly diminished by the many steps taken to support financial stability.
In addition, some officials believed that the sizeable fiscal and monetary stimulus in place
could foster a more typical V-shaped recovery. They broadly agreed with the risks identified
by staff, and expressed particular concern about the pace of recovery in other countries, but
saw the housing market stabilizing. While deflation could not be ruled out, they saw it as less
of a risk than staff; inflation expectations remained well anchored, and high economic slack
had put less downward pressure on prices than expected.
15. Looking beyond the short term, the team saw the medium-term outlook as
characterized by weak potential output and rising household savings. Potential output
would be restrained by higher financing costs (Figure 10); moreover, international evidence
suggests that past financial crises have resulted in permanent losses of output (Selected
Issues Paper, Chapter I).1 In addition, personal saving would likely rise, as households
worked to rebuild wealth, the more so if credit constraints are more binding than in the past.
The authorities broadly agreed that the crisis would lead to higher saving over the medium
term, though the extent was highly uncertain. They were more skeptical about sustained
effects on potential growth, however, noting that the U.S. economy was highly flexible.
Indeed, they believed that in the medium run, higher domestic saving could both feed
stronger investment—supporting growth—and help contain pressure on long-term interest
rates.
16. The team assessed the U.S. dollar as moderately overvalued, although the
assessment was subject to unusually high uncertainty. The three standard Consultative
Group on Exchange Rates (CGER) methodologies put the dollar at somewhat above
equilibrium at end-June, on the basis of net external assets and fundamentals such as the

valuation relative to fundamentals.
They noted the important role of safe-haven flows in boosting the value of the dollar during
the crisis, and observed that the recent depreciation reflected the unwinding of such flows, as
well as the increasing use of the dollar for funding of financial trades on the back of a
favorable interest differential. Officials saw demand for U.S. assets as robust over the
medium term, in light of the authorities' commitment to sound macroeconomic policies, the
depth and liquidity of U.S. capital markets, and the size of the U.S. economy––the same
properties which support the dollar's role as reserve currency.
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS: STABILIZATION, UNWINDING, AND BALANCE-SHEET REPAIR
The overall strategy
17. Over the next several years, U.S. policymakers face three broad challenges:
•

Stabilization, to put a floor under the Great Recession and lay the basis for a
sustained recovery. Macroeconomic policies have played a supportive role, and can
respond further if tail risks materialize; but the priority is returning financial
institutions to full health via recapitalization and balance-sheet cleaning—a sine qua
non for sustained recovery.

•

A “Great Unwinding” of extraordinary support. Key elements include withdrawing
public support from the financial system, and developing a strategy to shrink the
Fed’s balance sheet, to position it to pull back on monetary stimulus when a sustained
recovery is underway.

•

Dealing with the longer-term legacies of the crisis—the major imbalances in the
fiscal, household and financial sectors, against the backdrop of lower potential

household savings would imply an overvaluation according to the macro-balance approach.

26
growth. A key challenge is to enact rigorous, far-reaching reforms of financial
regulation to prevent a recurrence of the financial markets excesses of recent years.
Another essential element is restarting private securitization to support financial
intermediation over the medium term.
18. While near-term stabilization continues to have the greatest priority, it depends
importantly on the other objectives. Notably, monetary and fiscal stimulus have stoked
concerns in some quarters about the longer-run risks of inflation and rising debt, which in the
near term could exert upward pressure on interest rates. The dynamic interaction between
near- and long-term challenges underscores the need to develop and communicate strategies
for exiting extraordinary financial system support and dealing with long-term challenges, and
implement them rigorously, to underpin confidence. All these challenges are further
heightened to the extent that potential growth were to weaken relative to pre-crisis standards.
A. Stabilization: Exiting the Great Recession
19. The authorities believed that, while risks remained, considerable progress had
been made towards stabilizing the financial system. Notably, the Supervisory Capital
Assessment Program (SCAP) had made a thorough, rigorous, and uniform evaluation of the
risks to major institutions in an adverse scenario. The results had bolstered confidence in the
stability of major financial institutions, and accordingly, some were able to access capital
markets for equity and nonguaranteed debt. The next step was to complete recapitalization
plans under the SCAP. While more needed to be done to return financial institutions to full
health, capital was not seen as constraining lending, as credit demand remained subdued, and
they saw remaining TARP resources as adequate. The Public-Private Investment Program
(PPIP) could be useful in improving price discovery and cleaning bank balance sheets, and
could be used to address capital shortfalls uncovered in the SCAP. However, with banks
accessing private markets, profits unexpectedly robust in the first quarter, and the economy
and asset prices recovering, the facility could be less needed than originally thought. Many
applications had been received for the legacy securities program, but participation in the loan
program was less clear.
20. The team agreed that policies had substantially reduced systemic strains, but saw
downside risks. The team welcomed the SCAP exercise, particularly its high level of
transparency. That said, while the SCAP’s adverse economic scenario was more pessimistic
than staff’s baseline, losses could persist for a prolonged period, notably in commercial real
estate (Annex III). Moreover, a worse-case outturn of sub-par growth, depressed earnings,
and mounting losses could not be ruled out. Such a scenario would erode capital from the
SCAP target level—a 4 percent ratio of Tier 1 common capital to risk-weighted assets—
which was low by historical standards (averaging 7¼ percent over 1997–2007 for all FDIC
banks). This called for continued close monitoring of the financial system, along with regular
stress tests to evaluate vulnerabilities; meanwhile, it would be prudent to retain the
Administration’s proposed $750 billion budgetary reserve for financial stabilization funds. It

27
would also be essential to quickly implement the proposed resolution framework for systemic
nonbanks, to provide the options of receivership and conservatorship for orderly resolution.
The team also supported the objective of cleaning bank balance sheets, but noted that the
PPIP might not be extensively used for loan purchases (absent a large subsidy element) as
banks might have to book significant losses on loan sales. In addition, potential investors had
expressed concerns about risks that they could face restrictions on their compensation or be
subject to criticism (or windfall taxes) if they reaped large gains.
21. The team welcomed the continued efforts to stem preventable foreclosures, but
expressed concerns about the high level of underwater mortgages. The Making Home
Affordable (MHA) initiative partially dealt with shortcomings of earlier programs by
providing financial incentives to borrowers and servicers to perform sustainable
modifications, as well as for alternatives to foreclosures such as short sales and deed in lieu
of foreclosure. However, concerns remained that the structure of ABS contracts limited the
incentives and ability of securitizers to modify mortgages, including the lack of a broad safe
harbor for servicers against investor lawsuits. In addition, negative equity could reduce
incentives for debtors to restructure their obligations, which—if it occurred—could call for
greater incentives for equity writedowns. Officials saw the central issue as affordability; only
5 percent of foreclosures involved underwater borrowers defaulting on affordable mortgages.
They noted that only large writedowns would improve affordability, entailing high costs and
moral hazard.
22. The team also observed that the equity market downturn and credit market
disruption had a severe impact on insurers and pensions. The crisis had demonstrated
how failures of large insurers could impose

23. The team welcomed the authorities’ steps to stem stresses in financial markets. The
response was broad, including support for CP and money market mutual funds, FDIC

28
guarantees of bank liabilities under the
Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (as
well as NCUA guarantees), and the Fed’s Term
Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF)
and purchases of mortgage-backed securities
(MBS). These initiatives had helped to improve
conditions in markets, with money-market
spreads narrowing sharply, interest rates on
consumer borrowing coming down, and volumes
generally improving. That said, longer-term
markets still relied significantly on government
measures; notably, Fed purchases of MBS were
large relative to the fresh supply (flow-of-funds
data suggest that purchases exceeded net GSE
issuance in the first quarter of 2009). In addition,
efforts to reduce borrowing costs faced the
headwinds of rising benchmark Treasury rates.
Officials saw that the array of programs had
stabilized market conditions, and short-term
securities markets now relied less on public
support. Fed officials stressed that they did not
aim to dominate the MBS market, nor to fix
private borrowing rates, but to limit financing
pressures. It was agreed that more needed to be
done to return markets to full health, particularly
for securitization (see below).

effects. More generally, Fed officials saw the
recent rise in long-term Treasury rates as primarily driven by increased risk appetite and an
improved economic outlook.

29
25. The team asked whether there could be scope to enhance transparency and
communication, especially in light of the upward sloping fed funds futures curve (which
at the time of the mission suggested that markets expected a tightening in the second half of
2009). In this connection, the recent moves to publish longer-term forecasts and elaborate its
strategy for supporting economic and financial stability could be accompanied by more
explicit communication of the Fed’s perceptions of the risks surrounding the price stability
outlook, to lower expected future interest rates and flatten the yield curve. Fed officials
considered that market signals were difficult to read, in view of uncertainties about prevailing
term and liquidity premia, but overall felt that their strategy and stance were well understood.
Given the considerable prevailing uncertainty, they saw risks to committing more strongly to
a particular stance of monetary policy going forward.
26. The team viewed the broad stance of fiscal policy in 2009−10 as appropriate,
which—along with stimulus in key trading partners—was providing critical support to
demand in the United States and in the rest of the world. According to staff estimates,
stimulus would boost GDP growth by about 1 percent in 2009 and ¼ percent in 2010. Further
fiscal stimulus could be considered if tail risks—such as serious deflationary pressures—
materialized, but given long-term fiscal challenges, it must be set within a sustainable
medium-term framework.3 The authorities did not rule out additional stimulus if necessary,
but saw the priority as implementing and monitoring the large package already in train,
which they saw as broadly on track.
B. The Great Unwinding: Preparing the Exit from Extraordinary Support
27. The crisis response has swelled public sector balance sheets. Fed, Treasury, and
federal agency balance sheets have grown sharply and taken on sizeable credit risk. For
example, the Fed balance sheet has doubled in size to 15 percent of GDP, and could double
again to 30 percent of GDP if all existing facilities were deployed to their limits (for those
with caps). The U.S. government now effectively owns a major global insurance group, the
mortgage GSEs, and holds large shares in banks and auto manufacturers. Some 58 percent of
bank liabilities are now guaranteed,4 and for the six largest banks, TARP preferred and
common shares account for a sizeable share of Tier 1 capital. Unwinding these interventions
will pose major challenges: for the Fed, absorbing enough liquidity that it can effectively
tighten monetary policy; and for government, withdrawing support without damaging
confidence. Moreover, exit strategies—including strategies for orderly withdrawal of
macroeconomic stimulus, once a durable recovery is secured—will need to be coordinated
internationally, to avoid an unleveled playing field.
3

The team observed that large near-term gross financing requirements—estimated at some $5 trillion—put a
premium on a well-communicated strategy for medium-term fiscal sustainability to maintain market confidence.

4

Guaranteed liabilities comprise $4.8 trillion in insured deposits, $700 billion in insured non-interest-bearing
transaction accounts, and $336 billion in guaranteed debt (the latter two are under the TLGP program).

30
Unwinding the Fed
28. The team saw a key priority as developing and communicating an exit strategy to
withdraw monetary stimulus once a sustainable recovery is underway (Box 6). While
short-term facilities were unwinding as market conditions became more favorable, longerterm assets—such as TALF and assets purchased—were rising, which would be more
difficult to unwind rapidly without disrupting markets (and could give rise to capital losses).
The situation called for maximum operational flexibility, with a broad toolkit to reassure
markets that liquidity could be withdrawn when and as needed. Instruments such as
remuneration on excess reserves could be supplemented by reverse repos in agency securities
and MBS, although the liquidity of the associated markets could be a constraint. Other tools
included use of the Supplementary Financing Program sterilization facility with Treasury
(subject to the federal debt ceiling), and if needed, issuance of Fed paper (although this
would create a second tier of sovereign debt, and would require Congressional authorization).
Also, as anticipated in the March joint statement with Treasury, Maiden Lane facilities
(support to Bear Stearns and AIG assets) should be moved to the Treasury, in the view of the
team at an early stage, to reduce Fed exposure to credit risk and support fiscal accountability.
29. Fed officials believed they had sufficient tools to manage the exit, although
additional instruments would be welcome. Fed officials had addressed issues surrounding
the exit strategy in recent public communications, to underpin confidence in its ability to
manage the exit. Its credibility was reflected in asset prices, which revealed few fears about
inflation, notwithstanding concerns among commentators. Interest on reserves would likely
play a key role, and modalities of other options such as enhanced reverse repos were under
development; officials expressed confidence that other tools would be provided if needed. On
credit risks, apart from Maiden Lane, risks to the Fed’s balance sheet were limited, reflecting
high-quality collateral, large haircuts/over-collateralization, and (on some facilities) credit
protection by the Treasury through capital investment. That said, Fed officials acknowledged
that purchases of longer-term assets did entail some interest-rate risk.
Unwinding government interventions
30. The team observed that the government will need to wind down its interventions
when the crisis fades to avoid distortions, fiscal risks, and governance issues. Although a
number of facilities have sunset provisions, and an exit strategy should not be implemented
until the financial system has fully stabilized, there should be a clear medium-term objective
to withdraw emergency facilities and support, coordinated internationally to avoid crossborder distortions. The pace of withdrawal would need to be calibrated to future financial
conditions, but should gradually reduce subsidies and tighten access terms for any facilities
that may need to be extended, both to minimize risks and differentiate stronger institutions
from weaker ones (some of which might need assistance for a prolonged period). Healthy
firms should be encouraged to repay capital injections and issue nonguaranteed debt to signal

31
Box 6. Federal Reserve Exit Strategy
The Fed balance sheet has grown substantially—from $900 billion in the first half of 2007 to about $2.1
trillion at mid-June 2009. It could grow further—to over $4 trillion—if all existing facilities were fully
deployed. While the current size of the balance sheet is not a concern, the Fed will need to shrink excess
liquidity in order to implement a positive policy interest rate as the economy enters a lasting recovery.
There are a number of tools available to the Fed to achieve that goal. Short-term facilities can be rolled
off. Some roll-off is natural as financial markets stabilize, yet a constraint is that markets need to recover
before the Fed fully withdraws its support. Similarly, the Fed might sell tradable assets, such as
Treasury securities, and agency debt and MBS. However significant sales may affect interest rates in
underlying markets (particularly for housing debt). As an alternative to sales, the Fed may perform
reverse repos in a broader range of collateral. Yet their scope is limited by the liquidity of relevant
funding markets, particularly for MBS collateral.
The remuneration of bank reserve balances will likely play a significant role in the exit strategy, as it
can set a floor for short-term interest rates. Yet, beyond a certain level of excess reserves, reserve
remuneration may lead to persistent disintermediation (crowding out) of interbank markets, and
necessitate a higher level of short-term interest rates than would otherwise be appropriate.
Excess liquidity can also be sterilized through the Supplementary Funding Program (SFP, where the
Treasury issues new debt and deposits proceeds with the Fed) or issuance of Fed paper. Allowing the
Fed to issue paper would contribute to monetary policy independence, but would create a new tier of
U.S. sovereign debt. Congressional approval would be required to adjust the debt ceiling to
accommodate SFP issue or to allow the creation of Fed paper. Finally, implementing the intended
transfer of Maiden Lane and AIG facilities to the Treasury would reduce excess reserves, if the Fed was
compensated in cash.
Given the uncertainties surrounding the future evolution of financial and economic conditions, as well as
the fact that many available instruments have not yet been fully tested, it would be appropriate for the
Fed to have access to the largest possible set of instruments to enable responding to all contingencies.

viability. Clear communication of the government’s strategy, particularly on conditions for
unwinding (linked to objectives of the programs), would help to secure market confidence.
31. Officials saw the exit from financial system interventions as evolving organically in
line with the recovery. Officials expressed little concern that financial institutions would
rely on government support for longer than necessary, as (for example) government capital
injections carried a stigma, and banks were therefore eager to repay. This was in line with the
government’s strategy to encourage repayment of capital and return firms to private
ownership as quickly as possible, guided by the principle that shareholders and taxpayers
would be best served if the government exerted influence only on core governance issues and
not day-to-day operations.5 The repayment of capital injections by the healthier banks, in
addition to banks’ improved access to private markets for funding, was in line with this
overall aim. They agreed that the exit strategy needed to be internationally coordinated,
especially with regard to guarantees, where cross-border issues had arisen.
C. The Long-Term Legacies of the Crisis
32. The crisis and the policy response leave interrelated legacies: a weakened financial
system, requiring major reforms and strengthening of supervision and regulation;
unsustainable fiscal imbalances; and damaged household balance sheets. These will also
have sizeable international repercussions: the U.S. long-run fiscal position will have an
important impact on global interest rates and financial markets; and slower U.S. growth, with
a less-buoyant U.S. consumer, requires a rebalancing of global demand (Selected Issues
Paper, Chapter II).
Strengthening the Financial Sector
33. The crisis has had two major implications for the U.S. financial sector.6 First, it
revealed major weaknesses in supervision and regulation, including a failure to recognize and
internalize a buildup of systemic risk, particularly risks outside the banking system and those
related to flaws in the securitization model. Second, it has radically changed the shape of the
U.S. financial system, with investment banks now reconfigured as bank-holding companies,
nonbanks severely weakened, the housing GSEs now in government hands, and private
securitization dormant. While securitization will likely pick up over time (see below), the
legacy is likely to be a more bank-centered and (at least initially) more concentrated system.
Overall, financial conditions are likely to be tighter, and innovation less rapid, than in the
pre-crisis years, restraining growth.
5

Similarly, the principles for managing ownership stakes in auto companies centered on disposing of such
stakes as soon as possible, managing stakes in a hands-off, commercial manner to protect taxpayers, and voting
only on core governance issues.

6

The planned Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) will expand upon these and other issues related to
the stability of the U.S. financial system.

33

34. The authorities saw a number of priorities for regulatory reform, which were
included in wide-ranging Administration proposals issued after the mission.7 These
included an enhanced focus on systemic risk, with Fed regulation of all systemic financial
institutions from a macroprudential perspective, as well as a Financial Services Oversight
Council (FSOC) chaired by the Treasury to identify and report on emerging systemic risks,
and steps over time to mitigate procyclicality. All institutions would be subject to tighter
supervision and regulation, with even higher standards for large, interconnected firms (to
internalize systemic costs), complemented by a broadened resolution framework for systemic
firms; also, the Fed’s emergency lending would require Treasury approval. On the
international front, the report called for higher regulatory standards and improved
cooperation, with strengthened capital frameworks, enhanced oversight of global financial
markets (including OTC derivatives) and internationally active institutions, and reform of
crisis prevention and management arrangements. On organizational changes, the plan would
consolidate two bank regulators while creating a new consumer regulatory agency.
35. The team generally welcomed the Administration’s proposals, although their
effectiveness would depend critically on implementation. The team saw it as essential to
implement the measures as a package, as allowing gaps to persist could prove problematic.
Key details of implementation would be important: notably, there was an argument for
regulation of systemic firms that would penalize size and complexity to discourage the
promulgation of systemic risk (Selected Issues Paper, Chapter III), with the supervisory
perimeter reviewed regularly to ensure that it remained adequate. Other questions surrounded
whether the FSOC would be more effective than a single institution such as the Fed in
identifying emerging systemic risks and highlighting them through a financial stability
report; the mandates for systemic stability could be clarified, including the relationship
between the Council and the Fed, and between the Treasury and Fed under the FSOC. A
main concern was that the proposals missed an opportunity to consolidate the large number
of regulatory agencies, which could have mitigated coordination problems, sped decisionmaking, and bridged the gaps and inconsistencies that contributed to the crisis.
36. On securitization, the authorities and the team agreed that restarting private
securitization markets would be essential to ensuring smooth credit flows when credit
demand recovers. The authorities noted that it would take time to restore a more normal
pace of private securitization; while the TALF had grown rapidly and even catalyzed private
deals on similarly-structured ABS, private market activity remained muted, in part reflecting
weak credit demand. Proposed regulatory reforms would deal with issues such as the role of
credit ratings, underwriting standards, and risk retention; efforts were also underway to
improve incentives for bundlers to perform due diligence by increasing their liability. The

34
team agreed with these priorities but also saw scope for a broader legal “safe harbor” for
servicers to modify loans, as well as efforts to support simplification and standardization of
products (including through a market code of conduct). In addition, the role of the major
housing GSEs would need to be addressed as the future structure of the financial system
clarified; options ranged from privatization to full government ownership, but the key was to
clarify whether their liabilities are explicitly guaranteed, and to subject the agencies to strict
oversight and regulation.
The Fiscal Legacy
37. The team noted that the crisis—as in many countries—will leave unsustainable
fiscal imbalances. The combined effects of the stimulus, cyclical pressure on the deficit, and
financial support costs will dramatically increase the fiscal imbalance. Deficits in 2009/10
and 2010/11 will average 12½ percent of GDP, pushing up gross federal government debt
held by the public by almost 30 percent of GDP to about 70 percent of GDP, and—absent
adjustment—to almost 100 percent of GDP by 2019, close to the level prevailing in the
aftermath of World War II (Selected Issues Paper, Chapter IV). Gross financing requirements
will rise sharply to some 30 percent of GDP, and with the maturity of debt having shortened
in recent years, would remain high. Key fiscal risks included costs of financial rescue
operations (including those accrued by the Fed), as well as possible calls to support private
defined benefit pensions and state finances.

38. Looking forward, even bigger challenges are posed by looming pension and health
care pressures. Pension entitlements are projected to generate gradually-widening deficits
from 2017. Already-high public health care spending would rise from about 5 percent of
GDP in 2009 to more than 6 percent in 2019, and about 8 percent in 2029, according to

35
CBO—mainly due to rising per capita expenditures. Expanded insurance coverage would
help attain the policy objectives of better and more equitable health outcomes, but would
greatly worsen fiscal imbalances if not coupled with efficiency gains (Box 7).
39. The team observed that the Administration’s FY 2010 budget proposal made
welcome steps toward addressing these problems, but fell short of a comprehensive
solution. In particular, the team welcomed the objective of stabilizing debt beginning in early
2012. The budget proposal increased transparency through ten-year forecasts and more
realistic assumptions about defense spending and future tax policy, and appropriately
emphasized fiscal discipline, including by proposing statutory pay-as-you-go rules. However,
its medium-term forecasts relied on relatively optimistic economic assumptions, implying
that only a modest cut in the primary deficit would be needed to stabilize debt. 8
40. Against this background, while the pace of fiscal consolidation should depend on
overall economic developments, substantially more adjustment would be needed over
the medium term. For example, an adjustment of 3.5 percent of GDP (relative to the budget
proposal) in the federal primary surplus would stabilize debt at about 70 percent of GDP over
2015–19. With nondefense discretionary expenditures near historical lows, most of the
burden would need to fall on revenues. This could include base broadening (limiting
deductions on household mortgage and corporate debt), higher marginal tax rates for most
income groups than envisaged in the budget, higher energy taxes, a federal consumption tax,
and measures to ensure better tax compliance, including by simplifying the tax code (the
latter being studied by the President’s tax force on tax reform).9
41. The authorities underscored their commitment to medium-term fiscal discipline,
including the achievement of their 3 percent of GDP budget objective.10 Treasury
officials acknowledged that fiscal consolidation would be challenging—updated projections
were to be published in the forthcoming mid-term review—but considered that staff’s
economic assumptions were on the pessimistic side. They saw less risk that concerns about
fiscal sustainability would push up long-term interest rates (and assumed no rise in their
projections), as a credible plan would minimize this risk. Officials agreed that funding
requirements were large, but the Treasury aimed to lengthen debt maturity over time.
8

Staff employs a real interest-rate/growth differential—key for debt dynamics—of 1.9 percent, compared with
OMB’s 0.5 percent, and CBO’s 1.4 percent. For comparison, the differential was 1.7 percent over 1985-1999,
calculated using ex-post real interest rates (the average of real three-month Treasury bill rates and ten-year
Treasury rates, deflated by the actual change in the GDP deflator over the subsequent quarter or ten years
respectively). Real ex-post ten-year rates are not observable beyond 1999; in addition, that period was
characterized by unusually low long-term yields.

9

IRS research has estimated uncollected tax obligations at 2.9 percent of GDP, suggesting sizable returns to
enhancing compliance through better enforcement (see
http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=154496,00.html).

10

On staff’s economic assumptions, this would imply a debt ratio of about 75 percent of GDP.

36
Box 7: Escalating U.S. Health Spending
Per capita health spending in the United States is the
highest in the OECD, and is still rising. U.S. health
spending represents over 15 percent of GDP, compared to
less than 10 percent in the G-6 group, and grew by about
5 percent a year in real terms over 2000−06 compared with
3½ percent in G-6. Without major reform, the Council of
Economic Advisers project that health care’s share of GDP
will continue to rise rapidly, reaching around 28 percent of
GDP in 2030 and 34 percent in 2040 (15 percent of GDP
accounted by Medicare and Medicaid). Despite the large
spending, health outcomes in the United States are less
favorable than in many OECD countries. For example, the
infant mortality rate is the fourth highest and years lost from
preventable causes are the fifth highest in a sample of
OECD countries.

Lowering the health cost growth rate by 1.5
percentage points would have dramatic implications
for the share of GDP devoted to health care in 2040. In
May 2009, representatives from the health care industry
pledged to reduce the annual growth rate of health care
costs by 1.5 percentage points as soon as possible by
improving care for chronic diseases, streamlining
administrative tasks and reducing unnecessary care. The
Council of Economic Advisers estimates that if these health
cost savings take hold from 2014 onwards, then health
spending would only rise to 23 percent of GDP by 2040
(reducing the budget deficit by 6 percent of GDP), versus
34 percent if no reforms are undertaken. In late June, the
pharmaceutical industry also agreed to help close a gap in
Medicare's drug coverage, by pledging to spend $80 billion
over the next decade to help reduce the cost of drugs for
seniors and pay for a portion of any increase in health care
coverage.

G-6

Health care costs are the main driver behind rising
health spending. The escalation in health costs is primarily
explained by the emergence and widespread adoption of
new medical technologies. Other factors found to be
driving health costs include rising personal income, health
care prices and administrative costs. Looking ahead,
population aging and other demographic effects are
estimated to drive one-quarter of the future increase in
health spending.
Health care inefficiencies might be driving health costs
by about one-third (5 percent of GDP). The sources of
inefficiency include fee-for-service payment systems,
high administrative costs, and inadequate focus on
prevention. Also, market imperfections in the health
insurance market create adverse selection problems,
where healthy people overpay for health insurance
coverage.

42. The authorities emphasized that health care reform was critical for both growth
and longer-term debt sustainability. While discussions with Congress were ongoing,
reforms would have two key elements. First was universal coverage, which should be budget
neutral, and which they had proposed be financed by scaling back itemized deductions for
high-earning taxpayers, reducing tax evasion and loopholes, and achieving efficiency gains
in health care provision. Second, they aimed to reduce the rate of cost growth by
1.5 percentage points per year, notably through leveraging research on the relative
effectiveness of alternative treatments, and setting incentives for providers to choose the
most cost-effective ones. More generally, securing medium-term fiscal sustainability could
require several rounds of measures on various fronts, but the Administration was determined
to bring the fiscal situation under control.
43. The team underscored the importance of ensuring that the ultimate package, when
it emerged, was budget neutral in the short-run and made meaningful progress in
reducing long-term health-care costs. Given that the impact of measures to reduce costs
was extremely difficult to assess, it saw a need for careful monitoring, with additional
measures taken promptly if envisaged savings failed to materialize. In addition, medical care
reform should be complemented by social security reforms, where savings would be smaller
but more predictable. While the authorities agreed that the impact of specific measures was
difficult to gauge, they underscored that substantial potential savings existed, particularly
from ensuring more widespread use of cost-effective treatments. They indicated that once
health-care reforms had been launched, attention would turn to social security reform.
Household Balance-Sheet Adjustment
44. Consumption growth is likely to be weak over the medium term as households
rebuild damaged balance sheets, which will support a narrower current account deficit.
Household net worth has fallen from a record-high 640 percent of disposable income before
the current crisis to below 500 percent in the first quarter of 2009, near mid-1990s levels. At
the same time, household debt remains high relative to disposable income, and debt to net
worth (household leverage) has risen sharply. Against this backdrop, ongoing household
deleveraging would likely restrain consumption growth and boost savings (as discussed
above) going forward. Over the medium term, with the withdrawal of fiscal stimulus offset
by a recovery in private investment from crisis-related lows, the increase in private savings
would support a reduction in the current account deficit to about 2¾ percent of GDP
(Table 2).
45. Accordingly, the crisis would have significant implications for the U.S. role as the
engine of global growth. First, as noted above, the crisis appears to be leading to an
adjustment in the U.S. contribution to global imbalances, which is likely to have substantial
implications for key trading partners (Figure 11). Second, the combination of more cautious

consumers, tighter financial regulation, and lower securitization is likely to reduce the U.S.
interest elasticity of demand. As a result, the U.S. economy is likely to absorb a smaller
proportion of future global shocks than it has in the past, which will in turn require greater
flexibility and adjustment elsewhere.
46. The authorities broadly agreed that the U.S. consumer was unlikely to be the
global “buyer of last resort,” underscoring the need to rebalance global demand.
Surplus countries would need to rely more on domestic demand instead of exports. If excess
savings (the “savings glut”) re-emerged with U.S. saving also rising, global growth could be
adversely affected (as well as heightening financial risks, as they saw global imbalances as
one cause of the crisis). In addition, they believed that increased exchange rate flexibility was
needed in some countries to facilitate adjustment.
47. The authorities recognized the importance of open markets at home and abroad to
U.S. economic performance, particularly in times of stress. They supported the G-20
leaders' pledge to avoid raising barriers to trade or investment. While acknowledging that the
U.S. trade regime remained very open, staff emphasized that holding the line against
protectionism required that governments forgo any scope within their WTO obligations to
raise barriers or to otherwise favor domestic industries. Buy American (BA) provisions of the
U.S. stimulus package harmed expenditure efficiency, appeared to be causing some project
delays, and added to protectionist pressures in partner countries. Staff welcomed efforts to
limit the scope of BA and encouraged the authorities to utilize maximum flexibility in
implementation (e.g., through waivers for products containing only limited import content or
where public interest exceptions can be justified), and to urge state and local governments to
follow international procurement agreements, even where they are not required to do so.
48. The authorities underscored their commitment to the Doha Round and
multilateralism. The authorities sought to reinvigorate domestic support for trade by
highlighting its benefits and demonstrating its consistency with their broader economic
objectives. They attached great importance to concluding the Doha Round, both to reduce the
future risks of protectionist measures and to generate substantial new market opening,
especially in advanced and middle-income countries. In addition, the FY2010 budget puts
foreign aid on a path to double (though it would still remain modest relative to UN targets).
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
49. The U.S. financial and economic crisis has had severe global repercussions. The
turbulent unwinding of unsustainable financial imbalances, culminating in the collapse of
Lehman Brothers, revealed major weaknesses in the U.S. regulatory and resolution
frameworks. The resulting financial turbulence has had a serious impact on financial stability
and growth, both in the United States and in the rest of the world.

41
50. Post-Lehman, an increasingly strong and comprehensive policy response has
helped to stabilize economic and financial conditions. The large monetary and fiscal
stimulus and wide range of measures to restore financial stability are welcome, as is the
attendant transparency. The sharp fall in economic output seems to be ending, and
confidence in financial stability has improved. That said, financial strains are still elevated
and the outlook remains for only a gradual recovery, with risks still tilted to the downside.
51. Steps to stabilize financial conditions are helping to restore confidence, but risks
remain. The immediate priority is to complete the strengthening of the financial system.
Policies under the Financial Stability Plan, notably the SCAP stress test, debt guarantees, and
capital injections, have contributed to a significant improvement in financial conditions.
However, risks persist, notably the risk that a prolonged recession could further erode capital.
This situation warrants continued close monitoring and regular stress tests to evaluate
vulnerabilities. The proposed reserve for stabilization funds should be retained, with the
resolution framework for systemic nonbanks expeditiously implemented to improve the
predictability and flexibility of crisis management. Balance-sheet cleaning remains a priority;
the PPIP will provide a tool, although its usage may be limited. Recent steps to facilitate
mortgage modifications are welcome, but more steps may be needed to encourage
writedowns of underwater mortgages.
52. Macroeconomic policies are providing helpful support to demand. Monetary policy
should remain highly accommodative until recovery is clearly underway. Meanwhile,
continued clear communication by the Fed on the near-term outlook will be essential to
anchor inflation expectations, given the prevailing uncertainty. If downside risks materialize,
additional credit easing and a strengthened commitment to maintaining a highly
accommodative stance could be deployed. Additional fiscal stimulus could also be used,
provided it were set within a credible medium-term fiscal framework.
53. A key priority will be to develop and to communicate exit strategies to unwind the
extraordinary crisis-driven interventions. For the Fed, a diverse set of tools will be needed
to afford maximum flexibility in light of uncertainties about how market conditions will
evolve and about the extent to which particular instruments can be used. In addition, Maiden
Lane facilities should be transferred to the Treasury at an early stage, to reduce the Fed’s
exposure to credit risk. On support to financial institutions, terms should be tightened on
facilities that need to be extended, to avoid distortions, fiscal risks, and governance issues.
Clear communication of the strategy would bolster market confidence, and international
coordination will be warranted as well.
54. A crucial lesson from the crisis is the need for substantial strengthening of
financial supervision and regulation. The Administration’s proposals to enhance the
framework through Fed regulation of all systemic firms and the creation of a financial
council are welcome. However, the remaining fragmentation in the regulatory structure is a

42
concern, the mandate for systemic stability should be clarified, and regulations for systemic
firms should be stringent enough to discourage size and complexity. Measures will also be
needed to mitigate financial procyclicality, coordinated internationally. The forthcoming
FSAP will provide an opportunity to explore these and other issues in more depth.
55.
Restarting private securitization will be critical to restoring healthy credit flow.
While implementation will take time, the faster reforms can be pursued, the lower the risk of
impeding credit supply once economic activity (and credit demand) revive in earnest. Key
steps, some envisioned in the authorities’ plan, include improving disclosure about the
ratings process and the underlying credits, and differentiating ratings for securitized products;
strengthening the liability of bundlers to improve their accountability; and encouraging more
standardized and simpler securitizations through market codes of conduct. An appropriate
role for the housing GSEs will be needed, as the future shape of the financial system clarifies.
Under any model, it should be made clear whether the housing agencies’ liabilities are
explicitly guaranteed, with the agencies subject to strict oversight and regulation.
56.
With public debt set to rise substantially over coming years, it will be critical to
secure medium-term fiscal sustainability. The FY2010 budget is commendably
transparent, and appropriately recognizes the need for an early stabilization of public debt.
However, substantial additional measures will be required to achieve its goals. Given the low
level of discretionary spending, measures would most likely need to include increased
revenues. Options could include tax-base broadening, a federal consumption tax, higher
energy taxes, and improved compliance.
57.
Substantial further measures will be needed to rein in soaring entitlement costs
over the longer term. In this connection, the Administration’s focus on health care reform is
welcome, especially the goal of reducing growth in medical costs. However, the impact of
potential cost-control measures is highly uncertain. Accordingly, progress on this front will
need to be closely monitored, with additional measures taken promptly if improvements fail
to materialize. In this connection, these steps should be supplemented by early social security
reforms, where the gains are smaller but more certain. Thus, the Administration’s intention to
work toward developing a political consensus on social security reform once health care
reforms are complete is welcome.
58.
The crisis has important implications for the U.S. role in the global economy.
Over the medium term, rising personal savings and a fall in fiscal deficits from crisis levels
may cement the recent reduction in the current account deficit at a more sustainable level.
Moreover, the U.S. consumer is unlikely to play the role of global “buyer of last resort”—
suggesting that other regions will need to play an increased role in supporting global growth
and adjustment. The aim to raise foreign aid is welcome, as is the commitment to maintain an
open trade regime during the crisis. However, the Buy American provision of the stimulus
package is regrettable, as it harms expenditure efficiency, and adds to protectionist pressures

43
in partner countries. This provision, if not revoked, should be implemented with maximum
flexibility.
59.

Staff proposes to hold the next Article IV Consultation on a 12-month cycle.

Annex III. Capital Needs of the Banking System—A Sensitivity Analysis
Recent exercises by the U.S. authorities and Fund staff assessed the capital needs of the
U.S. banking system from a forward-looking perspective. The U.S. Supervisory Capital
Assistance Program (SCAP) assessed the capital positions of the 19 largest U.S. bank
holding companies (BHCs) under an “adverse” macroeconomic scenario that was moderately
more pessimistic than the current WEO baseline.1 It found that they would need $185 billion
in capital to maintain a minimum 4 percent ratio of Tier 1 common capital to risk weighted
assets over 2009–10 (falling to $74.6 billion once first-quarter earnings and other capital
measures in train were accounted for). The April 2009 Global Financial Stability Report
(GFSR) estimated that all U.S. banks would need $275 billion of additional capital to
maintain a 4 percent leverage ratio (tangible common equity/tangible assets) or $500 billion
to maintain a 6 percent leverage ratio, over the same period.
The two exercises were quite different methodologically. For example, the SCAP involved
intensive bank-by-bank analysis for the top 19 institutions, including their derivatives and
trading exposures, whereas the GFSR performed aggregated analysis using published
balance-sheet data for the entire U.S. banking system. The SCAP incorporated banks’ firstquarter earnings and assumed somewhat larger losses than the GFSR, with a cumulative loss
rate on total loans of 9.1 percent in the SCAP.
Perhaps the most important difference regards the capital targets. The SCAP’s 4 percent
Tier 1 common target compares to the current average level of 5.2 percent (and a 1997–2007
average of 7.4 percent) for the 17 BHCs for which past prudential data are available
(Figure 1). The GFSR targeted a minimum 4 percent tangible common equity to tangible
assets, relative to a 4.3 percent current average for those banks, and a 6.1 percent historical
average.
A key question is the extent to which downside risks could increase capital needs. For
example, net losses could persist beyond the horizon used in the SCAP and GFSR exercises,
which run through end-2010 (though the SCAP required banks to have adequate provisions
at end-2010 to cover 2011 losses). A related risk is that the recession could be more
prolonged, putting upward pressure on losses and downward pressure on earnings.
To explore this question, staff performed an illustrative sensitivity analysis. Drawing on
GFSR methodologies, the exercise linked projected losses to macroeconomic assumptions.2
1

For example, the SCAP assumes GDP growth of -3.3 percent in 2009 and 0.5 percent in 2010, versus the
staff’s -2.5 percent and 0.7 percent respectively.

2

A description of the model used to estimate charge-off rates can be found in Box 1.7 of the April 2009 Global
Financial Stability Report.

6
The staff simulated downside (and upside) scenarios in which real GDP growth was one
percent lower (higher) than the WEO baseline through mid-2011, with unemployment and
house price developments concomitantly worse (better).3 The results were simulated for the
48 largest BHCs, accounting for over 75 percent of U.S. banking assets, over 2009–14. The
exercise, while indicative in nature given the assumptions needed, may provide a broad sense
of the orders of magnitude implied by various scenarios (Figure 2).
The results suggest that capital needs may be significantly sensitive to the length and
depth of the recession. For example, under the downside risk scenario, net earnings (i.e.,
post-taxes, -dividends, and -losses) are $71.4 billion lower than under the baseline over
2009–10. The actual capital shortfall rises by a smaller amount ($40.5 billion), as some banks
have sufficient excess capital to absorb losses; also, risk weighted assets are assumed to
move in line with nominal GDP, which (other things equal) means a lower capital
requirement in dollar terms. However, the capital need grows further, to an additional
$316.2 billion compared to the baseline, if potential losses during 2011–14 are taken into
account. Alternatively, in the upside scenario, capital needs could be reduced by $76 billion
relative to a baseline scenario over the 2009–14 period.
The downside risks underscore the need for vigilance and maintaining policy tools to
deal with financial strains. While banks have recently been able to raise significant amounts
of capital in private markets, it would be desirable to retain the budget’s placeholder for
stabilization funds if needed. Similarly, the Public-Private Investment Program could prove a
useful tool for balance sheet cleaning, especially if significant concerns about balance-sheet
weaknesses re-emerged.

3

While the scenarios are symmetric, the results (capital needs) are asymmetric, reflecting that (1) capital
shortfalls are bounded below by zero and (2) bank losses tend to fall less in good times than they rise in bad
times.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with the
United States
On July 24, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the United States. 1
Background
Since the last consultation, the U.S. economy has experienced the worst financial crisis since the
Great Depression. In the second half of 2008, financial pressures intensified and came to a head
with the failure of Lehman Brothers in September, triggering massive financial instability in U.S.
and global financial markets, with severe repercussions for the real economy. In the
United States, job losses and the unemployment rate surged, with GDP declining by 6¼ percent
in the fourth quarter of 2008 (quarter over quarter, seasonally adjusted annual rate) and a further
5½ percent in the first quarter of 2009. Inflation sank and briefly reached negative territory.
Internationally, production and international trade collapsed, with pronounced contractions in
manufacturing exporters. Measures of financial stress, especially credit spreads, increased
sharply, while Treasury yields fell and the dollar strengthened amid safe-haven flows. Despite the
rise in the dollar, the U.S. current account deficit receded on the back of weak domestic demand
and lower oil prices.
In response to these shocks, U.S. macroeconomic policy shifted to a war footing. In October
2008, the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) provided capital injections to stressed financial
institutions and bolstered financial markets. In addition, guarantees were provided on selected
bank assets and liabilities and expanded on deposits. In the same month, the Fed participated in
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the First Deputy Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities.

a coordinated rate cut with five other major central banks, and subsequently lowered its target
rate to an all-time low range of 0–25 basis points and communicated that conditions were likely to
warrant an exceptionally low rate for an extended period. The Fed also enhanced its securities
purchases as well as facilities to unfreeze segments of credit markets. In February 2009, the
authorities launched a fiscal stimulus of more than 5 percent of GDP over 2009–11 and ramped
up support for the housing market. The authorities’ Financial Stability Plan released in February
2009 included stress tests to assess banks’ resilience to the economic downturn, which bolstered
confidence in financial stability when results were announced in May, as well as a plan to address
toxic assets on financial institutions’ balance sheets.
The combination of massive macroeconomic stimulus and financial market intervention began to
stabilize financial and economic conditions. That said, economic activity remains weak, while
financial conditions remain somewhat stressed. Looking ahead, financial strains will weigh on
investment and (in tandem with the effects of rising unemployment and falling house prices)
consumption. In addition, the outlook for partner country growth remains subdued, which will
restrain exports.
The medium to longer run will pose a series of major challenges. These include, for the medium
term, formulating exit strategies from interventions to stabilize the financial system, as well as
extraordinary monetary policy stimulus. For the longer term, challenges include addressing the
weaknesses in financial supervision and regulation brought out by the crisis, stabilizing the public
finances (particularly in light of rising pressures from entitlements), and coping with an
environment of rising saving and slower growth as household balance sheets adjust.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that the U.S. financial and economic crisis has had severe domestic as
well as international repercussions on financial stability and growth. Directors commended the
authorities’ forceful and internationally coordinated actions to stabilize and repair the financial
sector, bolster domestic demand, and address international spillovers. As a result of their
increasingly strong and comprehensive policy measures, the sharp fall in economic output seems
to be ending, and confidence in financial stability has strengthened. Nevertheless, with financial
strains still elevated, the recovery is likely to be gradual, and risks are tilted to the downside. In
addition, potential growth could remain well below past trends for a considerable period.
Nevertheless, the long-term growth effects expected from structural policies now being
implemented were also noted, and a few Directors expected the crisis to have little lasting effect
on potential growth, given the flexibility of the economy.
Directors commended the steps taken to stabilize financial conditions and help restore
confidence. Policies under the Financial Stability Plan—notably stress tests, debt guarantees,
and capital injections—have contributed to a significant improvement in financial conditions.
Continued close monitoring and regular stress tests to evaluate vulnerabilities are nevertheless
needed. Directors supported implementing expeditiously the resolution framework for systemic
nonbank financial institutions, and retaining the proposed reserve for stabilization funds. Balance
sheet cleaning remains a priority. More steps might be needed to encourage writedowns of
underwater mortgages, but care must be taken to avoid moral hazard.

3

Directors agreed that macroeconomic policies are providing significant support to demand, and
an eventual unwinding would have to wait until an economic recovery is clearly underway. If
downside risks materialize, additional credit easing and a strengthened commitment to
maintaining a highly accommodative monetary stance could be considered. Additional fiscal
stimulus could also be used, although the immediate focus should be on implementing the current
fiscal measures and monitoring their impact. Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to
set policies in a sound medium-term policy framework.
Directors considered that a key priority will be to develop comprehensive exit strategies to unwind
the extraordinary crisis-driven interventions, once a sustainable recovery is underway. Directors
agreed that the Fed will need a diverse set of tools to respond to the uncertain evolution of
market conditions, while the transfer of Maiden Lane facilities to the Treasury would reduce its
exposure to credit risk. If extended, the terms of support to financial institutions should be
tightened. Directors stressed that clear communication of exit strategies, along with international
coordination, would bolster market confidence and facilitate a smooth exit.
Directors welcomed the Administration’s recent proposals for substantial reform and
strengthening of financial supervision and regulation. They saw scope for further actions to
address fragmentation in the regulatory structure and to clarify the mandate for systemic stability.
Some Directors also encouraged consideration of regulations aimed at discouraging size and
complexity. Directors supported the authorities’ commitment to an internationally coordinated
approach, especially in areas such as crisis management and cross-border supervision. The
forthcoming FSAP will provide an opportunity to explore financial supervisory and regulatory
issues in more depth.
Directors emphasized that restarting private securitization will be crucial to restore a healthy
credit flow. Key steps, some already envisioned in the authorities’ plan, include improving
disclosure about the ratings process and underlying credit quality; differentiating ratings for
securitized products; strengthening the liability of bundlers to improve their accountability; and
encouraging more standardized and simpler securitizations through market codes of conduct.
The housing GSEs would need to be subject to strict oversight and regulation, and their role
should be clarified as the future shape of the financial system emerges, including whether their
liabilities are explicitly guaranteed.
With public debt set to rise substantially over coming years, Directors underscored the need for
an ambitious medium-term fiscal consolidation to secure fiscal sustainability, as recognized in the
FY2010 budget. As the crisis has exacerbated existing fiscal imbalances, consolidation will likely
require significant additional adjustment. Given the low level of discretionary spending, the
adjustment would most likely need to focus on the revenue side. Noting the considerable
uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook, Directors supported the authorities’ intention to
re-evaluate the options for achieving fiscal sustainability if deficits do not decline as expected.
Directors underscored that addressing soaring entitlement costs remains the critical medium-term
fiscal challenge. They welcomed the Administration’s focus on health care reform, emphasizing
that the ultimate package should include substantial measures to reduce health care costs over

4
the longer term, while aiming at budget neutrality in the short term. Directors underscored that the
impact of cost control measures will need to be carefully monitored, and that additional measures
should be taken promptly as needed. Directors also welcomed the Administration’s intention to
work towards developing a political consensus for social security reform.
Directors observed that the crisis will have important implications for the role of the United States
in the global economy. The U.S. consumer is unlikely to play the role of global “buyer of last
resort”—suggesting that other regions will need to play an increased role in supporting global
growth. Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to increase foreign aid, and their
commitment to maintain an open trade regime during the crisis and, in this context, underscored
the importance of resisting protectionism.
