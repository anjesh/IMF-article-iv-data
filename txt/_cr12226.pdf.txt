STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION,
FIRST REVIEW UNDER THE THREE YEAR ARRANGEMENT
UNDER THE EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY AND REQUEST
FOR MODIFICATION OF PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
July 12, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context: Despite a difficult economic and social context, the government has made
steady, though uneven, progress in implementing its ECF-supported economic reforms.
Civil society and trade unions have been restive given high inflation due to the
persistence of food and fuel shocks.
Program: All end-March 2012 quantitative targets were met. However, fiscal slippages
emerged requiring corrective fiscal measures (about 1½ percent of GDP). The
implementation of structural reforms was uneven. Continued efforts in revenue
mobilization are critical in addressing declining donor support, while ongoing
strengthening of public financial and debt management augur well for transparency
and improved governance.
Outlook and risk: The medium-term macroeconomic outlook is challenging. Risks
emanate from a delicate social situation given persistent shocks and the high cost of
living. Declining donor support, if sustained, would imply greater fiscal adjustment in
realigning spending with available resources while external spillovers through the trade
channel could weaken demand for exports.
Staff views: The staff recommends completion of the review and disbursement of SDR
4 million, and modification of performance criteria and indicative targets for endSeptember 2012.

Fiscal trends. While revenues and

expenditure were broadly in line with the
program, the deficit in 2011 was higher than
expected due to the late disbursement of the
2

World Bank budget support operation.

Revenues through end-May 2012 were lower
than expected by (0.5 percent of GDP), owing
to a fall in collections of excise taxes and the
granting of exemptions. To limit the impact of
inflation on the poor, the government
eliminated taxes on food products on May 1
until end-2012.
6.

Money and credit. Growth in broad

money decelerated to about 4.7 percent
(y-o-y) in April 2012 following tighter
monetary conditions as policy rates rose by
350 basis points to 14 percent in May 2012.
Credit to the private sector after peaking at
40 percent at end-2011 slowed to 28 percent
(y-o-y) at end-April 2012 in the face of tighter
liquidity conditions. Banks were able to
sustain credit growth despite a decline in
deposits, in part through a drawdown in excess
reserves.

C. Program Implementation
7.

Program performance has been

challenging under difficult economic
conditions (MEFP, Tables I.1–I.2).
All quantitative and indicative targets for
end-December 2011 except that on pro-poor
spending and all performance criteria and
indicative targets for end-March 2012 were
observed. Structural benchmarks for the first
review are still pending. The decree on budget
governance that realigns current regulation
with the new organic law is awaiting
presidential approval, while recruitment for the
international firm to conduct an audit of the
central bank was delayed due to the need to
incorporate the recommendations of the
safeguards assessment mission into the terms
of reference. The safeguards recommendations
were incorporated into the terms of reference
and bids for the selection of the auditors have
now been received and selection is envisaged
by mid-July. Submission of the auditor’s
report is now expected by end-September in
light of the delays (LOI ¶4, MEFP ¶21).
Regarding the decree on budget governance
clarifications were incorporated into the legal
text, reflecting discussions by the Council of
Ministers. These changes will be reviewed
shortly by the Council of Ministers prior to

could cause a slowdown in growth, reform

multilateral donors continue to provide budget

bilateral donors have become less engaged in

rising interest rates and adverse external

discussions with commercial banks regarding
the impacts of adverse developments on their
balance sheets and to better assess emerging
credit risks. Increased on-site inspections are

ANNEX II. BURUNDI—SHOULD THE FUEL PRICING
MECHANISM BE REVISED?1
Burundi has been using a fuel pricing mechanism (formula) for more than two years which has been
more recently complemented with a price smoothing system based on the use of a stabilization fund.
In May 2011, a fuel price subsidy was introduced. This note: (i) summarizes Burundi’s fuel pricing
arrangement and explains some of its shortcomings; (ii) reviews the motivation for adopting an
automatic fuel pricing mechanism with a price smoothing framework and highlights some design
principles2; and (iii) suggests some modifications to Burundi’s fuel pricing mechanism.

I. THE CURRENT FUEL PRICING MECHANISM IN BURUNDI
Burundi’s fuel pricing formula establishes a procedure to set retail prices based on the
international fuel prices faced by importers, pre-agreed distribution costs (transport, deposit and
other administrative costs), pre-agreed margins for private importers and distributors, and taxes.
Each month the formula stipulates the retail prices needed to ensure meeting the agreed margins,
given the prices of refined fuels in international markets (obtained from Platts) and the import cost
parameters included in the formula.3
More recently the original formula was modified, and a retail price stabilization fund (FS) was
created. The current formula includes a lump-sum charge per liter of each fuel distributed (the
amount differs by fuel product). This amount, which is charged at customs, would be transferred to
the FS and deposited into a specific subaccount in the Central Bank. The purpose of the FS is to
smooth fluctuations in retail prices. However, it is not an automatic scheme: the government needs
to decide, each period, whether to adjust or not the contribution to the FS and, consequently, what
retail price to set. Regarding tax revenue, the use of the FS should not entail any revenue losses nor

This note draws heavily on the FAD technical manual “On the Design and Implementation of Automatic Fuel Pricing
Mechanisms” by D. Coady, A Tuladhar, J. Arze del Granado, L. Eyraud and L. Nemeth.

In Burundi, given that its landlocked position imply an important delay between the time fuel is purchased abroad
and available for sale in the domestic market, a two-month average import price (Platts) is used.

volatility in tax receipts in principle, as price smoothing would be implemented only as long as there
is a positive balance in the FS. In practice, however, this is not completely true and, in any case, hard
to verify as explained below.

A. Shortcomings of the Current Framework: Recent Evidence
Some of the limitations are related to implementation aspects of the original framework and
others, with the operation of the price smoothing mechanism (i.e. the FS). First, the updating of the
formula’s cost structure is unsatisfactory, since the different costs embedded in the pricing formula
are updated with an irregular frequency. Second, the non-automatic nature of the FS has exposed
the government to regular pressures on its pricing decision, similar to those experienced by
countries that do not count with a formula at all. As a consequence, 3 undesirable outcomes
emerge:
Large price jumps and distortions. International fuel prices fluctuations, that turn out to be very
persistent, affecting import prices, are confused with transitory ones, often leading to long periods
of fixed prices followed by large single price adjustments (or, a sequence of relatively large
adjustments).4
Lack of fiscal transparency. Withdrawals from the FS are implemented by adjusting excise taxes. In
principle this would not entail fiscal losses if there is a consequent compensation with FS resources.
However, in practice, the FS has never been accumulated in a separate escrow account, so it is very
difficult to know, at any point in time, the “balance” of the FS.
Revenue loses. The current non-automatic system is prone to causing revenue losses due to the
pressure not to adjust prices at different points in time depending of the evolution of international
fuel prices.

4

Take for example a situation in which import prices have been increasing continuously and the government has
decided, in each period, to keep retail prices unchanged (depleting gradually resources from the FS). When facing a
new rise in import prices, and bearing in mind the limited balance in the FS, the government would need to decide
whether to translate the entire increase to retail prices (full pass-through, i.e. stop withdrawing resources from the
FS); translate some of the increase to retail price (incomplete pass-through, withdrawing some resources from the
FS); or keep retail prices unchanged (zero pass-though, heavily withdrawing resources from the FS). Sooner or later
the government will be faced with a situation in which import prices keep increasing and the FS is exhausted. At that
time it might be forced to pass a large increase to retail prices to catch up with the price that would have prevailed in
the absence of a FS mechanism.

II. REVISITING BURUNDI’S FUEL PRICE SMOOTHING MECHANISM
A. Motivation for an Automatic Fuel Pricing Mechanisms
Why adopt an automatic fuel price mechanism? An automatic mechanism is intended to
guarantee full pass-through of international prices to domestic prices, which in turn ensures that
consumers face the true opportunity cost of fuel. It also avoids subsidies which might lead to:
inefficiently high levels of consumption; distortive taxation to finance them; high volatility of tax
revenue (affecting, in turn, priority public spending).
Why add a price smoothing component? The adoption of an automatic fuel price mechanism that
encompasses an automatic price smoothing mechanism can ensure full pass-through over the
medium term while also avoiding sharp price increases. Tax revenue volatility would not necessarily
be higher than under the irregular adjustments that prevail when the government follows a “waitand-see” approach (see section II.B).
A range of automatic price smoothing mechanisms is available. Within the class of automatic
mechanisms, a recent FAD technical note draws attention on 2 groups of them: price band and
moving average mechanisms:
-

Price band mechanisms (PB): This approach sets a maximum limit on the magnitude of retail
price changes, in both directions. Caps can be set as a proportion of the current retail price or in
absolute amounts (although absolute caps can become less effective as international prices
increase). Under price caps, at the start of each period (e.g., month) the retail price according to
the full pass-through mechanism is determined based on last month’s average import cost. If
the required retail price increase is above the maximum allowed increase (i.e., the cap), then the
maximum allowed increase is implemented and net taxes adjusted accordingly. If the implied
price increase is below this threshold, then the full adjustment is allowed. The same logic applies
for downward adjustments.

-

Moving average mechanisms (MA): This approach bases retail price adjustments on changes in
the average of past import costs: At the start of the period (e.g. month) the retail price under the
formula is calculated using an average of past import costs (say, the average of import costs for
the last three months). Retail prices are then allowed to fully adjust to the smoothed formula
import price. The difference with the retail prices that would have prevailed under full passthough is absorbed by net taxes.

B. Adopting an Automatic Price Smoothing Mechanism in Burundi
Adopting an automatic mechanism would imply:
i.

fluctuations in tax revenue in the short-term—though in an automatic and transparent
way—but no fiscal loss over the medium-term;

ii.

a delayed pass-through but in an automatic way, avoiding the costs and political pressure
faced when the adjustment is decided in an ad hoc way.

In practical terms, substituting the FS with an automatic price smoothing mechanism would only
entail adjusting “net taxes” (grouping custom duties, excise tax and VAT together with the actual
contribution to the FS) every month in an automatic way as prescribed by the rules of the
smoothing mechanism.
How would have an automatic price smoothing mechanism worked for Burundi? Based on
simulations under alternative MA and PB mechanisms (plotted in Figure 1) and indicators of their
variability, performance under PBs and MAs are compared to the current system using the FS
(denoted HIST in Tables and Figures) and to the one that would have prevailed if a full pass-through
mechanism had been in place (labeled FPT).5 Table 1 reports the volatility results for retail prices and
for tax revenue.6 Table 2 presents results for tax levels, and Table 3 presents an overall ranking,
taking into account the performance in terms of minimizing tax and price volatility while
safeguarding tax revenue.
The current system (HIST) is ranked as the worst mechanism in terms of the standard deviation of
prices and of the largest single monthly price increase indicators (Table 1). The highest rankings
belong to the MAs with wide windows (6 and 4 months) and the PB with a narrow band (3 percent).7

5

The price and tax series shown in Figure 2, and used for the indicators in Tables 1-4, correspond to a “basket” fuel
taking into account the average consumption of gasoline, diesel and kerosene. The data available for this exercise is
from January 2009 to August 2011. As Figure 1 shows, this period is characterized by an upward trend in
international prices, which conditions the results of this analysis. An extended dataset with complete cycles in
international prices would have been preferred.
6

PB3, PB5 and PB10 denote 3 percent, 5 percent and 10 percent price band mechanisms. MA2, MA4 and MA6 refer
to moving average mechanisms using import prices from the last 2, 4 and 6 months respectively.

7

As a reference, note that a PB3 for Burundi would currently imply a maximum price increase or decrease of about
60 Fbu.

Regarding tax levels, Table 2 reveals that, in the sample considered, any of the PB or MA
mechanisms would have performed better than the current FS scheme (labeled HIST in the Table).
Indeed, fiscal loses under the current system seem to have been sizeable (see Appendix A).
Furthermore, for the sample considered, a price band mechanism would have performed best in
terms of safeguarding tax revenue in Burundi, as they imply only a temporary gap between the price
under the formula and the one that would prevail under full pass-though.

APPENDIX A
We computed actual and theoretical net tax series since January 2010 (see Figure below). Net taxes
include excise taxes, VAT and contributions to the funds (both FS and strategic fund). The
“theoretical” level of net taxes is the one that would have prevailed if the excise taxes were at their
original levels (246.41, 234.85 and 54.7 BIF per liter of gasoline, diesel and kerosene respectively)
and the FS and the strategic fund did not exist (i.e. their contributions were set to zero). The actual
net tax series is the actual revenue from excise taxes, contributions to the funds and VAT. The fiscal
loss plotted is the product of the unitary (i.e. per liter) fiscal loss, that is, the difference between
actual and theoretical net taxes, times the actual volumes imported. We use the price formula for
each month and actual imported quantities up to July 2011 (for August and September we assumed
imports are equal to the average in May-July 2011).1
The Figure below reveals that the gap between the actual and theoretical net tax has widened
significantly in the recent conjuncture for gasoline and diesel, but not for kerosene. While the actual
net tax for kerosene decreased in May, when the subsidy was implemented, this was reversed in the
following months: in August 2011 the only fuel that was paying the theoretical level of excise tax
was kerosene. Instead, the net subsidy per liter of gasoline and diesel has kept increasing up to
September.
We also estimate the cost of the current fuel subsidy policy Burundi introduced in May 2011 (see
Table below). We consider that a subsidy has been in place only since May 2011 onwards since it is
argued that, before then, the cumulated contributions to the funds (both the FS and the strategic
fund) were above the revenues losses (due to lower excise taxes). However, the fund(s) are assumed
to have been depleted by May 2011. We use the price formula for each month and actual imported
quantities in May-July.

Along this section we are using the price formula for “Depot Bujumbura” for all quantities imported. Although the

The cumulated revenue losses up to September are estimated at almost 4 billion BIF. The bulk of the
subsidy cost, almost ¾, has benefited diesel consumption, while less than 1 percent of the subsidy
went to kerosene consumption in this period. The revenue loss for 2011 is 10.6 billion BIF (0.36 percent of GDP). To summarize, total costs of subsidies per year, are about 1/3 of a percent of GDP.

ANNEX III. BURUNDI: EXCHANGE RATE ASSESSMENT1
A. Recent Developments
After a long period of stability, the Burundian Franc demonstrated greater flexibility in 2011.
It depreciated by about 12 percent against the US dollar in the course of 2011, leading the IMF to
reclassify the country’s exchange rate regime from ‘pegged’ to ‘other managed’. Faced with higher
imported inflation, the effective
exchange rate (NEER) depreciated by

and the higher costs of fuel-related imports.
Burundi, like other members of the East African Community (EAC) faced a common shock but
reacted much slower in allowing the currency to depreciate. In the first three quarters of 2011,
food inflation rose to peaks of 26 percent in Kenya, boosted by local food shortages in the wake of
the drought. Burundi, Tanzania, and Uganda saw food inflation rise to 20 percent, 22.5 percent, and
46 percent, respectively. In addition to food, higher transportation costs associated with rising
global oil prices had a particularly important impact on consumer prices in landlocked Burundi and
Uganda, while power tariffs were hiked sharply in Tanzania. The increase in the region’s nominal
exchange rates against the dollar also fueled the inflationary process. Against the US dollar, local
currencies depreciated in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania by 11 percent, 10 percent, and 16 percent,
respectively, in the first three quarters of the year (Figure 2), before starting to appreciate following

the tightening of the monetary stance. The recent 12 percent depreciation of the Burundian franc is
thus in line with regional trends.

Beginning in September 2011, the authorities stepped in more firmly to curb potential
second-round effects of high inflation. Lower-than-expected aid inflows also brought pressure to
bear on the currency in concert with the persistence of the food and fuel shock. In response to these
developments, the authorities raised policy rates by an additional 331 basis points (bps) since July
2011 (Figure 2), compared to Kenya (1175 points), Tanzania (442 points), Uganda (1000 points), and
Rwanda (100 points).

Burundi’s current account deficit improved somewhat since the end of the civil war, but
remains in deep negative territory. Burundi’s current account excluding grants, stabilized
following the 2005 peace agreement, but the country still remains highly dependent on foreign aid
flows. The current account deficit, excluding grants, averaged about 20 percent of GDP since 2000.
Despite a significant improvement in the terms of trade since 2000, the trade deficit averaged
24 percent of GDP owing in part to Burundi’s narrow export base and rising imports as aid was
spent and absorbed. The capital and financial account benefitted from one time debt relief in 2009
worth about US$ 1 billion.
Burundi’s trade openness increased as aid inflows were spent and absorbed. Openness
measures by exports and imports to GDP rose from 24 percent in 2000 to 51 percent at end-2011.
Coffee prices and export volumes rose threefold over the period. Imports also rose sharply in value,
mainly through the absorption of official aid flows. During the post conflict period, official transfers,
grew four fold since 2000, before declining during the latter part of the decade. Remittances also
increased substantially after the conflict, and represent a third of current transfers.

B. Exchange Rate Assessment
Data shortcomings in Burundi limit the effectiveness of typical CGER methodologies. The
external competitiveness assessment of some low income countries may require the use of non
traditional methods to assess the level of the REER. Given data shortcomings in Burundi, two
approaches were used; (i) econometric, using real coffee prices to estimate the equilibrium exchange
rate (EREER); and (ii) an assessment of Burundi’s relative productivity to that of its trading partners,
based on a trade weighted relative productivity index.
Following Cashin et al. (2004) commodity currency methodology, the REER was regressed on
real coffee prices3. This was predicated on coffee accounting for 85 percent of exports and because
of the lack of a long time series on other
macroeconomic fundamentals. One

These results should be interpreted with caution. These imply that the Burundi Franc should
appreciate to close the gap between the REER and its equilibrium level (EREER) which would likely
worsen Burundi’s competitiveness. Notwithstanding, the projected deterioration in the terms of
trade by 18 percent in 2012 would help to close this gap by lowering the level of the EREER. The
large role played by aid inflows in financing both the current account and fiscal deficits contributed
to the strengthening of the currency over time.

C. Conclusion
Assessing the potential misalignment of a currency is challenging in a low-income fragile
state such as Burundi. While the commodity currency model suggests a slight undervaluation, this
result should be taken with caution. Other indicators suggest that Burundi needs to improve its
competitiveness while the development of a productive private sector remains a challenge given the
many obstacles of the current business environment. Limited access to electricity and frequent
outages further stymie productivity.

APPENDIX I: LETTER OF INTENT
Bujumbura, July 9, 2012

Madame Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431

Dear Madame Lagarde:
1.

On January 27, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)

approved a new three-year arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) in favor of the
Republic of Burundi. This arrangement is intended to support our medium-term program and to
strengthen macroeconomic stability, expedite growth, and reduce poverty. Under this arrangement,
the Burundi government recently discussed the first program review with an IMF mission. This
review focused on program implementation from December 1, 2011 to March 31, 2012, as well as
on the outlook and the economic and financial measures to be implemented in 2012.
2.

Since the beginning of the year, Burundi has been confronted with an unfavorable

international economic environment, characterized by declining budgetary assistance and rising
food and oil prices. Our forecasts suggest that these trends will have adverse effects on economic
growth, balance of payments, and budget execution in 2012. To mitigate the impact of this crisis on
the cost of living for vulnerable population groups, the government has implemented tax relief
measures on food and petroleum products whose fiscal effects will be partly offset by higher taxes
on alcoholic beverages, telephone communications, second-hand cars, along with a substantial
reduction in domestically funded expenditures. These measures were incorporated into a
supplementary budget that was submitted to parliament.
3.

These shocks notwithstanding, program implementation at end-March 2012 was satisfactory

overall. All performance criteria and indicative targets were observed. In addition, the government
intends to press ahead with the program in pursuit of the objectives of fiscal and debt sustainability,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

51

BURUNDI

and to strengthen the economic growth outlook for Burundi in the medium term. In particular, the
government intends to tighten short-term fiscal and monetary policies in an effort to curb
inflationary pressures, while safeguarding pro-poor expenditure. The government also stands ready
to adopt any additional measures that may be required for this purpose. The government will
consult with the IMF in advance of the adoption of such measures and/or of revisions to the policies
contained in the MEFP, in accordance with the IMF’s policies on such consultations.
4.

With regard to the structural reforms, in spite of being delayed in the implementation of

reforms, the Government is determined to adopt the decree of budget governance and to recruit an
international auditor to reinforce the safeguards at the central bank and the ministry of finance by
mid-July 2012. Because of this delay, the audit report will be made available at the end of
September 2012.
5.

The PRSP-II aims to achieve strong and sustained growth based on transformation of the

economy financed through the mobilization of domestic resources and grants. In the event that
grants are lower than expected, the government will undertake appropriate measures to realign the
macroeconomic framework with available resources.
6.

The government will provide the IMF with such information as it may request to ensure

implementation of the program. That information as well as arrangements for monitoring
implementation of the program and the performance criteria, quantitative targets, and structural
benchmarks are detailed in the Technical Memorandum of Understanding, which is also attached to
this letter.
7.

In light of the appreciable progress in implementing the program supported by the ECF

FINANCIAL POLICIES, 2011-14

INTRODUCTION

Burundi’s economic and financial program, supported by the International Monetary Fund

(IMF) under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF), aims to consolidate economic and political gains,
promote inclusive economic growth, contain inflation, and strengthen policies designed to combat
endemic poverty in rural and urban areas. This Memorandum supplements the December 2011
version. It reports on quantitative implementation at end-March 2012, structural benchmarks
through end-June 2012 and defines the economic policies and reforms the government intends to
implement in 2012 to achieve the objectives of its economic and financial program. The program
measures and objectives are consistent with the Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy Paper
(PRSP-II).
2

Despite remarkable progress, Burundi remains a fragile state. It still needs technical and

financial support from the U.N. and other bilateral agencies to complete the transformation of its
economy and strengthen its political institutions. In the interest of creating a calm social and
political environment, dialogue is the government’s preferred method of managing conflicts. It was
in this context that the government, acceding to civil society’s demand to eliminate taxes on food,
forestalled a strike protesting the high cost of living.

II.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ECONOMIC AND
FINANCIAL PROGRAM IN 2011/EARLY 2012

A.
3.

Recent Economic Developments and Outlook for End-2011and March 2012

Economic activity improved slightly to 4.2 percent in 2011, falling a little short of the

initial projections. This growth reflected the expansion of services and major foreign investments in
the secondary sector. Agricultural output, however, was much weaker than expected owing to the
cyclical decline in coffee production and a decrease in food production caused by bad weather.
Inflationary pressures mounted, with the rate of inflation rising to 25 percent at end-March 2012,
compared to 15 percent at end-December 2011. Prices rose sharply in response to the relatively
high prices of foodstuffs on the international market and a drop in agricultural output of

54

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURUNDI

approximately 30 percent in the first quarter of 2012. The government’s decision to raise electricity
and water rates also stoked inflation.
4.

The current account (including transfers) widened further to 12.3 percent of GDP in 2011.

Terms of trade deterioration and delays in budgetary assistance disbursements largely explain this
unfavorable development. Gross official reserves contracted sharply, to a level equivalent to
4 months of imports in 2012.
5.

The monetary survey at end-December 2011 reveals a sharp decrease in net foreign assets

of roughly 12.3 percent of the beginning period money supply, a substantial increase in credit to the
economy, and money supply growth of 6.1 percent. The decrease in net foreign assets is attributable
to delays in the disbursement of budgetary assistance and the decision of the monetary authorities
to stabilize the Burundian franc by selling larger amounts of foreign exchange on the exchange
market. Rising oil and food prices also contributed to the decline in net foreign assets. Overall in
2012, credit to the economy will remain moderate at 23 percent owing to the tightening of
monetary policy to curb inflationary pressures. Furthermore, with a view to mitigating the effects of
external shocks on domestic production, the country’s foreign exchange policy has become more
flexible. The daily reference exchange rate is now determined using the weighted average of the
rates applied by commercial banks to the previous day’s purchases and sales of foreign exchange.
Foreign exchange auctions are held twice a week, with foreign exchange allocated at the rates
proposed by banks.
6.

On the fiscal front, the mobilization of domestic funds improved, as projected, and

expenditure was kept within the program envelope. The overall deficit, however, was larger than
anticipated owing to the delay in budgetary assistance disbursements in 2011. At end-December
2011, the overall budget deficit (cash basis, non-HIPC grants included) was approximately 4 percent
of GDP, well above the target of 2.5 percent. Domestic revenue amounted to 15.4 percent of GDP
thanks to the revenue mobilization efforts of the Burundi Revenue Authority (BRA). Total spending
fell short of projections by about 0.4 percentage points of GDP as a result of a decrease of FBu 5
billion in transfer expenditures. However, pro-poor spending of roughly FBu 372.6 billion was
broadly in line with the budgetary objectives and helped mitigate the negative effects of energy and
food crisis on vulnerable populations.
7.

At 8.7 percent of GDP in 2011, the wage bill exceeded projections by nearly FBu 1.6 billion,

or 0.05 percent of GDP, owing to the hiring of more personnel in the health and education sectors
than planned. The reason for this overage is that careers and payroll are managed by the Ministry of
the Civil Service, although they could be brought under control if payroll management
responsibilities were transferred to the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development Planning.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

55

BURUNDI

8.

At end-May 2012, revenues were lower than expected owing to the granting of exemptions

and lower collections on excise taxes (by about 0.5 percent of GDP). To counter the high cost of
living, the government provided tax relief by eliminating customs duties, VAT, and administrative
charges on 13 food products. This tax exemption applies to both local and imported products. For
2012, the amount of forgone revenue associated with this decision is estimated at FBu 10 billion, or
0.3 percent of GDP. Similarly, because of rising international oil prices, the government waived
excise taxes on oil products to offset soaring retail prices and their effect on inflation. At endDecember 2012, the loss of revenue caused by this subsidy is projected at FBu 23 billion.
Nevertheless, corrective measures are envisaged to address the slippages.
9.

Program implementation is satisfactory overall. The indicative targets for end-December

2011 were met but for that on pro-poor spending that was missed by a small margin. At end-March
2012, the quantitative performance criteria were met, as well as all the indicative criteria.

III.
10.

IMPLEMENTATION OF STRUCTURAL MEASURES

Regarding public financial management (PFM), the government recently concluded the

implementation of an initial public financial management strategy (PFMS-1), as well as a 2009-11
action plan. Early assessments indicate that substantial progress has been made on several aspects
of PFM, particularly modernization of the legal and institutional framework of PFM and budget
programming and preparation. As a result, significant gains were achieved in the areas of budget
credibility, supervision, cash management, and government accounting. Building on this progress, a
new strategy for 2012-14, aimed at consolidating gains, will be developed in collaboration with our
technical and financial partners. With regard to revenue collection, the government is continuing its
efforts to have a lasting impact on revenue. In addition to its campaign to raise taxpayer awareness,
the government has simplified customs clearance procedures and created a one stop border post
with Tanzania to facilitate the movement of goods across that border, which is the point of entry for
a large portion of our foreign trade.
11.

On the monetary front, following the technical training provided to pilot commercial banks,

the central bank launched repo operations (April 2011), the development of which was impeded by
the decrease in bank liquidity in the last six months. As part of the financial sector reform, the
central bank plans to strengthen the financial infrastructure by computerizing its activities and
modernizing its payment system (RTGS and electronic clearing). Competitive bidding for
modernization of the computing room has ended; the three firms selected have already submitted
their proposals, which are being analyzed. Preparations for the implementation of a modern
payment system are under way and the Draft Law Establishing the National Payment System has
56

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURUNDI

been completed and forwarded to the Council of Ministers for adoption. The strategic and
conceptual study on electronic money has been completed and the legal frameworks for e-money
and mobile banking are being prepared. Studies on the establishment of a complete clearing and
settlement infrastructure have also been concluded and the respective systems will be put in place
before a unit responsible for payment systems operation and oversight is established. The financial
market development plan was finalized in March 2012 and submitted for review by the Council of
Ministers.
12.

In the field of banking supervision, business continuity directives have been issued to the

banking sector and a detailed manual and a draft circular on risk-based supervision will be prepared
with Central AFRITAC technical assistance. In addition, the banking supervision service was
restructured to include the function of financial stability assessment. The central bank strengthened
its internal control and risk management system with the establishment of an Audit Committee and
a revised audit charter conforming to international standards. A risk-based approach was also
adopted. To ensure that the regulatory framework favors the development of microfinance
institutions, a revised draft decree regulating the microfinance sector is nearing completion and is
currently being analyzed by the Bank’s management. With regard to banking supervision, a new
draft banking law was prepared with IMF technical assistance and the commercial banks will migrate
to the IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) by end-2013. A new commercial bank,
Kenya Commercial Bank, has opened a branch in Burundi.
13.

In the coffee sector, the government successfully resumed its washing stations privatization

program, with 28 stations sold to Burundian private investors, and made certain that coffee growers
received their reserved share in keeping with the government’s commitment (25 percent of the
capital). A new invitation to bid will be issued for the remaining 76 washing stations no later than
end-2012. The government recognizes the preponderant role that the private sector should play in
the coffee sector, as part of its strategy to boost production and minimize the cyclical effects of
coffee production.
14.

With respect to governance, the government has made substantial progress in

implementing the national good governance and anti-corruption strategy. The outcome in the
INTERPETROL case was a Supreme Court ruling in INTERPETROL’s favor. The first review of
implementation of the good governance strategy revealed that effective implementation would
require the establishment of a technical secretariat.
15.

The government has made strides in improving the business climate to attract investment.

The reforms carried out had a direct impact on four indicators: (i) business start-ups; (ii) the issuance

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

57

BURUNDI

of building permits; (iii) property transfers; and (iv) the protection of investors. These reforms helped
improve Burundi’s ranking, making it one of the ten best reforming countries in the world.

IV.
16.

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND POLICIES FOR 2012

The economic and financial program for 2012 is consistent with the three-year ECF-

supported economic program. It aims to consolidate gains, particularly with respect to
macroeconomic stability and strong, sustained economic growth. However, because of persistent oil
and food price shocks and the decline in donor support, which add to the uncertainty of the shortand medium-term economic outlook, the macroeconomic framework for 2012 has been revised as
follows: (i) economic growth is expected to level off at 4.2 percent, which is below our initial
forecasts; (ii) inflation at end-2012 is estimated at 14.7 percent thanks to a more restrictive monetary
policy, increased food production, and a decrease in international oil and food prices; and (iii) official
reserves are expected to stabilize at 3.8 months of imports. Moreover, in response to the impact of
external shocks on the budget, the government will continue its fiscal consolidation efforts and take
steps to expand the tax base and implement a fiscal policy designed to control expenditure.
17.

Since the start of the year, the national and international economic context has profoundly

affected execution of the 2012 budget. Because of the persistence of relatively high food and oil
prices, the government implemented tax relief measures aimed at easing social tensions. The
elimination of taxes on food led to a drop in revenue estimated at FBu 10 billion. Moreover, oilrelated revenues are expected to shrink by approximately FBu 23 billion, owing to the reduction of
excise taxes on oil products in conjunction with the rise in international oil prices and partial pass
through to domestic fuel prices. Expenditure projections point to an overrun of about FBu 18 billion,
essentially reflecting the increase in the wage bill, attributable to the lack of control over hiring and
the payment of wage arrears and other outlays in the health sector.

18.

The government plans to boost revenue collection and to control expenditure in order to

close the financing gap caused by expenditure overruns and the elimination of taxes. Consequently,
the government adopted the following new tax measures in the context of revising the 2012 Budget
Law: (i) replacement of the existing ad valorem tax on beer with an excise tax expressed in terms of
hectoliters of beer sold (FBu 30,000/Hl); (ii) institution of a 10 percent tax on telephone
communications; (iii) increase of the VAT levied on alcoholic beverages (other than beer) from
50 percent to 70 percent; (iv) implementation of a new assessment system for the tax on used
vehicles (v) increase of excise taxes on tobacco products; and (vi) a 10 percent income tax rate
58

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURUNDI

applied to wages of high government official. These measures would generate approximately FBu
26.9 billion and boost tax revenue to FBu 501.2 billion, or 14.1 of GDP.
19.

The government is also committed to taking corrective measures on expenditure.

Consequently, current expenditure will decrease by 0.5 percent of GDP. Cuts will be mainly in
domestically financed capital spending and the wage bill will be contained at 8.1 percent of GDP,
with hiring in the health and education sectors remaining a priority. Self-financed capital
expenditure is also projected to decrease by FBu 18.4 billion, or 0.5 percent of GDP.
20.

These efforts will bring the projected budget deficit into line with the program objectives.

The overall 2012 budget deficit (including grants) is estimated at 2.7 of GDP. The financing gap will
be covered by domestic borrowing without any risk to debt sustainability. All these changes will be
included in a supplementary budget.

21.

The Government will continue the reinforcement of safeguards. In this respect, it will ensure

that the recruitment of the international auditor takes place before mid-July 2012 to (i) supervise the
full execution of all the recommendations made in the report GPO Deloitte 2011; (ii) control on a
test basis significant domestic disbursements and transfers on behalf of the Government or in that
of its creditors who took place during the period going from July 2011 to March 2012, and
(iii) evaluate the state of execution of the new decree on the management of public expenditure,
which replaces the General Payment of Public accounts (RGCP) regulation of 1964. The final audit
report will be made available by end-September 2012. The delay observed in the recruitment of the
auditor is partly attributable to the need for taking into account the suggestions of the March 2012
IMF safeguards assessment mission which help developing terms of reference for the audit.

V.
22.

PROMOTION OF GOOD GOVERNANCE

In the health sector, the government will continue the policy of providing free healthcare for

children under 5 years of age and covering the costs of childbirth. Additional infrastructure
investments are planned to meet the growing demand for health services. The government will
continue to give priority to the hiring of medical personnel in a context of wage bill stabilization.
These measures will contribute to higher quality medical care.
23.

In the education sector, the government also intends to continue the program of free

primary school tuition and will expand it to include higher education. It plans to build new
classrooms and hire teachers in order to reduce the teacher-student ratio.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

59

BURUNDI

24.

In the agricultural sector, the government, in close collaboration with donors, plans to

combat the high cost of living and eliminate food insecurity. Accordingly, the government will
implement the National Agricultural and Livestock Investment Plan, the priorities of which are as
follows: (i) sustainable growth of production and food security; (ii) professionalization of producers
and promotion of innovation; (iii) development of industries and agribusiness, including livestock
and fishery activities; and (iv) institution building.
A.

25.

Structural reforms

Public financial management reform remains at the center of the government’s economic

reform policy. Accordingly, texts implementing the decree setting out the general regulation on
government budget management will be issued in the coming months, thanks to the technical
assistance provided by our development partners. For example, the decree on fiscal governance was
reviewed by the Council of Ministers and will be adopted by mid July 2012 after ensuring that the
observations of the Council of Ministers are reflected the final text. The assignment of expenditure
commitment auditors to two pilot ministries will occur shortly thereafter. The decree on the
appointment and legal status of the revenue office’s receiver general was examined by the Council
of Ministers. This decree defines the function of the OBR receiver general and determines the scope
of his authority and his relations with the senior government accountant. The OBR commissionergeneral also fulfills the functions the Office’s receiver general.

The implementation of a new

organizational chart is also planned for the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development Planning
(MFPDE), the broad outlines of which were discussed with the IMF. The purpose of the
reorganization of the MFPDE is to provide the ministry with the procedures and tools necessary to
successfully implement the new fiscal, financial, and accounting regulatory framework adopted in
application of the organic law on government finance. In addition, to consolidate the gains achieved
in the area of public financial management as a result of implementation of the first public financial
management strategy (PFMS-1), as well as the 2009-11 action plan, the government intends to
formulate a new public financial management strategy based on the results of the PEFA (Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability) assessment. This new strategy is aimed at increasing the
effectiveness of the basic functions of public financial management, in particular by finalizing a
consistent legal and institutional framework for public financial management, efficiently mobilizing
domestic and external resources, and enhancing the efficiency, accuracy, and transparency of the
processes of preparing and executing the government budget.
26.

Debt sustainability remains one of the top priorities of the program, given the small range of

Burundi’s exports and its limited repayment capacity. The Debt Management Performance
Assessment (DEMPA) recently carried out by the World Bank revealed that the structure of our debt,
60

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURUNDI

while sustainable, remains vulnerable to exogenous shocks. The risk of over indebtedness is high.
Consequently, in financing economic development, the government will only seek grants or highly
concessional loans having a grant element of at least 50 percent. A World Bank (DEMPA) mission is
also planned to develop an action plan aimed at (i) improving the legal framework governing the
issuance of guarantees and onlending; (ii) strengthening the debt management structure; and
(iii) building capacity for the analysis of cost indicators and basic debt risks. With a view to
improving debt management, a program to build debt management capacity is being carried out by
UNCTAD with financing from the European Union. The program also includes the development and
installation of a new version of the SYGADE software (6.0,) an update of the debt database, and the
publication of a debt statistics bulletin beginning in July 2012.
27.

As part of the financial sector reform, the Ministry of Finance, in collaboration with the

central bank, plans to establish a unit to coordinate and monitor the reform strategy and the action
plan. The responsibilities of this unit will be to: (i) monitor and assess implementation of the strategy
and the action plan, by preparing, in advance, performance indicators and measures for verifying
results; (ii) serve as the interface between the institutional actors in the sector and as liaison with
donors; (iii) assist the authorities in seeking financing and mobilizing resources; (iv) carry out an
information and awareness campaign to ensure coverage of the reforms in the media and other
publications. The unit will be supervised by a steering committee, which will be responsible, inter
alia, for crafting broad guidelines for the conduct of the strategy and for implementation of the
payment system computerization projects.
28.

To facilitate expanded access to formal financial services by the poor, a national survey on

financial inclusion is under way. It will help the central bank better understand the demand for
financial services, gauge the degree of satisfaction of the public, develop strategies to expand access
to financial services geared to the various needs of the poor and increase the use and quality of
such services.
29.

In the energy sector, the government plans to pursue its policy aimed at supplying more of

the country with electricity and improving the financial position of REGIDESO (public utility
Company). The government intends to promote private sector participation in the power generation
and distribution sector within the framework of a public-private partnership. Consequently, in the
next four years, the government plans to increase power generation capacity by 157 MW with the
implementation of subregional hydroelectric dam projects such as Rusumo Falls (60MW) and Ruzizi
(48.3MW) and domestic investments such as Kabu 16. These hyrdroelectric plants will be
constructed through the European Development Fund, the World Bank, and Exim Bank of India.
REGIDESO’s financial position was significantly improved by the raising of electricity and water rates

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

61

and the collection of large consumers’ bills thanks to the introduction of a prepayment system,
which will be expanded with a view to solidifying the improvement in REGIDESO’s finances.

POVERTY REDUCTION AND GROWTH STRATEGY PAPER

The Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy Paper (PRSP-II) was adopted by the

government in December 2011 and forwarded to the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund following intensive participatory consultations including representatives of the government,
grassroots communities, donors, civil society, the private sector, and Parliament. The strategy was
officially launched by the President of the Republic on February 9, 2012. To increase awareness
among its development partners, government delegations visited several capitals and headquarters
of international institutions. The priority action plan for implementation of the PRSP-II is being
finalized, while the government, in concert with its development partners, is in the process of
preparing a donor conference, scheduled for October 2012.
31.

The PRSP-II, which is a key component of the effort to consolidate peace and kick-start

economic growth, is structured around four strategic pillars:


Strengthening of the rule of law, consolidation of good governance, and
promotion of gender equality;



Transformation of the Burundian economy to achieve sustained, job-creating
growth;



Improvement in the accessibility and quality of basic services and strengthening
of national solidarity; and



Management of land and the environment in harmony with sustainable
development principles.

32.

The PRSP-II aims to promote strong economic growth which is anchored on a

transformation of the economy, for which the financing would come from internal revenue and
grants. According to this scenario, growth would average 6.9 percent over 2012–15, without
comprising fiscal and debt sustainability. Conversely, the government stands ready to enact
measures that will tighten fiscal and monetary policies should budget support grants be lower than
expected. These measures will be taken in conjunction with the IMF.
33.

With a view to strengthening the ownership and accountability of all stakeholders, meetings

to disseminate the contents of the PRSP-II will be held throughout the country, beginning in July.
The development of a communications strategy will be an integral part of that stage, to better
prepare for the involvement of all participants in the preparatory phase of the first review of PRSP-II
implementation.
62

Improvement of statistics

To lay the foundations of an effective system for monitoring socioeconomic progress in

Burundi, the government will pursue efforts to improve the statistical system by strengthening the
units in charge of collecting data for the regular production of high quality economic and financial
data.
35.

To strengthen the statistical services of the sectoral ministries, a draft decree on the creation,

organization, and composition of the central ministries’ statistical services will be submitted to the
Council of Ministers for adoption in the latter half of 2012. To make up for the gaps in statistical
data, the ISTEEBU plans shortly to begin conducting surveys on (i) the living conditions of Burundian
households; (ii) the work force in Burundi; and (iii) malaria indicators in Burundi. The household
survey on living conditions will also serve as the basis for redefining the CPI basket. To this end, the
government will request IMF technical assistance to help strengthen its statistical capacity.

VII.
36.

PROGRAM MONITORING

Quarterly monitoring of the program by the IMF Executive Board will continue, based on the

quantitative monitoring indicators and structural benchmarks described in Tables I.1 and I.2. These
indicators are defined in the attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU). The
semiannual reviews will be based on the data at end-March and end-September. The second
program review will be based on the performance criteria for end-September. To ensure the success
of the program, the authorities will take all steps necessary to achieve the quantitative targets and
structural benchmarks agreed with IMF staff.

ATTACHMENT II. TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF
UNDERSTANDING
Bujumbura, July 9, 2012
1. This technical memorandum of understanding covers the agreements on monitoring
implementation of the program supported by the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) Arrangement. It
sets out the definitions of program variables to monitor implementation of the program and the
reporting requirements for the government of Burundi and the Bank of the Republic of Burundi
(BRB). It defines quantitative performance criteria, indicative targets, and applicable adjusters.

A. QUANTITATIVE PROGRAM TARGETS
Quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets
2. The quantitative performance criteria for the program as shown in the MEFP are as follows:



net foreign assets of the BRB (floor);



net domestic assets of the BRB (ceiling);



net domestic financing of the government (ceiling);



external payment arrears of the government (ceiling, continuous);



stock of short-term external debt (maturity of less than one year) of the government

(ceiling, continuous); and



new nonconcessional medium- and long-term external debt contracted or

guaranteed by the government or the BRB (ceiling, continuous).
3. The quantitative indicative targets for the program, shown in the MEFP, are as follows:



accumulation of domestic arrears (ceiling);



pro-poor spending (floor); and



reserve money (ceiling).

Definitions and measurement
4. The net foreign assets of the BRB are defined as the difference between (i) gross official reserves
(valued at market prices) and other claims; and (ii) foreign exchange liabilities to nonresident
entities (including the use of Fund resources, and liabilities arising from the use of any SDR

66

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURUNDI

allocation). The gross official reserves of the BRB are defined as those foreign assets that are
liquid and freely available to the BRB.
5. The net domestic assets of the BRB are defined as the difference between (i) reserve money,
comprising currency in circulation, reserves of commercial banks, and other deposits held at the
BRB; and (ii) net foreign assets of the BRB.

Adjuster for changes in the compulsory reserves coefficients
6. The ceiling on net domestic assets of the BRB will be adjusted symmetrically for any change in
the compulsory reserves coefficient applied to deposits in commercial banks by the amount of
the new coefficient minus that stipulated in the program, multiplied by bank deposits subject to
compulsory reserves. The rate stipulated in the program is currently 3 percent.
7. Net domestic financing of the government is defined as the change in (i) outstanding loans,
advances, and other credit to the government from the BRB and all of Burundi’s commercial
banks; (ii) plus the stock of all government securities held by the nonbank public denominated
in Burundi francs, including that held by nonresidents; (iii) less government deposits held in the
BRB or in Burundi’s commercial banks. The coverage of government is defined as central
government and any other special funds or operations that are part of the budgetary process or
have a direct impact on the government’s financial position.
8. The stock of external payment arrears of the government for program monitoring purposes is
defined as the end-of-period amount of external debt service due and not paid within the grace
period defined by a creditor, including contractual and late interest, for which a clearance
agreement is not in place or for which arrears are not rescheduable. For arrears to exist, a
creditor must claim payment of amounts due and not paid. Amounts in dispute are not
considered arrears. Arrears for which a clearance framework has been agreed with the creditor
or which are subject to rescheduling or restructuring are not considered arrears for program
monitoring purposes. Program arrears would include any debt service due under such
agreements that have not been paid.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Definition of debt
9. The program includes a ceiling on new nonconcessional external debt contracted or guaranteed
by the government or the BRB. For the purpose of this program, external debt is defined as all
debt contracted in a currency other than the Burundian Franc. This performance criterion applies
to the contracting or guaranteeing by the government, local governments, the BRB and
REGIDESO of new nonconcessional external debt (as specified below) with an original maturity
of one year or more, including commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not
been received (including leases). The coverage of government is defined as central government
and any other special funds or operations that are part of the budgetary process or have a direct
impact on the government’s financial position. Debt contracted by state-owned enterprises is
included in the overall ceiling, if guaranteed by the government.
10. For program purposes, the definition of debt is set out in Executive Board Decision No. 12274,
Point 9, as revised on August 31, 2009 (Decision No. 14416-(09/91)).
a) For the purpose of this guideline, the term “debt” will be understood to mean a current,
i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of
value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to
make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some
future point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities
incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as
follows:
(i) loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an
undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds,
debentures, commercial loans and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that
are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the
funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future
(such as repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements);
(ii) suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer
payments until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are
provided; and

68

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURUNDI

(iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the
right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the
total expected service life of the property, while the lessor retains the title to the property.
For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the
lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the agreement
excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair or maintenance of the property.
b) Under the definition of debt set out in point 9 (a) above, arrears, penalties, and judicially
awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual obligation
that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not
considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.
11. The grant element of debt is the difference between the present value (PV) of debt and its
nominal value, expressed as a percentage of the nominal value of the debt. The PV of debt at
the time of contracting is calculated by discounting the future stream of payments of debt
service due on this debt. The calculation of concessionality will take into account all aspects of
the loan agreement, including maturity, grace period, payment schedule, upfront commissions,
and management fees. For loans with a maturity of at least 15 years, the 10-year average
commercial interest reference rates (CIRRs) published by the OECD should be used as the
discount rate for assessing the level of concessionality, while the 6-month average CIRRs should
be used for loans with shorter maturities. To both the 10-year and the 6-month average CIRRs,
the following margins should be added: 0.75 percent for repayment periods of less than
15 years; 1 percent for 15–19 years; 1.15 percent for 20–29 years; and 1.25 percent for 30 years
or more. The performance criterion is defined to exclude rescheduling arrangements,
borrowings from the IMF and any Burundi franc-denominated treasury securities held by
nonresidents.
12. The stock of short-term external debt with a maturity of less than one year owed by the
government is to remain at zero under the program. The coverage of government is defined as
central government and any other special funds or operations that are part of the budgetary
process or have a direct impact on the government’s financial position. Normal import credits
are excluded from this ceiling. Loans with an initial maturity, as recorded in the original loan
agreement, of one year or more are considered medium-term or long-term loans. This
performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

69

BURUNDI

Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt, adopted August 24, 2000, but also to
commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received (including
leases). Excluded from this performance criterion are rescheduling arrangements, borrowing
from the IMF, and any Burundi franc-denominated treasury securities held by nonresidents. As
of September 2007, the stock of short-term debt outstanding was nil.
13. Consistent with the PRSP, the authorities’ definition of pro-poor spending is based on three
criteria: (i) social character of spending, based on the administrative classification of spending
(this includes “social services” spending and part of “general services” and “economic services”
spending if it has a social character component); (ii) consistency with one of the four PRSP
pillars; and (iii) pro-poor investment spending, financed by donors.
14. The accumulation of domestic arrears is measured by the accumulation of non-executed
payment orders older than 60 days.
External financial assistance adjustor
15. The program provides for adjusters to allow higher than expected external assistance to be
spent (with a cap) and shortfall of external assistance to be financed domestically (with a cap).
16. Any financing excess up to US$40 million will be spent on expenditure priorities defined in the
PRSP. The floor on the stock of net foreign assets of the BRB will be adjusted upward, and the
ceilings on the net domestic assets of the BRB and on net domestic financing to the government
will be adjusted downward to accommodate 100 percent of any financing excess above
US$40 million.
17. The floor on the stock of net foreign assets of the BRB will be adjusted downward, and the
ceilings on the net domestic assets of the BRB and on net domestic financing to the government
will be adjusted upward to accommodate a financing shortfall up to a maximum of
US$40 million. External financial assistance will be converted to Burundi francs using the
program-specified BIF/US$ exchange rate. The program exchange rate for end-June 2012 is
1408.2 and at end-September 2012 is 1416.4.
18. External financial assistance (measured in US$) is defined to include the following: (i) nonproject
loans and grants to the budget (including payments made through the multi-donor trust fund

70

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURUNDI

managed by the World Bank for current debt service to multilaterals); plus (ii) debt relief on
current maturities; minus (iii) any cash payments for external arrears clearance operations. Donor
disbursements into blocked accounts for the purpose of clearing arrears will not be considered
foreign assistance for program monitoring purposes.

B. PROVISION OF INFORMATION TO IMF STAFF
19. To facilitate the monitoring of program implementation, the authorities will prepare and forward
to the IMF African Department a monthly progress report on the program, within six weeks of
the end of each month, containing the following weekly data:


foreign exchange auction market (MESD) transactions;



the balance sheet of the BRB (weekly statement) (BRB Research Department).

20. The following monthly data, with a maximum lag of six weeks:


IX. Implementation of Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief (PCDR): Not Applicable
Decision point - point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country qualifies
for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to be committed.
Interim assistance - amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance committed at
the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional circumstances).
Completion point - point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance
committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income as
defined in footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the implementation of
pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).
X.

Exchange Arrangements
While the de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating, the de facto exchange rate
arrangement has been reclassified to other managed arrangement from stabilized
arrangement against the dollar, effective July 26, 2011, due to increased flexibility of the
Burundi franc. The US dollar is the intervention currency. On June 14th, 2012, the official
exchange rate was BIF 1412.04 to the US dollar. In 2003 the central bank eliminated most
remaining exchange restrictions on current international transactions and delegated
authority to commercial banks to approve standard transactions. In early 2004, the surrender
requirement was lowered to 50 percent and in early 2005 it was eliminated. The central bank
has admitted foreign exchange bureaus to the weekly auctions. Most external arrears to
bilateral and multilateral creditors were cleared by the end of 2005. In December 2006 the
government published a new foreign exchange regulation, the Foreign Exchange Regulation
of 2006 that liberalized access to foreign exchange for current transactions and removed
one multiple currency practice. In June 2010, the government replaced the Foreign Exchange
Regulation of 2006 with the Exchange Regulation of 2010. The new regulation became
operational in July 2010.
Burundi has availed itself of the transitional arrangements of Article XIV since it joined the
Fund in 1962 but no longer maintains any exchange restrictions or multiple currency
practices that relate to that article. It does have one multiple currency practice that is
inconsistent with Article VIII, Section 2(a): the exchange rate used for government

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

76

BURUNDI

transactions differ by more than 2 percent from market exchange rates. Burundi maintains
certain foreign exchange restrictions for security reasons and has notified the Fund of those
restrictions pursuant to Decision 144-(52/51). Burundi modified the 2010 foreign exchange
regulation on March 3, 2011. Consequently the two foreign exchange restrictions mentioned
in EBS/11/29 Sup. 1 relating to: (i) a tax clearance requirement for certain current
international transactions such as payments of moderate amounts for amortization of loans
or for depreciation of direct investments by nonresidents and (ii) the limitations on the
availability of foreign exchange for the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions based on noncompliance with obligations that are unrelated to
such transactions are no longer in place.

XI.

Article IV Consultation
In accordance with Decision No. 14747-(10/96), adopted September 28, 2010, Burundi is on
the 24-month Article IV cycle. The 2008 Article IV consultation was completed by the
Executive Board on July 23, 2010, (IMF Country Report No. 10/313), along with the fourth
review of the ECF arrangement.
In concluding the 2010 consultation, Executive Directors acknowledged the commendable
progress that Burundi made in implementing its first ECF-supported program in a difficult
post-conflict environment. They agreed that fiscal sustainability in the face of a heavy debt
burden will depend on broadening the revenue base and improving the composition of
spending while financing the budget though grants and highly concessional external
resources. Directors encouraged the authorities to continue their efforts to reform the
financial sector by improving banking supervision, and addressing weaknesses in the
banking system, notably concentration risk. Directors also saw the need to accelerate
structural reforms, especially in the coffee sector, and welcomed Burundi’s membership in
the East African Community.

RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
GROUP
(As of May 23, 2012)
Burundi has been a member of the African Development Bank (AfDB) Group since the group was
founded in 1964. AfDB grant and loan operations with the country were interrupted by the outbreak
of civil strife in 1993. On July 19, 2004, the AfDB Boards approved general policy guidelines to help
postconflict countries clear their arrears and created a facility, the PCCF, initially funded with about
SDR 100 million in AfDB funds, to provide financial assistance to qualifying countries. The policy
guidelines call for a three-way burden-sharing formula among the country, donors, and the PCCF.
On October 27, 2004, the AfDB Boards endorsed an arrears clearance proposal for Burundi whereby
the balance of arrears was settled with the help of donors and the PCCF before the decision point
for the enhanced HIPC Initiative.
On April 21, 2009, under the enhanced framework of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
Initiative, the Board of Directors of AfDB approved AfDB’s share of the HIPC debt relief in an amount
equivalent to USD 150,200,000 in Net Present Value (NPV) terms as of the end of 2004. The Board of
Directors also approved Burundi’s qualification for debt relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI), in an amount of US$ 15.38 million, (UA 10.48 million), in nominal terms.
In support of the Government’s economic and social program, the Board approved the Country
Strategy Paper (CSP) in October 2008. The CSP covers the period 2008 to 2011 and focuses on
2 pillars of the CSLP namely, (i) support to effective government by improving economic governance
and the functioning of key public sector institutions, and (ii) increase employment opportunities
through developing infrastructure and targeted interventions in the agricultural sector. The Country
Strategy Paper Mid-Term Review and Country Portfolio Review have been presented to CODE on
30th of November 2010 and confirmed the relevance of the pillars. The Bank Group intervenes
actively in infrastructure (transport, water and sanitation, and energy), agriculture, governance and
social sectors. The Bank ongoing portfolio comprises seven (7) national operations for a total UA
112.23 million. The road sector accounts for 58.9% of the portfolio, followed by the social sector
(17.7%). There are six (6) active multinational operations for UA 117.7 million, mostly in the road
sector (70.1%).The amount of 7 million UA for the fourth phase of Burundi’s “Programme d’Appui
aux Réformes Economiques” (PARE IV) has been fully disbursed in 2011.

The 2012-2016 CSP has been approved by the Board of Directors on January 11th, 2012. The CSP
proposed strategy emphasizes selectivity, with two complementary pillars, namely (i) strengthening
state institutions and (ii) infrastructure improvements in order to promote inclusive growth and
development. The selection of these pillars is consistent with the Bank’s comparative advantage in
the infrastructure sector, as well as its value-added in the area of support of reforms, good
governance and institutional capacity building. The Bank plans to support Burundi trough
infrastructure projects (mainly transport and energy); a two tranches GBS, namely PARE V,
amounting of UA 12 million for the period 2012-2013 and capacity building.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of June 26, 2012)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance. The
most serious shortcomings affect national accounts, government finance, and balance of
payments statistics. Insufficient funding, staffing shortages and lack of equipment, along with
coordination difficulties among responsible institutions, impede the timely production and
dissemination of macroeconomic statistics.
Real sector statistics: Serious deficiencies in real sector data compilation hamper economic
analysis and management. National accounts statistics are compiled infrequently by ISTEEBU, the
national statistical office. Source data on agriculture, the most important economic activity, is
inadequate. Consequently, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding estimates of the level
and the growth rate of GDP, components of expenditure, and all ratios to GDP. Annual national
accounts estimates provided to the Fund, are not compiled, but rather, are derived from a
macroeconomic projection model and certain base year estimates for 1998 and 2005. Since 2007,
ISTEEBU has started the process for improvement of national accounts statistics with the
assistance of AFRITAC. National accounts are now established on the basis of SNA 1993 (partially)
using ERETES software with 2005 as base year. Compilation of GDP estimates for the years 2007
and 2008 is nearly finalized. Data on non-financial corporations is also a major area of concern
for national accounts compilers. The monthly consumer price index features expenditure weights
derived from a dated 1991 household expenditure survey and covers only the capital city. The
CPI also has serious problems with the methodology used, including the lower-level formula,
treatment of missing prices, and the sample selection, all of which lead to an inaccurate
measurement of inflation. No producer price indices are compiled. Limited labor market statistics
are available, thus hampering surveillance.
Government finance statistics: Burundi has benefitted from technical assistance provided by
the World Bank and Fiscal Affairs Department in the areas of public financial management
information systems and public expenditure management, as well as Statistics Department (STA)
training in the compilation of government finance statistics. Nevertheless, government finance
statistics (GFS) continue to suffer from weaknesses in coverage, accuracy, consistency, and
timeliness. Burundi has accepted to participate in the GFS module under the Enhanced Data
Dissemination Initiative (EDDI) project for Africa funded by the United Kingdom Department for
International Development (DFID). The GFS module has as its main objective to improve the
quality and dissemination of fiscal statistics using the guidelines of the Government Finance
Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). The support under the module consists mostly of a series of
technical assistance missions over the next 3 to 5 years. The first mission took place in April 2011.
The second mission will take place later this year.
Monetary and financial statistics: The monetary and financial statistics are now compiled
following the recommended methodologies of the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual (2000), and are broadly adequate for both surveillance and harmonization with the

85

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURUNDI

monetary statistics of other East African Community member countries. Transactions with the
IMF are reflected incorrectly—the amount of loans received from IMF differs from the IMF
records, misrepresenting foreign liabilities of the central bank. STA informed the central bank of
the issue, the resolution of which is pending. Because of the current payment system, there are
differences between the central bank and other depository corporations (ODC)
records. Normally, transactions between the central bank and ODC show up in ODC balance
sheet with one-day lag that affects other items (net) (OIN) in the Depository Corporations survey.
The liabilities of three banks in liquidation are shown in the central bank balance sheet; however,
the information on these banks is not included in the summary of ODC data.
External sector statistics: Annual balance of payments and international investment position
statistics are compiled by the Banque de la République du Burundi (BRB) according to the fifth
edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). However, severe coverage and measurement
difficulties impart a high degree of uncertainty to external sector statistics and surveillance. For
example, there are significant unrecorded imports and exports (particularly coffee and tea) of
merchandise and services, and while adjustments are made, the uncertainty remains. For both
services and income, the accuracy of the source data is not routinely assessed against other data
sources. Similarly, measurement of capital and financial account transactions relies on Burundi’s
International Transaction Reporting System, which is known to have incomplete coverage.
Further actions are required to improve the accuracy and reliability of external sector data.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS) since August 2011.

No data ROSC is available.

III. Reporting to STA
Summary government finance transactions data are reported for publication in International
Finance Statistics (IFS). The BRB has completed migration to the Standardized Report Forms for
the submission of its monetary statistics to the Fund; detailed monetary statistics are published
in the IFS. Balance of payments and international investment position data are published in IFS
and in the Balance of Payments Yearbook.

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Burundi
On July 27, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Burundi.1
Background
Real GDP growth is estimated to have increased to 4.2 percent in 2011. After decelerating to
15 percent (y-o-y) toward end-2011, headline inflation rose sharply in March 2012 to
24.5 percent (y-o-y) owing to a rise in rents, utility tariffs, and higher food prices. It has since
eased slightly to 22.7 percent in May 2012.
Growth in broad money decelerated to about 4.7 percent (y-o-y) in April 2012 following tighter
monetary conditions as policy rates rose by 350 basis points to 14 percent in May 2012. Credit
to the private sector after peaking at 40 percent at end-2011 slowed to 28 percent (y-o-y) at
end-April 2012 in the face of tighter liquidity conditions. Banks were able to sustain credit
growth despite a decline in deposits, in part through a drawdown in excess reserves.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

BURUNDI

While revenues and expenditure were broadly in line with the program, the deficit in 2011 was
higher than expected due to the late disbursement of the World Bank budget support
operation. Revenues through end-May 2012 were lower than expected by (0.5 percent of
GDP), owing to a fall in collections of excise taxes and the granting of exemptions. To limit the
impact of inflation on the poor, the government eliminated taxes on food products on May 1
until end-2012.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Burundian authorities for progress in implementing their
Fund-supported economic program in a difficult post-conflict environment. However, Directors
considered that the external and internal risks weighing on the outlook called for a faster pace
of fiscal and structural reforms, and encouraged the authorities to persist in their prudent
approach to macroeconomic management.
Directors agreed that continued progress in implementing revenue reforms is essential in light
of recent fiscal slippages and the decline in donor assistance. In particular, they encouraged
the authorities to widen the tax base, strengthen revenue administration, and overhaul the fuel
pricing mechanism. Directors commended the authorities for taking sizable corrective fiscal
measures to keep the program on track but stressed the need to better align spending
priorities in view of resource constraints.
Directors emphasized the importance of pursuing public financial management reforms in
order to foster greater transparency and accountability, and to strengthen institutional capacity.
They also noted that, despite improvements in the budget framework, significant gaps remain
in debt management and Burundi remains vulnerable to debt distress. In this context,
continued reliance on grants and highly concessional loans remains a priority.
Directors considered that additional monetary policy tightening will be warranted if inflationary
pressures do not subside in the period ahead. They called for further monitoring of risks to the
financial sector stemming from rising interest rates and an unfavorable external environment.
Directors acknowledged that greater exchange rate flexibility has helped the economy adjust
to external shocks. They underscored the need to further enhance Burundi’s competitiveness
by strengthening the business climate, improving the electricity supply, and reducing
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

transportation costs.
Directors concurred that Burundi’s statistical base still suffers from shortcomings that hamper
policy design and evaluation. In particular, they encouraged the authorities to improve capacity
in the preparation of national accounts, balance of payments data, and consumer price
indices.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

July 27, 2012

IMF Executive Board Completes First Review Under the Extended Credit Facility
Arrangement for Burundi and Approves US$6 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the first review of
Burundi’s performance under the program supported by the Extended Credit Facility (ECF). In
completing the review, the Executive Board approved a modification of performance criteria for
end-September 2012.
The Executive Board’s decision will allow for the disbursement of an amount equivalent to SDR 4
million (about US$ 6 million), bringing disbursements under the arrangement to an amount
equivalent to SDR 5 million (about US$ 7.6 million). Burundi’s current three-year ECF
arrangement was approved on January 27, 2012 (See Press Release No.12/35)
Following the Executive Board’s decision on Burundi, Mr. Naoyuki Shinohara, Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair, issued the following statement:
“Progress under the Fund-supported program has continued at an uneven pace. Economic growth is
expected to exceed 4 percent in 2012, but inflation has been persistent in the wake of the food and
fuel price shocks. The medium-term economic outlook remains challenging and vulnerable to

downside risks stemming from internal strains, declining donor support, and the external
environment.
“Fiscal slippages in early 2012 were addressed decisively in a supplementary budget through a
combination of revenue and expenditure measures. To ensure that the budget targets are achieved,
further revenue mobilization, including through improvements in tax administration, remains
important.
“Underlying inflation has started to decline, but monetary policy should stay focused on anchoring
inflation expectations. Higher policy rates have contributed to a welcome slowdown in credit
expansion, but further action will be necessary if inflationary pressures do not ease in the period
ahead.
“Maintaining debt sustainability remains a priority for fiscal policy. Given Burundi’s vulnerability
to debt distress, financing should continue to rely primarily on highly concessional resources.
Equally important, further steps are needed to strengthen public debt management, including the
finalization of a medium-term debt management strategy currently under preparation.
“Burundi’s competitiveness needs to be enhanced to boost growth prospects and accelerate
economic development. To this end, it is important to push ahead with structural reforms to improve
the business environment, including by strengthening infrastructure and energy supply,”
Mr. Shinohara added.

Statement by Mr. Momodou Saho, Alternate Executive Director for
The Republic of Burundi
July 27, 2012
1.
My Burundian authorities are committed to strengthening the country’s
macroeconomic fundamentals and to continue the implementation of sound policies and
reforms under their economic program. They are confident that this will contribute to
consolidate economic and political gains, promote new growth drivers and inclusive growth,
reduce poverty and help shield the economy from exogenous shocks. They are, however,
mindful that internal and external constraints could hamper the success of their economic
program. Nevertheless, with their strong policy commitment and continued support from the
Fund and their development partners, my authorities are confident that they will succeed in
implementing their economic program.
2.
My authorities are appreciative of the Fund’s constructive engagement and support
under the ECF, and thank staff for the helpful policy dialogue and advice. Going forward,
they are determined to further strengthen this engagement as they make progress toward
achieving their key national and regional objectives as set out in the PRSP II and the EAC
protocols.
3.
My authorities have made steady progress in the implementation of the program
despite the difficult global environment. All performance criteria and indicative targets for
end-March 2012 were met, and the fiscal slippages have been adequately addressed through
the revised 2012 budget. In view of this strong performance, my authorities request
Directors’ support for the conclusion of the first review under the ECF, and modification of
performance criteria for end-September 2012.
Recent economic and policy developments
4.
Burundi’s economic activity continues to be adversely affected by protracted high
fuel and food prices, poor weather conditions and declining donor flows. As a result, real
GDP growth forecast for 2012 has been revised downwards to 4.2 percent from the earlier
forecast of 4.8 percent. The expansion of services and foreign investments in the secondary

sector remained the major drivers of growth while agricultural output was weak on account
of drought conditions. Consequently, prices of foodstuffs rose sharply in addition to the
continued increase in fuel prices. The authorities have also adjusted electricity and water
tariffs. As a result, inflation rose sharply to 25 percent by end-March 2012.
5.
The authorities’ 2011 fiscal outturn reflected progress made in strengthening their
fiscal framework in line with the program targets. In this regard, domestic revenue
mobilization improved and expenditure was kept within the program envelope. Although
expenditure fell short of projection, the authorities did maintain pro-poor spending at the
targeted level. Subsequently, to further protect the vulnerable, the authorities extended tax
relief by eliminating custom duties, VAT, and administrative charges on 13 imported and
locally produced food products amounting to 0.3 percent of GDP. Additionally, the
authorities waived excise taxes on oil products to offset soaring oil prices and its effect on
inflation. In response to declining external budget support, and the reduction of the revenue
collections on foodstuffs and oil products, the government reviewed the 2012 budget with
further expenditure cuts and increasing domestic revenue by introducing new taxes. These
budget adjustments also respond to the program’s goals.
6.
Monetary policy has been tightened further to curb inflation. Consequently, the rate
of growth of credit to the economy has moderated. Supervision of financial institutions has
been improved and the Central Bank (BRB) continues to implement measures aimed at
strengthening its financial safeguards. In this vein, it has established an audit committee and
adopted a new audit charter that conforms to best practice. The BRB also continues to pursue
a flexible exchange rate policy in order to mitigate external shocks. However, given the
recent sharp depreciation of the domestic currency, it intervened in the foreign exchange
market to reduce volatility.
7.
On the external side, the current account widened owing to the deterioration of the
terms of trade, the decline in external budget support and the high prices of imported food
and fuel. As a result, official reserves fell to 4 months of import cover from 4.4 months in
December 2011.

97

8.
My authorities completed preparation of the second Poverty Reduction and Growth
Strategy Paper (PRSP-II) which focuses on the transformation of the Burundian economy.
The key pillars of the strategy include the consolidation of good governance, achieving
sustainable growth and job–creation, strengthening of national solidarity and improving
management of land and the environment. The growth projections in the PSRP-II are
necessarily ambitious, because of the transformative nature of its objectives. However, the
authorities, like staff, are aware of the risks to the outlook. These relate to the ongoing
international economic crisis, low international coffee prices and shortfalls in budget support.
The authorities will take measures as necessary and in consultation with the Fund, to adjust
policies in the event the adverse scenarios materialize. The authorities intend to organize an
international conference of donors in October 2012 on PRSP-II.
Policy framework and reforms going forward
Fiscal policy and reforms
9.
The authorities have made substantial progress with regard to the implementation of
public financial management reforms. Significant gains were achieved in the areas of budget
credibility, supervision, cash management, and government accounting. Going forward, they
remain committed to further strengthening public financial management and, in this regard,
intend to develop and implement a new public financial management strategy for 2012–2014 in
order to consolidate the gains attained thus far. The legal and institutional framework will be
improved and strengthened for more effective financial governance, promoting transparency and
accountability. They have also simplified customs clearance
procedures and created a one-stop border post with Tanzania, the main entry point of
Burundi’s foreign trade.
10.
Given the downward trend in external aid inflows, the authorities are determined to
further strengthen their capacity to mobilize domestic resources by enhancing tax
administration, and widening the tax base. Critical steps will be taken to close fiscal
loopholes in order to maximize tax collection. The authorities welcome IMF technical
assistance in assessing the tax exemption system and fuel pricing mechanism, and look
forward to further support going forward.

98

11.
My authorities are mindful of the country’s risk of debt distress and, in this regard,
they remain committed to pursuing the mobilization of concessional external financing. The
authorities are also committed to completing and fully implementing their medium–term debt
management strategy focused on improving the legal framework governing the issuance of
guarantees and on lending; strengthening the debt management structure and building
capacity for the analysis of cost indicators and basic debt risks. They intend to create a high-level
committee to coordinate public debt management processes and to ensure that total
public debt is consistent with the country’s macroeconomic objectives.
Monetary policy
12.
The authorities’ monetary policy framework will continue to be focused on curbing
inflation and streamlining credit to the private sector. The authorities believe that the flexible
exchange rate has helped to stabilize the BRB’s reserves and improve the liquidity of the
financial sector. Nonetheless, they are concerned about the repercussions of this policy stance
on inflation especially with the recent depreciation of the exchange rate.
Financial sector reforms
13.
The BRB will continue strengthening its supervisory and regulatory services to the
financial institutions with a view to broadening access to financial services under its
inclusive finance framework. The BRB will also continue strengthening its internal control
and risk management systems, and the modernization of its payment systems. Mobile
banking will be a key pillar for deepening inclusive finance. Therefore, the legal and
regulatory framework will be implemented. Furthermore, in the spirit of the strengthening
investor protection and deepening of the financial sector, the central bank will strengthen the
creditor rights framework.

rated Burundi the seventh most improved economy in the world. However, challenges in this

energy and the privatization of public enterprises. The reforms in the mineral sector are

Conclusion
16.
The implementation of the ECF-supported program could be hampered by internal
and external environment challenges. The authorities will maintain an appropriate mix of
fiscal and monetary policies, as well as deepened structural reforms to support growth and
reduce poverty. Given the large financial needs, the authorities count on the catalytic impact
of IMF engagement to support Burundi in the mobilization of grants and high concessional
resources. With their policy stance and continued support from the Fund and other
development partners, my authorities are confident that they will succeed in achieving the
objectives of their economic program.
