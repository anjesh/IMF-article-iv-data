ALBANIA
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation, Fifth Review Under the Three-Year
Arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, Review Under Extended
Arrangement, Financing Assurances Review, and Request for Modification of
Performance Criteria
Prepared by the European Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Poul M. Thomsen and Scott Brown
July 11, 2008
Executive Summary
The expiration of the EFF/PRGF-supported program in January 2009 will cap an impressive period of
economic transition. Per capita GDP in U.S. dollar terms more than doubled over the last decade, inflation was
brought down to developed-economy levels, social conditions have improved drastically, and Albania is
graduating from IDA. This progress was due mainly to prudent macroeconomic and structural policies. The
program is broadly on track, despite some renewed slippages in the electricity sector.
These successes notwithstanding, some deep-seated problems remain, notably in the electricity sector and with
regard to the business climate, two areas in which reforms have lagged. Moreover, new challenges have appeared
on the horizon, and more adversarial politics are in stock ahead of next year’s election, while regional risks linger.
In spite of a more difficult external environment, the near-term macroeconomic outlook remains broadly
favorable with growth projected at potential, inflation returning to the target band, and continued external
stability. The recent widening of the external current account deficit appears due mainly to temporary factors, with
continued strong export growth and diversification. Empirical analysis of the real effective exchange rate is
subject to a large degree of uncertainty, with a CGER-type methodology resulting in estimates ranging from a
5 percent undervaluation to an overvaluation of up to 25 percent.
Policy discussions took a longer view on the requirements for continued economic success after graduation
from the low-income group: securing price stability in the near term; ensuring a continued strong economic
outlook by maintaining fast paced productivity growth and low inflation; mitigating risks to domestic and financial
stability; anchoring fiscal policy in the cross-currents of potentially conflicting requirements; and bringing
electricity sector reforms to a close.
Albania's de facto exchange rate system is an independent float, with occasional intervention. Albania
maintains exchange restrictions under the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, but maintains no restrictions
subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII.
Based on the satisfactory performance and the authorities’ commitments, staff recommends completion of
the Fifth Review and Financing Assurances Review, and modification of three performance criteria for
end-September 2008. All performance criteria were met, and staff considers the end-September 2008
performance criteria to be consistent with program objectives.

I. THE CONTEXT
1.
Albania is reaching new milestones in its economic and political development. Over
the last decade and underpinned by Fund programs, per capita GDP in U.S. dollar terms more
than doubled and inflation was brought down to developed-economy levels (Table 1). While
some of this reflected catch-up gains from the transition from a particular detrimental economic
policy regime before the 1990s, the bulk of the progress was due to prudent macroeconomic and
structural policies. In recognition of economic and political achievements, a Stabilization and
Association Agreement with the EU was signed in 2006, and an invitation to join NATO
extended in the spring of 2008.
2.
Social conditions have improved drastically and Albania is graduating from IDA.
Rapid growth, price stability, and continued large remittances also significantly improved social
conditions and moved the country toward Millennium Development Goals.

These successes notwithstanding, some deep-seated problems remain, new
challenges are appearing on the horizon, and more adversarial politics are in store ahead of
next year’s election, while regional risks linger. Turning around the loss-making electricity
sector and realizing its potential has proved elusive over the entire transition period, despite
repeated attempts. Similarly, wide-spread governance concerns remain and the business
environment is weak (Figures 1 and 2 and Table 2). Meanwhile, macroeconomic policies cannot
rest on past laurels; further fiscal consolidation, advances in fiscal and debt management, and
deeper financial markets are required as Albania moves away from concessional finance and
starts accessing international markets. After a long and productive relationship with the Fund
(Box 1), alternative anchors for policies need to be found. The coming 2009 parliamentary
election could make persevering with sound policies harder. Lingering risks to the regional
security situation with the potential to trigger economic spillovers, place a premium on protecting
macroeconomic and financial stability.

Box 1. Implementation of Past Fund Policy Recommendations
The authorities’ responsiveness to Fund advice in earlier Article IV consultations has been
good, as reflected in strong program performance and the completion of four reviews under the current
arrangement. Macroeconomic policies have been prudent and delivered a strong growth performance.
On structural reform, the vulnerabilities that were previously identified in revenue administration, debt
management, and banking supervision are being tackled, with progress on tax administration being
particularly advanced. However, some key areas for structural reform have lagged behind. The
persistently weak financial performance of the electricity sector is a serious macroeconomic concern,
and limiting the resulting quasi fiscal costs is subject to program conditionality. Implementation of the
reforms to strengthen title registration and enforce contracts has also been slow.

4.
Supported by the authorities’ continued commitment, performance under the
PRGF/EFF-supported program remains strong. For the fifth review, all March
quantitative performance criteria were met (MEFP Table 1) and structural conditionality
appears on track (Table 3) with, however, some stress in the energy sector (see below).
II. BACKGROUND
A. Recent Economic Performance
5.
Since the last Article IV consultation, macroeconomic performance has
remained strong even in trying times.
•

Notwithstanding a drought, growth remained at potential and became broader
based. Real GDP grew by 6 percent in 2007 and the same rate is projected for the
current year. A regional drought in 2007 affected Albania particularly hard because of
dependence on hydro-electric power generation and rain-fed farming. But the
recovery was rapid as the economy diversified with buoyant construction and trade
and the opening of new markets and export activities—e.g., in textiles, footwear and
mining (Chart).

Inflation, while episodically above the
target range, is among the lowest in the
region. In spite of global food- and
commodity price shocks, there were only
temporary deviations from the 3±1 percent
inflation target, and expectations appear
firmly anchored. A cumulative 125 basis
points increase in the policy rate since July
2006, has maintained positive real interest
rates, buttressed by timely regulatory
tightening (Box 2).

In addition, risks to external and domestic stability have receded somewhat.
Domestic credit growth, though still elevated, has decelerated from past highs. The
share of exports of goods and services in GDP has risen in each of the past five years.
Albania continues to attract investment in its traditional exports, textiles and
footwear. In addition, non-traditional export sectors such as chromium have expanded
rapidly and, in the services sector, tourism is registering buoyant growth. As a result,
the past heavy concentration of exports to the key Italian and Greek markets has
begun to diminish.

6.
These favorable trends are a continuation of more than a decade’s rising
investment and productivity (Box 3). Business improvements, labor shedding and interindustry resource reallocation following the collapse of communism were key, supported by
the successful macroeconomic stabilization and market-oriented reforms.

11
Box 2. Recent Banking Sector Legal and Regulatory Measures
I.
Changes to the legal framework include enactment of a new banking Law (December 2006) and an
Anti-Money Laundering Law (May 2008). Separate legislation has been submitted to Parliament to improve the
execution of collateral and establish the legal foundation for private party repurchase operations. In addition,
legislation to transfer supervisory authority over leasing companies to the BoA has been approved by the
Council of Ministers.
II.

Changes to the regulatory framework:

1.
Measures aimed at improving credit risk management. In the event a bank violates twin limits on
the rate of credit growth and non-performing loan levels, the BoA may now mandate a bank to: (i) Strengthen its
monitoring processes, (ii) Slow its rate of credit provision by adjusting interest rates and credit growth
objectives, by reducing its internal guidelines on the acceptable ratio of credit to collateral and customers’ debt
service to income; and by suspending promotional advertisements in the media; (iii) Weight with a 150 percent
risk factor, the greater of the value of credit that exceeds the prudential requirements for single exposures, the
value of credit that exceeds the new limits, or the value of nonperforming loans that exceeds the new ceiling;
(iv) Increase capital, or take other measures to achieve a higher minimum level of capital adequacy ratio;
(v) Initiate cost-cutting measures; and/or (vi) Set up an additional reserve fund from profit within six months. If
the BoA judges that the above measures are not producing the correct implementation and compliance by the
bank, it now has the authority to suspend all or part of the credit operations of the bank; or introduce credit
ceilings for individual banks.
2.

Measures to improving transparency towards clients, particularly truth in lending.

3.
Measures to strengthen regulations governing lending to related persons, by reducing the
aggregate prudential limit on lending by banks to related persons if the bank is found to have insufficient
systems to monitor related persons exposures.

7.
These impressive achievements owe much to sound macroeconomic and
structural policies. Stronger public finances, largely based on major improvements in tax
administration, which boosted the ratio of tax revenue to GDP substantially, lowered public
debt from 66 percent of GDP in 2001 to 53 percent in 2007 (Table 4). With the budget thus
tied down, the Bank of Albania (BoA) was able to sustainably lower inflation. Aside from
macroeconomic policies, structural reforms—such as supply-side tax reforms, financial
market development, and large scale privatization—provided strong incentives to invest, with
financing from persistent large remittances, as well as more traditional FDI (Table 5).
B. Challenges
8.
Notwithstanding this generally strong performance, Albania faces a number of
challenges on the way to emerging-market status.

12
Box 3. A Decade and a Half of Productivity Growth in Albania
Over 1993-2007, growth in Albania was significantly higher than in other transition economies. The
following assesses the performance in growth accounting terms.
Growth accounting decomposes output growth into the contribution of capital, labor and a residual
measure of efficiency gains usually called total factor productivity (TFP). In line with recent studies
(e.g., Schadler and others, 2006), the capital and labor shares are assumed to be 0.35 and 0.65,
respectively. The analysis suggests that high growth has been driven largely by TFP growth—
accounting for over 80 percent of the output growth.

As in other transition economies, labor was not a major factor for growth, partly because of high labor
mobility to advanced economies and hidden labor inputs in the large informal sector. However, a high
and growing contribution of capital accumulation sets Albania apart.

Recently, however, Albanian TFP growth is flagging even as it is rising in other transition economies,
pointing to the need for further structural reform.

•

Maintaining price stability in the near term through an appropriate monetaryfiscal policy mix. Unfavorable global inflation trends are expected to prevail over the
near future, while increased food exports will lower domestic supply and likely put
pressure on domestic prices over the medium term. These factors could make a return
to the inflation target zone harder, all the more so if tight budget policies were to be
relaxed.

•

Ensuring a continued strong medium-term outlook by maintaining fast paced
productivity growth through an improved business climate. A key challenge
arises from a high degree of labor mobility to more advanced European countries.
This sets an effective wage floor, makes labor-intensive growth unlikely, and puts a
premium on productivity advances. The business climate, which is particularly weak
in the areas of corruption, judiciary, and land titling, constitutes a key impediment.

•

Securing financial and external stability. In the financial sector, strong credit
growth doubled private credit over the last two years to 30 percent of GDP (Table 6).
With unsettled international financial market conditions and a predominantly foreignowned banking system, there is a knife-edge danger of an equally disruptive sudden
stop—e.g., if parent banks were to retrench—or a re-acceleration, e.g., if successful
land legalization were to increase available collateral. Temporary factors have
resulted in recent large current account deficits, underscoring the need to further
diversify the export base. Lower external deficits are also needed to improve debt
sustainability, especially given the planned shift from concessional to market finance.

•

Anchoring fiscal policy in cross-currents of potentially conflicting requirements.
With the imminent departure from the program’s anchor under the Fund-supported
program, a framework must be put in place to maintain a fiscal stance conducive to
macro stability. This will also be important to ensure that the availability of market
finance does not trigger a relaxation in fiscal consolidation efforts, notwithstanding
still large infrastructure and social development needs. Redressing the latter is
particularly pressing given still weak governance and past problems to spend capital
allocations.

•

Bringing electricity sector reforms to a close. The core of the problem is unpaid
electricity usage—the average effective collection rate, at around 50 percent, remains
low compared even with the regional average of about 75 percent. Without progress
in this area, the financial position of the electricity utility KESH will continue to
hemorrhage, electricity supply to the economy remain unreliable, and KESH’s
privatization be made more difficult.

14
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
9.
Against this background, the Article IV discussions focused on the policy
requirements for continued strong growth and macro-financial stability over the
medium term. With the PRGF-EFF arrangement set to expire in January 2009, the Article
IV consultation was timely in broadening the horizon from 16 years of Fund programs toward
post-program issues, with a focus on the medium-term policies and reforms necessary to
sustain high growth and on safeguarding financial stability. These issues were discussed with
a wide cross section of society, including through extensive outreach via a high-level
conference on opportunities and challenges.1
10.
In that context, the Fifth Review discussions covered updates to the
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), importantly pertaining to the
mid-year budget review, monetary policy, financial sector stability, measures to boost
KESH’s financial position, and conditionality for the Sixth Review. The authorities indicated
that they wanted to explore possible options for future Fund engagement in the context of the
Sixth Review.
A. Securing Price Stability in the Near Term
11.
In the face of an unfavorable global inflation outlook, there was agreement on
the need to stand ready to tighten monetary policy again. In addition to the recent
increase in electricity tariffs, pressures from world food prices will ease only gradually while
agricultural market integration would result in a secular trend increase of domestic food
prices to international levels. It was agreed that monetary tightening had been essential in
achieving low underlying inflation and would again be needed to combat any second round
effects or deterioration of inflation expectations (MEFP ¶17). Moreover, as demand pressures
could emanate from a re-acceleration of credit growth, the planned regulatory and
supervisory measures (see below) provide essential flanking support to monetary policy.

1

On May 14, 2008, staff and local experts, including high-level officials, discussed appropriate fiscal anchors,
debt sustainability and access to capital markets, inflation forecasting, monetary policy, and energy and other
reforms to boost growth. Participant conference presentations, including those of staff, and the conference
proceedings can be found at http://www.imf.org/external/np/seminars/eng/2008/alb/index.htm .

With the interest rate transmission channel still not fully developed, there was
consensus that the monetary policy framework needs to keep abreast of market
developments. The announced inflation

primarily through the exchange rate. In this
context, staff and authorities agreed that strong policy communication accompanying policy
rate decisions has been critical in constraining price pressures emanating from a quasi
monopolistic retail sector. With greater competition and productivity in that sector,
strengthening traditional transmission mechanisms will gain urgency.
13.
Fiscal policy also plays an important role in the authorities’ strategy to contain
demand pressures. The budget has accumulated a surplus of some one percent of GDP over
the first four months of 2008. It was agreed that over the remainder of 2008, the budget
would continue to support efforts to maintain price stability:
•

The 2008 budget mid-year review maintains a neutral fiscal stance from 2007.
The deficit ceiling of 5.2 percent of GDP (MEFP ¶9)—allowing for the very high
import content of accelerated capital spending—avoids creating a fiscal impulse in
2008. This is facilitated by buoyant revenue after the adoption of the 10-percent single
rate/flat tax (Box 4), which already has permitted the budget to absorb significant cost
overruns on the large Rreshen-Kalimash road project as well as compensation
payments for the recent catastrophic ammunitions explosion.

•

Planned large wage increases were scaled back sharply (MEFP ¶9). The mid-year
budget keeps wages at originally budgeted levels, thus foregoing earlier plans to effect
a large public sector wage increase, which would help prevent a potential wage-price
inflation feedback loop.

16
Box 4. The Albanian Flat Tax Reform in International Perspective
In order to create a friendlier investment climate, make the economy more competitive, encourage the
legalization of the shadow economy, and simplify tax collection, the authorities undertook the
following tax reforms:
•

In August 2007, a 10 percent flat tax on personal income replaced the previous system of five
income-dependent rates: 5, 10, 15, 25, and 30 percent, which did not result in a decline in the
average PIT rate. Dividends received by individuals remained taxed at 10 percent, and the
same rate replaced the small business tax rate of up to 30 percent.

•

In January 2008, a 10 percent corporate income tax replaced the 20 percent rate on profits.

•

Income tax rates were thus pegged among the lowest in transition economies.

Simultaneous administrative reforms boosted revenue: the number of workers who pay social
insurance contributions (and thus PIT) grew following the authorities’ campaign to clamp down on
evasion, and the number of CIT payers in the first months of 2008 has increased notably.
While the experience with the new taxes is too short to draw definite conclusions, revenue
performance in the January-April 2008 period has been very strong, with cumulative year-on-year
growth for the first trimester of almost 40 percent.
How does this compare to other transition economies that introduced a flat tax? Keen et al. (IMF
Working Paper 06/218) review the experience with flat tax in eight transition economies and conclude
that, with few exceptions, the introduction of a PIT or CIT flat rate was associated with revenue losses.

Why is Albania different? While the experience is still very short, a likely reason is that in
circumstances of initially very weak tax administration and tax compliance, simplifying the tax system,
lowering tax rates, broadening the tax base, and strengthening tax administration, could significantly
strengthen revenue collection.

17
•

Significant contingencies are built in to protect against budget risks. Such risks
remain significant, in particular in the electricity sector—which in 2007 ran quasifiscal losses of 2½ percent of GDP, the equivalent of public health spending—while
further cost increases for the large road project could be in store. A budget reserve of
¾ percent of GDP for the remaining 6 months of the year—consistent with the
program’s annual target of 1½ percent—protects the execution of the fiscal program.
B. Ensuring a Continued Strong Economic Outlook

14.
Under sound policies, the medium-term economic outlook remains favorable. In
staff’s baseline scenario, growth is projected to remain buoyant at some 6 percent through
2013, supported by capital accumulation and

are expected to keep inflation low.
15.
A wavering of policies would be costly and was seen as the main risk to the
outlook. An alternative medium-term scenario was discussed that assumes the maintenance
of past policy gains—including macroeconomic stability—but no further improvements in
governance and the business climate. This is based on staff analysis which suggests that
institutional weaknesses are a major impediment to growth (Box 5 and Figure 3). Without
further business friendly reforms, growth would fall progressively below the baseline, while
debt sustainability would be imperiled.
16.
The authorities saw more yield from prior reforms in the pipeline and also
looked toward a second round of structural reforms to improve the business
environment. In addition to their plans to maintain macroeconomic stability, they viewed an
increasingly competitive and foreign-owned banking system, along with recent tax policy
reforms, as having drastically improved the environment for investors. Initial feedback from
the recently set up one-stop shop for business registration and e-government initiatives had
also been positive and the authorities were looking forward to broaden the scope of these
initiatives.

18
Box 5. Model Specification Underlying Alternative Growth Projections
The baseline and alternative medium-term scenarios are underpinned by a growth accounting model
relating changes in total factor productivity (TFP) to various measures of institutional improvement,
availability of credit and macroeconomic stability. The model was estimated in log differences as an
OLS panel regression of 11 countries1, with the following specification:
TFPt = β0 + β1CRR t-1 + β2 EBRDt-1 + β3 PSCLAIMSt-1 + β4CPIt + β5TFPt-1 +εt
Where:
CRR
EBRD
PSCLAIMS
CPI
TFP

= PRS Group risk indicator;
= aggregate EBRD transition indicator;
= Claims on the private sector in percent of GDP;
= the CPI index;
= total factor productivity lagged one period (catch up effect).

The rationale for this specification was that the risk variable is a measure of agents’ willingness to
participate in the process of combining labor and capital; and the transition indicator is a measure of
their ability to participate. The CPI, as a proxy for the degree of macroeconomic stability, and the
initial conditions have standard interpretations.
The model differs from the potential growth estimates derived in Box 8 of the IMF Regional
Economic Outlook, Europe, April 2008 in several respects: (i) it is estimated using a smaller
database limited to transition countries, whereas the REO sample comprises 107 diverse economies
and utilizes a dummy variable to account for the effect of transition; (ii) it estimates TFP, rather than
real GDP per capita; and (iii) it excludes variables representing education and age dependency rate.
The findings are also broadly consistent with IMF Working Paper 07/170, (2007) that shows sound
policies (small fiscal deficit and low inflation) and institutional development (low corruption, law
and order, bureaucratic quality, etc.) to be associated with higher TFP growth.
Changes in TFP under alternative scenarios of institutional improvements were then applied to a
standard Cobb-Douglas production function to yield baseline and low-case growth outcomes. The
simulations imply that institutional factors are important—by 2012, the deterioration in the
investment climate embodied in the low-case scenario resulted in a decline in real growth from 6.2 to
4.4 percent.

17.
Staff observed that reforms to improve the business environment—while
essential—require steadfast implementation and need to be tailored to evolving
institutions and capacity. Stepped-up efforts are needed to strengthen institutions and
governance. While the authorities have taken actions to lighten the regulatory burden,
property rights—importantly those related to land tenure—remain ill defined and contract
enforcement is lacking in general, with the judicial system and courts singled out as key
impediments. The authorities noted that efforts are underway, with donor support, to redress
these shortcomings. Their new anti-corruption strategy focuses on raising public awareness
and coordinating efforts across various levels of government. Staff welcomed these steps, but
noted that their consistent enforcement across all levels of government required ongoing
commitment.
18.
The privatization program is winding down and the remaining strategic assets, e.g.,
the large public oil and insurance companies, as well as residual minority shareholdings are
likely to be divested over 2008–09. In addition the government aims to privatize the
distribution arm of KESH (see below).
19.
Improving statistics is another key element. In particular, improving the reliability,
timeliness and the frequency of national accounts statistics remain a top priority for the
authorities. With extensive technical assistance from the Fund, the authorities are improving
the methodology and data sources for national accounts and are working toward launching
quarterly national accounts—a key requirement for SDDS. However, in general, the progress
in improving statistics has been slow and intermittent, partly because of lack of skilled staff
and insufficient resources.
C. Mitigating Risks to Domestic and External Stability
External sustainability and competitiveness
20.
While the current deficit has widened temporarily, no major concerns about
competitiveness and external stability were raised, and staff and the authorities agreed that
the real exchange rate does not appear to be misaligned. Albania has an independently
floating exchange rate regime, there are few signs that competitiveness has deteriorated
significantly, and domestic monetary and fiscal policies have supported external
sustainability.

While data limitations prevent an assessment of unit labor costs, the real
effective exchange rate does not unduly inhibit export performance. Growth in
the volume of exports of goods and services has been increasingly buoyant (13 and
22 percent in 2006 and 2007, respectively). As a result, export market shares have
increased. Also as noted above, while the export base is still narrow, there is evidence
of export diversification in terms of both products and markets.

Kalimash road project. Excluding temporary and one-off factors, the underlying
current account deficit in 2007 was around 6.6 percent of GDP (see text table). Over
the medium term, staff expects the current account deficit to narrow to below 5
percent of GDP. As the effect of the adverse terms of trade shock wears off and
temporary factors unwind, the current account narrows by just over 3 percentage
points of GDP. Moreover, an improved business environment will boost non-price
competitiveness, thereby supporting more self-discovery regarding comparative
advantage with an attendant broadening of the export base and greater import
substitution. However, current account developments in the near future would need to
be monitored carefully to ensure that the headline deficit narrows as temporary factors
wane.

22
•

These findings are broadly consistent with CGER-type analysis. Using the CGER
macroeconomic balance approach, and a recent IMF Working Paper that estimates
this approach for new EU member states, staff constructed estimates for the current
account norm for Albania (see text table).1 These estimates are sensitive to the
inclusion of FDI in the calculations, vary widely, and result in a range of estimated
current account deficit norms of 1.2 to 6.4 percent of GDP—spanning the projected
current account—and corresponding exchange rate overvaluations of –5 to 25 percent.
As Albania is at an early stage of development and has high investment needs, a
current account deficit norm at the higher end of the scale—and including a role for
FDI—seems plausible.

The macroeconomic framework projects a continuation of established policies and staff used the medium-term
projections of the current account as the basis for the underlying current account. This estimate is relatively
conservative given projection of a contemporaneous small appreciation of the real effective exchange rate over
the forecast horizon.

23
However, the lek’s recent appreciation vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar has triggered
21.
domestic concerns. Exporters questioned whether the monetary policy stance was too tight.
The authorities and staff agreed, however, that monetary and fiscal policies have supported
external sustainability and that in any event, the real effective exchange rate had remained
broadly stable. Greater communication efforts may be needed to explain the impact of
bilateral euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate movements.
Debt Sustainability

22.
There was consensus that with public debt still over 50 percent of GDP, a
cautious approach to borrowing from the markets is called for. While the debt
sustainability analysis (Appendix I) shows that—based on the adoption of a prudent fiscal
rule—debt appears sustainable, the outlook remains vulnerable to shocks, especially given
still significant domestic debt rollover risk. In addition, the authorities have taken on a
€230 million commercial loan (which is included in the nonconcessional borrowing limit)
and are seeking to access international capital markets. While generally supporting the
authorities’ intention regarding greater integration with global capital markets, staff also
noted the added risks in terms of costs and volatility. In this context, targeting a reduction of
the debt to GDP ratio below 50 percent of GDP by 2011 (MEFP ¶10) would improve
sustainability and also provide a transparent signal to markets about policy intent, especially
if implemented through a clear fiscal rule (see below).
The requirements for successful first-time market access featured prominently
23.
in the discussions. It was agreed that strengthening debt management capacity and
developing a coherent medium-term debt strategy are key priorities. The authorities pointed
to the creation of a General Debt Department, albeit not fully staffed yet, as an important
initial step. Staff urged the authorities to move more quickly on filling posts and highlighted
the preparatory workload for first time issuance of Eurobonds. In this context, staff noted
some common pitfalls for first time issuers—too large an issuance for financing needs
(particularly for countries like Albania where capital spending is underexecuted) resulting in
high carry costs and causing humps in the repayment profile. Other potential difficulties
include high volatility and low liquidity in the secondary market and exchange rate volatility.
Given these difficulties, the authorities agreed that they would seek technical assistance to
prepare for sovereign issuance.
In domestic currency markets progress has been made on lengthening the
24.
maturity of debt, but a further deepening of markets is needed. The authorities
emphasized that the issuance of 5- and 7-year bonds had triggered nonresident interest and
significantly raised the average maturity of domestic debt to 424 days at end 2007 (from
195 days in 2005). Nonetheless, rollover risk remains high and a secondary market is needed
to further broaden the investor base. Accordingly, the authorities are reducing the frequency
of primary auctions (MEFP ¶5). They also noted that over the longer term further lengthening

24
of maturities and deepening of domestic markets could be achieved but only with the
development of pensions and insurance markets.
Financial sector stability

25.
While the banking system appears sound, there was consensus that mitigating
risks to financial stability required vigilance on several fronts. Core indicators suggest
that the banking system remains well capitalized, liquid, and profitable (Table 7). Although
rapid credit growth has lowered capital adequacy and liquidity ratios, NPLs remain low and
stress tests regularly performed by the authorities indicate that the banking sector is resilient
to standard exchange rate, interest rate, and credit quality shocks. In addition, the 2005 FSSA
gave high marks for the quality of banking supervision in Albania. However, the sector is
maturing rapidly, and there was agreement that the authorities needed to scale up their
regulatory and supervisory regimes in tandem. The discussion focused on two areas in
particular:
•

The recent slowing growth of the banking system balance sheet is welcome, but
could also indicate problems. As credit growth decelerated to under 50 percent,
broad money growth has slowed sharply to some 11 percent by end-April 2008 and
there was concern that this differential pattern may presage potential pressures on
international reserve holdings or the exchange rate. In practice, however, still large
NFA holdings by foreign owned commercial banks—levels these banks’ management
tended to view as undesirably high—may to some extent mitigate these pressures.
Still, there was agreement on the importance to fully implement the recent MCM TA
recommendations on top of other recent and already planned prudential and regulatory
measures. Of particular importance are: improving BoA’s cross-border supervisory
collaboration with the home-country supervisors of resident foreign banks; speeding
up work on contingency planning for crisis management; resolving problems in
collateral valuation and execution, loan classification, credit concentration, connected
lending, and transparency/truth in lending requirements; and better monitoring and
managing of banks’ credit risk.

•

Further development of the bank and nonbank financial sector was seen as
essential, in particular development of liquid government securities and inter-bank
markets. A key initiative in this regard—being pursued with TA from MCM—is the
development of a delivery-versus-payment system for government securities, which
will also support private party repurchase operations (MEFP ¶19, SB end-October).
To spur interbank market development, staff encouraged the BoA in its dealings with
individual banks to avoid simultaneously injecting and draining liquidity through
repos and to make full use of the upcoming TA from LEG to improve the legal
infrastructure for interbank loan collateralization. Turning to the nonbank financial
sector, the authorities continue to work with the World Bank to further develop the

25
insurance and pension sectors, which have potential to provide longer-term funds for
investment.
D. Anchoring Fiscal Policy in Cross-Currents of Potentially Conflicting Requirements

26.
The overarching theme of the discussions was how to progress with fiscal
consolidation. The current fiscal anchor—a combined limit on net domestic financing and
the stock of nonconcessional debt—will expire with the program and, while having served its
purpose well in the past, would need to be updated in any event to reflect the shift toward
greater reliance on market finance going forward. The authorities aim to anchor fiscal policy
to the objective of bringing public debt to below 50 percent of GDP over the medium term
(MEFP ¶10). This would have the twin benefits of allowing for the temporary acceleration in
capital spending in 2008 and 09, while providing a clear signal and commitment to debt
sustainability to outside observers and markets. It was agreed that a simple and credible fiscal
rule would be the best way to implement such an anchor, and several options were discussed.
Given the authorities’ preference for a small government, their intention to protect recent key
tax cuts, and check spending promises ahead of next year’s elections, there was some
preference for an expenditure-based rule. Staff noted that such a rule would also allow for a
greater play of automatic stabilizers compared with a deficit rule, but observed that it would
put less emphasis on protecting recent gains in tax administration and the overall fiscal
balance. Irrespective of the nature of the rule, staff stressed the need for claw-back
mechanisms in case there are upward deviations from the planned debt consolidation path
(as was the case, e.g., in Switzerland). It was agreed that these issues would be discussed in
greater depth during the Sixth Review.
Within a fiscal consolidation path, discussions focused on how fiscal policy could

best address still high development needs. There was agreement that a stable
macroeconomic environment was a sine qua non for sustaining economic development.
Beyond its contribution to macro stability, fiscal policy has a role in providing an enabling
environment for private-sector led growth, essential public goods and a targeted safety net:
•

With supply-side friendly tax policy reform largely in place, implementation and
administrative improvements were seen as key. The authorities continue improving
VAT administration and the large taxpayers office, and are also increasing the number
of social security contributors (MEFP ¶11, SB end-July). Further steps are being taken
to increase local governments’ own revenues. In an environment still characterized by
significant evasion, the implementation of the flat-tax coincided with the introduction
of a complicated matrix of presumptive and sector- and skill specific reference wages
for tax assessment purposes. Apart from the potential threat to wage flexibility, staff
noted the scope for abuse by tax administration, and suggested that the complexity be
cut to minimize face-to-face interaction between tax administration and payers.

26
•

Pension reform could offer various benefits, but also risks, and requires careful
preparation. High statutory PAYG social security contribution rates continue to
impart a significant tax wedge, which the authorities aim to lower through the
introduction of a mandatory funded pillar. In addition, pension funds could supply a
stable source of longer term finance. The mission supported these goals, but noted
that such a comprehensive reform required time and recommended that the authorities
continue to cooperate with the World Bank on the reform’s blueprint. In any event,
experience elsewhere has shown the potential for significant transition costs that need
to be covered within the existing fiscal framework.

•

Given their vision of a small government, the authorities want to arrest the
recent growth of current expenditure, focusing instead on efficiency and better
targeting. They saw major scope from better IT, pointing to the recently discovered
savings in personnel costs from a comprehensive civil-service employment data base.
To improve targeting of scarce resources, it was also agreed to reallocate budget
provisions that were previously earmarked for wage increases to a targeted social
safety net to compensate for higher food and energy prices (MEFP ¶9).

•

In contrast, capital budget underspending remains a significant concern. In past
years, actual spending lagged well behind budgeted amounts (see table) and was only
boosted through late-year reallocations. The authorities pointed to ministries’
problems in preparing high-quality project proposals, and to a large number of small
projects, as the main culprits. Staff also saw the need to address considerable
overbudgeting and improve procurement standards. In response, the authorities have
moved to concentrate the capital budget on redressing key transport infrastructure
bottlenecks, which—owing to their scale and quality of contractors—can be executed
on time. They have also introduced new procedures to improve the quality of
submitted projects and consolidate the large number of small projects. Finally, they
are stepping up ministries’ training to improve their project preparation capacity.
While they saw scope in public-private partnerships in the future, the authorities plan
to refrain from financing projects through state-owned special purpose vehicles until
capacity to fully evaluate such schemes is built. Staff stressed the need for private
investors to bear the commercial risks involved to ensure optimal resource and risk
allocation.

Despite a considerable comparative advantage for the production of low-cost
hydropower, electricity supply remains unreliable and the sector runs large losses. The
authorities, in consultation with the World Bank, have so far implemented seven action plans,
but there is little improvement in effective

effective collection rate has again dropped
below 50 percent over the last six months.
The litmus test is bringing the financial performance of KESH back into the
29.
black. Following the recent tariff increase, KESH’s financial plan allowed for large wage and
employment increases and a doubling of investment spending, while electricity imports have
run at a level that required KESH to export some of them at a financial loss. While the World
Bank and KESH are asking for another increase in electricity tariffs, the authorities
considered that the March tariff adjustment had already resulted in significant hardship for
vulnerable consumers and had supplied KESH with the financial momentum to effect the
programmed halving of KESH’s quasi-fiscal losses from 2.4 percent of GDP in 2007
(equivalent to the health budget) to 1.2 percent. Moreover, given slippages early in the year,
this would require KESH to begin registering positive cash flows toward the end of the year.
Accordingly, the authorities stressed their commitment to several measures to forestall the
need for a further tariff increase (Box 6):
•

Tackling chronic theft is key. Building on progress made in 2007, further measures
are planned to raise collection rates to 90 percent and reduce losses to 32 percent
(compared with 81 and 35 percent last year, respectively). Achieving these targets
will require determined efforts from KESH management, including cutting off illegal
connections and progress will be monitored by a end-October structural benchmark
on collection rates (MEFP ¶16).

•

KESH’s business plan needs revision: Limiting personnel cost and imports, and
prioritizing investments—the latter also important to not limit the options postprivatization—would be more than sufficient to achieve the goal. The authorities have

28
thus adopted a new Action Plan for KESH containing these measures as a prior action
for the Fifth Review.

Box 6. Electricity Sector: Recent Developments and Goals
New electricity tariffs became effective March 2008. Residential tariffs for up to 300 kWh per month
consumption remained unchanged, but for consumption in the second block (above 300 kWh) the price
increased by 71 percent (to 12 lek per kWh). The overall average tariff thus depends on the share of
household consumption in the latter block, which staff puts at 26 percent, thus arriving at an overall average
increase of some 20 percent. Of course, the increase in KESH revenue is likely to be less than that for the
year as the new tariffs are effective for only 9 months and households adjust their use of electricity.

There was agreement that a private-sector dominated and diversified electricity
sector offered the best chance to make chronic supply and performance problems an
aspect of the past. The authorities plan to lessen dependence on hydropower through
rehabilitating an existing thermal power plant and constructing a new one, licensing private
independent power producers, and constructing a new transmission line to Montenegro to
further integrate Albania’s power sector into the liberalized Southeastern European market.
To enforce more payment discipline and put the sector on a sounder footing, they also aim to
privatize the distribution arm of KESH in 2008. While agreeing with the strategy, the mission
noted the tight deadline and pointed out that potential investors will look toward ongoing
improvements in the company’s finances in line with those targeted under the program as
well as to less politicized regulation.
IV. PROGRAM AND OTHER ISSUES

31.
The proposed conditionality for the Sixth Review is consistent with program
goals, and the program is fully financed through 2008. The 2008 financing gap is
expected to be closed by arrears rescheduling and Fund financing, and projected future debt
service to the Fund is minimal (Tables 8 and 9). Program monitoring for 2008 is described in
Tables 1 and 2 of the MEFP and in the Technical Memorandum of Understanding.
Modifications are proposed to the end-September 2008 performance criteria: on (i) net
international reserves of the BoA to reflect changes in the base period, the temporary
widening of the current account, and a change in the currency of calculation from U.S. dollars
to euros; (ii) net domestic assets of the BoA due to changes in the base period and lower
projected money demand; and (iii) on net domestic credit to government to reflect a higher
external financing. It is also proposed to add an end-October structural benchmark for
cumulative collection performance by KESH.
The authorities continue making progress in clearing remaining arrears with
32.
non-Paris Club Creditors. Albania maintains restrictions under the transitional
arrangements of Article XIV in the form of outstanding debit balances estimated at
€35million at end-2007, which are derived from inoperative bilateral payment agreements
that were in place before Albania joined the Fund. Most outstanding official external arrears
have been reconciled or are in the process of reconciliation and further progress has been
made clearing or rescheduling private sector arrears (notably with Swiss private companies).
The authorities are aiming to have regularized all outstanding arrears by the end of 2008
(MEFP ¶25).
V. STAFF APPRAISAL

33.
Albania’s economic transition and long and productive engagement with the
Fund has resulted in impressive gains. Per capita GDP in U.S. dollar terms more than
doubled over the last decade, inflation was brought down to developed-economy levels,

30
social conditions have drastically improved, and Albania is graduating from IDA. The bulk of
the progress was due to prudent macroeconomic and structural policies. Supported by the
authorities continued commitment, performance under the PRGF/EFF-supported program
generally continues to be strong.
These successes notwithstanding, some deep-seated problems remain, new
34.
challenges have appeared on the horizon, and more adversarial politics are in store
ahead of next year’s election, while regional risks linger. The reform of the loss-making
electricity sector must not falter this time around. Still wide-spread governance concerns
must be addressed and the business environment improved. Accessing international markets
must not endanger further fiscal consolidation while alternative anchors for policies need to
be found after the expiration of the current Fund-supported program. Populist economic
policy should be avoided ahead of the 2009 elections, while lingering risks to the regional
security situation place a premium on protecting macroeconomic and financial stability.
In the face of an unfavorable global inflation outlook, the monetary authorities
35.
need to stand ready to tighten again. Global and transition forces imply upward pressures
on prices in the near- and medium term. The emergence of any second round effects or a
deterioration of inflation expectations require a resumption of the tightening cycle. Moreover,
regulatory and supervisory measures must provide essential flanking support.
Beyond monetary policy, demand pressures should be contained through fiscal
36.
policy. The 2008 budget mid-year review maintains an appropriately neutral fiscal stance
from 2007 with a deficit ceiling of 5.2 percent of GDP. Moreover, now is not the time to
implement large wage increases and risk launching a potential wage-price inflation feedback
loop.
The medium-term economic outlook remains favorable but a wavering of
37.
policies would be costly. Growth is projected to remain buoyant at some 6 percent through
2013 and appropriate macroeconomic policies and attendant further gains in policy credibility
are expected to keep inflation low. However, without further business friendly reforms,
growth would fall progressively below the baseline, while debt sustainability would be
imperiled. A second round of structural reforms to improve the business environment is thus
called for and requires steadfast implementation and tailoring to evolving institutions and
capacity.
At present, there are no major concerns about competitiveness and external
38.
stability. The lek is independently floating, the recent widening of the current account deficit
is explained by temporary factors, competitiveness is holding up, and macroeconomic
policies are generally supportive of external sustainability. It will be important to ensure that
monetary, fiscal, and structural policies are used actively to safeguard external and financial

31
sector stability, particularly in light of the authorities’ plans to rely more on international
capital markets in the future.
While the banking system appears sound, mitigating risks to financial stability
39.
requires vigilance on several fronts. The recent MCM TA recommendations need to be
fully implemented on top of other recent and already planned prudential and regulatory
measures. Of particular importance are improving BoA’s cross-border supervisory
collaboration with the home-country supervisors of resident foreign banks; speeding up work
on contingency planning for crisis management; and resolving problems in collateral
valuation and execution. Domestic markets need to be deepened to reduce rollover risk and
broaden the investor base.
Further fiscal consolidation would best be anchored through a clear and
40.
transparent fiscal rule. Given the authorities’ preference for a small government, an
expenditure-based fiscal rule could be appropriate provided it maintained claw-back
mechanisms in case of upward deviations from the planned debt consolidation path. The
Sixth Review will provide an opportunity to discuss the nature of the fiscal anchor after the
expiration of the current arrangements.
Within a fiscal consolidation path, fiscal policy can redress still high
41.
development needs. A stable macroeconomic environment is a sine qua non for sustaining
economic development. Fiscal policy has a role in providing an enabling environment for
private-sector led growth, delivering essential public goods and a targeted safety net while
maintaining supply-side friendly tax policies and improving tax administration; arresting the
recent growth of current expenditure; cutting back capital overbudgeting; and strengthening
implementation capacity.
The public utility’s financial performance needs to finally be brought back into
42.
the black. Quasi-fiscal losses amounted to 2.4 percent of GDP in 2007, equivalent to the
health budget. Following the recent tariff increase, tackling deep-seated problems is key if
another tariff increase is to be avoided: chronic theft must be forcefully dealt with, personnel
cost and imports limited, and investment prioritized. Doing so would also facilitate the plan
to privatize the distribution arm of KESH in 2008.
The authorities’ intention to improving statistics is appropriate. To maximize the
43.
yield of IMF TA, it will be crucial to address the lack of skilled staff and insufficient
resources.
Given the strong program performance and the authorities’ commitments, staff
44.
recommends completion of the Fifth Review under the PRGF/EFF-supported program
and the financing assurances review, as well as modification of three performance
criteria for end-September 2008.

32
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Albania remain on a
45.
24-month cycle in line with the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles in program
countries.

Appendix I: Public and External Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)1
Update
Over the past five years Albania’s debt sustainability has continued to improve—domestic
debt maturities have lengthened and the public debt to GDP ratio has remained on a
downward path. Nevertheless, it remains relatively high at 54 percent of GDP and domestic
debt rollover at 424 days is still short by comparison with other countries. Looking ahead, as
long as an adequate fiscal anchor is in place, debt looks set to remain on a sustainable path;
it is expected to decline to below 50 percent of GDP by 2011 and, following a one-off
increase in 2008, external debt falls back gradually. However, debt remains susceptible to
shocks—notably to rollover risk, as well as growth and external shocks. Furthermore, as the
authorities seek to access international capital markets, the debt position could change much
more rapidly than seen in the past and will be subject to much larger uncertainties. The
lower growth scenario—with a lesser reform effort and wavering fiscal discipline—
illustrates how easily the relatively benign picture of debt sustainability could be thrown off
course.
External and Total Public Debt Sustainability
Despite an increase in 2008, the external debt ratio remains relatively low at
19.7 percent of GDP and is expected to decline over the medium term. The increase in
external debt in 2008 is a result of a one-off increase in commercial borrowing to finance a
large road project (the Rreshen Kalimash road). The increase remains within the ceiling for
nonconcessional borrowing in the IMF program and is not expected to be repeated. The
authorities’ commitment to reduce total public debt to 50 percent of GDP by the medium
term is consistent with a fall back in the external debt ratio beginning in 2009.
The DSA suggests that external debt sustainability will be easily maintained. On current
assumptions—which include declining debt concessionality, a gradual slowdown in
remittances, and somewhat lower export growth in later years—retaining sustainability looks
easily manageable as external debt declines on an NPV basis to below 16 percent of GDP in
the medium term (Appendix Table 3). Despite the shift to less concessional debt, the
projected public debt service ratio declines from 14 percent of revenues in 2008 to between
8 and 10 percent in the medium term. Over the forecast horizon we assume that FDI
gradually becomes more important as a source of financing for investment and the private
1

The assumptions underlying the DSA are little changed from the previous assessment: Real GDP growth of
around 6 percent, inflation 3 percent and an appreciation of the real effective exchange rate of ¾ percent per
year. Export growth at 8-13 percent over the forecast horizon is considerably lower than the historical average of
around 30 percent, since this included a period of transition and catch up. FDI is expected to increase gradually
over the forecast horizon, reaching 5.3 percent of GDP.

47
sector increasingly takes on external debt. The probability of a relatively low level of external
debt distress is supported by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment
(CPIA), which links the quality of a country’s policies and institutions to thresholds for debt
sustainability. The CPIA classifies Albania as a medium performer—but very close to being
upgraded to the high performer level, falling just 0.1 percentage point short. External debt
remains well below the indicative sustainability thresholds of NPV of debt to GDP of
40 percent and debt to exports of 150 percent.2
The total public debt ratio falls below 50 percent of GDP in 2011 and declines over the
forecast horizon such that the debt ratio is close to 32 percent of GDP by 2028
(Appendix Table 1). This is predicated on restraint of public expenditure (kept to below
30 percent of GDP), a further gradual increase in revenue collection, and the fiscal deficit
narrowing from 5.2 percent of GDP in 2008 to below 4 percent of GDP beginning in 2009.
Looking further ahead the public sector deficit stabilizes at 2.2 percent of GDP from
2013 onward. Under these conditions, total public debt remains on a sustainable downward
path, although the public sector debt to GDP ratio remains above the indicative CPIA
threshold until 2017. This points to the importance of continued efforts towards debt
reduction.
However, public debt remains vulnerable to an export or growth shock, or to a lapse in
fiscal policy. While the stress tests show that external debt remains sustainable under a
number of standard shocks, it still appears vulnerable to an export shock, which moves the
debt to export ratio to above 100 percent (Appendix Table 4 and Appendix Figure 2).
Furthermore, the low growth scenario (see paragraph 15) shows how a lower growth path,
combined with a lack of fiscal discipline, quickly results in a rising rather than falling path
for the public debt to GDP ratio (Appendix Table 2 and Appendix Figure 1).
Moreover, increased commercial borrowing brings new risks—such as higher costs
associated with the under-execution of capital spending and sudden reversals in risk
appetite. To date, external debt has been largely contracted from bilateral and multilateral
institutions and so debt has accumulated only at the pace at which the authorities are able to
execute capital spending—foreign-financed capital spending has been very low relative to
each year’s budget projections. With commercial borrowing, the under-execution of capital
spending no longer provides a binding constraint on the accumulation of debt. Instead, debt is
contracted at issue and interest costs are incurred regardless of whether the proceeds are
spent. As Albania prepares to shift to more commercial financing, the capacity to accurately
2

The Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rates countries against a set of 16 criteria grouped in
four clusters: (i) economic management; (ii) structural policies; (iii) policies for social inclusion and equity; and
(iv) public sector management and institutions. Albania scores relatively highly for economic management and
structural policies but has lower scores for policies for social inclusion and public sector management.

48
project capital spending needs, and to implement capital spending, thus becomes even more
important. Moreover, potential exposure to risk appetite reversals heightens the need for a
clear and credible fiscal anchor that is communicated effectively to the markets. Finally, debt
management capacities need to be strengthened to ensure that the risk and cost trade-offs are
adequately analyzed.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in Euro terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate ch
4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the NPV of new debt).

VII. Safeguards Assessments:
The Bank of Albania (BoA) was subject to a safeguards assessment with respect to current
arrangements. The most recent assessment was completed on July 14, 2006 and found that
some weaknesses exist in the central bank's safeguards framework. The main
vulnerabilities identified by the assessment concern the quality of the external audit,
oversight of the external and internal audit functions and the system of internal controls,
and certain weaknesses in the controls over the Fund data reporting process. The
assessment recommended measures to alleviate these weaknesses. The authorities have

56
already taken steps to improve the external audit process, and staff will monitor their
implementation of the remaining recommendations.
VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangement:
On July 1, 1992 the Albanian authorities adopted a floating exchange rate system
(an independent float). Under the Fund’s de facto exchange rate regime classification,
Albania follows an independently floating exchange rate regime—although the monetary
authorities occasionally intervene in the foreign exchange market with the objective of
smoothing temporary fluctuations. Albania’s exchange rate arrangement is free from
exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to Fund jurisdiction under
Article VIII. However, the country still avails itself of the transitional arrangements under
Article XIV and maintains exchange restrictions in the form of outstanding debit balances
on inoperative bilateral payment agreements, which were in place before Albania became a
Fund member. These relate primarily to debt in nonconvertible and formerly
nonconvertible currencies, which the authorities expect to resolve by end-2008. Albania
has not imposed new restrictions under Article VIII. The exchange rate stood at Lek
78.6 per U.S. dollar at end-May, 2008.
IX. Article IV Consultation:
The conclusion of the 2006 Article IV consultation and the first review under the
PRGF/EFF-supported program took place in July 2006 (IMF Country Report No. 06/286).
Albania moved from a 12-month cycle to a 24-month cycle, in line with the decision on
consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002. The last Article XIV Consultation was
concluded in December 2005.
X. FSAP Participation and ROSCs:
An FSAP was carried out in early 2005. The Financial System Stability Assessment was
considered by the Executive Board on August 1, 2005 concurrently with the staff report for
the sixth review of the PRGF-supported program and financing assurances review. An
action plan for implementing the FSAP recommendations has been prepared in
consultation with the IMF and is currently being implemented. A data module ROSC was
published on the Fund’s website in June 2000. A fiscal ROSC was completed in June
2003. Albania participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), and a
complete set of GDDS metadata for the external, financial, fiscal, and real sectors, as well
as for the socio-demographic indicators is posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board (http://dsbb.imf.org). A data module ROSC reassessment using the Data
Quality Assessment Framework was conducted in March 2006.

57
XI. Technical Assistance:
The Fund, other multilateral organizations and donors have provided extensive assistance
for institutional development in Albania. The Fund alone has sent several technical
assistance missions to Albania every year since 1991. The extent and focus of Fund TA
over the past two years is briefly reviewed below.
Technical assistance from MCM has focused on two main areas: monetary policy and
banking supervision. In the monetary policy area, a resident advisor assisted the Bank of
Albania during the initial transition to an implicit inflation targeting regime. This was
followed by short expert visits that focused on monetary policy decision processes, as well
as more technical background work such as modeling and forecasting. The results of the
TA have been favorable, with a significant boost in quality of the monetary policy
decision-making process, as evidenced, inter alia, by inflation performance as well as
research output. In the banking supervision area, following assistance in the
implementation of a Supervisory Development Plan through 2005, TA missions have
helped the authorities focus on stress testing, rapid credit growth and other emerging
issues. A mission in February 2008 focused on assisting the authorities to draw up an
action plan for the further development of their banking supervisory practices. Ongoing
assistance with the implementation of a credit registry contributed to the successful
inauguration of the registry at end-2007. Assistance has also been recently provided to
assist in the creation of a delivery-versus-payments system for secondary market sales of
government securities.
Recent technical assistance from FAD has concentrated in two main areas: tax
administration and debt management. In strengthening tax administration, Fund TA
covered improving the large taxpayer operations, review of computerization program, and
transfer of responsibility for the collection of social insurance contributions from Social
Insurance Institute to the General Department of Taxation. FAD also provided assistance
on reform and development of public debt management, including the strategic, legal and
institutional framework, development of domestic securities market and the integration of
debt and cash management.
Recent technical assistance from LEG included help legislative drafting and supervisory
guidance for AML/CFT and banking supervision, and for amendments to the Central Bank
Law—and related agency agreements between the Bank of Albania and the Ministry of
Finance.
Technical assistance from STA covered national income accounts, balance of payments,
consumer price index, and data dissemination. While a previous resident technical expert
financed by the Fund helped official statistical agency improve national accounts coverage
to informal sector, a new peripatetic technical assistance project has started in February

58
2008 to increase frequency and enhance accuracy of these accounts. In strengthening
balance of payments statistics, Fund TA supported the rapid progress with regard to the
accuracy and frequency of data. However, poor source data constitutes a problem in
making further progress especially in analyzing current transfers. A Fund mission assisted
the authorities in updating the basket of goods used to calculate the CPI index. A data
ROSC mission visited Albania in March 2006. While Albania is successfully subscribes to
GDDS, the authorities have expressed their intension of subscribing to the SDDS. A recent
TA mission has evaluated the requirements for the SDDS and concluded that the main
obstacle is the lack of quarterly national accounts data. A recent mission also assisted the
authorities in updating and rebasing the consumer price index.
Generally, the authorities welcomed the technical assistance from the Fund and made
extensive efforts to adopt the TA recommendations. However, further institutional
development is required in virtually every sector.
IX. Resident Representative:
A Fund resident representative has been posted in Tirana since April 1993.
Ms. Ann-Margret Westin has filled this position since August 2005.

59
Appendix III: World Bank Relations
Partnership in Albania's Development Strategy

The Republic of Albania has been a member of the World Bank since 1991. Since then, the
WBG has provided strong support to Albania, including 69 loans mostly in IDA
commitments totaling US$954.1 million, IFC commitments ofUS$125 million, and MIGA
guarantees totaling US$8.6 million. The quality of the active portfolio has continued to
improve, with an increasing focus on long-term capacity development and implementation
through Government structures.
The World Bank's Board approved the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Albania for
FY06-FY09 in January 2006. The CAS builds on the experience of the World Bank Group
(WBG) since the early 1990s (through three CASS).1 The CAS presents a program of support
which seeks to build on the improved macro-economic management and progress in
structural reforms that has occurred since 2002. It aims to support Albania's National Strategy
for Social and Economic Development (NSSED) and the European Union (EU) Stabilization
and Association process (SAP) with the ultimate objective of EU integration and the
attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
The government approved the new National Strategy for Development and Integration
(in March 2007) and is committed to better address the link between the strategic planning
process, the Medium Term Budget Program (MTBP) and the annual budget in the context of
newly established Integrated Planning System (IPS). The IPS aims to allow the Government
of Albania (GoA) to prioritize its expenditures based on a national strategy that focuses on
the European Integration agenda. A government executed multi-donor trust fund (MDTF) has
been established with financing from various donors in order to ensure increased and
transparent linkage between NSDI objectives and government policy and budget allocations
and expenditures
Bank Group Strategy

Reflecting Government priorities, the CAS (2006–09) program seeks to support Albania's
efforts in strengthening governance, sustaining a private sector-led growth and improving
service delivery. The CAS recognizes that more coherent efforts need to be made to address
the challenge of poor governance in Albania, and introduces a 'Governance Filter'
compromising of four core principles which will be used to ensure that governance

1

The 'Bank' refers to the IBRD and IDA and the 'World Bank Group' generally refer to the Bank, IFC, FIAS and
MIGA.

60
considerations are mainstreamed into all of the Bank's interventions. The CAS program is
also more selective, focused on two pillars:
I. Continued Economic Growth through Support to Private Sector Development, with
expected outcomes including (a) macroeconomic stability; (b) improved business climate
through better quality of business regulations and improved public-private sector dialogue;
(c) improved public infrastructure; (d) increased operational efficiency of financial
institutions; (e) improved functioning of the land market; (f) improved corporate governance;
(g) increased transparency and efficiency in the management of public spending and stronger
institutions for planning, tendering and providing infrastructure and services; (h) better
accountability in public administration; and (i) better management and planning for Albanian
coastal resources.
II. Improving Public Service Delivery, particularly in the Social Sectors, with expected
outcomes including: (a) improved educational attainment and quality of basic education;
(b) improved efficiency and equity of health financing; (c) better quality of health care;
(d) improved fiscal sustainability of the social insurance system and increased access to welltargeted, sustainable, and effective assistance; and (e) improved access to safe rural water
supply and sanitation.
The CAS proposes a lending range of US$ 75–US$ 196 million, with actual lending to be
determined by the pace of reform in key sectors. The proposed lending program is financed
by a blend of IDA and IBRD resources, with gradual transition from IDA to IBRD beginning
in FY06. Up to 11 IDA/IBRD lending operations are proposed in FY06-FY09, of which three
would be a series of programmatic Development Policy Operations (DPO) building on the
success of the PRSC series in the previous CAS. The CAS employs also targeted program of
WBG Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) support. A project on improving the
secondary and local roads is expected to be approved by the Board in June. Another project
on the safety of dams is expected to be approved later in 2008. A CAS Progress Report (CAS
PR) is expected for presentation to Board in June 2008.
The active World Bank portfolio includes 19 investment projects with a total commitment of
$311.5million, of which about $275.3 million remain to be disbursed. The investment side of
the Bank's portfolio has performed well. Three projects were approved by the Board in 2006:
(i) Albania Avian Flu; (ii) BERIS; and (iii) Education Excellence and Equity Project (June 1).
Two new projects have been approved in February 2007, the Transport Project and the Land
Administration and Management Project. The first Development Policy Operation (DPO)
was approved on March 29, 2007. A new project on Secondary and Local Roads was
approved on June 3rd, 2008.

61
Bank-Fund Collaboration in Specific Areas

As in previous periods, the World Bank assistance for structural reform in Albania will
continue supporting the IMF's lead role on support for macro-economic policies aimed at
facilitating sustainable growth. Continuing collaboration is likely to become even more
critical given that most of the outstanding areas for reform remain on the structural side. In
areas of direct interest to the IMF, the Bank is engaging in policy dialogue and providing
financial and technical assistance to support (i) improved public expenditure management;
(ii) public sector reform; (iii) pension, health and social assistance reform; (iv) financial
sector reform and development; and (v) an improved policy environment for business.
Public expenditure management: Albania's systems of Public Financial Management
(PFM) and related fiscal institutions constitute a main risk for macroeconomic stability and
high quality fiscal adjustment. Over the past years, the Bank has complemented IMF policy
conditionality and technical assistance with a multi-pronged assistance program including
lending operations and fiduciary and diagnostic work. Under the new CAS, the Bank will
continue its support to the GoA through the ongoing Programmatic Public Expenditure and
Institutional Review (PEIR) and the Country Fiduciary Assessment Update (CFAU-FY06).
These have identified key weaknesses in the PFM system and provide the underlying analysis
for defining policy reform conditionality in the Development Policy Operation (DPO) that
focus on public investment management.

To increase the effectiveness of public expenditure and public financial management system,
the World Bank will support a number of measures to further improve the strategic allocation
of resources mainly through the support to the implementation of the Integrated Planning
System (IPS); improving the linkages between recurrent and investment spending and
strengthening the rigorous review of public investment projects based on economic and
financial criteria.
Public sector reform: The civil service and broader public sector employment structures
require continued engagement and support. The Bank and IMF will need to work closely to
ensure that an appropriate framework remains in place to allow the Government to move
ahead with efforts to (a) strengthen accountability mechanisms for public entities, both
Ministries and subordinated agencies, rendering them more efficient; (b) increase
competitiveness of the salary structure and the ability of the civil service to attract skilled and
competent professionals; and (c) consolidate and deepen the measures aimed at the
depoliticization of the civil service, both through improved adherence to the requirements of
the Civil Service Law, as well as through a cautious, measured expansion of the Civil Service
Law in a manner that is fiscally responsible. As deeper reform of public administration is
currently anticipated through the CAS period, the Bank through the DPO continues to engage
on civil service reform.

62
Power sector reform: While the Bank has taken the lead in developing the policy agenda,
the sector's fiscal impact has also motivated conditionality in previous IMF-PRGF
arrangements. Since mid-2006, KESH's financial situation has deteriorated significantly as a
result of the following factors: (a) severe shortage in electricity supply in the region which led
to a significant rise in import electricity prices; (b) unfavorable hydrology since late 2006;
(c) a suboptimal management of hydro resources in the last quarter of 2006; and (d) poor
performance of the utility as indicated by low collection rates and large losses. The hydrology
and reservoirs management have improved in 2008. The World Bank believes that the tariff
increase effected in March 2008 is delayed and insufficient. This and large unpaid electricity
consumption continue to hamper KESH’s financial situation, which puts the company’s
investments as well as operational performance at risk. The Bank had to suspend the
preparation of an investment project for KESH’s distribution because a satisfactory Action
Plan for 2008-2010 is yet to be agreed with KESH and the Government. KESH’s financial
situation remains precarious and is expected to register significant operating losses in 2008 as
well. Conditionality related to improving sector performance, sector restructuring, and
strengthening the regulatory and legislative framework is included in successive Bankfinanced projects. On-going projects include the Power Sector Generation and Restructuring
Project (2004) that will provide new thermal generation capacity (expected to be operation in
2009) and is co-financed by EBRD and EIB; and the ECSEE APL2¬Albania Project (2005)
that is co-financed by EBRD and will finance the upgrading of the high-voltage transmission
substations, thereby facilitating Albania's participation in the Energy Community of South
East Europe (ECSEE). The World Bank will present to its board an IDA Credit to address
safety issues of the country’s Hydroelectric Dams in June 2008.
Social Insurance Reforms: The financial stability of the social insurance system and the
coverage and targeting of the social assistance system are key components of medium term
fiscal consolidation. Both the Bank and the IMF have focused on pension reform under the
PRSC and PRGF programs, including the increase of the retirement age for men and women.
The short-term agenda will focus on strengthening the financial sustainability of the existing
pension scheme while aiming for a reduction of the overall payroll tax burden in the medium
term so as to help improve competitiveness of Albanian labor. The Bank is supporting SII in
developing its capacity to model medium- and long-term impacts of policy changes on the
fiscal sustainability of the social insurance system and to identify a sustainable path for future
reforms to the social insurance system. The Bank and the IMF are supporting such reforms in
a coordinated fashion. They will also work closely to ensure that essential pre-conditions for
future structural reforms to the pension system will be put in place, including strengthening
of the financial markets.
Financial sector reform and development. Albania has made significant progress towards
the adoption of a market-based economy with the support of the World Bank and the IMF.
The Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FSAC), approved by the Board in June 2002, has
helped to advance reforms in the banking sector, including the privatization of the Savings

63
Bank, the development of a deposit insurance system, improvement of the bankruptcy
framework and collateral enforcement, strengthening of bank regulation and supervision, and
the development of a Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system.
The WBG in conjunction with the IMF are assisting the Government in the completion of the
financial sector reform agenda and support the implementation of the recommendations of
the 2005 Joint IMF-World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). The DPO is
providing support for policy measures aimed at the (i) adoption of a legal, institutional and
supervisory framework enabling sound development of the non-banking financial sector,
including the insurance sector; (ii) strengthening insurance supervision and regulation; and
(iii) adoption and implementation of an ED—compatible legal and institutional framework
for accounting and auditing.
This reform agenda is being coordinated with European Commission institutions, especially
in those elements of the reform agenda, such as accounting and auditing, for which the acquis
communautaire is relevant.
Improving the business environment. Improving the business environment will be crucial
to overcome high levels of unemployment, attract the badly needed investment flows, and
boost exports. Complementing the IMF dialogue on macro-economic stability and its
technical and advisory assistance to strengthening tax administration, the Bank is using a
combination of instruments. These include the Business Environment Reform and
Institutional Strengthening and the Land Management and Urban Development projects in
conjunction with the DPO to support improvements in the business climate, through (i) the
adoption and implementation of regulatory governance tools aimed at improving the quality
of business-sector related regulations; (ii) establishment and operations of a Secretariat for
Regulatory Reforms for the removal of administrative barriers to investment; and
(iii) adoption and implementation of a transparent land registration system.

Appendix IV: Statistical Issues

Overall data provided to the Fund are adequate for surveillance, although further
improvements in some areas are needed. Albania was a pilot country for the data
dissemination module of the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC),
and a data ROSC was published on the IMF’s external website in May 2000.1 Albania
participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS).
A March 2006 data ROSC reassessment mission assessed data quality in six areas of
macroeconomic statistics (national accounts, consumer price index, producer price index,
government finance, monetary, and balance of payments statistics) based on the DQAF
(July 2003), and reassessed data dissemination practices against the GDDS. At the request of
the authorities, the mission also conducted an assessment of dissemination practices against
the SDDS and prepared a work program and timetable for meeting the requirements for
SDDS subscription. The data ROSC report was published on the IMF’s external website in
October 2006.
A further review of progress towards SDDS subscription was carried out in October 2007.
The mission found that the Bank of Albania (BoA) has started disseminating draft versions of
the Advance Release Calendar and the National Summary Data Page, covering data from the
Institute of Statistics (INSTAT), the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and the BoA. The mission
concluded that Albania would be ready for SDDS subscription within 12 to 18 months,
assuming that the current momentum in improving data can be maintained. The main
obstacles are in real sector statistics, and the ongoing peripatetic technical assistance project
will be important in overcoming them.
The ROSC reassessment mission found significant progress in adopting international
statistical standards despite acute resource constraints. Official statistical agencies
demonstrate strong and sustained commitment to plans and programs to further upgrade
statistics in response to greater challenges posed by: (i) a rapidly evolving economy; (ii) the
adoption of an inflation targeting regime; and (iii) growing national interest in joining the
European Union. However, due to severe resource constraints at INSTAT, the improvement
in the national accounts has been slower relative to other datasets.
The Law on Official Statistics (2004) strengthened the legal framework for INSTAT as an
independent agency under the Council of Ministers, and articulated the role of the Statistics
Council as INSTAT’s governing body. In addition, planned Memoranda of Understandings
between INSTAT, the MoF and the BoA should facilitate data sharing and coordination
among these agencies.

This data ROSC was completed before the formal adoption of the Data Quality Assessment Framework.

65
A. Real Sector
Price statistics

The consumer price index (CPI) is reported regularly for publication in the International
Financial Statistics (IFS). In 2001, a revision of CPI weights was initiated by INSTAT based
on a new household budget survey; the revised index was finalized in February 2002. The
compilation of the CPI generally follows international standards, and the estimation of
imputed rent within the CPI was improved in 2003.The limited coverage of the 2000
Household Budget Survey (HBS) (only urban areas) combined with a rapid change of the
structure of the economy and consumption patterns put a priority on new CPI weights. The
recent ROSC mission recommended (i) introduction of checks on the prices reported by
enumerators; (ii) replacement of nonrespondents to the HBS with similar households; and
(iii) inclusion of new items in the CPI as they become significant.
In December 2007, INSTAT has updated the CPI weights using the results of a new nationallevel HBS conducted during the period October 2006-September 2007. A November 2007
STA mission assisted the authorities in resolving compilation issues for the new CPI.
A monthly producer price index (PPI) has been published quarterly since March 2002. Prices
are not collected each month, but only once a quarter, due to financial constraints. The
weights were derived from the 1998 annual Structural Business Survey. The ROSC mission
recommended (i) monthly publication of the PPI; (ii) replacement of enterprises that go out of
business; and (iii) validation of the PPI results against other available price data.
National accounts

National accounts are compiled from insufficient source data that are hampered by poor
questionnaire design (e.g., Structural Business Survey), limited area coverage (e.g., HBS),
and insufficient frequency of surveys. While technical assistance has been provided on
methodological procedures, source data still do not provide sufficient information to compile
reliable estimates on the nonobserved economy. In November 2005, INSTAT released major
revisions of the GDP estimates (for 1996–2003) and updates for 2004, reflecting
methodological improvements.
The ROSC reassessment mission recommended (i) improvement of source data to adequately
capture the nonobserved economy; (ii) expansion of the scope of annual national accounts to
include the income account, the capital account, and the rest of the world accounts; and
(iii) improvement of the timeliness of GDP data (currently 11 months) so as to meet the
9-month recommendation of the GDDS. INSTAT needs additional staff and financial
resources to fully carry out its statistical work program.

66
In November 2004 and March 2005 STA missions assisted the authorities in improving the
timeliness of the annual estimates and in developing quarterly national accounts. INSTAT
has benefited from technical assistance from the Fund and the European Union (EU), mainly
to address weaknesses in methodology, basic data sources, and incomplete coverage of the
private sector. STA concluded a technical assistance project in March 2006 for which the
Italian government agreed to commit $500,000 from its sub-account with the IMF over a
period of two years. The project was aimed at further improving the national accounts
estimates and basic source data. The Italian National Institute of Statistics (Istat) and the
National Statistics Office of Finland (Statistics Finland) provided technical assistance to
INSTAT following the project contract. In addition, STA is currently providing additional
technical assistance through peripatetic missions during 2008–09 for the improvement of the
annual accounts and the establishment of a compilation system of quarterly GDP estimates.
The first of these peripatetic missions, conducted in February 2008, concluded that INSTAT
was not in a position to compile reliable quarterly estimates of GDP and significant further
work is needed to increase the capability of the local staff, who lack experience in
interpreting and analyzing economic data. Although some experimental quarterly GDP
estimates have been compiled, the second mission undertaken in May 2008 strongly
recommended INSTAT management to withhold release of the quarterly figures until
compilation attains soundness.
External trade

The compilation and dissemination of foreign trade data has improved in recent years,
following disruptions in the late 1990s. One important contributing factor has been the
implementation of the Automated System of Customs Data (ASYCUDA) software system,
supported by the EU. Further progress is expected in the area of trade in services as a result
of the implementation of surveys.
B. Government Finance

Government finance statistics (GFS) generally follow internationally accepted standards and
guidelines on concepts and definitions, scope, classification and sectorization, and basis for
recording vis-à-vis the Government Finance Statistics Manual 1986 (GFSM 1986). The
scope of the general government sector is in line with the GFSM 1986 and encompasses
budgetary central government, (about 1520 individual budget institutions), local government
(about 2160 units), and two extrabudgetary funds (the social security fund and the health
insurance fund).
The Organic Budget Law and the Guidelines on State Budget Performance clearly provide
the MoF with a mandate to compile and disseminate government finance statistics. The main
data sources, which are timely, are reports of (i) District Treasury Offices; (ii) the Debt
Management and Financial Analysis System; (iii) project implementation units for foreign

67
financed projects; and (iv) the extrabudgetary funds. External donor financed-projects that do
not pass through the treasury system, represent a weakness in source data. Following the
ROSC mission’s recommendation that MoF accelerate work aimed at formally adopting the
GFSM 2001-based reporting format and improve source data coverage for external donorfinanced projects, the authorities have recently begun reporting quarterly fiscal data for
publication in the International Financial Statistics using the GFSM 2001-based monthly
Statement of Sources and Uses of Cash. Albania has submitted fiscal data to the Fund for
publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook for 2001–06.
C. Monetary Accounts

The monetary data compilation framework conforms to the methodology recommended in
the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM), and data are compiled and
disseminated on a timely basis. The depository corporations’ survey covers the BoA and all
the other deposit-taking institutions (17 commercial banks and 130 savings and loans
associations (SLAs)). The accounts of the SLAs, with the exception of loans, are produced on
a cash basis, which contrasts with the MFSM’s recommendations of accrual accounting.
Another deviation from the MFSM’s methodology is that the BoA’s and commercial banks’
holdings of nontradable long-term securities are recorded at book value.
In January 2005, the BoA began reporting its monetary data to STA using Standardized
Report Forms (SRFs). The monetary data in the SRFs format have been published in the
quarterly IFS Supplement since September 2006. The reporting of monetary data in the SRFs
format will facilitate the implementation of an integrated monetary database to be used for
both publication in IFS and for operational needs of EUR.
To further improve monetary statistics, the ROSC reassessment mission in 2006
recommended that the BoA (i) apply fully the MFSM’s recommendations on market
valuation and accrual accounting; (ii) implement measures to improve the accuracy of the
banks’ reporting; (iii) implement an electronic (online) reporting system for banks and other
financial institutions; and (iv) introduce a database driven compilation system for monetary
statistics. The authorities have informed STA of good progress towards implementing the
ROSC mission’s recommendations, particularly those related to the use of market valuation
and improvement of the accuracy of the commercial banks’ reporting.
D. Balance of Payments

The data compiled by the BoA are methodologically sound, although some of the estimates,
particularly for international transactions outside the banking system need to be refined. The
BoA has established data compilation procedures based on the classification system of the
fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. The BoA reports quarterly data to STA on a
regular and timely basis. It has revised the methodology for the measurement of tourism
services, principally through surveys of travelers. Problems remain in the areas of service

68
transactions and remittances, and in the monitoring of financial account transactions, foreign
assistance (grants from abroad to regional and local governments are underreported), and
external debt. These problems could be addressed by strengthening existing data sources and
improving estimation methods.
A November 2004 mission noted that the coverage and accuracy of the data should be
improved through the strengthening of the legal framework and the use of the bank reporting
system to verify data from enterprise surveys. It also recommended incorporating the results
of the direct investment survey as well as investigating the net errors and omissions observed
at the level of individual reporting banks. The February 2006 follow-up mission focused on
remittances, goods for processing, services (particularly travel services), official transfers,
and direct investment.
To further improve compilation and dissemination of statistics, the ROSC reassessment
mission recommended that BoA (i) improve source data to adequately capture remittances;
(ii) strengthen its law to: provide for the sanctions―including fines―needed to mandate
response to surveys by nonbank reporters, inspect the financial accounts of firms, and
prohibit the provision of individual reporter’s data to tax authorities; (iii) require quarterly
reporting by significant firms of transactions in direct investment equity, debt, and reinvested
earnings, in portfolio equity and debt, and in trade credit; and (iv) introduce a database driven
compilation system.
A September–October 2007 mission reviewed the remittances and travel service estimates
and reconciled the financial account and International Investment Position. The mission
noted strong progress in adopting earlier recommendations but advised that estimation
methods for transactions outside the banking system (mostly remittances and investment
transactions by nonresident Albanians) require further improvement.
E. External Debt and Grant Statistics

Good quality external debt statistics for public and publicly-guaranteed debt are compiled by
the MoF. The external debt database ensures timely and accurate reporting of external
government debt (including commitments of state-owned enterprises). However, there have
been some irregularities in the recording and presentation of old external arrears. The
External Debt Committee would need to improve inter-agency coordination to ensure the
timely and accurate reporting of the stock of external arrears and changes resulting from
rescheduling agreements. The collection of data on external grants is not timely, with lags of
several months frequently encountered. In consultation with donors, the authorities are

ATTACHMENT I

Tirana, July 11, 2008

Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street NW
Washington, D.C. 20431

Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:

The current Fund-supported program, approved in January 2006, remains broadly on track.
All quantitative and structural performance criteria have been observed and economic
prospects remain favorable, both from the near- and medium-term perspectives. Growth
continues to be buoyant, underlying inflation is low, and confidence in the currency and the
banking system remains strong. Debt is on a declining and sustainable path. In addition, past
and ongoing structural adjustment is now supplying tangible benefits to the economy. We
are, consequently, well placed to fully implement the policies and reform agenda described in
the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP). These policies are
consistent with our National Strategy for Development and Integration.
On this basis, we request completion of the financing assurances review, and completion of
both the fifth review under the three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
arrangement and the fifth review under the three-year Extended Fund Facility arrangement.
We also request the sixth disbursement and purchase under these arrangements in an
aggregate total amount of SDR 2.435 million.
We believe that the policies set forth in the attached MEFP are adequate to achieve the
objectives of the program, but will take any further measures that may become appropriate
for this purpose. Albania will consult with the Fund on the adoption of these measures, and in
advance of revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance with the Fund’s
policies on such consultation.
Following this arrangement, and as long as Albania has outstanding financial obligations to
the IMF arising from loan disbursements under the present arrangement, Albania will consult
with the IMF from time to time on economic and financial policies, at the initiative of the
government or the Bank of Albania, or if the Managing Director of the IMF requests such
consultation. These consultations may include correspondence and visits of officials of the
IMF to Albania or of representatives of Albania to the IMF.

71
In continuing with our policy of transparency, we consent to the publication of this letter, the
attached MEFP, and the accompanying Executive Board documents on the IMF’s website.

Sincerely yours,
/s/
Sali Berisha
Prime Minister

72
Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) for Albania
I. BACKGROUND AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

1.
This memorandum provides a detailed description of our policies over the remainder
of the 2006–09 program period. It is fully consistent with our National Strategy for
Development and Integration (NSDI), which was approved in February 2008.
Our macroeconomic performance since the previous Article IV consultations has
2.
been solid. We have enjoyed a prolonged period of rapid, non-inflationary growth despite the
weather-induced disruptions of 2007. Production is becoming broader based as agriculture
recovers from the last year’s drought and the supply of electricity improves; and our inflation
rate remains among the lowest in the region. Prudent fiscal policy was maintained and the
public debt burden has been reduced from 58 percent in 2005 to 53 percent of GDP at end
2007, reflecting fiscal consolidation, rapid economic growth, and the allocation of half the
proceeds of large privatizations to debt reduction. In 2008, the strong performance of exports
continued, partly reflecting rapid expansion of new export products such as chromium. Still,
the current account is likely to deteriorate by ½ percent of GDP as a result of adverse terms of
trade, while this year’s imports are again temporarily boosted by machinery and equipment
needed for the construction of the large road project.
But cost pressures are building. Despite low underlying demand pressure on prices,
3.
higher food and energy prices again drove headline inflation above the BoA’s target band in
March through May 2008. However, the combination of 5 successive 25 basis points
increases in the BoA’s policy rate since mid-2006 and regulatory tightening staved off second
round effects, leaving inflationary expectations well anchored at low levels.

4.
Tax revenue has over performed budget projections. Personal income tax, VAT
and corporate tax collections have been particularly strong. In response to the introduction of
the flat tax and the reference wage, personal income tax collections more than doubled in the
first quarter of 2008. Despite the reduction of the corporate tax rate, revenues did not decline
as projected, as the number of corporate tax payers increased. At the same time, strong
nominal growth, imports, and sales, but also administrative improvements, are boosting
VAT.
We have also made progress in structural reform, though this has lagged
5.
somewhat our success on the macroeconomic front. We implemented reforms in tax and
customs administration, debt management and the financial system; and improved the
statistical and legal frameworks. However, poor payment discipline and attendant losses in
the electricity sector continue.
•

Tax administration: More than half of the eligible taxpayers have already started
using the Large Taxpayers Office (LTO). Following our campaign to increase the
number of social security contributors, the number of contributors has increased by
30,000 in the first quarter of 2008. We have also moved to pay VAT refund claims

73
automatically if validity checks are met (SB, end-April 2008). Finally, following an
intensive debate, Parliament has approved the new tax procedures law.
•

Public expenditure and debt management: We extended the maturity of domestic
public debt to an average 421 days in May 2008, thus reducing rollover risk. The new
IT system for conducting primary auctions of government securities has reduced
operational risk. We decreased the frequency of 3- and 6-month T-bill auctions to a
monthly basis, and started to publish the schedule for issuing government securities to
the market for the next quarter, which will stimulate additional use of the interbank
money market and the secondary market for government securities. We continue to
conduct independent feasibility studies for any large project (as defined in the
attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding—TMU) financed through
nonconcessional borrowing; provide a semi-annual listing and status of all projects
considered for nonconcessional financing; and prepare semi-annual reports on the
stock of external arrears (all SBs; ongoing). Parliament adopted the new organic
budget law.

•

Financial sector supervision: The credit registry became fully operational and has
been incorporated into our off-site examination procedures. It is used by banks in
credit decisions, and by the BoA to improve risk management, assessment, and
monitoring of delinquent loan levels. The Council of Ministers has approved
legislation to transfer supervisory authority over leasing to the Bank of Albania (BoA)
and, in the first quarter of 2008, we introduced additional regulations mandating
improvements in banks’ internal audit systems and treatment of large exposures.

•

Electricity sector: The independent regulator (ERE) approved an around 19 percent
increase in electricity tariffs, which became effective in March 2008. In the first
quarter of 2008, we achieved a steady improvement in electricity losses, which were
cut by 5 percentage points to 36.3 percent, but the collection rate declined to
73.7 percent—implying that only 47 percent of all electricity supplied is paid, a level
far below that anywhere else in the region.
II. STRATEGY, OBJECTIVES, AND POLICIES

6.
Our medium-term economic strategy aims to maintain macroeconomic stability
and deliver continued strong, private sector-driven, growth. While macroeconomic and
financial sector stability are the essential prerequisites, rapid growth will also require
significant progress in raising governance, institutions, and infrastructure to norms of
advanced middle income countries.
•

Prudent and well-anchored fiscal policy is key to maintaining macroeconomic
stability. Continued adherence to our medium-term fiscal framework based on a
small but increasingly efficient government remains the cornerstone of our strategy.
To this effect, we are improving the efficiency of core activities and offloading
remaining noncore functions to the private sector. Going forward, we will also give
fiscal policy a greater role in demand management.

74
•

Our monetary policy framework will continue to be based on a 3±1 percent
inflation target band, supported by a flexible exchange rate. While changes to the
BoA repurchase rate will remain the main policy instrument, given the still
underdeveloped transmission mechanism, we will continue to use regulatory
measures to support monetary policy objectives and foster financial stability.

•

Improving the business climate and public infrastructure are essential to boost
the economy’s potential. Our program addresses deficiencies through a wide range
of institutional reforms, including with respect to the commercial court system and
real estate title registration. We will continue making good progress on enhancing
public infrastructure such as roads and ports. A private-sector dominated and
diversified electricity sector is critical to ensure a stable supply of electricity at low
cost.
A. Macroeconomic Framework

7.
The medium-term macroeconomic framework envisaged at the start of the year
remains appropriate. Over the medium term, growth is projected to surpass 6 percent,
beginning in 2008 as higher supply prices and the return of normal rainfall spur agriculture
production and other sectors of the economy benefit from a more stable supply of electricity.
Over time, better infrastructure, easing of market entry barriers, more competitive product
markets, and governance and administrative reforms will support the needed gains in total
factor productivity. Strengthening export growth, buoyant remittances, and declines in
electricity and road-related imports will decrease our reliance on foreign savings and allow
the current account deficit to return to more moderate and sustainable levels beginning in
2009.
The main risks to this framework arise from the global inflation and growth
8.
outlook, fiscal slippages, threats to financial stability, and incomplete reform in the
energy sector. We will therefore retain policy vigilance, including by ensuring a broadly
neutral fiscal stance, sufficient budgetary contingencies, proactive financial sector
supervision, and tight oversight over energy reform.
B. Fiscal Policy

9.
The 2008 mid-year budget review will contain the deficit at 5.2 percent of GDP.
This level avoids creation of a fiscal stimulus, when account is taken of the high import
content of the large road project. We will cover the budget costs of compensation for the
Gerdec explosion 0.2–0.3 percent of GDP from budgetary contingencies. To mitigate the
social impact of increased foodstuff prices, we will use the wage and pension contingency
(4.6 billion lek) to finance targeted subsidies to vulnerable segments of the population.
Conversely, to avoid fueling a wage-price inflation spiral, we will hold personnel
expenditures, including social insurance contributions, within the originally approved amount
of 68 billion lek. We will use the revenue over-performance to pay for the infrastructure
projects including recent cost overruns on the Rreshen-Kalimash road—whose total cost,
excluding VAT, is now projected to amount to €630 million. We will also maintain a

75
contingency of ¾ percent of GDP that will allow us to contain further fiscal risks, including
those resulting from any further cost overruns on the road and from KESH’s financial
difficulties. These contingencies would be assessed and reallocated at the next program
review. In addition, half the revenue of any unbudgeted privatization will continue to be used
to reduce public debt and the other half for expenditure on well-conceived investment
projects. Should the fiscal deficit target be in jeopardy, we stand ready, in consultation with
the Fund, to take appropriate actions, including offsetting reductions in other expenditure.
To signal our commitment to sound fiscal management, we will continue to
10.
reduce public debt, aiming to bring it below 50 percent of GDP over the medium term.
The annual implementation of this target will be carried out either through a cap on the
overall fiscal deficit or expenditure consistent with that objective. We will consult with the
Fund on the specific form of such rule best suited to Albania’s specific circumstances.
While changes in tax policy will be limited, further tax administration effort will
11.
be focused primarily on bringing actual collections in line with potential yields. We will
limit changes in tax policy in 2008 to increasing the property tax rate and the royalty tax
imposed on extraction of minerals, raising the infrastructure impact tax on newly constructed
buildings, further decentralizing certain national fees and charges to local governments, and
introducing a new local charge on nonagricultural land. We are on track to increase the
number of taxpayers paying social contributions (excluding contributions paid by agricultural
workers and voluntary contributors) to 410,000 by the end-July 2008 (SB). We will continue
to issue quarterly progress reports on the use of the risk assessment module of the
ASYCUDA system to perform inspections in customs (SB; ongoing).
Improving the implementation of capital projects remains a priority of public
12.
expenditure management. Following the introduction of the new public investment
management procedures and the new procurement law, we now focus on improving
ministries’ capacity to implement procedures. With external support, we are accelerating the
training of investment officers, and introducing an integrated planning system to allow ontime monitoring of all public investment projects and facilitate any eventual reallocation.
C. Reform of the Electricity Sector

13.
Apart from redressing financial losses in the electricity sector, we will also tackle
poor payment discipline and reduce vulnerability to weather shocks. We expect that
privatization of the distribution arm of KESH will enforce more payment discipline and
eliminate quasi-fiscal losses emanating from the power sector. We are also taking actions to
diversify domestic generation and more fully integrate Albania into the regional power grid.
We are progressing towards privatization. With assistance from USAID, we
14.
established the required market structure and regulations for full vertical unbundling of
KESH, and with assistance from the IFC, we have set up a program aimed at privatizing the
distribution arm before end–2008. We have finalized the methodology for tariff adjustment
and identified qualified bidders in June 2008. We are aware that the privatization agenda—
while technically feasible within 2008—is subject to complex risks. The Ministry of

76
Economy, Trade, and Energy is carefully monitoring the process to ensure close coordination
between KESH, the regulator, IFC, and donors.
A number of projects are underway to diversify electricity supply and further
15.
integrate into the regional networks. Construction of a thermal power plant with a total
cost of €97 million, financed jointly by the World Bank, EIB and EBRD, has already started.
The plant will increase power supply by 700 GWh a year upon completion in mid-2009. A
rehabilitation contract for the thermal power plant at Fier is under negotiation and will further
increase supply by 800 GWh at completion. Additionally, to increase private sector
involvement in generation, we are in the process of concessioning two new large hydro power
plants. Work on a new transmission line to Montenegro has begun with assistance from KfW
which, when completed in the second half of 2009, will significantly increase cross-border
transmission capacity.
Nevertheless, immediate measures to boost KESH’s cash flow are important. In
16.
addition to the recent increase in electricity tariffs, we have adopted a new action plan that
aims at raising the effective collection rate to 60 percent by further reducing distribution
losses to 32 percent and boosting collections to 89.6 percent. With higher technical losses in
winter, this is consistent with raising the effective collection rate to 62 percent by endOctober (SB). After clearing all past arrears of budgetary and non-budgetary institutions to
KESH in 2007, we will ensure that these institutions henceforth pay power bills in a timely
manner. KESH is expected to bill eligible customers at the higher regulated rate to recover
import cost and the distribution fee. We adopted sufficient measures to reduce the quasifiscal losses of KESH to below 1.2 percent of GDP in 2008 (SB; mid-June, 2008). These
measures include containing KESH’s personnel cost, limiting the electricity imports to 2100
GWh this year and limiting local investment at 2.7 billion lek. If needed, we will take further
measures to meet the quasi-fiscal losses target. These short-run improvements in the
company’s financing should also facilitate the privatization of the distribution arm.
D. Monetary, Exchange Rate, and Financial Sector Policies

17.
In the current less-benign global environment, our primary concern is to keep
inflationary expectations anchored at low levels. We will therefore react quickly to any
rise in underlying price pressures that might signal the emergence of second round effects,
including by proactively raising our policy rate if needed. We will also intensify our existing
policy of maintaining open and transparent communications with the market. With the fiscal
stance broadly neutral, a resurgence of credit growth and threats to financial stability remain
the principal risks; and we will therefore continue to supplement monetary policy actions
with efforts to further tighten the regulatory and supervisory environment to contain credit
growth and safeguard the quality of the loan portfolio.
We are pushing ahead with efforts to further strengthen regulation and
18.
supervision. Data indicate that the banking system remains solvent, liquid and profitable,
and point to only a slight deterioration in the level of nonperforming loans. We are mindful,
however, that this portfolio has never been tested by adverse economic conditions and that its
rapid growth can temporarily conceal an underlying deterioration. Also, collateral execution

77
remains weak, particularly as concerns residential housing which makes up an increasing
share of lending. During the remainder of 2008, we will implement the recommendations of
the February 2008 IMF technical assistance mission and carry out additional actions to
strengthen our capacity to safeguard the financial system. We will:
•

Improve the legal and operational framework for executing collateral, including
through changes to the Civil Code;

•

Further enhance cooperation between BoA and the home country supervisors of
resident foreign banks, with an aim to signing formal MOUs; and improve
cooperation between the respective domestic financial supervisory authorities and the
Ministry of Finance, in particular, to strengthen financial stability and contingency
planning for crisis management;

•

Enforce better monitoring and managing by banks of the indirect credit risk arising
from the extension of foreign currency loans to unhedged borrowers by increasing the
level of provisions required for such credit or assigning higher risk weights, setting
overall exposure limits to unhedged borrowers at 400 percent of regulatory capital,
and mandating that each bank establish a dedicated unit for risk management and
economic analysis.

•

Increase the transparency of banks towards their customers by mandating clear
explanations of the terms and conditions of contracts, including effective interest
rates, eliminating misleading marketing practices, and providing a mechanism for
dealing with customer complaints. In addition, we will insist on timely disclosure by
banks on various aspects of the bank’s activities, such as financial performance,
strategies and practices of risk administration, risk exposure, organizational structure;
and

•

Encourage further consolidation of the banking sector and clearly communicate this
goal to the market, including by issuing specific provisions governing mergers and
acquisitions. In the second half of the year, we will begin revising our regulations
governing consumer credit, corporate governance, bank conservatorship and
liquidation, and the construction of the capital adequacy ratio.

We will further improve the financial sector architecture. By end-October we will
19.
complete the development of a delivery versus payment (DVP) system for all forms of
government securities (SB). As this system will include the capacity to execute private party
repurchase agreements, it is expected to improve volumes in the interbank market which,
though growing, remain relatively small due in part to perceived credit risk. The purchase and
implementation of a fully automated central securities depository IT system is expected to be
completed—with IMF assistance—by mid-2009.
We will ensure that the BoA has a sound balance sheet and adequate level of
20.
capital. We will continue to build up the BoA reserve fund to prudent levels, and work
towards adopting international best accounting practices in the calculation of BoA profits.

78
We will make securities issued to compensate BoA for unrealized valuation losses fully
marketable by end-September. We will take no legislative or regulatory action that weakens
the independence of the BoA, including its control over its budget and its authority to decide
on compensation levels.
21.
We will continue reforms in the nonbank financial sector. We will review and
update all insurance laws and regulations by early 2009, with an immediate emphasis on the
legislation governing motor vehicle third-party liability and reinsurance. We will consult with
the Fund on the tax treatment of private pension funds during the drafting process of a new
legal framework governing this industry, and aim to adopt the necessary legislation within
2008. Until the revised legal framework is adopted and supervisory capacity improves, we
will continue to follow a prudent approach in the pension industry and restrict participation to
the three companies already licensed.
E. External Policies

22.
Prudent external borrowing will remain key to maintaining external debt
sustainability. We are committed to keep external nonconcessional borrowing within the
program’s cumulative ceiling of €680 million. In 2008, we will use €230 million of foreign
bank loans to finance the Rreshen-Kalimash road project. We will continue to conduct
independent feasibility studies on all projects being considered for nonconcessional foreign
financing, and provide to the Fund a semi-annual listing of projects and progress report on
the stock of external arrears (all SBs, ongoing). We will also refrain from financing large
development projects through any state-owned special purpose vehicle (SPV) until we have
developed additional capacity to fully evaluate such schemes; and will limit the fiscal risks
from concessions.
Strengthened debt management capacity is key to proper evaluation and
23.
management of the risks of commercial external borrowing. A new debt strategy is now
in place and the debt management Directorate has been reorganized. We will push forward
with developing capacity and improving coordination with the medium-term budget. After
raising a syndicated commercial loan from a foreign bank, we are considering issuing
Albania’s first benchmark Eurobond in international capital markets in 2009. We are seeking
technical assistance from donors and IMF to ensure that we are adequately prepared to
undertake such an operation.
We will further strengthen our liberal trade regime. The Interim Agreement for
24.
Free Trade with the EU and the Central Europe Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) are
promoting the development of regional trade. The free trade agreement with Turkey was
ratified by the Albanian parliament and came into force in May 2008. The weighted average
tariff rate is expected to decline further to 2.4 percent in 2008.
We continue to make progress on clearing or rescheduling our external arrears.
25.
Outstanding official external arrears have been reconciled with North Korea, Russia, the
Bank of Greece, and a consortium of Greek Banks, and are in the process of being reconciled
for Vietnam, Algeria and Cuba. We have contacted countries that were part of the former

79
Yugoslavia (Serbia, Montenegro, FYR Macedonia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and
Slovenia) to negotiate terms. We reached agreement with private Swiss companies and two
Greek companies to clear arrears in 2008. We are in the process of reconciling outstanding
arrears with companies in Austria, Belgium, the U.K., the Netherlands, Sweden India and
Denmark. We are working to clear all outstanding external arrears by end 2008 and will not
accumulate new external payments arrears. We will continue to provide semi-annual reports
to the Fund on the outstanding stock of external arrears within one month of the end of each
quarter (SB; ongoing). Once all arrears have been cleared or reschedule we will begin
discussions with the Fund with a view to accepting Article VIII.
F. Other Structural Reforms

26.
We are stepping up efforts to implement reforms that are key to improve our
business and investment climate. The National Registration Center (NRC)—a one stopshop for business registration—has prompted the registration of many more businesses by
cutting the legal timeline for registration to only one day and the registration cost to 100 lek.
Following this success, we are working to ease the burden of licensing and permits. To
support the development of SMEs, we are implementing an action plan prepared based on the
approved Strategic Program for 2007–2009. We already made the Competitiveness Fund and
Export Guarantee Fund fully operational and effective, and rely more on the increased
capacities of Albinvest. We are also taking measures to improve the commercial court system
and are pursuing land registration and titling in order to enhance contract enforcement and
property rights and ensure long-term sustainable development. To address the regulatory and
infrastructure bottlenecks more quickly, we are considering proposals on establishing
industrial parks. However, given already low statuary tax rates, we do not envisage any tax
incentives for these parks.
Privatization of remaining strategic public assets will continue in 2008. In June
27.
2008, we approved the sale of 85 percent of the oil refinery ARMO to a US-Swiss
consortium which submitted the highest bid for €125 million. Given significant interest
shown by foreign insurance companies in Albania, we expect to be able to sell INSIG this
year. In addition to the distribution arm of KESH, we will also intensify our efforts to divest
the assets of Albpetrol and our minority stake in AMC.
We continue to improve statistics. Improving the reliability, timeliness and
28.
frequency of national accounts statistics remain a top priority. The findings of the householdbudget and labor-force surveys—both conducted in 2007—were published in May 2008. We
are utilizing these surveys to enhance coverage and reliability of national accounts and shortterm statistics. In addition, we will strengthen the collaboration between INSTAT, the BoA
and the MoF to improve the quality of economic statistics. We appreciate the extensive
technical assistance from the IMF in this area. With IMF assistance, we expect to soon
publish our first quarterly national accounts—a key requirement for SDDS. Afterward, we
plan to move towards SDDS status. We will ensure that INSTAT has sufficient resources to
carry out its mandate.

80
G. Program Monitoring

29.
The seventh disbursement and purchase under the PRGF/EFF-supported program will
be based on the end-September, 2008 quantitative performance criteria (Table 1 and the
TMU); and completion of the sixth review and financing assurances review. The sixth review
under the PRGF and EFF arrangements is expected to be completed no later than February 1,
2009. During the program period, Albania will not impose or intensify restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions; or introduce multiple
currency practices, or conclude bilateral payments agreements inconsistent with Article VIII,
or impose or intensify import restrictions for balance of payments reasons.

ATTACHMENT II
TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

This memorandum defines the quantitative performance criteria, benchmarks and indicative
targets established in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) up until
end-December 2008; and associated reporting requirements.
A. Net Domestic Credit to the Government

1.
For the purposes of the program, the government includes the State Budget, the
Social Security Institute (SSI), the Health Insurance Institute (HII), the Expropriation Fund,
local governments, and the accounts of all entities (including special purpose vehicles) that
are used to operate or manage public-private partnership (PPP) projects.
Net domestic credit to the government (NCG) is defined as gross domestic credit in
2.
lek and in foreign currency extended to the government (as defined above) by the banking
system, savings and loan institutions (SLIs), and other domestic lenders;1 less the sum of
government financial assets held in the banking system and in the SLIs.

3.

The following definitions apply to gross domestic credit to the government:
(i)

Gross domestic credit in lek and in foreign currency extended to the
government includes: (a) securities (including treasury bills and bonds) issued
by the government and held by the Bank of Albania (BoA), deposit money
banks (DMBs), SLIs, and other domestic lenders; (b) loans and advances
extended to the government by BoA, DMBs, SLIs, and other domestic lenders;
(c) negative balances in government deposits with BoA, DMBs and SLIs; (d)
any securities or debt instrument of any kind issued by government (as defined
above) to the Bank of Albania to compensate the Bank of Albania for its net
valuation losses on its assets and liabilities in, or denominated in, gold, special
drawing rights or foreign currencies, and which the Bank of Albania keeps in
its (off-balance sheet) Valuation Reserve Securities Account of the Bank of
Albania, as required in Article 64 of the Law on the Bank of Albania (No.
8269, dated December 12, 1997)2; and (e) any other form of financial
obligation of the government to domestic lenders, the issuance of which
resulted in borrowing funds by the government or a payment for an existing
payment obligation of the government.

1

Other domestic lenders comprise firms, nonbank institutions, and households, or any other resident legal or
natural person, or institution.

2

This was equivalent to lek 15.505 billion at end-December 2007.

84
(ii)

Gross domestic credit in lek and in foreign currency extended to the
government excludes (i) advances on profit transfers by the BoA; and (ii) the
lek 5,908 million temporary security issued by government to BoA on
December 31, 2007 and retired on February 27, 20083.

(iii)

The stock of gross domestic credit extended to the government and held by the
BoA and DMBs in the form of treasury bills will be valued at issue price plus
accrued interest. The stock of gross domestic credit extended to the
government and held by the BoA in the form of other securities and direct
loans to government will be valued including accrued interest. The stock of
gross domestic credit extended to the government and held by the DMBs in
the form of variable and fixed income securities (excluding treasury bills) will
be valued at issue price plus accrued interest. The stock of all gross domestic
credit extended to the government and held by SLIs and other domestic
lenders will be valued at face value4.

(iv)

For the purposes of program monitoring, gross domestic credit to the
government in foreign currency will be converted from lek to euros at the endof period lek/euro exchange rate prevailing on the test date; and then
converted to lek at the program exchange rate of lek 123.6/euro.

The following definitions apply to government financial assets held in the banking
4.
system and in the SLIs:
(i)

Government financial assets held at the Bank of Albania include:
(a) transferable deposits in domestic and foreign currency; (b) lek deposits
held in BoA for projects; and (c) standard gold deposits of the government.
For the purposes of program monitoring, standard gold deposits will be valued
at the program price of gold (€596.2 per ounce)5.

(ii)

Government financial assets held at the Bank of Albania exclude: (a) foreign
currency deposits related to foreign financed projects; and (b) deposits serving

3

This security was issued to provide bridge recapitalization of BoA until a transfer of gold from government to
BoA was finalized on February 27, 2008.

4

Under current reporting standards, the stock of all gross domestic credit extended to the government and held
by the SLIs and other domestic lenders is only available at face value.
5

The lek value of standard gold deposits will be (a) converted to euros using the current end-of-period lek/euro
exchange rate; (b) then converted to ounces of gold using the current euro market price of gold; (c) then
converted to euros at the program price of gold (€596.2 per ounce); and (d) then converted to lek at the program
lek/euro exchange rate of lek 123.6/euro.

85
as the counterpart for non-standard gold and other precious metals owned by
the government.
(iii)

Government financial assets held at the DMBs include: (a) all deposits of
government in domestic and foreign currency; and (b) payable amounts owed
by the DMBs to government.

(iv)

Government financial assets held at the SLIs include all deposits of
government held at the SLIs.

For the purposes of program monitoring, foreign currency-denominated government
5.
financial assets will be converted from their lek value (obtained from the BoA and aggregate
DMBs’ balance sheet) to their currency of denomination at the end-of period lek exchange
rate for that currency prevailing on the test date; and then converted to lek at the lek exchange
rate for that currency prevailing at end-March 2008. Those foreign currency-denominated
government financial assets for which the currency of denomination is unknown, will be
converted from their lek value (obtained from the BoA and aggregate DMB’s balance sheet)
to euros at the end-of period lek/euro exchange rate for that currency prevailing on the test
date; and then converted to lek at the lek/euro program exchange rate of lek 123.6/euro.
Under these definitions, the stock of net domestic credit to the government was
6.
lek 361.3 billion at end-December 2007. The breakdown of the categories of net domestic
credit to the government as defined above is given in Attachment Table 1.
The limits on the change in net domestic credit to the government will be cumulative
7.
within each calendar year.
B. Net Domestic Assets

8.
The stock of net domestic assets (NDA) of the Bank of Albania is defined as
reserve money—defined as the sum of currency issue (less lek notes and coins held by the
Bank of Albania) and commercial bank reserves held at the BoA—less the net international
reserves of the Bank of Albania (Section C). For program monitoring purposes, all foreign
currency assets and liabilities making up NIR will be valued in local currency at the exchange
rates of end-March 2008. Under this definition, the level of NDA was lek 74.4 billion as of
end-March 2008. The NDA limits will be cumulative changes from end-March 2008 and will
be monitored from the accounts of the Bank of Albania.
C. Net International Reserves

9.
Net international reserves (NIR) are defined as reserve assets minus reserve
liabilities of the Bank of Albania. Reserve assets are readily available claims of the Bank of
Albania on nonresidents denominated in foreign convertible currencies. Excluded from
reserve assets are any assets that are pledged, collateralized, or otherwise encumbered; claims

86
on residents; precious metals other than monetary gold; assets in nonconvertible currencies;
illiquid assets; and claims on foreign exchange arising from derivatives in foreign currencies
vis-à-vis domestic currency (such as futures, forwards, swaps, and options). Reserve
liabilities shall be defined as foreign exchange liabilities to residents and nonresidents of the
Bank of Albania, irrespective of their maturity. They include: foreign currency reserves of
commercial banks held at the Bank of Albania; all credit outstanding from the IMF;
commitments to sell foreign exchange arising from derivatives (such as futures, forwards,
swaps, and options); and all arrears on principal or interest payments to commercial banks,
suppliers, or official export credit agencies. The government’s foreign currency deposits at
the Bank of Albania are excluded from reserve liabilities6, with the following exception:
those government deposits that arise from the proceeds of the foreign currency-denominated
syndicated loan contracted to finance part of the Rreshen-Kalimash road will be included in
reserve liabilities. Reserve assets and reserve liabilities will both be expressed in euros. The
NIR limits will be cumulative changes from end-March 2008, and will be monitored from
data supplied by the Bank of Albania.
During this program, for monitoring purposes, the bilateral exchange rates between
10.
the euro and non-dollar currencies will be kept at their end-March 2008 levels and holdings
of monetary gold will be valued at €596.2 per ounce. Under this definition, the level of NIR
was €1,126.5 million at end-March 2008.
D. Adjusters for NCG, NDA, and NIR

11.
The NCG and NDA ceilings and the NIR floor are defined on the assumption that
cumulative privatization proceeds from January 1, 2008 will be as follows:
End-Sept 2008

lek 4,100 mn. (Of which €26.0 mn. in foreign currency);

End-Dec 2008

lek 4,100 mn. (Of which €26.0 mn. in foreign currency).

The NIR floor will be adjusted upward (downward) and the NDA ceiling adjusted downward
(upward) by half of any excess (shortfall) in the receipt of privatization proceeds in foreign
currency from these assumed values. The NCG ceiling will be adjusted downward (upward)
by half the amount of any excess (shortfall) in the receipt of total privatization proceeds from
these assumed values7.
6

This exclusion is justified by current procedures in Albania, whereby the government's foreign currency
receipts are deposited in a blocked account at the Bank of Albania and the funds are transferred to the
government’s lek account before being spent. A change in this procedure, would require revisiting the NIR
definition.

7

For the NCG adjuster, the lek equivalent of deviations from the programmed amounts received in foreign
currency will be converted to lek at the exchange rates prevailing on the value date of the transaction.

87
12.

The ceiling on NCG:

•

Will be adjusted upward (downward) by the increase (decrease) in debt instruments of
any kind (valued at issue price if possible) that the government (as defined above)
transfers to the Bank of Albania to compensate the Bank of Albania for its net
valuation losses on its assets and liabilities in, or denominated in, gold, special
drawing rights or foreign currencies, and which the Bank of Albania keeps in its
(off-balance sheet) Valuation Reserve Securities Account of the Bank of Albania, as
required in Article 64 of the Law on the Bank of Albania (No. 8269, dated
December 12, 1997).

•

Will be adjusted upward by the increase in debt instruments of any kind (valued at
issue price if possible) that the government (as defined above) transfers to the Bank of
Albania to for the purpose of recapitalizing the Bank of Albania. The transfer of
securities to the Bank of Albania will be deemed to be for recapitalization purposes to
the extent that the offsetting entry in the Bank of Albania’s balance sheet is recorded
in the bank’s capital account. This adjuster excludes the security referred to in
paragraph 3 (ii) (ii).

•

Will be adjusted upward by the running down of government financial assets (as
defined in paragraph 4) for the purpose of recapitalizing the BoA. As at endMarch 2008, the amount of financial government assets (as defined in paragraph 4)
expended for this purpose was Lek 2,844 million.

•

Will be adjusted upward by the amount of fiscal expenditure that was authorized by
the 2007 budget, but legally expended in the first 14 days of 2008 and legally credited
to the 2007 fiscal year.

•

Will be adjusted downward by the amount of fiscal expenditure that was authorized
by the 2008 budget, but legally expended in the first 14 days of 2009 and legally
credited to the 2008 fiscal year.

•

Will be adjusted upwards by the disbursed amount of the foreign currencydenominated syndicated loan contracted to finance part of the Rreshen-Kalimash road
that is sourced through resident banks or other resident lenders. There will be no
adjustment to the NCG target for this purpose for disbursements of this loan that are
sourced through nonresident lenders.

The ceilings on NCG and NDA, and the floor on NIR are defined based on the
13.
assumption that foreign budgetary and/or balance of payments loan financing (excluding IMF
financing, project and commodity loans, loans from the International Development

88
Association of the World Bank Group, and macro-financial assistance from the EU) will
amount, on a cumulative basis, from January 1, 2008, to:
End-Sept 2008

€0.0 mn;

End-Dec 2008

€0.0 mn.

The ceilings on NDA of the Bank of Albania and NCG will be adjusted downward,
and the floor on NIR will be adjusted upward by the amount total foreign loan financing
(excluding IMF financing, project and commodity loans, loans from the International
Development Association of the World Bank Group, and macro-financial assistance from the
EU) exceeds these projections.8
14.
The NDA ceilings will also be adjusted to reflect the impact of any change in the
required reserve ratio of commercial banks with the Bank of Albania. Should reserve
requirements in lek (foreign currency) be changed from the 10 percent on all deposits held in
lek (foreign currency), then the NDA ceiling will be adjusted by multiplying the change in the
reserve requirement by the programmed deposits for which required reserves are held in lek
(foreign currency). The total adjustment to the NDA ceiling will be the sum of the adjustment
made for any change in the reserve requirement on lek deposits and the adjustment made for
any change in the reserve requirement on foreign currency deposits. Before making any
change to the required reserve ratio, the authorities will consult with IMF staff. For the
purpose of this adjuster, the programmed level of deposits in lek and foreign currency are
defined as follows:
In lek (lek bn.)

In foreign currency (lek bn.)

E. External Debt and Arrears

15.
As set forth in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to
Foreign Debt (Decision No. 12274–00/85) August 24, 2000), the term “debt” will be
understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual
arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or
services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets
(including currency) or services, at some future point(s) in time; these payments will
8

For the NCG adjuster, the lek equivalent of deviations from the programmed amounts received in foreign
currency will be converted to lek at the exchange rates prevailing on the value date of the transaction.

89
discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take a
number of forms, the primary ones being as follows: (i) loans, i.e., advances of money to
obligor by the lender made on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds
in the future (including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans and buyers’ credits)
and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under
which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the
collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and official swap
arrangements); (ii) suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to
defer payments until some time after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are
provided; and (iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the
lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter
than the total expected service life of the property, while the lessor retains the title to the
property. For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception of
the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the agreement
excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair or maintenance of the property.
Arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment
under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an
obligation that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not
give rise to debt.
The limit on medium- and long-term external debt applies to the contracting or
16.
guaranteeing by the government or the Bank of Albania, of new nonconcessional external
debt with an original maturity of more than one year. It applies not only to debt as defined in
paragraph 15 of this memorandum, but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for
which value has not been received9. External debt will be considered to have been contracted
at the point the loan agreement or guarantee is ratified by the Albanian parliament. Excluded
from the limits are refinancing credits and rescheduling operations (including the deferral of
interest on commercial debt), credits extended by the IMF, and credits on concessional terms
defined as those with a grant element of at least 35 percent. The grant element is to be
calculated using the OECD Commercial Interest Reference Rates (CIRRs): for maturities of
less than 15 years, the grant element will be calculated based on six-month averages of
CIRRs; and for maturities longer than 15 years, the grant element will be calculated based on
ten-year averages. Debt falling within the limit shall be valued in euros at the exchange rate
prevailing at the time the contract or guarantee becomes effective.
The limit on medium- and long-term external debt as defined in paragraph 16 will be
17.
adjusted downwards by the disbursed amount of the foreign currency-denominated
syndicated loan contracted to finance part of the Rreshen-Kalimash road that is sourced
9

For the purposes of program monitoring, "external" means owed to a non-resident, and includes both foreign
currency- and local currency-denominated debt (where debt is defined in paragraph 15 of this memorandum).

90
through resident banks or other resident lenders. There will be no adjustment to the limit on
medium- and long-term external debt for this purpose for disbursements of this loan that are
sourced through nonresident lenders.
18.
The limit on short-term external debt applies on a continuous basis to the stock of
short-term external debt owed or guaranteed by the government or the Bank of Albania, with
an original maturity of up to and including one year. It applies to debt as defined in
paragraph 15 of this memorandum. Excluded from the limit are rescheduling operations
(including the deferral of interest on commercial debt) and normal import-related credits.
Debt falling within the limit shall be valued in euros at the exchange rate prevailing at the
time the contract or guarantee becomes effective.
A continuous performance criterion applies on the accumulation of new external
19.
payments arrears on external debt contracted or guaranteed by the government or the Bank
of Albania. External payment arrears consist of external debt service obligations (principal
and interest) falling due after March 31, 2008 and that have not been paid at the time they are
due, taking into account the grace periods specified in the contractual agreements. Excluded
from the prohibition on the accumulation of new arrears are: (i) arrears arising from interest
on the stock of arrears outstanding as of March 31, 2007; and (ii) external arrears that are
subject to debt rescheduling agreements or negotiations.
Large projects (as referred to in MEFP paragraph 5 and MEFP Table 2) are defined
20.
as those projects involving total nonconcessional borrowing in excess of €20 million.
F. Tax Revenues

21.
Collection of total tax revenue by the Tax and Customs Departments and social
insurance contributions will be monitored on the basis of quarterly indicative floors. These
indicative floors will include all revenues collected by the GDT, GDC, and SSI (including
revenues collected on behalf of local governments), but exclude revenues collected by local
governments directly.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with Albania
On July, 25, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Albania.1
Background
Over the last decade, macroeconomic performance has generally been strong and per capita
GDP in US dollar terms more than doubled. A Stabilization and Association Agreement with the
EU was signed in 2006, and an invitation to join NATO extended in the spring of 2008. Rapid
growth, price stability, and continued large remittances also significantly improved social
conditions and moved the country toward Millennium Development Goals. Macroeconomic
stability has been maintained and inflation is among the lowest in the region.
Strong fiscal policy, largely based on major improvements in tax administration, lowered public
debt from 66 percent of GDP in 2001 to 53 percent in 2007. More recently, tax policy reforms
have further boosted revenues—to be allocated in the supplementary budget to investment
projects.
With such supportive fiscal policy, the Bank of Albania was able to maintain low inflation, despite
a rise in recent months above the 3±1 percent target range, that was driven mainly by higher
world food prices. Underlying inflation remains low and, going forward, inflation is projected to

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities.

2
return into the target band within the year, notwithstanding unfavorable global inflation trends and
pressures from the ongoing transition process.
Risks to domestic and external stability have receded somewhat. Domestic credit growth, though
still elevated, has decelerated from past highs, and the authorities adapted regulatory and
supervisory regimes to keep abreast with the rapidly developing financial system. Exports are
growing strongly, though temporary factors have pushed up the current account deficit.
However, progress with structural reform has been uneven. On the one hand, tax reforms,
financial market development, and large scale privatization have provided strong incentives for
investment. In contrast, turning around the loss-making electricity sector has proved elusive
despite repeated attempts. The core of the problem is unpaid electricity usage—the average
effective collection rate, at around 50 percent, remains low compared even with the regional
average of about 75 percent. Moreover, wide-spread governance concerns and the weak
business environment are already factors in the recent slowdown in productivity growth.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors praised the authorities’ macroeconomic policy stance that has led to a
prolonged period of strong noninflationary growth and sustained improvement in living standards
and social conditions, despite a deteriorating external environment. Directors also welcomed the
good progress in structural reforms, and encouraged the authorities to undertake early action on
the remaining agenda in reforming the electricity sector and in improving the business climate.
Directors concurred that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate. Given that
exogenous shocks implied upward pressure on prices in the near and medium-term—
compounding pressures associated with the transition process—Directors noted that monetary
conditions might need to be tightened if second-round effects appeared or inflationary
expectations deteriorated.
Directors considered external competitiveness to be broadly adequate, and stressed the
importance of ensuring that macroeconomic and structural policies continue to safeguard
external stability going forward, particularly in light of the authorities’ plans to rely more on
international capital markets in the future.
Directors encouraged the authorities to set fiscal policy within a transparent medium-term
framework. They considered the authorities’ goal of reducing debt to 50 percent of GDP by 2011
to be consistent with debt sustainability, macroeconomic stability, and the need to meet Albania’s
still-considerable development needs. Safeguarding progress made in debt sustainability will
require a prudent debt management strategy and a cautious approach to borrowing on
international capital markets. Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to limit the 2008 deficit
to 5.2 percent of GDP and to adopt an explicit fiscal rule guiding future budgets. They
commended the authorities’ recent decision to address the welfare effects of rising food prices

3
through targeted subsidies.
Directors regarded continued financial sector development as a prerequisite for maintaining
rapid economic growth. The banking system appears sound, and exposure to the current global
financial turmoil is slight. Regulatory and supervisory capacity needs to keep pace with the
sector’s development to mitigate the attendant risks. In this regard, Directors considered that the
immediate priority lay in improving cross-border supervisory collaboration, contingency planning,
and collateral execution. Directors also saw an important role for regulatory and supervisory
measures in supporting monetary policy, given the still undeveloped monetary transmission
mechanism and high degree of euroization.
Directors observed that, with efficiency gains from the transition process likely to gradually wane,
maintaining strong growth as a middle-income country would increasingly depend on
improvements in both institutional quality and infrastructure. This would help to attract foreign
direct investment and improve productivity. In this regard, Directors considered that past
initiatives, such as the one-stop business licensing procedure, had been effective, and
encouraged the authorities to initiate further business-friendly reforms. In addition, they
encouraged the authorities to improve governance, strengthen the judicial system, and tackle
corruption. Directors noted continuing problems in the electricity sector, and stressed that the
authorities would have to follow through with their new action plan for the Albanian Power
Corporation (KESH) if another electricity tariff increase in the near future was to be avoided.
Progress in this area would facilitate the planned privatization of KESH’s distribution company.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to improve the reliability and timeliness of statistics.
Addressing the lack of skilled staff and insufficient resources in the statistical agency would help
maximize the usefulness of Fund technical assistance.

IMF Executive Board Completes the Fifth Review Under the PRGF and EFF
Arrangements with Albania and Approves US$4 Million Disbursement

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the fifth
review of Albania's economic performance and financing assurances under the three-year
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement and the Extended Fund Facility
(EFF) arrangement. The completion of the reviews enables the release of an amount
equivalent to SDR 2.4 million (about US$4 million), which will bring the total disbursements
to Albania under both arrangements to SDR 14.6 million (about US$23.9 million).
The concurrent three-year arrangements under the PRGF and EFF, amounting to the
equivalent of SDR 17 million (about US$27.9 million), were approved effective from
February 1, 2006 (see Press Release No. 06/17).
The Executive Board also approved a request for modification of three end-September 2008
performance criteria related to the Bank of Albania’s net international reserves and domestic
assets, and net domestic credit to government.
Following the Executive Board's discussion of Albania on July 25, 2008, Mr. Murilo Portugal,
Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“Albanian economic performance remains strong, despite less benign external conditions. A
regional drought in 2007 affected Albania particularly hard, but recovery was rapid as the
economy diversified and new export markets were developed. Growth therefore remained
buoyant and became broader based, reaching 6 percent last year. Inflation, while episodically
above the 3±1 percent target range, remains among the lowest in the region in spite of global
food and commodity price shocks. In addition, risks to external and domestic stability have
receded somewhat, as domestic credit growth—though still elevated—has decelerated. The
share of exports of goods and services in GDP has increased, and Albania continues to attract
investment in its traditional exports, textiles, and footwear. Public finances have

2
strengthened, largely due to improved tax administration, allowing public debt to remain on a
declining path as a percent of GDP. Firm monetary policy has maintained positive real
interest rates.
“Growth is expected to remain at 6 percent in 2008 with inflation just under 4 percent, but
risks have increased. Rising global commodity prices, particularly of food, may put pressure
on domestic prices in the short term. Over the medium term, investment-driven productivity
increases will be needed to maintain the pace of growth and expand the export base. This
necessitates improvement in the business climate, particularly in the areas of governance,
judiciary, and land titling.
“Regulatory and supervisory capacity need to continue to keep pace with developments in the
banking sector. The banking system appears sound with little exposure to current global
financial turmoil. Moreover, its rapid development has contributed significantly to economic
development. However, in the face of still rapid credit growth, vigilance and regulatory
adaptation is required to ensure stability of the financial system. In this regard, the immediate
priority lies in improving cross-border supervisory collaboration, contingency planning, and
collateral execution.
“The program’s medium-term fiscal framework is consistent with low inflation, debt
sustainability, and the authorities’ model of a small, efficient government. This framework is
expected to reduce debt to 50 percent of GDP by 2011. Combined with the authorities’
existing strategy of limiting the size of government and outsourcing activities where possible,
the resulting medium-term fiscal path is expected to satisfy Albania’s still-considerable
development needs, while supporting macroeconomic stability. The authorities appropriately
intend to adopt a fiscal rule to anchor this policy direction.
“Despite progress made this year, electricity sector reforms remain unfinished, at
considerable economic cost. The core of the problem is unpaid electricity usage—the average
effective collection rate, at around 50 percent, remains low compared even with the regional
average of about 75 percent. Without progress in this area, the electricity utility will continue
to lose cash, risks to the budget will grow, electricity supply to the economy will remain
unreliable, and the utility’s privatization will be made more difficult,” Mr. Portugal stated.

Statement by Arrigo Sadun, Executive Director for Albania
and Francesco Spadafora, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
July 25, 2008

On behalf of the Albanian authorities, we thank staff for the well-written and informative report,
which is testament to the remarkably close and constructive cooperation with the authorities.
Overview

Sound macroeconomic and structural policies, underpinned by Fund programs, have laid the
ground for the impressive progress made by the Albanian economy over the last decade. Per
capita GDP growth in U.S. dollar terms has more than doubled and graduation from IDA is
forthcoming. Inflation has declined toward the European average and is currently among the
lowest in the region. Timely monetary policy tightening, complemented by appropriate regulatory
measures, was crucial to reach this positive outcome. While implementing supply-side tax
reforms, major improvements in tax administration have contributed to strengthen public
finances, boosting the revenue-to-GDP ratio and lowering the public debt.
Growth is projected to remain at a solid 6.0 percent in the current year and, equally importantly,
is broader-based, with a pick up in the relative weight of such sectors as construction and
manufacturing and upbeat trade following export diversification in both markets and products.
Credit growth, identified as a major risk in past reviews, has been somewhat contained, but
remains relatively robust.
The real exchange rate does not appear to be misaligned and there are no major concerns about
competitiveness and external stability. Most of the widening of the current account deficit in
2007 reflected temporary factors and the gap is expected to decline to below 5 percent of GDP in
the medium term as a result of stronger exports, buoyant remittances, and a reduction in
electricity and road-related imports.
The authorities are now focusing on the medium-term policies and reforms necessary to sustain
growth and ensure financial stability. The persistently strong performance under the PRGF-EFFsupported program confirms their commitment. For the fifth review, all quantitative performance
criteria have been met and structural conditionality appears on track.
Against such a positive background, in a context of persistent security-related regional risks,
some long-standing problems remain, mainly related to the electricity sector, governance and the
business environment.
Fiscal Policy

The authorities’ medium-term fiscal framework envisages a small but more efficient government.
Fiscal policy has provided a key contribution in maintaining macroeconomic stability and, going

2
forward, should take on a greater role in demand management. In the longer term, further fiscal
consolidation will be pursued with a view to fund development projects.
The 2008 budget sets a deficit ceiling of 5.2 percent of GDP that does not generate a fiscal
impulse; this gap should decline to 3.0 percent as early as 2009 (as opposed to the projected
3.7 percent at the time of the fourth review).
Following the introduction of a 10 percent flat tax rate for both personal and corporate incomes
(respectively in August 2007 and January 2008), personal income tax collections more than
doubled in the first quarter of 2008, while the revenues from corporate taxation remained stable
due to the broadening of the tax base. Buoyant revenues have allowed the budget to absorb the
costs (0.2-0.3 percent of GDP) of compensation for the Gerdec ammunitions explosion. Against
such major reforms, the authorities will now concentrate their efforts on bringing actual
collections in line with potential yields. In this regard, the objective of increasing the number of
social security contributors to 410,000 by end-July 2008 appears on track.
A large wage increase for public sector workers has been scaled back sharply by the mid-year
budget review in order to prevent a potential wage-price spiral. Significant contingency reserves
of about 1.5 percent of GDP are in place to protect the 2008 budget outcome against the risks
arising from quasi-fiscal losses incurred by the electricity company KESH and cost overruns
associated with the Rreshen-Kalimas road project.
The authorities stand ready, in consultation with the Fund, to take further actions, including
offsetting reductions in other expenditures, should the fiscal deficit target be in jeopardy,
Public debt has been reduced from 58 percent of GDP in 2005 to 53 percent in 2007 and its
maturity extended to reduce rollover risk. The authorities aim at reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio
to below 50 percent by 2011, in order to mitigate the risks, in terms of costs and volatility,
associated with the prospective greater integration with global capital markets. The annual
implementation of this target will be carried out either through a cap on the overall fiscal deficit
or expenditure consistent with such an objective. In light of the forthcoming expiration of the
Fund-supported program in January 2009, the authorities have been discussing with staff how
best to replace the current fiscal anchor in order to preserve macroeconomic stability and have
expressed a preference for an expenditure-based rule.
Improving the implementation of capital projects remains a priority of public expenditure
management. Following the introduction of new public investment management procedures and
a new procurement law, the authorities are focusing on strengthening Ministries’ capacity to
implement such measures.

3
Monetary and financial sector policies

Following three increases of the policy rate in 2007, the monetary authorities stand ready to
further tighten monetary policy in order to avoid second-round effects potentially arising from
looming domestic and external inflationary pressures. The former are related to the recent
increase in electricity tariffs and, over the medium run, to increased food exports; the latter to the
expected pass-through to domestic prices from global inflation trends.
Despite the progress, there remain some upside risks to the rate of credit growth from the
potential expansion of available collateral, as a result of the ongoing land legalization. Further
regulatory and supervisory measures would complement monetary policy in the event that reacceleration of credit growth materializes. On the other hand, downside risk to the rate of credit
growth may arise from a retrenchment of parent banks in funding their Albanian subsidiaries, in
a largely foreign-owned banking system (about 90 percent of total assets in 2007, up from
47 percent in 2003).
The banking system is well-capitalized, liquid and profitable. The authorities intend to safeguard
its stability through proactive supervision. However, on account of the system’s rapid expansion,
they are aware of the need to enhance the regulatory and supervisory regimes in tandem and are
benefiting from TA recommendations provided by MCM and LEG.
In particular, the Bank of Albania aims at signing formal Memoranda of Understanding to
increase cooperation with the home country supervisors of resident foreign banks. Improvements
in the legal and operational framework for executing collateral are also planned, including
through changes in the Civil Code.
To improve the effectiveness of monetary policy, as well as to further stimulate the growth of the
financial sector, the authorities aim to develop efficient interbank and secondary markets. To this
end, a delivery versus payment system for government securities is due for completion by endOctober. The development of pensions and insurance markets, supported by the World Bank,
would also address the still high rollover risk of domestic debt, although progress has already
been made on lengthening its maturity. Moreover, the new IT system for conducting primary
auctions of government securities has reduced operational risks.
To prepare the country for the forthcoming graduation from concessional finance, the authorities
have been taking steps towards the objective of tapping international capital markets. In order to
meet the requirements for a successful first-time market access, a General Debt Department has
been created to strengthen debt management capacity. Technical assistance will be sought from
donors and the IMF to prepare for Albania’s first sovereign issuance of Eurobonds within a
coherent medium-term debt strategy.

4
The electricity sector

In the authorities’ view, a privately-dominated and diversified electricity sector is critical to
ensure a stable supply of electricity at low cost. Unfortunately, previous attempts to place the
electricity sector on a sound footing have not been sufficient to obtain a lasting solution and
address the ensuing macroeconomic risks. In fact, chronic power disruptions have taken a toll on
inflation, the budget deficit and current account (because of the ensuing need to import more
costly energy).
With regard to the fourth review’s structural benchmark aimed at reducing the quasi-fiscal losses
of KESH to below 1.2 percent of GDP in 2008, a new action plan was adopted as a prior action
for the fifth review. This includes such measures as containing KESH’s personnel costs, limiting
the electricity imports as well as reprioritizing local investments. The authorities stand ready to
take further actions to meet the above target, if necessary
Aware of the importance of strengthening KESH’s cash flow, in addition to last March’s tariff
increase, the action plan also aims at raising the effective collection rate from the current 47
percent to 60 percent, consistent with the new structural benchmark of bringing this rate up to 62
percent by end-October. Efforts are under way to ensure that budgetary and non-budgetary
institutions, whose arrears have been recently cleared, henceforth pay electric bills on time.
In order to achieve a lasting solution and ensure a stable supply of electricity over the medium
term, the authorities, under the advice of the IFC, have set up a program to privatize the
distribution arm of KESH by end-2008. To this end, they have finalized the methodology for
tariff adjustment and identified qualified bidders in June 2008. Furthermore, with assistance from
USAID, they have established the required market structure and regulations for full vertical
unbundling of KESH.
The authorities are also involved in a number of projects to diversify electricity supply and
further integrate the national grid into the regional network. Construction of a thermal power
plant, financed jointly by the World Bank, EIB and EBRD, has already started and should be
completed by mid-2009. Additionally, to increase private sector involvement in power
generation, they are in the process of concessioning two new large hydro power plants.
Structural issues

The objective of the authorities’ medium-term economic strategy is to foster continued strong
private sector-led growth.
In a context of successful macroeconomic stabilization, market-oriented reforms have paved the
way to rising investment and Albania now sets itself apart in terms of the contribution of capital
accumulation to growth. However, total factor productivity, which has provided the largest push
to the expansion, shows signs of deceleration. The authorities are aware of the need to avoid

5
complacency and recognize that failure to advance improvements in governance and business
climate will negatively affect growth and debt sustainability. A better business environment is
also instrumental in addressing quasi-monopolistic price setting in the distribution and retail
sectors.
The authorities intend to address the business climate, governance and institutional weaknesses
thorough a wide range of reforms. Steps are being taken to improve the legal system and pursue
land registration and titling, in order to enhance contract enforcement and property rights. The
National Registration Center, a one stop-shop for business registration that cuts time and cost,
has proved effective in prompting the registration of more firms. A new anti-corruption strategy
is being implemented with donor support. Privatization of the remaining strategic public assets
will continue in 2008. While expecting further benefits from prior reforms, the authorities look
forward to the adoption of a second round of structural reforms to improve the business climate.
Relationship with the Fund

The authorities look forward to exploring possible options for future Fund engagement in the
context of the sixth review.
