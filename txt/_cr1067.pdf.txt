INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO
Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2009 Consultation with the Republic of San Marino
Approved by Adam Bennett and Thomas Dorsey
February 2, 2010
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background. As well as suffering from the global crisis, the economy of San Marino is also
facing financial stress related to (i) exposure of the largest bank to a troubled Italian banking
group, and (ii) sizable deposit outflows following an Italian tax amnesty.
Challenges. San Marino’s most immediate challenge is to complete the orderly unwinding of the
banks’ positions in connection with the recent liquidity stress, at a time when there is also a need
to strengthen the capital base of its largest bank. In addition, the authorities have to adopt
appropriate fiscal policies to support the economy in the current downturn. Medium-term
challenges are four-fold: plan ahead for fiscal consolidation, strengthen the enforcement capacity
of financial sector supervision and anti-money laundering and combating the financing of
terrorism (AML/CFT), enhance the lender-of-last resort (LOLR) capacity of the Central bank of
San Marino (CBSM), and establish a business environment supportive of a repositioning of the
economy to an international environment characterized by greater financial transparency.
Staff views. Short-term fiscal policy measures are broadly appropriate. Measures to address
liquidity pressures in the financial sector have helped the orderly unwinding of banks’ positions,
and plans to increase the capital of the largest bank, when implemented, should enhance its
financial strength, but significant vulnerabilities remain. Initiatives already taken by the
authorities to enhance international cooperation and transparency will serve as a foundation upon
which the economy can reposition itself; the authorities should also explore ways to enhance
cooperation with the euro area and seek access to Eurosystem liquidity for the banks.
Medium-term fiscal sustainability would benefit from reduced current spending, pension reforms,
and co-payments on selected health care services. Product and labor market flexibility needs to
be enhanced.
Authorities’ views. The overarching objective of the authorities is to strengthen San Marino’s
international integration, and to facilitate the transformation of the country’s business model
through appropriate macroeconomic and structural policies. The authorities were generally in
agreement with Fund recommendations, while expressing a need for caution with regard to the
liberalization of some sectors (i.e., real estate and telecommunication) and the labor market.

I. THE CONTEXT AND OUTLOOK
A. Key Features of San Marino’s Economy
1.
San Marino is a tiny landlocked republic with close links with Italy. Both
countries are bound by a customs union; about 90 percent of trade is with Italy, and
30 percent of the labor force is comprised of Italian commuters. Ties with Italy have been
strengthened by the signature of Economic and Financial Cooperation agreements in March
and November 2009 respectively, and a Double Taxation agreement is expected in 2010.
2.
Although the euro is its official currency, San Marino does not formally belong
to the euro area, and the CBSM has a limited lender-of-last resort (LOLR) capacity.
San Marino uses the euro on the basis of a formal arrangement concluded in 2000 with the
European Community, through a monetary agreement with Italy—on behalf of the European
Community. The CBSM is not a member of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB)
and has limited ability to respond to a systemic liquidity shock (see Selected Issues Paper).
Local banks do not have access to Eurosystem liquidity and have only indirect access to the
EU area payment systems via Italian banks acting as direct participants on behalf of San
Marino banks. Such an arrangement generates credit risk, potential additional costs, and
uncertainty to execute cross-border transactions if a direct participant cannot be found.
3.
San Marino’s banking sector has contributed to high growth, but such a
performance has come at the price of elevated macro-financial vulnerabilities. The
capitalization of the banking sector is high by international standards (Figure 3). But the ratio
of total assets of the financial sector to GDP has grown steadily over the past few years, from
700 percent in 2003 to close to close to 900 percent at the end of 2008 (Figure 3). Macro
financial vulnerabilities are high—especially in view of the limited LOLR capacity—and
they are exacerbated by the concentration of the banking sector, with the first three largest
and systemically important banks accounting for about 75 percent of total assets.
B. Several Coincident Challenges are Weighting on the Outlook
4.
The global financial crisis began to affect the economy of San Marino in the
second half of 2008 and is likely to continue to do so in 2009‒10, with risks tilted to the
downside due to uncertainties in the banking sector outlook. Growth turned negative by
1.1 percent in 2008 and the downturn has worsened in 2009, with projected growth down to
minus 5 percent. Growth is likely to remain negative, at minus 1.8 percent, also in 2010
partly due to the impact of the Italian tax amnesty on financial services. As a consequence,
unemployment is on the rise and inflation is declining. The unemployment rate is expected to
reach 5.1 percent in 2009 and 5.5 percent in 2010, from 3.1 in 2008, while inflation will
decelerate from 4.3 percent in 2008 to 2.4 percent in 2009 and slightly rebound to 2.7 percent
in 2010. Due to the sharp deterioration in domestic demand, the trade balance is expected to
improve to 17 and 20 percent of GDP in 2009 and 2010, respectively.

4
5.
Two concurrent events are creating significant vulnerabilities in the financial
sector. First, the largest bank (Cassa di Risparmio della Repubblica di San Marino-CRSM)
has a large exposure to its Italian subsidiary (Delta) which is now facing financial
difficulties. In May 2009 Italian police placed under custody the senior management of
CRSM and Delta on account of money-laundering allegations. Shortly afterwards, the Bank
of Italy put Delta under special administration and stripped CRSM’s authorization to own
stakes in Delta. Second, effective September 2009, the Italian government adopted a tax
amnesty allowing individuals and business to avoid sanctions provided they disclose and
repatriate their off-shore assets. The measure created a risk for large deposit outflows.1
6.
The recently conducted Financial Sector Assessment Program indicates that
while the system so far has withstood pressures relatively well, vulnerabilities remain
(Box 1). Most notably, a further deterioration in the financial position of the Delta Group
beyond what has already been recognized would weaken CRSM capitalization, with
potentially systemic implications. With regard to liquidity, as of December 15, about
29 percent of total deposits and related investments had benefited from the tax amnesty, with
an impact on banks’ liquidity of 2.3 billion euros. An additional 220 million will be
repatriated to Italy before June 15, 2010 (see paragraph 14). So far, all the banks have been
able to meet depositor requests, but the extension of the tax amnesty until end-April 2010
could lead to new pressures.
7.
San Marino needs also to review its “business model”. Its economy must adjust to
the new international environment of greater transparency in economic and financial areas.
But it is not yet clear how the financial sector and, more broadly, the economy will adapt to
the end of activities based on limited bank secrecy. While this new environment presents
additional challenges for policymaking, the authorities sees these developments as sources of
new opportunities for the economy which they intent to seize.

1

Initially planned to end on December 15, 2009, the tax amnesty was extended until the end of April 2010, and
the penalty increased from 5 to 6 percent until February 2010, and then to 7 percent.

5
Box 1. Key Conclusions of the FSAP
Short-term vulnerabilities
 Official data originally indicated that as of June 2009 the average risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio
(CAR) of the system was 15.4 percent, but subsequent revaluation of non traded equity holdings of banks as
of that date brought the figure down to 11.0 percent. Two banks with over a third of banking sector assets
have CARs below 7 percent, and one has a CAR below the 11 percent minimum required by 2013.


Stress tests indicate that the main vulnerabilities of the banking sector relate to deposit outflows or to a
deterioration of credit quality and these risks are particularly high for the largest bank. Most banks are
liquid and well-capitalized, and would be resilient to outflows as long as they can easily liquidate their
securities portfolios or borrow from other more liquid banks, but the largest bank is vulnerable.



The banks’ vulnerability to a decline in credit quality is amplified by highly concentrated loan portfolios,
which had been facilitated by lax prudential limits on large exposures. In particular, a further degradation of
the financial position of the Delta group beyond what has already been recognized could have systemic
implications due to CRSM’s exposure.

Financial sector regulation and supervision
 The CBSM’s governance needs to be enhanced, with a view to strengthen its accountability and
independence. Its budgetary arrangements need to be strengthened so as to enhance its operational
autonomy.


The CBSM has created a regulatory regime that approaches international standards, with gaps notably in
international cooperation, with legal provisions on secrecy constraining its scope; the absence of provisions
for specific capital requirements for market and operational risks; and five year transitional provisions with
regard to limits to large exposures and connected lending. The fiduciary firms need to be more tightly
regulated.



The CBSM capacity is weak, especially in the area of supervision (i.e., supervisory manuals for on-site and
off-site supervision have not been finalized, and there is no policy with regard a desirable periodicity for
on-site inspections). Particular attention is needed with the enforcement of banks’ obligations with regard to
financial crime.

Anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT)
 Following the 2007 MONEYVAL mutual evaluation, the authorities acted swiftly and steadily to fix the
shortcomings and fill the gaps of the AML/CFT regime, leading to the lifting of the compliance enhancing
procedure in September 2009.


Effective implementation of the AML/CFT regime remains a challenge, partly due to the short timeframe in
which financial institutions had to cope with the new regulatory framework, but also because of the
ineffectiveness of the previous regime and scarce controls. More human resources should be allocated to
the Financial Intelligence Agency, the CBSM and the Judiciary.



Mechanisms to ensure transparency in the ownership of fiduciary companies should be enhanced and the
scope of the activities in which fiduciary companies can engage should be clarified.

8.
Several features of the economy of San Marino should help in addressing
current challenges. The economy is not as dependent on the financial sector as is often
thought, a positive feature if financial sector activities were no longer to drive growth.
Industry has the largest contribution to GDP (38 percent); tourism and commercial sectors
are also important, contributing together nearly 20 percent; financial activities contribute for
about 19 percent (Figure 1). Furthermore, the financial sector employs only about 5 percent
of the work force, and its contribution to total government’s revenues (about 10 percent) is
large but not dominant (Figure 3). Finally, owing to prudent fiscal policy over the years, the
public sector had accumulated significant deposits, equivalent to about 23 percent of GDP as
of October 2009.
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
9.
Discussions focused on policies to mitigate macro-financial vulnerabilities and
support growth; they benefited from the conclusions of the FSAP. The policy objectives
of the authorities are to: (i) ensure an orderly unwinding of the banks’ position in the context
of the Italian tax amnesty through skillful liquidity management and enhanced international
cooperation, in particular with Italy; (ii) support the economy through appropriate fiscal
policy without endangering medium-term sustainability; (iii) strengthen the institutional
framework for the CBSM’s LOLR function; and (iv) clarify the business environment and
financial sector supervision to support a repositioning of the economy.
A. Policy Response to Short-Term Challenges
10.
The authorities’ response to the short-term challenges comprises fiscal and
financial sector policy measures (including with regard to the AMF/CFT regime). While
some actions started in late 2008, the bulk of the measures were implemented in the second
half of 2009, at a time when the impact of the global crisis on the economy, and of the Italian
tax amnesty on the financial sector was becoming more evident.
Fiscal policy
11.
To contain the effect of the downturn on the economy the government has taken
several fiscal measures. A scheme to subsidize enterprises planning to invest in new
technologies was introduced in 2009. This scheme took the form of an interest subsidy on
bank loans of up to 10 years to finance investments of up to 5 million euros per enterprise,
with an overall envelop of 100 million euros. The subsidy covers up to 80 percent of the
interest payments; applications need to be submitted by December 31, 2009 but the
Government is planning to extend this deadline up to March 31, 2010. The Government has
also expanded unemployment benefits to fixed-term unemployed workers and workers
employed in the services sector based on the length of past employment. Wage
supplementation benefits (Cassa Integrazione Guadagni), provided when wage payments are
interrupted due to temporary market disruptions, were also extended for an additional

7
3 months until December 31, 2009. The Government intends to implement a more
comprehensive reform of social safety nets in 2010.
12.
The above discretionary measures, together with the sharp contraction in
revenues from the economic slowdown, will result in a significant deterioration of the
fiscal accounts. The central government balance is expected to be -4.3 percent of GDP in
2009 —the first deficit since 2002— and -3.5 of GDP in 2010. The overall balance of the
consolidated public sector will reach -6.2 and -5.5 percent of GDP in 2009 and 2010,
respectively, partly due to the widening deficit of the Social Security Institute. The latter
reflects higher expenses on social safety nets and lower contribution rates from the weaker
labor market.
Financial sector policies
13.
The CBSM took several steps to enhance its ability to monitor the liquidity
position of banks during the course of 2009. Banks were asked to report their liquidity
position frequently—eventually on a daily basis—and to disclose the maturity structure of
their balance sheets. These measures allowed the CBSM to respond flexibly to short-term
liquidity developments.
14.
Several initiatives were also taken, some in close cooperation with the Italian
authorities, to ease liquidity pressures and boost CBSM’s LOLR capacity:


In response to liquidity pressures that started to build up at the CRSM following the
June 2009 events, the CBSM provided liquidity assistance, which was supplemented
by a credit line from a local bank; this liquidity was utilized to support Delta.
Concurrently, the pool of Italian banks participating in the funding of Delta agreed to
maintain their exposure up to the end March 2010;



Measures to boost CBSM’s LOLR capacity were three fold: (i) in mid-November
2009 the CBSM established a voluntary and incentive-based facility whereby banks
with excess liquidity could deposit funds with the CBSM; (ii) at the end of November
2009 a Decree-Law allowed the government to guarantee any foreign borrowing by
the CBSM to help secure credit lines from domestic or foreign banks to be used for
liquidity assistance for financial institutions faced with a temporary need;2 (iii) in
early December 2009 a Decree-Law imposed on banks a mandatory 8 percent deposit
requirement with the CBSM. The CBSM informed financial institutions that any
liquidity assistance provided to another bank would be taken into account in the

2

The incentive-based facility set up by the CBSM did not generate an interest on the part of the banks.
Regarding foreign borrowing, discussions were held in late November on the possibility of setting up a
government guaranteed credit line from a pool of Italian banks; these discussions ended without result.

8
computation of the funds required to be deposited with the CBSM. 3 The authorities
have indicated that the measure has contributed to an appropriate redistribution of
liquidity in the system; and


In early December 2009, Italy’s Revenue Agency, recognizing San Marino’s
particular situation, responded positively to San Marino’s request to consider a
possible extension for the effective repatriation to Italy of funds benefiting from the
tax amnesty and granted an extension to June 30, 2010.

15.
A recapitalization plan is being implemented to boost the financial strength of
the largest bank. In mid-January 2010, the shareholders of the CRSM unveiled a plan to
strengthen its financial position which had suffered from its exposure to Delta, involving:
(i) an overall 100 to 150 million in capital injection, with contributions from the
government, the local banking sector, Sammarinese private investors, and the current
shareholders; and (ii) issuance of medium term bonds. The CRSM indicated that the plan
would bring the bank’s CAR above 11 percent, which will be the minimum requirement by
2013.
16.
With regard to the AML/CFT regime, since the adoption of the MONEYVAL
Mutual Evaluation Report in 2008, San Marino has achieved considerable progress in
bringing its legal and institutional framework in line with the FATF recommendations.
As a result of this progress MONEYVAL lifted the compliance enhancing procedure in
September 2009. However effective implementation of the AML/CFT requirements remains
a challenge, especially with regard to customers accepted prior to the enactment of the new
AML/CFT law. An on-site visit of San Marino is planned in September 2010, as part of
MONEYVAL’s fourth round of mutual evaluations.
B. Addressing Medium-Term Challenges
17.
The authorities have started to take action in response to medium-term
challenges, but this is still a largely unfinished agenda. So far, the authorities have mainly
focused on policy measures to strengthen transparency and international cooperation in
economic and financial matters. The reform agenda to strengthen fiscal sustainability and
increase labor and product market flexibility in response to medium-term challenges needs to
be spelled out, and reforms to strengthen the institutional framework for the LOLR function
are still at an initial stage.

3

The measure differs from a standard reserve requirement system in several ways: it is of a temporary nature
and shall end in January 2010; it applies to interbank deposits as well as customer deposits; deposits required to
be held with the CBSM will be blocked for the whole (monthly) maintenance period; derogation to the general
requirement may be granted based on demonstrated liquidity stress.

9
Business environment and financial sector reform
18.
Important steps were taken by the government in 2009 to improve the business
environment, by enhancing transparency in economic and financial matters, as well as
international cooperation. Between April and September 2009, San Marino signed
12 OECD compliant bilateral agreements on exchange of information on tax matters,
allowing the country to join the OECD “White List”.4 At the regional level, Economic and
Financial Cooperation agreements were signed with Italy. These initiatives will serve as
foundations upon which the economy can reposition itself in the new international
environment of greater transparency.
19.
A renegotiation of the 2000 Monetary Cooperation agreement with the
European Community is already in motion. The European Commission is now asking San
Marino to adopt over time all relevant EU legislation relating to the activity and supervision
of financial institutions, AML/CFT, and statistical reporting requirements. The ultimate
objective is to create a level playing field between San Marino and the European Community
for its financial sector. In this context, in November 2009 San Marino also raised the
possibility for its banks to access Eurosystem liquidity, although this is not envisaged in the
decision adopted by the Council on the renegotiation of the agreement.
20.
The FSAP noted that, starting from a low base, in the recent period
commendable progress was made by the CBSM in strengthening the prudential and
supervisory frameworks. Prior to 2005, financial regulation in San Marino was very
limited, with virtually no regulation consistent with the Basel Committee Core Principles for
Effective Banking Supervision. Over the past four years, the CBSM has been the main driver
in the development of a proper regulatory regime which now approaches international
standards. However, supervisory and enforcement capacity (especially on-site supervision) is
weak and the CBSM needs greater autonomy and additional resources to be able to discharge
effectively its functions, including to conduct full inspections.
Product and labor market reform
21.
Measures to support private investment and innovation have been implemented.
Reduced import tax rates5 on instrumental goods were introduced in 2004, and tax benefits
on reinvested operating profits were established in 2007.

4

5

This effort is continuing, with eight additional bilateral agreements signed as of mid-January 2010.

A distinctive feature of the Sammarinese tax system is the import tax (known as monofase), a single-stage
indirect tax levied on goods intended for domestic consumption and reimbursed each time imported goods are
subsequently re-exported. At the moment this monofase is the most important indirect tax, although the
government has indicated the intention to eventually replace it with a VAT system.

10
22.
The government has taken important steps toward product market
liberalization and streamlining, but some barriers to competition remain. The business
licensing system has been reformed in 2009, with the aim of reducing political discretion in
awarding licenses, expediting bureaucratic procedures and reducing barriers to entry.
Measures have also been taken to discourage the establishment of anonymous companies and
increase transparency. However, the authorities consider that restrictions on ownership and
entry barriers should remain in those sectors (i.e., real estate, telecommunication and car
rental) which are particularly vulnerable to money-laundering activities.
23.
The labor market rigidities mentioned in previous Article IV consultations
remain significant, as well as are the restrictions on the hiring of nonresident
workers. Measures to liberalize the labor market have been piecemeal, resulting in
continued hurdles for the hiring of non Sammarinese highly-skilled workers. The labor
market also suffers from the absence of a double-taxation agreement with Italy, which is a
deterrent to foreign workers. The government is now planning several reforms to strengthen
the labor market. In particular, it intends to implement active labor market policies to assist
unemployed workers and enhance employability, and further streamline the system of social
safety nets. However, reservations were expressed regarding increasing labor market
liberalization.
Public administration reform
24.
An ambitious plan of public administration reforms has been launched to
increase flexibility and productivity. Public administration in San Marino has traditionally
been excessively bureaucratic, with an oversized number of employees, at times deficient in
terms of education and skill levels. Recently approved laws envisage more flexibility in
moving employees and managers within the public administration and assigning tasks,
enhanced autonomy and accountability for managers, higher education requirements for new
employees and more transparency in the hiring process.
25.
The government is also planning a number of state owned enterprises reforms.
These reforms include the transformation of the public utility and the postal service firms
into a state joint stock company, the conversion of the philatelic and numismatic corporation
into a special accounting office, and the University into a foundation, and the privatization of
the diary company. In the utility sector the government is considering adjusting tariffs more
in line with market prices, and move to a more cost effective procurement system.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
Short-term macro financial vulnerabilities
26.
The mission broadly endorses the authorities’ policies to address immediate
pressures on the financial sector, and notes that significant vulnerabilities remain. The

11
authorities’ pro-active stance and skilful management in dealing with the emerging liquidity
pressures, combined with the cooperation of the Italian authorities, is helping to facilitate the
orderly unwinding of the banks’ positions. The extension of Italy’s tax amnesty to April 30,
2010 could potentially lead to new pressures in particular on the largest bank. Therefore, it is
desirable to maintain the safeguards and controls adopted by the CBSM; as soon as the
liquidity pressures on Sammarinese banks abates, the CBSM should consider eliminating the
mandatory deposit requirement system and implement a reserve requirements system in line
with best practice. The authorities’ prompt action in dealing with pressures on the financial
position of the largest bank (CRSM) is also to be commended, and staff notes that these
measures, once implemented, would enhance its financial strength. However, a degradation
of the financial position of the Delta group well beyond what has already been recognized
could lead to recapitalization needs for the CRSM exceeding the capacity of its current or
potential Sammarinese shareholders, therefore requiring the authorities to give consideration
to opening its capital to other investors.
27.
Short term fiscal policies to support the economy during the current slowdown
are broadly appropriate, but a consolidation strategy should be planned ahead. While
current deficits are driven by cyclical conditions, even after the recovery, public finances will
face challenges from ageing and healthcare related liabilities and potential costs related to the
planned reform of active labor market policies. There may also be a loss in revenues due to
lower financial sector profitability and a decline in the growth potential of the economy.
Overall strategy for repositioning the economy
28.
San Marino is now at a critical juncture and the pressure for reform creates a
window of opportunity that the authorities should not miss. The mission commends the
government’s medium-term policy objectives. In particular, the authorities’ aim to facilitate
the transformation of the country’s business model through enhanced international
cooperation and transparency is appropriate.
29.
The impetus given by the government to strengthening cooperation with Italy is
to be commended. The Economic Cooperation agreement and the Financial Cooperation
agreement are key building blocks this strategy. The latter agreement outlines the conditions
for San Marino banks to be granted direct access to the payment systems of the EU, and the
authorities should act swiftly to take advantage of this. This agreement also opens the way
for the signature of Memorandum of Understanding (MOUs) for the exchange of information
between the CBSM and the Bank of Italy, and between the agencies responsible for
AML/CFT and for the prevention of market abuses, another area where the authorities should
move swiftly as it would strengthen cross-border oversight of the financial sector and
facilitate cooperation in dealing with emerging problems. Early signature of the Double
Taxation agreement—the third building block in the strategy—is also desirable as it would
improve further the business environment by facilitating the hiring of high-skilled workers
from Italy.

31.
Pension reforms should resume. The 2005 pension reform has resulted in a
significant increase in contributions that overall are now in line with benefits. Nevertheless,
certain pension funds are constantly in deficit, requiring subsidization from other funds, as
well as frequent extraordinary transfers from the state budget. Moreover, actuarial
projections suggest that the current system is not sustainable in the long term. Building on
the consensus that the 2005 reform has generated, additional measures should be considered,
including: (i) harmonizing contribution rates across categories of workers, to avoid crosssubsidization; (ii) increasing contributions rates; (iii) lengthening of the period over which
qualifying wages are considered in the determination of pension benefits; and (iv) expediting
the introduction of a fully funded second pillar. The current rule under which state transfers
are automatically linked to total contributions could also be reconsidered, as it implies a
steady and automatic increase in central

may soon become necessary to introduce co-payments on selected services and

Strengthen the LOLR framework and financial sector supervision
33.
The institutional framework for liquidity management in San Marino needs to
be strengthened. The lack of an effective LOLR facility makes San Marino’s banking sector
susceptible to a risk of insolvency triggered by liquidity pressures, which in turn could lead
to strains on the public finances and economic growth. To mitigate macro-financial
vulnerabilities the institutional framework for systemic liquidity management needs
upgrading and the mission supports the authorities in their efforts to explore the feasibility to
secure access to Eurosystem liquidity for Sammarinese banks in the context of the
renegotiation of the 2000 Monetary Cooperation agreement. In the meantime, and as a first
line of defense, the CBSM should strengthen self insurance mechanisms to help banks cope
better with idiosyncratic liquidity shocks by ensuring that banks are properly assessing their
own liquidity mismatches and setting appropriate limits for their circumstances. Banks
should also be asked to seek credit lines from reputable and dependable international banking
groups; those unable to do so could be required to hold a larger stock of liquid assets.
34.
Financial sector supervision should be further reinforced in order to create, over
time, a level playing field with the European Community. The conclusions of the FSAP
suggest that, while challenging, this objective is not out of reach. The CBSM will need to
strengthen its governance so as to enhance its autonomy; its resources will need to be
expanded to facilitate the effective enforcement of prudential regulations and supervision;
and its international cooperation with related institutions abroad needs to be intensified.
Furthermore, while the authorities have shown a serious commitment to AML/CFT and have
achieved considerable progress in bringing San Marino’s legal framework in line with
international standards, additional resources need to be allocated to the Financial Intelligence
Agency (FIA), the CBSM and the judiciary to improve enforcement.
35.
More broadly, the authorities need to evaluate what kind of financial sector is
best suited for San Marino. In the absence of a LOLR, a smaller scale financial sector
focused on the needs of the economy of San Marino would be prudent. On the other hand, if
the banking sector were better integrated with reputable and dependable international
banking groups than is currently the case, this would lessen the need for a Sammarinese
specific LOLR framework, and the financial sector could remain large and internationally
active. This model would be based on the development of a financial sector in which the
soundness of locally-licensed banks would depend on that of their parent institutions. The
need to maintain strong financial sector regulation and supervision capacities would
nevertheless remain, partly because support from parents cannot be taken for granted. In this
context, the challenge would be to balance prudential requirements for liquidity and exposure
to related parties against business needs that entail high exposures to the parent. This would

14
require close cooperation with home supervisors in order to keep under review the financial
health of parent groups and their ability to support their local subsidiaries.
Enhance product and labor markets flexibility
36.
The staff welcome the efforts to liberalize the product market, but reckons that
the authorities’ concerns can be addressed through measures less damaging to
competition. Remaining restrictions to ownership and entry barriers could be removed given
that concerns about the potential for money-laundering for certain activities may be
addressed through the implementation of an effective AML/CFT regime, on corporate
ownership in particular.
37.
Labor market reforms are needed to attract more diversified and high-skilled
labor and ease the transition toward a new business model. The mission acknowledges
that active labor market policies can help generate the jobs that the private sector will need to
reposition itself in the new environment however, their actual effectiveness remains to be
seen. Moreover, labor market rigidities continue to be high, making it difficult for the private
sector to take advantage of new market opportunities. The mission also understands that
undertaking wide-ranging reforms when pressures on unemployment have increased is
politically challenging, but an open and competitive labor market will be in the long-run
interest of the citizens of San Marino.
Strengthen further the statistical system
38.
The authorities have made great strides since San Marino’s participation in the
IMF’s General Data Dissemination System, but there is still room for improvement
(Annex II). National and fiscal accounts, as well as monetary and financial sector data are
compiled according to international standards, but some key statistics (such as real and fiscal
data) are available only with delay and, in many cases, are at a lower than standard frequency
and detail, which raises uncertainty about the reliability of medium term forecasts. Increasing
coverage and reducing the time lag in producing and disseminating statistics would help
bring the system to a level needed for well informed economic policymaking. An improved
and more timely statistical database would also help San Marino achieve its aim of greater
international integration.
39.

It is recommended that San Marino remain on a 24-month consultation cycle.

Projected Obligations to Fund: None

VII. Exchange Rate Arrangements: Prior to 1999 the currency of San Marino was the
Italian lira. Since January 1, 1999 San Marino uses the euro as its official currency. The
central monetary institution is the Banca Centrale della Republica di San Marino. Foreign
exchange transactions are conducted through commercial banks without restriction at rates
quoted in Italian markets. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign

3
exchange. San Marino's exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments
and transfers for current international transactions, except for those maintained solely for the
preservation of national or international security and which have been notified to the Fund
pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51).1
VIII. Article IV Consultation: San Marino is on a 24 months cycle. The previous Article
IV consultation took place during November 30–December 11, 2006, and concluded on
February 23, 2007 (Country Report No. 07/94). The staff report and associated Executive
Board’s assessment are available at:

ANNEX II. SAN MARINO: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision: Progress has been made since San Marino’s participation in the IMF’s
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) in May 6, 2008 but important weaknesses in
the statistical database remain mainly due to resource constraints. In January 2007, in view
their intention to participate to the GDDS, the authorities named two National GDDS
Coordinators and announced their objective to increase the frequency of website updates in
order to improve data dissemination. As of November 2009, national and fiscal accounts, as
well as monetary and financial sector data are compiled according to international standards
but some key statistics (such as real and fiscal data) are available only with delay and, in
many cases, are at a lower than standard frequency and detail.
Real sector statistics: National accounts data for 1995 onward have been calculated in
accordance with ESA95 and since 2008 data are compiled quarterly with about six months
delay. The authorities have also calculated sectoral value added annually but data are
published with one-year delay. Consumer prices and, starting June 2008, employment data
are published monthly with short delay. A business production index based on electricity
consumption was launched in 2006. Consumption and business sentiment indexes have been
compiled starting 2007 based on annual household and business surveys.
Government finance statistics: The authorities have provided data for the central
government, state owned enterprises, and social security fund for 2004–09, as well as the
budget for 2010–2012. However, only central government data have been compiled in
accordance with IMF standards, and only after explicit request. Typically, the central
government budget is still written so as to close at par, which implies that standard financing
items, such as amortization, are included as an expenditure while ”borrowing requirement” is
included among the revenues.
Monetary and financial statistics: Since May 1997 the authorities have provided balance
sheet data on the commercial banks and the monetary authorities to the STA’s EIS database.
These data are provided on a quarterly basis, with approximately a six-week reporting lag.
The authorities have introduced laws and took some measures to improve coverage and
timeliness of banks’ reporting. The CBSM has improved sectorization and expanded data
collection to cover the offshore asset management activities of banks. The breakdown of
deposits (and other assets and liabilities) between residents and nonresidents and the
breakdown of short-term credit by public and private sector components are also available.
However, there is no broad money survey and data on non-bank financial intermediaries are
lacking.
External sector: San Marino does not compile balance of payments accounts. Given the
currency union with Italy and the subsequent introduction of the euro, the authorities have
not considered this a high priority and have, therefore, not committed the necessary
resources. Starting 2008, trade statistics are released quarterly with a lag of about six months.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
THE REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO
Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of San Marino
Staff Supplement
Prepared by the European Department
Approved by Adam Bennett and Thomas Dorsey
February 16, 2010
1.
This statement summarizes economic development and policy actions since issuance
of the staff report. This information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
The President and Director General of the Central Bank of San Marino (CBSM)
resigned on February 9, 2010, following the dismissal of the head of banking supervision at
CBSM by CBSM’s Board of Directors on the recommendation of the Credit and Savings
Committee.1 In their published letter of resignation they mentioned (inter alia) the following
reasons for resigning: “interferences and pressures exerted on the central bank to influence
its supervisory function;” and “lack of “the necessary conditions for the continuation of our
appointment”. In public appearances soon after the resignation, the Minister of Finance
indicated that the Committee for Credit and Savings is entitled “to give and revoke its
confidence to central bank staff”, and he reiterated “the government's commitment to
strengthen banking supervision.” In an official statement sent to Fund Staff, the Minister of
Finance declared (inter alia) that “the latest developments will not interrupt the route San
Marino has taken toward higher transparency, efficiency and stability of its banking system”
and that “the Government intends to initiate a project to strengthen the regulatory structure of
the Central Bank and the Financial Information Agency, in order to implement the
recommendations of the IMF and converge toward the most efficient international standards
on financial supervision” He also indicated that the authorities are already searching for
suitable candidates to fill the positions that have been vacated.

1

Members of the Credit and Savings Committee (CCS) include the Minister of Finance as Chair and a minimum
of two to a maximum of four members appointed by Government among its members. The CCS’s
responsibilities include “policy and guidance” (“indirizzo e orientamento”) on “the activity of banking, finance
and insurance supervision.”

2
3.
On the basis of the information available to the staff at this juncture, the dismissal of
the head of banking supervision would not appear to violate Sammarinese law, but does
reflect the lack of independence of the CBSM. These events reinforce the importance of
strengthening CBSM independence and accountability frameworks, as underscored in the
staff appraisal and elaborated on further in the FSSA. Swift action in line with international
best practice in this regard will be critical to help lift the uncertainties regarding banking
system policy in San Marino that these recent events may generate. Such actions would
include—as a matter of urgency—the appointment of a qualified management team for
CBSM and of a new head of banking supervision at the CBSM.
4.
In January 2010, Parliament adopted, and the Captains Regent promulgated,
amendments to the bank secrecy provisions contained in Article 36 of the San Marino
financial supervision law which prohibits disclosure of confidential information. However,
the amendments do not properly address the key criticisms identified by the mission (see
paragraph # 80 of the FSSA). Article 36 still has no exception to the secrecy provision that
would allow on-site visits of foreign-owned banks by the home state supervisor. In addition,
the amended Article 36 now allows confidential information to be passed to a foreign-owned
bank’s parent company but only where this is in accordance with San Marino’s laws on
consolidated supervision. However, those laws still do not provide for proper risk
management of a foreign-owned Sammarinese banks by its parent bank.
5.
The effort to sign OECD compliant bilateral agreements on exchange of information
on tax matters is continuing, with one additional agreement signed since the staff report was
issued. This brings to 21 the number of such agreements signed since April 2009.
6.
In light of the risks and perceived risks from arising from banking system concerns,
the staff now proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12 month
cycle.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 25, 2010

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with
San Marino
On February 17, 2010 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with San Marino.1
Background
The global financial crisis, which began to affect the economy of San Marino in the second half
of 2008, is likely to continue to do so in 2009‒10. Growth turned negative by 1.1 percent in
2008; it is projected to be minus 5 percent in 2009 and to remain negative in 2010. As a
consequence, unemployment is on the rise and inflation is declining. Due to the sharp
deterioration in domestic demand, the trade balance is expected to improve.
Short-term vulnerabilities in the financial sector have risen due to exposure of the largest bank
to a troubled Italian banking group and to liquidity pressures from a tax amnesty adopted by
the Italian government. The authorities have responded with a range of policy measures,
which have so far resulted in the orderly unwinding of the banks’ positions, but significant
vulnerabilities remain.
For the medium-term, the economy of San Marino must adjust to the new international
environment of greater transparency, but it is not yet clear how the economy will adapt to the
end of activities based on limited bank secrecy.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted the significant negative impact of the global economic crisis on San
Marino’s economy and the macro financial vulnerabilities that the country faces. Directors
endorsed the measures taken by the authorities to address the immediate pressures. They
commended the authorities for strengthening international cooperation in economic and
financial matters and for their effort to reach a double taxation agreement with Italy, which
would help facilitate a repositioning of the economy.
Directors noted that the financial sector has withstood pressures relatively well. They
commended the authorities for managing effectively the emerging liquidity pressures.
However, in light of the continued uncertainties, Directors stressed that the central bank should
maintain the safeguards it had adopted. Directors agreed that as soon as liquidity pressures
abate, mandatory deposits should be replaced by a conventional reserve requirement system.
They noted that recapitalization of the largest bank would enhance its financial strength.
Directors expressed concern about the dismissal of the head of banking supervision at the
central bank and the ensuing resignation of its top management. They stressed that these
developments impact the effectiveness of financial supervision and undermine the credibility of
the reform process in the financial sector and the reputation of the country’s financial
authorities. Directors called on the authorities to resolve this issue urgently and to take the
necessary action to rebuild the reputation and credibility of the central bank and ensure its
independence and accountability.
Directors considered the authorities’ fiscal policy stance to be broadly appropriate. At the same
time, they emphasized the importance of ensuring fiscal sustainability. Consolidation
measures should include reducing current expenditures as well as resuming pension reforms
and consideration should be given to introducing co-payments on healthcare services and
products.
Directors urged the authorities to implement the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)
recommendations to further reinforce financial sector supervision and create a level playing
field with the European Union. Noting structural weaknesses in the systemic liquidity
management framework, Directors encouraged the authorities to address the lack of an
effective lender-of-last resort framework, for example through better integration of
Sammarinese banks with reputable international banks.
Directors underscored the need for greater product and labor market flexibility to improve the
country’s business model. Noting the progress made in the statistical system, they encouraged
the authorities to strengthen this effort.

3
Directors appreciated the transparency measures adopted by the authorities, including on antimoney laundering and combating the financing of terrorism, and urged them to fortify these
efforts.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Arrigo Sadun, Executive Director and Francesco Spadafora, Senior
Advisor to Executive Director
February 17, 2010
At the outset, the Sammarinese authorities wish to thank the Fund’s mission teams for the
high-quality and balanced reports, which are testament to the excellent dialogue and working
relationship with the Fund. The authorities have greatly benefited from the conclusions of the
FSAP, as well as from the Article IV discussion on policies to mitigate macro-financial
vulnerabilities and support growth. They broadly share the Fund’s recommendations.
San Marino’s economy has not been immune from the global crisis. Growth turned negative
in 2008, deteriorated in 2009, and is likely to remain negative (at -1.8 percent) also in 2010.
As a consequence, inflation is declining and unemployment is projected to hit 5.5 percent in
2010. Mirroring the sharp deterioration in domestic demand, the trade balance is improving
(a surplus of 20 percent of GDP is projected for 2010, up from 17 percent in 2009).
Against this background, the authorities’ policy response in the short term focused on
addressing the banks’ liquidity position, improving financial sector supervision, and
supporting the economy through fiscal policy.
Over the medium term, the authorities aim to seize the opportunities arising from a new
international environment characterized by greater transparency in economic and financial
areas. To this end, their overarching objective is to strengthen San Marino’s integration in
the global economy and facilitate the transformation of the country’s business model through
enhanced international cooperation and transparency.
Fiscal Policy
The authorities have adopted several fiscal measures to support the economy in the current
downturn, bearing in mind the need to preserve the medium-term sustainability of public
finances.
A scheme to subsidize enterprises that are planning to invest in new technologies was
introduced in 2009, while unemployment and wage supplementation benefits (Cassa
Integrazione Guadagni) have been expanded. A more comprehensive reform of social safety
nets is planned to be implemented in 2010.
Following the above discretionary measures and the sharp contraction in revenues from the
economic slowdown, the fiscal accounts will result in a significant deterioration. The central
government’s balance is expected to be -4.3 percent of GDP in 2009 (the first deficit since
2002) and -3.5 of GDP in 2010. Owing to prudent fiscal policy over the years, the public
sector had accumulated significant bank deposits, equivalent to about 23 percent of GDP as
of October 2009.

2
In order to preserve medium-term fiscal sustainability, the government is actively engaged in
reducing current spending. Moreover, a pension reform is being implemented, based on
defined-contribution pension funds (second pillar), which should integrate the public pension
system. In the medium term, the introduction of co-payments on certain health care services
could be taken into consideration.
Financial Sector
The banking sector is a traditional source of growth for the country and its capitalization is
high by international standards. Following an Italian tax amnesty (effective September 2009)
to stimulate individuals and businesses to repatriate their off-shore assets, the banking sector
has been coping with sizable deposit outflows.
The Central Bank of San Marino (CBSM) took several initiatives, some in close cooperation
with the Italian authorities, to effectively tackle short-term liquidity developments and boost
its lender-of-last-resort capacity. The authorities’ pro-active stance to address liquidity
pressures have helped the orderly unwinding of banks’ positions, and all the banks have been
able to meet depositor requests.
In particular, to enhance the CBSM’s ability to monitor liquidity, banks were asked to report
their liquidity position frequently (eventually on a daily basis), and to disclose the maturity
structure of their balance sheets. In mid-November 2009, the CBSM established a voluntary
and incentive-based facility whereby banks with excess liquidity could deposit funds with the
central bank. At the end of November 2009, a Decree-Law allowed the government to
guarantee any foreign borrowing by the CBSM to help secure credit lines from domestic or
foreign banks to be used for temporary liquidity assistance to financial institutions. In early
December 2009, another Decree-Law imposed on banks a mandatory 8 percent deposit
requirement with the CBSM.
In the context of the renegotiation of the 2000 Monetary Cooperation agreement with the
European Community, in November 2009 San Marino also started negotiations on the
possibility for its banks to gain access to the Eurosystem liquidity.
The CBSM also provided liquidity assistance to the largest bank (Cassa di Risparmio della
Repubblica di San Marino-CRSM), following the financial difficulties that started in June
2009 as a result of the exposure to Delta, its Italian subsidiary. A recapitalization plan
unveiled in mid-January 2010 is being implemented to strengthen CRSM’s financial
position. The plan revolves around two measures: an overall capital injection, with
contributions from the government, the local banking sector, Sammarinese private investors,
and the current shareholders; and the issuance of medium-term bonds. The CRSM indicated
that the plan would bring the bank’s CAR above 11 percent, which will be the minimum
requirement by 2013.

3
The authorities have stated their commitment to strengthening the enforcement capacity of
financial sector supervision. As noted in the FSSA report, in the recent period commendable
progress was made by the CBSM in this area. Prior to 2005, financial regulation in San
Marino was limited, with insufficient legislative regulation consistent with the Basel
Committee Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision. Over the past four years, the
CBSM has been the main driver toward developing proper prudential and supervisory
frameworks in line with international standards.
The Government recognizes the important role carried out by the CBSM, in particular with
regard to on-site supervision. Since its establishment, it has ensured increasing resources to
conduct efficient and timely inspections. To this end, the CBSM’s staff has been increased
by over 40 percent since 2004.
The authorities have stated their commitment to strengthening the anti-money laundering and
combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime. Following the 2007 MONEYVAL
mutual evaluation, the authorities acted swiftly and steadily to fix the shortcomings and fill
the gaps of the AML/CFT regime. Since the adoption of the MONEYVAL Mutual
Evaluation Report in 2008, San Marino has achieved considerable progress in bringing its
legal and institutional framework in line with the FATF recommendations. As a result of this
progress, MONEYVAL lifted the compliance enhancing procedure in September 2009. An
on-site visit of San Marino is planned in September 2010, as part of MONEYVAL’s fourth
round of mutual evaluations.
Improving the Business Environment
As stated in the introduction, the developments at the international level toward an
environment characterized by greater transparency in economic and financial areas are seen
by the authorities as new opportunities to be seized in order to strengthen San Marino’s
international integration and cooperation, and to facilitate the transformation of the country’s
business model.
To this end, between April and September 2009, San Marino signed 12 OECD compliant
bilateral agreements on exchange of information on tax matters, and eight additional bilateral
agreements were signed as of mid-January 2010[1]. As a result of this effort, the country
joined the OECD “White List”.
In the context of a renegotiation of the 2000 Monetary Cooperation agreement with the
European Community, San Marino is working on the European Commission’s request to
adopt over time all relevant EU legislation relating to the activity and supervision of
financial institutions, AML/CFT, and statistical reporting requirements. The ultimate
objective is to create a level playing field between San Marino and the European
Community for its financial sector.

4
In this regard, it should be noted that, while the financial sector is a traditional source of high
growth, making up about 20 percent of GDP and 10 percent of the government’s total
revenues, industry has the largest contribution to GDP (38 percent), and another major
contribution (nearly 20 percent) also comes from tourism and commercial. As correctly noted
by staff, these features of the economy of San Marino should help in addressing current
challenges.
The government has taken important steps toward product market liberalization and
streamlining. The business licensing system has been reformed in 2009, with the aim of
reducing political discretion in awarding licenses, expediting bureaucratic procedures, and
reducing barriers to entry. Measures have also been taken to discourage the establishment of
anonymous companies and to increase transparency. However, the authorities consider that
restrictions on ownership and entry barriers should remain in those sectors (i.e., real estate,
telecommunication, and car rental), which are particularly vulnerable to money-laundering
activities.
The authorities are planning several reforms to strengthen the labor market, most notably
through active labor market policies to assist unemployed workers and enhance
employability. Additional benefits may come from a double-taxation agreement with Italy
that is set to be signed in 2010.
The authorities have a more cautious approach than staff on increasing labor market
liberalization. This is due to the extremely limited size of the territory and to the upward
trend in unemployment as a result of the current economic crisis. The number of cross-border
workers at the end of 2009 amounted to about 41 percent of the total employees in the private
sector.
The Government is currently working on a draft law to regulate residence permits to better
respond to the growing demand for high-qualified workers from abroad. At the same time, it
is actively promoting local expertise through specialized training of Sammarinese workers
and students.
With regard to public administration, an ambitious plan has been launched to increase
flexibility and productivity, including through higher education requirements for new
employees and more transparency in the hiring process. Finally, a number of measures are
planned to reform state-owned enterprises. In this context, the authorities are considering
adjusting tariffs in the utility sector more in line with market prices, and moving to a more
cost effective procurement system.
San Marino has close links with Italy, which accounts for 90 percent of trade in the context
of a customs union. The authorities have given new impetus to strengthening cooperation
with Italy, most notably through the signature of Economic and Financial Cooperation
agreements in 2009. The latter outlines the conditions for San Marino banks to be granted
direct access to the payment systems of the EU, and both will also help reposition the
country in the new international environment of greater transparency.
