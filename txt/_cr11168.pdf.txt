INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
GERMANY
Staff Report for the 2011 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2011 Consultation with Germany
Approved by Antonio Borges and Tamim Bayoumi
June 9, 2011
Executive Summary
Background: Given its large size and international connections, Germany has been called on
to assist the global economic recovery. Similarly, a robust German financial system is
important both for German and global financial stability. The authorities recognize these
linkages and the consequent German responsibilities. They welcomed the focus of this
consultation on Germany’s international role.
Challenges: The authorities argued, and staff agreed, that short-term stimulative measures—
more rapidly raising wages or delaying fiscal consolidation—could compromise German
strengths with dubious value for other countries. The real German challenge is to strengthen its
areas of weakness and, thus, play a more medium-term international role. The key is to
counteract growth constraints in a way that also supports sustainable rebalancing via higher
domestic demand growth. Thus, Germany’s gain would benefit Europe and the global
economy. Also, given the financial system’s large size, its international connections, and the
nonlinear behavior of these connections at times of stress, the forward-looking development of
stronger German systemic shock absorbers is an important goal of the authorities.
Policy Recommendations: Enhancing growth will require focus: tax policy to raise labor
force participation and investment, education and innovation policy to raise productivity
(especially in the services sector via more widespread use of information technology), and an
efficient and stable financial sector (that is also more sensitive to financing start-up ventures).
The authorities broadly agreed with this agenda. They also agreed that these measures will
help raise the traditionally-anemic consumption growth, and such autonomous demand will
boost Germany’s role as an international locomotive and narrow its current account surplus.
However, they also felt that some rebalancing was already ongoing. On securing financial
stability, the authorities recognize the importance of purposeful progress in resolving the
legacy of the crisis and greater clarity on the regulatory and supervisory regime to facilitate
proactive supervisory practice. They saw some merit in staff’s suggestions for streamlining the
permanent resolution and deposit insurance mechanisms and changes in the three-pillar
banking system to meet new challenges; however, they saw these as more medium-term tasks.

I. OUTLOOK
1.
The recovery has brought German output and employment above pre-crisis
levels. After the world economy’s fearsome drop starting in the second quarter of 2008,
economic activity in several emerging markets is now above pre-crisis levels while advanced
economies are just approaching those levels. In the first quarter of 2011 German GDP
surpassed its pre-crisis level following growth of 3½ percent in 2010, and employment is
higher than before the crisis. On both these counts only a few advanced economies have done
as well. The United States is somewhat ahead in terms of output but significantly lags in
employment growth. Consequently, the United States has gained in terms of productivity
growth, a reminder that Germany has considerable ground to make up on productivity.
World trade was near precrisis levels
in December 2010.

2.
The nature of the German recovery
and its growth prospects are explained by the
prominent role of external demand. More so
than elsewhere by far, Germany’s crisis
contraction and the recovery were driven by
external demand. Thus firms, viewing the
downturn as temporary, had greater incentives
than elsewhere to retain workers—and the hourly
flexibility in labor contracts and the short-work
subsidy scheme (Kurzarbeit) were well suited to
reinforce those incentives. Also, because the
demand shock predominated, potential growth
did not fall significantly and the output gap is
projected to close later this year (Box 1).

The German crisis and recovery were externally driven,
more so than in most other countries.

than projected by staff, pointing to the expected increase in the wage bill as well as a pickup
in investment activity. Staff viewed such rebalancing as a cyclical response triggered by the
export impetus and, thus, not yet a reflection of a structural shift.

5
Box 1. Germany’s Growth Potential—Little Damaged but Low
The impact of the crisis on German potential
GDP was relatively mild. Germany experienced a
temporary decline in external demand, in contrast to
longer-lasting, structural shocks elsewhere. Staff
estimates that German potential growth during the
crisis has declined only moderately from its precrisis rate of about 1¼ percent. As such, German
potential GDP will likely suffer limited permanent
damage from the crisis in contrast to more
persistent losses elsewhere—U.S. potential GDP,
for example, is projected to be about 5 percent
below its pre-crisis trend in 2015.

Negative output gaps are more persistent in other
advanced economies.

1/ Pre-crisis trend extrapolated based on staff estimates of
historical potential growth of 1¼ and 2½ percent for
Germany and the U.S., respectively.

The benign crisis impact does not resolve Germany’s long-term problem of low potential
growth. While Germany escaped the crisis with little permanent damage, its long-term growth
prospects, estimated by staff at about 1¼ percent annually, remain low. This view was shared by the
authorities who see potential output growth at between 1¼ and 1½ percent. Thus, although the U.S.
has lost ground relative to its pre-crisis trajectory, the growth gap vis-à-vis the U.S. will remain
significant.

6
Box 2. Labor Market Dynamics During the Crisis and Beyond
German employment remained remarkably stable during the crisis. The outcome reflects the
nature of the shock experienced, the institutional framework, and supporting policies.


While the shock was severe, firms perceived it as temporary and so had the incentive to
hold on to labor and reduce hours worked rather than lay off workers.



It helped that in recent years, flexible workweeks and work-time accounts had been
incorporated into collective agreements. The subsidy for reduced work-time hours
(Kurzarbeit) was extended and similarly reinforced the incentives to adjust employment
through hours.



The Hartz reforms in the early 2000s redesigned unemployment and welfare benefits, and
thereby increased the flow into employment, especially at the low-wage end. This has led
to a decline in the steady-state unemployment rate, which is projected to reach about
6¼ percent or less, from over 8 percent historically. This underlying downward trend also
explains the moderate unemployment response.
...consistent with a lower steady-state
unemployment rate.

The unemployment rate has trended downward...

The low potential growth rate
reflects a combination of factors. GDP
growth is projected to converge, by 2015,
to the long-term potential rate of
1¼ percent. Over the last decade, labor and
capital services have made modest
contributions; adjusted by hours worked,
the contribution of labor has been nil.
Total factor productivity (TFP) has
responded to cyclical factors, falling
sharply in the crisis and then realizing an
offsetting gain in the recovery. But the
recent flattening is consistent with low
long-term average TFP growth.
Productivity growth has been strong in
Germany’s traditional areas of strength,
rising but below that of the U.S. in the
production of information and
communications technology products, and
low in services, especially business and
trade services.

Export dependence offers some upside growth potential but the downside risks

A multi-pronged growth agenda is required. All three contributors to potential
growth, labor, capital, and productivity need attention. First, merely to offset the sharp
decline in the working-age population over the next decade would require an about
2½ percentage point increase in labor force participation, a gap unlikely to be filled by
additional immigration. Second, the low investment rate needs to be raised. And, finally,
higher productivity growth will benefit from investment and innovation, especially in areas
outside Germany’s traditional strengths. Productivity gaps in the services sector require
greater usage of information and communication technology (ICT), where Germany can
close the gap with the international frontier. The importance and crosscutting nature of ICT is
reflected in Germany’s High Tech Strategy, and, more broadly, in Europe’s 2020 growth
agenda, which also notes the link between ICT usage and services’ productivity.
The private services sector in Germany has
invested relatively less in information technologies.

The share of investment and research in information
technologies is relatively small in Germany.

This agenda needs to be supported by specific policy measures. Based on
discussions with the authorities, the measures with the greatest expected leverage to support
these objectives are:


Tax policy. Tax policy to increase incentives for labor participation and investment is
discussed in section IV on public finances.



Education policy. While the authorities noted that important education initiatives are
already bearing fruit, they recognized the need for more widespread early childhood
care and education, reorienting vocational training to emphasize lifelong learning, and
further upwards mobility within the education system.



Innovation policy. Promoting the availability of risk capital will help raise incentives
to invest in higher-risk, higher-growth sectors. In this regard, removing uncertainties
regarding tax treatment, redesigning change-of-ownership rule, which eliminates loss
and interest carry-forward, as well as improving the efficiency of the insolvency
process (by promoting faster restructuring proceedings, including through legislative
initiatives currently underway) would help develop further venture capital and private
equity markets. Further efforts in increasing commercial use of intellectual property
rights held by universities and research institutions should be considered.

Despite its large economic size, Germany has not been a significant independent
source of global growth. Germany’s outward growth spillovers have been small compared
to other large countries. The limited outward spillovers from Germany and large inward
spillovers are related. Countries with high sensitivity to external shocks generate limited
outward spillovers. Germany transmits impulses from the United States and Asia, mainly to
European economies with strong trade links. The authorities suggested that Germany’s robust
recovery could enhance its role as an independent engine of growth. They also noted that
those countries that are thought of as locomotives experienced unsustainable residential
investment booms and rising current account deficits. And they pointed to beneficial effects
from German foreign direct investment on growth in Central and Eastern European countries
which have been integrated into Germany’s regional supply chain.

Greater contribution to European and global rebalancing would require more
autonomous German sources of domestic demand. Stepped up efforts to raise potential
growth would contribute to that goal if they create wider employment opportunities alongside
higher productivity growth, particularly in the non-tradables sector. In addition to creating
incentives for greater domestic investment, higher permanent incomes would also sustain
higher consumption growth. While the authorities shared this perspective, they also felt that
some of the rebalancing was already occurring.

16
15.
The German financial system could generate outward spillovers—and it is
susceptible to shocks from other large financial systems. The large size of Germany’s
financial system, its international connections, and the nonlinear behavior of these
connections at times of stress, imply that Germany could have a larger cross-border influence
through its financial system than through its real economy. For this reason, as the authorities
recognize, a robust financial system is important for both German and global financial
stability. The risks of financial spillovers into Germany arise mainly from other large
financial systems. Broader risks arise from the continuing uncertainty with regard to the debt
obligations of euro area sovereigns and banks under stress, which creates an environment
where contagion risks are elevated. Staff proposed that these challenges warrant a more
comprehensive and consistent European policy response, and the German authorities
emphasized the need for a clear framework that paid due regard to moral hazard and private
sector involvement.
16.
German exposure to direct risk from the European periphery is limited in terms
of banks’ assets but more wideranging implications are possible. Aggregate exposure of
German banks to sovereign and bank debt held in peripheral economies is small relative to
the size of their assets. But this

Box 3. Structural Factors and the Current Account
The emergence of global imbalances cannot be explained by
current account models. In the long term, current account balances
are to a large extent driven by fundamentals such as per capita
income level, fiscal policies, demographic factors, oil prices and the
initial net foreign assets position. The traditional drivers of the
current account, however, cannot explain the recent surge in global
imbalances. The residuals from the current account equation largely
mirror the imbalances from 2000–09.

Germany’s export competitiveness derives from a comparative advantage in a
large number of specialized product varieties. German firms have specialized in a large
variety of capital goods, consumer durables, and pharmaceuticals and they enjoy significant
world market shares in these products. The authorities noted that by the onset of the pre-crisis
boom, the decline in competitiveness following unification had been counteracted. Germany
was able to hold market share, allowing exports to ride the global trade wave. There is,
however, a cautionary tale here. The U.S. also enjoys specialization in a large number of
products, but has been losing market share in the past decade. Thus, global competition,
especially from emerging nations, will likely challenge traditional German dominance.

In popular discourse, raising German wages to reduce German competitiveness
is often recommended, as is reducing the household savings rate.1 But these approaches
are neither analytically nor pragmatically sound.

Despite recent wage moderation, German
wages are amongst the highest in Europe
(changes in nominal wages and unit labor
costs are highly correlated). Since its
competitiveness derives from product
specialization, raising German wages
would do little to improve export
prospects of countries that do not compete
with Germany in its specialized products.
Higher wages would increase domestic
consumption only if seen as sustainable
by residents but would hurt if, as the
authorities suggest, they reduce
investment incentives further.

The German national saving rate is about on par with advanced European peers.
Household saving rates are also not exceptionally high. Reducing domestic savings
rates will require bucking a long-standing tendency in Germany for precautionary
savings; moreover, providing greater social security to reduce the incentive to save
would go against public finance considerations; and finally, addressing Germany’s
traditionally high level of precautionary savings is best seen as the end result of
raising domestic sources of growth, rather than the starting point.

The most sustainable approach to reducing the German current account surplus
is likely through policy efforts to raise domestic investment rates, which are low among
advanced economies. The corporate sector was the main contributor to the increased surplus
during the boom years. The rise in corporate savings, reflecting increased profits and low
dividend payout, was not matched, as the

Germany. The key to raising investment is likely to
be a restructuring of public finance priorities (as
discussed below). But, in addition, the broader growth agenda would increase permanent
incomes, reduce uncertainty and, hence, stimulate consumption and investment, further
contributing to reduced surpluses. Although the authorities expect investment to pick up
given the recent recovery in capacity utilization, they see merit in improving the investment
climate. They also recognize that reducing banks’ incentives to seek higher yields abroad and
more proactively develop domestic business would be a help.

B. International Investment Position
23.
Germany has exported capital to match its
surpluses, increasing sharply its holding of
international assets. Outward foreign direct
investment has increased to above 40 percent of GDP.
While the authorities rightly emphasized the value of
German FDI to the receiving economies, they also
recognized that financial investments by banks—
through loans and the purchase of stocks and bonds—
were the primary drivers of the large outflows prior to
the crisis. Since 2007 banks have reduced their
holdings of foreign assets, which have been partly
transferred to the public sector through the resolution
agencies.

IV. PUBLIC FINANCES
28.
From a sizeable stimulus, the authorities are moving towards a gradual
consolidation. The German fiscal stimulus during the crisis phase was comparable to—or
larger than—in other advanced economies. That stimulus is now set to be phased out and a
consolidation process has begun. The package is ambitious by historical standards (Box 4).
Staff estimates suggest that the size of the consolidation (at about ¾ percentage points of
GDP per year) is likely to be larger than that implied by the authorities’ estimates of the
structural balance based on the output gap. The latter incorporates a larger allowance for the
reduction in cyclically-adjusted spending than occurred on account of the strength of the
labor market in the downturn. The European Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) target can be
achieved in 2011, and the objectives of the national fiscal rule and the preventive arm of the

24
SGP are within reach at the latest by 2016. The increased primary surplus will help bring
down the debt-to-GDP ratio from its current level of over 83 percent of GDP (having been
boosted recently by banking sector support).
Germany f iscal stimulus was one of the
largest among advanced countries.

Box 4. Large Fiscal Adjustments are Subject to Risks1
Fiscal consolidation has been a key concern for
German policy makers. With the debt-to-GDP ratio
on a generally rising trend, periodic efforts have
been made to rein it in. Four large fiscal adjustment
initiatives were in 1976–79, 1982–85, 1992–95
and 2004–07.

29.
Staff views the proposed consolidation path as appropriate. The German economy
is on a path to close its output gap. From the European perspective, a slower pace of German
consolidation will provide limited fiscal spillovers to the periphery, and elsewhere the need is
less with output gaps also closing. At the same time, German debt at over 83 percent of GDP
remains high, the demographic fiscal challenge lies ahead, and debt dynamics are susceptible
to growth shocks and fiscal slippages. Adherence to Germany’s near-structural balance rule
will strengthen the credibility of that commitment. The authorities recognize that some of
their proposed measures (e.g., military spending cuts), however, remain under discussion. In
case the savings envisioned do not materialize, the authorities recognize that additional
efforts would be required elsewhere. They also emphasized that cyclical revenue gains would
not be used to finance structural measures. Staff agreed but recommended the pace of
consolidation be slowed in case of a substantial negative shock to growth.

From a longer-term perspective, and staying within the consolidation path, a
rebalancing of public finances to promote growth is desirable. The need to increase labor
participation is evident on account of the projected decline in the workforce and the scope for
doing so is validated by the Scandinavian experience. Low-skilled, female, and elderly labor

31.
Reducing labor taxes along the participation margins could be most effective
(Box 5). Marginal tax rate relief is best targeted at the participation margin of labor supply,
and tagged to paid work. This can be implemented through the introduction of in-work credit
programs for the elderly and secondary earners and an earned income tax credit for the lowincome, with the possibility of a negative income tax. An alternative to the latter could be to
raise the threshold for the low-income tax relief (the so-called mini-jobs) and reduce the
speed at which tax benefits are withdrawn. Also, reforming the regime of income splitting for
tax purposes could create better incentives for labor market participation as it would shift the
marginal tax burden away from the more flexible partners towards inelastic primary earners.2
While predicting the impact of such reforms is inherently difficult, a rough estimate suggests
that tax credits for the elderly and secondary earners combined with the move to individual
taxation of married couples could increase the labor force significantly (by about
900,000 people if the tax credit is 1,000 euros per person/family) with relatively small fiscal
cost (0.7 percentage points of GDP). While the authorities agreed with the need to reduce the
labor tax wedge, they favored a more generalized tax reduction. They also pointed to
constitutional constraints regarding the elimination of income splitting and noted that
improving the quality and availability of childcare is essential in stimulating the labor supply
of women.

Further reform of the corporate income tax would also support growth. Recent
studies find that among all taxes, corporate taxes are the most harmful to economic growth,
with recurrent taxes on immovable residential property being the least harmful. Despite a
comprehensive reform of the corporate income tax in 2008, there is scope for improving the
tax regime for enterprises. In particular, consideration should be given to abolishing the local
level trade tax, and offset it by property and inheritance taxes. Also, in line with international
trends, the debt bias in corporate financing could be reduced. This can be achieved by
introducing an allowance for the normal return on new equity, which, while creating an
initial fiscal cost, will help increase investment, wages and growth.3 While the authorities
agreed with the need to reform the trade tax and reduce the debt bias in corporate financing,
they pointed out to the lack of political consensus for the former and the likely high fiscal
cost of the latter, which would require a gradual approach.
33.
The proposed reductions in direct taxes might require larger revenues from
indirect taxes and reductions in social entitlements. Eliminating concessions in VAT and
raising property and inheritance taxes will help bolster revenue. Staff estimates potential
gains from these reforms at 3 percent of GDP. On the expenditure side, elimination of
unconditional child transfers would have to be carefully designed to take into account all
existing benefits and tax incentives. The evidence suggests that there is substantial scope to
increase efficiency of education spending (Box 6), with which the authorities agreed,
emphasizing their intentions to improve the quality of public finances in general.

Box 5. Taxation and Labor Supply1


Empirical studies find that a high tax wedge significantly increases the
unemployment rate by discouraging job search and making people more
reluctant to accept formal jobs. Moreover, it induces trade unions to increase
their wage claims, which increases the unemployment rate. For a given tax
wedge, progressivity in the income tax tends to reduce involuntary
unemployment since trade unions find it less attractive to claim high wages.



The net impact of after-tax wages on formal hours worked is small for men.
Women tend to be more responsive to tax rates.



The responsiveness is larger for decisions on whether or not to take paid work.
This may reflect, for instance, participation response by secondary earners (who
alternatively engage in home production), the unemployed (who alternatively
have access to social benefits), elderly workers (who alternatively retire early),
or low skilled (who alternatively operate in the informal sector).2



Studies also show that a high tax wedge may affect the amount of on-the-job
training, and the willingness to work irregular hours, as well as lead to the
underreporting of formal income.

Box 6. Social Spending and the Efficiency of Public Expenditure
Social expenditures have declined recently, but they remain a significant part of
overall expenditure in line with Germany’s per capita income. In 2008 Germany
spent 27.8 percent of GDP on social protection benefits—payments for sickness,
disability, pensions, unemployment, housing, family and children’s benefits. This
represents a decline of 2 ¾ points from 2003, but still accounts for roughly ⅔ of public
expenditure.
There is scope for increasing efficiency in public spending. Efficiency of social
expenditure could be increased by the broader use of means testing instead of
unconditional transfers, for example, for universal child benefits. Such measures would
have to be viewed in conjunction with tax allowances. While spending on primary and
secondary education in Germany is at about the OECD average, the educational
attainment—as measured by scores in cross-country studies—is low, pointing to
significant potential efficiency gains.

and experienced reduced losses in 2010. In a few
cases, banks have transferred impaired assets and non-core business to winding-up
institutions.
35.
Stress tests conducted under the FSAP Update confirm that the majority of
banks have sufficient capital buffers. Solvency tests assessed the vulnerability of the
banking system under two macroeconomic stress scenarios over 2011–15, (a) a sharp
“double dip” recession, which leads to an inverted yield curve; and (b) a prolonged period of
very low growth. A variety of risk factors, which have a potential impact for the German
financial system, were considered, including, funding risks, sovereign risk, upcoming
regulatory reforms, and behavioral responses. As the Financial System Stability Assessment
(FSSA) notes, on the whole, the portfolios of German banks were found to be robust against
cyclical fluctuations as well as direct spillover risks from peripheral sovereign debt exposure
thanks to recent improvements in capitalization levels and asset quality. The results of
liquidity stress tests indicate that banks can cope with large liquidity shocks, although larger
banks and some specialized private banks, given their reliance on wholesale funding, appear
more vulnerable than smaller retail banks, and could face higher funding costs in the future.

32
36.
However, pockets of vulnerabilities remain. German banks remain highly
leveraged and the quality of their capital is low by international standards. Their profitability
is also relatively low and expected to remain so (Figure 2). While Basel III requirements are
to be phased in, the market’s anticipation of higher capitalization standards will create
pressure particularly on the larger banks. In this setting, unanticipated impairments could
require new capital raising efforts. Within this overall picture, certain banks under current
stress and others that operate close to the regulatory minimum capital ratios face particular
challenges. The authorities agreed with this overall assessment and noted that some banks
have increased their capital and that they are closely monitoring the banks’ progress on their
way to complying with Basel.
Large German banks are relatively robust overall, but there are some tail risks.

B. Managing the After-Effects of the Crisis
38.
The German authorities provided sizeable support to a number of financial
institutions during the crisis. Total government intervention in the financial sector as
measured by the impact on public debt amounted to almost 13 percent of GDP. This includes
about 1.7 percent of GDP in federal and state recapitalizations and guarantees for capital
support; and the large portfolios of impaired assets/non-core business of the two winding-up
institutions (and other asset run-off vehicles) at end-2010 amounted to 11.1 percent of GDP.
Moreover, the federal government pledged 16¾ percent of GDP in guarantees for liquidity

35
support. Only less than half of that amount was issued in guarantees and most of these will be
run down by end 2011.

The legacy of the past crisis
requires more forceful action. Three
principles should guide such further
action, a view supported by the
authorities. First, the objective should be
to transfer the viable parts of the
distressed banks back from state care to
private competitive markets. This would
imply a scaling back of the authorities
“silent” ownership of banks. In this
regard, recent developments are
encouraging. Second, a more ambitious
approach is needed to isolate the “good”
segments of the banks’ portfolios, guided
by a realistic markdown of assets and a
clarification of core banking business in
the distressed institutions. The
consequent reduction in uncertainty with
regard to their viability should allow
them to function as healthy institutions
without state support. Finally, a plan to
dispose of the “bad” assets in a deliberate
manner but in a reasonable time frame
must be drawn up. The international
experience shows that protracted disposal
of assets hurts their long-term value and
recovery.

Restructuring authority and financing
40.
The new bank restructuring law is welcome and enhances the level of
preparedness. The law grants broad powers to the authorities to facilitate more timely and
efficient resolution of banks that are deemed systemically relevant. The new law embodies
many elements currently under discussion in European fora and is expected to be consistent
with the anticipated outcome. Open questions relate to the coordination between various
parties in the process of bank resolution, and to the provisions on resolution plans.

36
41.
The bank levy to fund the new resolution fund will build up additional resources
but given its target size, interim contingency arrangements remain critical. The
envisaged calculation of the bank levy is focused on the bank’s liabilities side (excluding
deposits and capital) and interconnectedness (nominal derivatives positions). Measuring the
latter risk remains an ongoing task, and initial contributions may be lower than expected due
to a ceiling on the levy linked to bank profits. The authorities are aware of these issues and
are finalizing regulations on the determination of the levy. Consideration should be given to
broadening the levy to other systemic financial sector participants benefitting from a stable
financial sector, such as insurance. Also, contingency arrangements for the event of a
substantial need of resolution funding need clarification.
42.
According to staff, a phased unification of the deposit insurance schemes, along
with synergies with the restructuring fund, would create greater certainty and stability.
The German deposit insurance regime is fragmented, and some parts lack full transparency,
legal certainty, and well-defined funding modalities in line with international best practice.
Also due to broad exemptions, the voluntary deposit protection and mutual guarantee
schemes currently do not need to embody the minimum elements of the1994 European Union
Directive. The European Commission staff has recently been in discussions with the German
authorities on the removal of the exemptions for mutual guarantee schemes. As a first step to
reduce these schemes’ inconsistencies with the BCBS-IADI core principles,4 the legal
certainty, transparency and funding of the regime should be enhanced by providing for a
harmonized and legally-binding deposit guarantee of €100,000 in all pillars. Also, the
interaction between the deposit insurance schemes and the restructuring fund should be
clarified. As a next step, resilience and credibility should be strengthened by limiting the high
coverage promised under the voluntary schemes.
43.
The authorities recognized the relevance of the issues raised by staff but saw
scope only for gradual change. They noted that depositor confidence was maintained
during the crisis and expect that issues such as lack of legal certainty, transparency, and
higher ex ante funding, will be addressed once the discussions at the European level are
completed. Staff pointed to the possible efficiency gains to be achieved by combining the
resolution fund with deposit insurance under a unified approach, but the authorities prefer to
keep these separate for now.
Supervision
44.
The need for more proactive supervision is a key and well-understood lesson
from the last crisis. This lesson is guiding a more forward-looking regulatory and

4

for Effective Deposit Insurance Systems.

37
supervisory process in Germany. In particular, for macroprudential supervision, the overall
organizational structure and the needed instruments are yet to be established.
45.
Staff expressed concern that the reform of the organizational structure for
financial supervision has dragged on. After abandoning earlier plans to consolidate all
prudential banking supervision into the Bundesbank, the authorities now intend to strengthen
the role of Bundesbank for macro-prudential oversight based on a “10-point plan.” Under this
approach, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority’s (BaFin) micro-prudential integrated
financial services supervision would be preserved. The authorities should proceed decisively
in establishing clear structures and removing lingering uncertainty. Legal enhancements are
needed to remove constraints on an expedient exchange of relevant information within and
between institutions. Early consideration is needed to prevent risks slipping through the
cracks. The authorities agree that further clarity is needed on the interactions between the
Bundesbank, BaFin, and the European Supervisory Authorities, as well as the relationship
between macro- and micro-prudential regulation.
46.
As noted by the FSSA, macroprudential instruments should be used to contain
systemic risk. While the authorities agreed with this broad objective, the specific
arrangements and tools for doing so are still under consideration. The instruments under
review include countercyclical capital buffers, systemic risk charges as foreseen under Basel
III, and, more generally, higher levels and quality of capital (e.g., through Pillar 2 charges).
The FSAP Update has estimated that, for most banks, such capital charges fall within the
existing capitalization. Where needed, additional capital could be covered by contingent
capital, for example.
47.
While the micro-prudential supervision framework is overall sound, there are
areas where it can be improved. The recent FSAP Update found supervision to be largely
compliant with the Basel Core Principles for Effective Supervision. It recommended
continued efforts along several dimensions: (a) regular stress testing of the banking and
insurance sectors, for example, with respect to longer-term risks, U.S. dollar liquidity, and
group-wide spillovers; (b) forward-looking assessment and action to head off vulnerabilities;
(c) advance vetting of bank acquisitions of

emerged from the crisis with a demonstration of stability. Nevertheless, it is not too early to
consider the longer-term challenges and stability risks they face. They have sizeable
exposure to the Landesbanken: despite their storied reputation for financing small and
medium firms, the Sparkassen place a sizeable fraction of their deposits to the
Landesbanken. In particular, as the Landesbanken rushed at the end of the previous decade to
invest in dubious projects abroad, the Sparkassen increased the share of their deposits held
with the Landesbanken. The Sparkassen are also partially responsible for Landesbanken
losses as part owners and guarantors in a mutual protection scheme. One large Sparkasse
faced significant financial stress during the crisis. Their valued deposit base will increasingly
be under contest as European financial integration—particularly internet banking—unfolds,
and adequate returns will be required on the higher and better-quality capital under Basel III.
With the costs they have borne for supporting the Landesbanken, it is not surprising that
some Länder have allowed for private ownership, though yet without voting rights in the
case of Sparkassen. A gradual shift to private ownership, while carving out their public
functions, will create a level playing field for their competitors challenged by new regulatory
burdens (small private banks, cooperative banks). Such a gradual transfer is a tested process
elsewhere in Europe and deserves serious consideration. The authorities believe that the
Sparkassen form an integral part of the German financial system, and continued stable
functioning during the crisis. Any reform would need to be considered in a medium- to longterm perspective.

VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
49.
Enduring strengths and supportive short-term policy measures have helped
achieve an impressive recovery from the crisis. The proficiency of its industry, along with
a sizeable, internationally-coordinated fiscal stimulus, targeted measures to support the labor
market and stabilize the financial sector, helped bring output and employment above precrisis levels. Yet counteracting medium-term growth constraints and securing financial
stability will be important to further build on these achievements and support economic
wellbeing in Germany and elsewhere.
50.
The very success of the recovery has generated calls on Germany to play a more
prominent international role. Such a role would help assist global growth and reduce
imbalances. In both respects, the scope for policy initiatives to achieve short-term gains is
limited. Instead, a sustained effort will be required.
51.
Political viability of the longer-term measures requires common ground between
enhanced German economic well-being and contributions to the global good. German
growth fluctuations have largely been driven by external developments. Despite a more
prominent role for domestic demand in the past year, a durable rebalancing is needed. Better
growth prospects (through a stepped-up growth potential particularly in the non-tradable
sector) would generate a reinforcing combination of supply and demand responses. As the
productive potential increases, confidence in a better future will raise the economy’s notably
low investment rate and boost consumption growth. Such autonomous demand would create
more of an international locomotive role for Germany, while narrowing its current account
surplus by addressing these underlying structural factors.
52.
The robust recovery offers a propitious context for tackling long-standing
structural problems. The commitment to fiscal consolidation is strong, and the German
leadership in this area carries potential medium-term benefits for Europe. In other areas,
however, the political momentum for reform appears weak. Stepping up potential growth
would require important measures in areas such as tax policy and educational reform, which
while widely understood, need to move up in policy priority and implementation. In financial
sector policy, the new bank resolution framework is welcome, but in other long-standing
matters, German authorities have been generally reactive to European initiatives. The
political constraints to action will only increase if these challenges are confronted in a lowgrowth environment.
53.
The growth agenda must be multi-pronged but supported by specific measures
to be effective. The goal is to increase labor participation, deploy labor productively and
complement it with physical investment and innovation, especially in areas outside
Germany’s traditional strengths. Tax policy to raise labor participation and improve the
investment climate would need to be complemented by educational reform, enhanced
provision of risk capital and a more efficient insolvency process.

40
54.
The government’s fiscal consolidation path is appropriate but consolidation
must build room for responding to negative surprises and for fostering growth. With the
output gap closing, longer-term considerations require lowering the public debt-to-GDP ratio
to regain lost ground, enhance its fiscal credentials, and support the European Stability and
Growth Pact. A reassessment of the speed of consolidation may be needed if growth turns out
to be significantly weaker than expected. Moreover, space is required within the
consolidation envelope for initiatives to foster a growth agenda.
55.
The financial system is broadly stable but pockets of vulnerability remain.
Improved capital ratios at banks imply that they could absorb considerable stress.
Nevertheless, German banks remain highly leveraged, achieve low profitability, and the large
banks remain highly dependent on market funding. These vulnerabilities apply with
particular force to certain financial institutions, most prominently some Landesbanken. The
delays in data publication and the lack of transparency in crucial areas are troubling.
Moreover, while the overall level of direct exposure to the European periphery is limited,
some banks are more exposed than others, and indirect effects through banks outside of
Germany could have cascading effects.
56.

Forward-looking actions to limit systemic risk are required in four areas:



The legacy of the crisis requires continuing attention. The effort must be to carve out
viable segments of the distressed banks and return them to private hands. The
distressed assets should be sold at a deliberate pace, avoiding fire sales but
minimizing delays that could cause the assets to lose value.



Clarity on the regulatory and supervisory regime is overdue. To prevent risks
slipping through the cracks, early consideration is needed to clarify the content of
macro-prudential oversight likely to be designated to the Bundesbank, the
relationship between macro- and micro-prudential regulations, and the necessary
information sharing requirements.



For the various deposit insurance schemes, a move towards common, statutory payout
obligations across the pillars could be a first step to their eventual unification to
realize economies of scale. Unified statutory schemes would also allow for the
possibility of the use of their resources for early intervention and, hence, realize
synergies with the proposed restructuring fund.



A gradual shift of the Sparkassen to private ownership, while carving out their public
functions, is a tested process elsewhere in Europe and deserves serious consideration.

57.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Germany be held on the
standard 12-month cycle, in accordance with the Decision on Article IV Consultation Cycles
(Decision No. 14747-(10/96) (9/28/2010)).

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

Germany’s currency is the euro, which floats freely and independently against other
currencies.
Germany is an Article VIII member and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions. It maintains measures adopted
for security reasons, which have been notified to the Fund for approval in accordance with
the procedures of Decision 144 and does so solely for the preservation of national or
international security.
VIII.

Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)

An assessment under the international standard for AML/CFT was conducted by the Fund's
Legal Department in May 2009. The detailed assessment report was adopted by the joint
MENAFATF-FATF Plenary Meeting held in Abu Dhabi from February 17–19, 2010. The
report concluded that, despite Germany introducing a number of measures in recent years to
strengthen its AML/CFT regime, the AML/CFT framework is not fully in line with the
standard. There are weaknesses in the legal framework and in sanctioning for noncompliance with AML/CFT requirements. The recommendations to address these include:

amending the Criminal Code to: criminalize (i) ML in a way that covers all serious
predicate offenses, and (ii) TF in a way fully consistent with international standards;

amending the AML Act to: (i) improve preventive measures notably by imposing a
reporting obligation based on suspicion rather than knowledge and that relates to the
proceeds of criminal activity; and (ii) clearly establish that the FIU should carry out
more of the core functions of an FIU as contemplated by the FATF standard;

fully and effectively implementing the UN Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs)
on TF;

applying sanctioning powers more effectively for breaches of AML/CFT obligations;

strengthening the effective implementation of AML/CFT obligations imposed on
designated non-financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs); and

improving the collection of statistics and the provision of guidance and feedback to
FIs.
Germany has made a clear commitment to further strengthen the national system for the
prevention, detection and suppression of money laundering and terrorist financing.

ANNEX II. GERMANY: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. Germany has a full range of statistical
publications and subscribes to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). A
ROSC Data Module report was published in January 2006. The authorities make substantial
use of the Internet to facilitate on-line access to data and press information.
Germany adopted the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts 1995 (ESA95)
in 1999. The 2005 ROSC Data Module mission found that the macroeconomic statistics
generally follow internationally accepted standards and guidelines on concepts and
definitions, scope, classification and sectorization, and basis for recording. However, the
sources for estimating value added for a few categories of service industries could be
improved. A direct source for quarterly changes in inventories, which is an important
indicator of changes in GDP over the business cycle, is lacking. There is no systematic,
proactive process to monitor the ongoing representativeness of the samples of local units and
products between rebases of the producer price index.
Comprehensive data reporting systems support the accuracy and reliability of the government
finance and balance of payments statistics. However, although explanatory documentation
exists, differences between the general government data in the ESA95 classification and the
general government cash data on an administrative basis is impairing fiscal analysis;
Germany publishes—through Eurostat—general government revenue, expenditure, and
balance on an accrual basis on a quarterly basis (ESA95) and submits annual data for
publication in the Government Financial Statistics Yearbook, in GFSM 2001 format.
Monthly data are only disseminated on a cash-basis.
Germany has been participating in the financial soundness indicators (FSIs) project since its
inception. Annual data for most of the 40 FSIs are posted on the FSI website with effect from
2005 and quarterly data with effect from the fourth quarter of 2008. The last data available
relate to the third quarter of 2010, suggesting that timeliness needs some improvement.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Germany
On July 6, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Germany.1
Background
In the first quarter of 2011 German GDP surpassed its pre-crisis level following growth of
3½ percent in 2010, and employment is higher than before the crisis. Staff projects the
economy to expand by a healthy 3 percent in 2011, but growth is expected to slow as the fiscal
consolidation takes hold, the output gap closes, and world trade growth decelerates. While
Germany escaped the crisis with little permanent damage, its long-term growth prospects
remain low (about 1¼ percent annually).
Rising commodity prices will temporarily lift German headline inflation from 1.2 percent in 2010
to 2½ percent in 2011. Core inflation, however, is projected to rise only moderately. Germany’s
current account surplus, which rose to about 7½ percent of GDP just before the Great
Recession, has since receded to about 5 percent of GDP.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
The authorities injected a sizeable fiscal stimulus in 2009–2010 to counteract the economic
downturn. With the economic recovery, they are moving towards a gradual consolidation. The
pace of the recovery and the consolidation efforts imply that the objective of the European
Union’s Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), to bring the deficit below 3 percent of GDP, can be
achieved in 2011. The goal of the national fiscal rule, which targets a close-to-zero structural
fiscal balance at the Federal level by 2016, is also within reach. The increased primary surplus
will help bring down the debt-to-GDP ratio from its current level of over 83 percent of GDP
(having been boosted recently by banking sector support) to 73 percent of GDP by 2016.
The banking system’s return to broad stability reflects both the significant policy measures and
the economic recovery. The German authorities injected significant capital into banks and
provided the safety net of sovereign guarantees to access market financing during the crisis. In
2010 banks have raised their capital ratios and asset quality has also improved. However,
pockets of vulnerabilities remain. Banks continue to be highly leveraged and the quality of their
capital is low by international standards. Their profitability is also relatively low and expected to
remain so.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Germany’s impressive recovery buoyed by the strength of the
export sector and supportive policies, including a fiscal stimulus and targeted measures to
support the labor market and stabilize the financial sector. Directors underscored, however, the
importance of structural measures targeting labor, capital, and productivity to raise mediumterm potential growth and domestic demand, particularly in the non-tradable sector, which would
also support the role of Germany as an international locomotive and contribute to a reduction of
global imbalances.
Directors observed that a multi-pronged agenda that tackled long-standing structural issues
could raise potential output growth. The implementation of such an approach, whose goal would
be to boost labor participation, domestic investment, and productivity, would include tax,
education, and innovation policies, complemented by an enhanced provision of risk capital and
a more efficient insolvency process.
Directors noted that the government’s fiscal consolidation path, while appropriate, needs to
allow room for fostering growth. They observed that, with the output gap closing, lowering the
public debt-to-GDP ratio will enhance credibility and support the European SGP. Directors
noted, however, that a reassessment of the speed of consolidation may be needed if growth
turns out to be significantly weaker than expected. They also observed that the use of fiscal
instruments for stimulating growth should stay within the planned consolidation path.

3
Directors considered that the German financial system has stabilized, although pockets of
vulnerability remain. Improved capital ratios imply that the banks could absorb considerable
stress. Nonetheless, Directors noted that German banks remain highly leveraged, achieve low
profitability, and the large banks remain highly dependent on market funding. While the overall
level of direct exposure to spillover risks from elsewhere in Europe is limited, some banks are
more exposed than others and indirect effects through banks outside of Germany could have
cascading effects. Directors also encouraged a more timely publication of key financial data and
enhanced transparency of the regulatory and supervisory regime, the operations of public
sector banks, and the deposit insurance schemes.
Directors stressed that actions to limit systemic risk in the financial system are required in a
number of areas. First, the legacy of the crisis needs to be addressed, including establishing
viable business models for the Landesbanken. Second, the regulatory and supervisory regime
should be strengthened through clarification of the content of macro-prudential oversight, the
relationship between macro- and micro-prudential regulations, and the necessary information
sharing requirements. In this context, ensuring adequate and high-quality bank capitalization is
important, especially where systemic risk considerations arise. Third, harmonization of the
various deposit insurance schemes would allow for the possibility of the use of their resources
for early intervention and help realize synergies with the restructuring fund. Finally, the role of
the Sparkassen would need to be considered in the context of an integrated and competitive
European financial system.

Statement by Hubert Temmeyer, Executive Director for Germany
July 6, 2011
I thank the staff for well-balanced reports and convey my authorities’ appreciation of
an open and constructive exchange of views during the Article IV and FSAP missions.
My authorities broadly share the staff’s assessment of the current macroeconomic situation
and the prospects of the German economy for 2011 and 2012. Furthermore, the staff
convincingly outlines the future policy challenges for continued and sustainable economic
growth which largely coincide with my authorities’ policy agenda. The following comments
are meant to emphasize the main thrust of the latter and the more nuanced perspective my
authorities would like to add to the staff’s assessment in a few areas, in particular with regard
to Germany’s contribution to global growth. In this context, my authorities believe that
stability and sustainability considerations should be better acknowledged.
The FSAP findings underline the strengthening of financial sector stability in Germany.
The banking system has enhanced its resilience and capitalization, and solvency of insurers
remains adequate. At the same time, the staff rightly points to persisting risks for financial
stability. Going forward, further progress in strengthening the German financial system will
be achieved on the back of a strong economic recovery which has evolved into a broad-based
upturn.
Public finances
As is laid down in the staff paper, fiscal consolidation is clearly of overarching
importance to my authorities. In the past two decades, the level of public debt has seen two
major expansions each following extraordinary events – the German reunification and the
global financial crisis – and there is a clear commitment and understanding across the main
political parties and, importantly, the German public to significantly lower public debt at all
levels of the German federal state. This is a demanding process which has gained momentum
with the agreement on the inclusion of the widely and openly discussed “debt brake”
(Schuldenbremse) into the German constitution now being implemented starting with FY
2011. My authorities are well aware of the positive spill-over effects that strict budget
consolidation in Germany entails for the credibility of EU fiscal rules and budget
consolidation in Europe in general.
Germany’s international role
This year’s staff report has put special emphasis on Germany’s role in the world
economy. My authorities entirely share the staff’s analysis that Germany can best contribute
to global economic growth and financial stability by safeguarding internal stability through
sound public finances, a fiscal and economic framework conducive to growth, and a stable
and sound financial system.
Since Germany’s current account surplus has been subject to some international
attention, it is noteworthy that it saw a significant reduction since 2008. This trend might
continue as projected in the staff report and the recent WEO update. The development of

2
Germany’s external account is largely explained by a multitude of private business decisions
in Germany and abroad and is not the result of targeted policy measures. In fact, attempts to
single out certain areas for policy action may even turn out to be counterproductive with
regard to the actual outcome. For instance, I fully agree with the staff that raising wages in
Germany as a means to reduce German competitiveness would neither be an analytically nor
a pragmatically sound approach. Even the staff’s suggestions for policy measures aimed at
raising domestic investment, with which I broadly agree, might turn out to be ambivalent
with regard to their impact on the external account. To be sure, increasing investment will
generate additional demand in the first round. However, a strengthening in Germany’s
potential output might also foster international competitiveness and increase exports which
then could hardly be considered as being an undesirable outcome.
The staff’s assessment of spillovers to and from Germany somewhat appears to play
down the country’s contribution to growth in other countries. In this regard, the
international debate tends to focus on Germany’s domestic demand and private consumption.
However, unlike some of its comparators, Germany has not experienced any major asset
bubble or rather skewed consumption-savings proportions of private households in recent
years. Private consumption in Germany proved to be very resilient during the global crisis
with a reduction of only 0.2 percent in 2009 against the background of subdued negative
wealth effects and household indebtedness. The staff’s analysis should be more sensitive to
such sustainability considerations and its positive effects. Furthermore, important automatic
stabilizers inherent to the German social and economic model and significant and targeted
labor market measures have stabilized household incomes. All this has helped to sustain
domestic demand throughout the global crisis to the benefit of the European and global
economy.
Since there are no major imbalances in the real economy and in view of very buoyant
labor market developments, domestic demand and private consumption are making
major contributions to growth in the current upswing. Indeed, the contribution to growth
from domestic demand was twice that from net exports in the first quarter of 2011.
Moreover, taking into account the size of its economy and its high degree of trade
integration, Germany’s relative contribution to sustainable growth may actually be much
larger than indicated by its “autonomous” impulses as calculated by staff. This holds not only
true for trade linkages, but also with regard to positive spill-over and second round effects
arising from German FDI not least in CEE countries. That said my authorities share the
staff’s view that domestic demand could be further strengthened through the implementation
of continued growth-enhancing structural reforms.
A fiscal and economic framework conducive to growth
The staff provides for a fair account of the German labor market by emphasizing the
declining structural unemployment rate following significant labor market reforms
earlier in the last decade while outlining that higher labor market participation should
be a policy priority. In this regard, my authorities will consider lowering personal income
tax rates as a transparent measure to narrowing the tax wedge, in particular for lower and
medium incomes, as soon as this can be achieved with due regard to fiscal consolidation

3
needs. Tax policy, however, is only one element amongst others and labor market
participation also crucially depends on the overall infrastructure, including the availability of
child care facilities. Important steps have already been taken in this regard, also with a view
to improving the educational system.
As regards corporate taxes, Germany has already implemented a comprehensive set of
measures over the past decade which significantly decreased the rates of those taxes
considered the most damaging for growth. This includes the lowering of personal income
tax rates and, as part of the comprehensive corporate tax reform in 2008 which resulted in
major tax cuts for the corporate sector, the lowering of the corporate income tax
(Körperschaftsteuer). My authorities agree in principle with the staff’s recommendation to
reform the financing of the municipal level by replacing the – locally set – trade tax with
other means of financing. However, a respective reform proposal did not find the majority
across municipalities. In a different vein, the staff’s views on the usefulness of introducing a
tax allowance for tax equity could not convince my authorities since evidence suggests a 25
percent decrease of corporate income tax revenues in the event of the introduction of such
measure. This would obviously be too costly and run counter to the overarching objective of
fiscal consolidation.
Furthermore, my authorities fully agree with the importance of further implementing
structural measures with a view to improve productivity growth, in particular in the
service sector. With regard to the stated productive gap in the German services sector, due
regard should be paid to the limitation in comparing measures of productivity across
countries which are often subject to specific classification and sometimes ad-hoc
assumptions which differ across countries.
Financial sector
FSAPs are an excellent tool to promote the soundness of the financial systems in
member countries and to contribute to improving supervisory practices around the
world. My authorities broadly agree with the staff’s thorough analysis of the German
financial sector and will use the recommendations to critically reflect on current structures
and practices and make adjustments to the existing framework where appropriate and
possible.
The assessment shows Germany’s generally high level of compliance with the
supervisory core principles. Most of the remaining deficiencies found in the banking sector
will be dealt with in preparations for and the implementation of Basel III/European Capital
Requirement Directive IV. With regard to the insurance sector and in the light of the
introduction of Solvency II in 2013, there is the need to continue to further enhance
supervisory capacity for being able to cope with the challenges ahead. This is particularly
true for the supervisory resources of the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht
(BaFin), especially for on-site supervision. The BaFin continues to strengthen its group-wide
supervision in the insurance and reinsurance sector.

4
Achieving continued financial stability requires a constant upgrading of the regulatory
and supervisory framework. To give only a few examples, the new bank restructuring law
significantly strengthens the crisis management framework in Germany. My authorities share
the staff’s recommendation with regard to strengthening macroprudential supervision; a 10point plan to reform the financial markets supervision structure envisages expanding the
Bundesbank's mandate in macroprudential supervision, and respective legislation is under
preparation.
The deposit insurance system in Germany will continue to be a credible and efficient
pillar of financial stability. As the structure of the deposit guarantee schemes is adapted to
fit the structure of the German banking system, unifying the schemes will not per se increase
the credibility and resilience in this area. It should be also kept in mind that neither
BCBS/IADI core principles nor the current EU Directive require a unified deposit guarantee
system. For the statutory deposit guarantee scheme a legally binding deposit guarantee of
EUR 100,000 as well as significant prefunding is in place. Any further reforms of the deposit
guarantee schemes regime, including harmonized funding requirements, will be in line with
the respective EU directive, which is currently under discussion.
Stress tests have significantly underpinned the assessment of financial stability. My
authorities share most of the conclusions of the stress testing results. In the process of
continuously enhancing this exercise, most of the Fund’s suggestions on improving the
Bundesbank stress tests have already been implemented. As assumptions for such stress tests
are always debatable, my authorities would like to put into perspective some of these
elements. Firstly, while the FSSA gives a rather pessimistic estimation of future profitability
of the cooperative sector (2 percent in 2015), in my authorities’ view such a decline in
profitability seems unlikely, considering that 2008, when the crisis hit and the term structure
was nearly flat, the return on equity (after tax) was 4 percent, in 2007 and 2009 above 5
percent for this sector. Secondly, the capital shortfall appears at least partly to be the result of
rising capital requirements of Basel III rather than of the stress scenarios. In addition, the
Fund’s estimate of core Tier 1 capital seems significantly lower by around 2 percentage
points than my authorities’ estimates.
Savings and cooperative banks in Germany have proven to be resilient during the
financial crisis and thereafter. Due to their retail orientation they benefit from a large share
of stable deposits and their domestic orientation was a stable factor during the financial
crisis. Regarding the admissibility of private capital for savings banks, one needs to take into
account that savings banks aim at public goods, in particular in delivering banking services to
a wide range of customers.
Existing weaknesses in the Landesbanken sector are being addressed. As a result of
ongoing consolidation efforts, progress has been made with respect to lowering risk-taking
and de-leveraging. However, profitability remains rather low and the capital structure has to
be adjusted to the upcoming Basel III regulation. While the Landesbanken need to adjust
their business model in some respects, it should be also kept in mind that they provide
important services as central institutions for the savings banks.
