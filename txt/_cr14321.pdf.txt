STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context: With successful landmark elections in September 2014, Fiji took a decisive
stride toward returning to democratic government for the first time since 2006. The
successful elections are expected to solidify the recent improvements in relationships
with traditional development partners, improve access to concessional development
finance, and boost confidence in the economy. In terms of economic policy, the
comfortable Parliamentary majority for the former interim Prime Minister’s party
(FijiFirst) is expected to support continued economic reform momentum.
Key issues and policy recommendations:


With the economy now growing above potential, near-term macroeconomic
management needs to be carefully calibrated. The accommodative monetary policy
in place since 2011 has stimulated economic activity. The Reserve Bank of Fiji should
now tighten policy in order to moderate credit growth and curb excess liquidity.



Fiscal policy has been prudent and well focused in recent years, but the expansionary
2014 budget was a major departure from these welcome trends. Reversion to the
prudent trend is strongly encouraged.



The authorities have accelerated economic reforms in recent years, for example in
the sugar sector and pension schemes, but the key policy challenges remain to raise
potential growth, reduce unemployment, improve financial inclusion, and increase
resilience to shocks. Following the elections, continued structural reform momentum
is needed to improve the business environment, address the infrastructure backlog,
and raise the absorptive capacity to take full advantage of a potential increase in
investments.

CONTEXT
1.
Persistent political turmoil, external shocks, and slow progress in structural reforms
have contributed to low growth over the past three decades. After experiencing robust growth
in the 1970s, economic growth in Fiji slowed to about 2 percent between 1980-2012. As in the case
of other Pacific island economies, growth in Fiji has also been constrained by high transportation
costs and the small size of its domestic economy. Fiji’s human development indicators are relatively
strong and Fiji has achieved broad coverage in provision of basic services, with declining overall
poverty levels even though progress in rural areas is lagging. Although Fiji has a more diversified
production structure than most Pacific island economies, the economy remains heavily dependent
on sugar and tourism.1
2.
With the successful elections in September 2014, Fiji took a decisive step toward a
return to democratic government, ending nearly eight years of military government since the
coup in 2006. The international community welcomed the successful elections.2 Voter participation
rate was high at 84 percent, and FijiFirst – the party of (former interim) Prime Minister Bainimarama –
received nearly 60 percent of the popular vote and thus secured about 2/3 majority in the
Parliament. With the return to democracy, relations with traditional development partners and
access to concessional finance will likely continue to improve (see Box 1). The confidence in the
economy will receive a boost as political uncertainty is reduced. In terms of the economic policy, the
new government is expected to continue the economic reform momentum established over the past
few years.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
3.
Progress towards elections had led to increased confidence in the economy. Growth in
2013 is estimated to have accelerated to 4.6 percent. The latest available consumption and
investment indicators suggest continued strength in 2014, with economic growth projected at 3.8
percent. Growth is projected to moderate towards 2.5 percent in 2015, in line with estimated
potential, as the growth rates in 2013-14 were temporarily boosted by a sharp rise in credit growth.
The one-off increase in disposable income from recent tax cuts would likely be used for debt service.
4.
Headline inflation remains subdued. Headline inflation is currently low (0.7 percent) as
imported commodity and food prices have remained stable. However, this low inflation includes a
one-off contribution of the introduction of free primary and secondary education. The authorities

1

Pacific island countries have become more exposed to the region’s business cycles. See Sheridan, Tumbarello, and
Wu (2012), “Global and Regional Spillovers to Pacific Island Countries”, IMF Working Paper 12/154.

The Multinational Observers Group found the elections credible and on track to broadly represent the will of the
Fijian voters. On the other hand, leaders of 6 other parties issued a joint statement disputing freeness and fairness of
the elections.

continue to maintain price controls on a large part of the CPI basket3—basic food items, hardware
and construction materials, pharmaceuticals, and petroleum products—that may cause the
measured CPI to understate the inflationary pressures. Looking ahead, inflation is expected to
remain within the Reserve Bank of Fiji’s (RBF) comfort range around 3 percent on continued benign
movements of food and commodities prices.
5.
Monetary policy rates remain near the zero-lower bound and lending growth is
accelerating. The RBF lowered its policy rate to 0.5 percent in October 2011 and monetary policy
has been on hold since then. The lower policy rate and persistent excess liquidity in the banking
system have slowly been transmitted to lower lending rates. In response to lower rates and
improved confidence, net domestic credit increased by 16.5 percent in the first half of 2014, driven
by loans to households, wholesale and retail, building and construction, hotel and restaurants, and
real estate sectors.
6.
The financial sector prudential indicators continue to show strength. The banking sector
has been dominated by foreign-owned commercial banks but two new entrants (one domestic) in
the past two years have increased competition. Overall, the banks remain highly liquid, with liquid
assets-to-total assets at 18 percent. Despite some pressures on margins reflecting increased
competition, the banks remain highly profitable with a return on equity of 25.6 percent. The capital
adequacy ratio stood at 13.7 percent at end-2013, above the minimum prudential requirement of 12
percent, and the NPL ratio declined to 2 percent.
7.
The fiscal deficit was smaller than expected in 2013, but the 2014 budget was
expansionary. The overall deficit for 2013 is estimated at 0.5 percent of GDP, well below the
budgeted level of 2.8 percent. Slower expenditure disbursement (including initial delays in road
projects due to the unexpected need for new equipment) as well as buoyant VAT collections
contributed to the lower deficit. As a result, the government debt-to-GDP ratio declined to 51
percent of GDP, down from 56 percent in 2010. In the 2014 budget, the authorities have provided
for a large increase in expenditures with the bulk of the increased spending financed from
privatization receipts. Under the national convention which treats privatization receipts as revenue,
the budget deficit is projected at 1.9 percent of GDP, however, under the Fund’s convention, the
budgeted deficit is much larger at 7.8 percent of GDP.4 Large parts of the planned privatization
financing will not materialize in 2014, and the authorities have developed and implemented
expenditure and revenue contingency plans aimed at containing the deficit. Based on developments
in the first half of 2014, the deficit financing target is on track to be met, as the authorities have
exercised significant expenditure restraint, combined with revenue over performance.

3

It is estimated that nearly half the CPI basket is under some form of price control. The Commerce Commission
adjusts the prices in response to international price developments (often with a few months lag). Lifting the price
controls would shorten the transmission of international prices to the CPI.

4

The national convention in Fiji relies on older Government Financial Statistics (GFS) standards and treats asset sales
as revenue, whereas the new GFS since 2001 treats asset sales as financing.

8.
International reserves have recently declined owing to strong import growth, but
remain above four months of imports. The goods export-to-GDP ratio has declined in recent
years, partly reflecting the real exchange rate appreciation since 2009, while the import-to-GDP ratio
has increased. At the same time, robust remittances and tourism spending have moderated the
current account deficit, which combined with sizeable foreign direct investment, have allowed the
buildup of an adequate level of foreign exchange reserves. Fiji’s merchandise trade deficit widened
in 2013 as imports grew by 20 percent (including aircraft purchase by Fiji Airways) while exports
contracted by 3 percent, partly reflecting disruptions in tourism due to the floods in the first quarter
and sluggish gold exports. Strong remittances (10 percent increase) and tourism spending (1
percent increase) provided offsetting inflows. Fiji’s net international investment position stood at
-81 percent of GDP in 2013, up from -78 percent in 2012, with the bulk of liabilities stemming from
foreign direct investment.
9.
There are both domestic and external risks to the outlook (see RAM in Box 2). Downside
domestic risks are focused on a slowing of the reform momentum, including sustaining capital
investment. There is also a risk that the planned large-scale privatizations may not materialize,
jeopardizing the authorities’ medium-term debt and deficit targets without offsetting expenditure
and revenue measures. On the upside, smooth transition to reform-oriented democratic
government could result in stronger confidence in the economy, overheating, and upward pressure
on inflation. On the external risks, Australia and New Zealand, the two most important tourism
markets for Fiji, could be adversely affected by lower commodity demand from China and elsewhere.
Normalization of U.S. monetary policy could raise interest rates globally and result in higher bond
market volatility, at a time when Fiji’s sovereign bond matures in 2016. Moreover, increased
frequency of natural disasters, possibly related to climate change, and the susceptibility to
commodity price shocks call for stronger macroeconomic buffers.
10.
In the event that risks to the Fijian economy materialize, allowing the automatic
stabilizers to operate would be the first line of defense. If the downturn persists, there is scope
for limited fiscal stimulus. Monetary policy will be of limited effectiveness given that policy rates are
near the zero-lower bound and the transmission mechanism is weak. To limit the risk of having to
refinance Fiji’s sovereign bond in unfavorable market conditions, the authorities should maintain
sufficient balances in the sinking fund. On the upside, to take advantage of the benefits of increased
foreign direct investment after the successful democratic transition, it is urgent to accelerate the
implementation of structural reforms to alleviate supply side constraints and boost the absorptive
capacity in the economy so as to avoid bidding up asset prices and wages of skilled workers in short
supply.

Authorities’ Views
11.
The authorities broadly agreed with the macroeconomic outlook and risks. The authorities
view the strong pickup in growth reaching 4.6 percent in 2013 as broad based, driven both by
increased investment and consumption, and supported by accommodative macroeconomic policies.
Remittances have increased as a result of increased demand from the UN for Fiji peacekeepers,
supporting consumption. They view the 3.8 percent growth forecast in 2014 as conservative. Growth
6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF FIJI

will slow in 2015 as the effects of tax cuts and lending growth moderate. While inflation is currently
low, a rise in commodity prices, increase in wage demands and a growing economy may put upward
pressure on inflation. Sustaining investment levels at around 25 percent of GDP will be a
macroeconomic challenge. On the external front, the rapid increase in imports can put stress on the
balance of payments in the post-election environment.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
With the economy now growing above potential, near-term macroeconomic management needs to be
carefully calibrated. To lay the foundation for sustainable and inclusive post-election growth, the
structural reform momentum needs to be maintained.

A. Monetary and Financial Policies
12.
The accommodative monetary policy has stimulated economic activity over the past
two years. After a long lag, the low policy rate in place since 2011 has led to a reduction in nominal
lending rates, which combined with increased disposable income, competition in the banking sector
and rising confidence in the economy, have contributed to strong credit growth over the past two
years. Both the household and corporate sectors have now rapidly taken advantage of recent tax
cuts and growth in disposable income to increase leverage, contributing to the strong increase in
real estate prices and buoyant import growth. The economy is now estimated to be growing faster
than its potential of around 2½ percent. While inflation is currently low, the limited supply capacity
of the economy could lead to rapid price increases in some sectors in light of a growing output gap.
13.
The RBF should now tighten policy in a gradual and measured manner to moderate
credit growth. The RBF is carefully monitoring the rapid credit growth and has intensified its
surveillance through targeted onsite bank examinations. Despite intensified surveillance, credit
growth accelerated in the first half of 2014. While initially welcomed as a long-awaited departure
from stagnant credit growth, it has reached a stage where moderation is needed. Large parts of
loans carry variable rates, making borrowers subject to risk of interest rate hike. To moderate credit
growth, the RBF should enhance its supervision (including moral suasion) as a targeted first step.
Banks should conduct scenario analysis as to how a sizable increase in its variable lending rate
would affect its clients' financial viability, especially for real estate and personal lending. In this
context, more data on household and corporate leverage need to be collected. The RBF could also
consider targeted macro prudential measures in sectors where credit growth is deemed excessive,
such as stamp duties and higher risk weights. While macro prudential measures would address the
effects of excess liquidity, and to the extent that such measures alone may be insufficient to limit
credit growth, the RBF should mop up excess liquidity through open market operations and raising
the reserve requirement. The RBF should also consider gradually raising the policy rate as a
preemptive move to moderate demand pressure on the economy.
14.
The financial sector remains highly profitable. The banking sector is well capitalized and
most banks report low NPLs. Despite some pressure on interest margins reflecting increased

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

REPUBLIC OF FIJI

competition, the banks remain highly profitable and liquid. However, with the rapid rise in credit
growth and a likely moderation of the economy, along with a general increase in global interest rate
levels, there is a risk that non-performing loans could increase in the period ahead. It is imperative
that banks address such risk through stress testing and scenario analysis, an area where further
progress is needed to complement the authorities' good progress on the 2006 FSAP
recommendations (see Annex 3).
15.
The Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF) continues to play a key role in the financial
sector and the economy more broadly. Recent reforms have commendably strengthened the
actuarial soundness of the Fund. The reforms have also improved the board governance of the Fund
through the "fit and proper” criteria. The FNPF has taken equity stakes in a wide range of sectors,
and it is also a potential bidder in sales of government assets. In this context, it is important that
FNPF not be pressured to accept below-market returns on such investments in order to provide
funding for budget spending. Against this background, the continued focus on governance and
commercial criteria in the FNPF investment decision-making process is of paramount importance,
especially given FNPF’s past record of poor investment decisions and governance issues.

Authorities’ Views
16.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s outlook on the monetary and financial sectors. The RBF
has maintained an accommodative monetary policy stance since 2011, resulting in high system
liquidity and record low interest rates. Furthermore, tax rates have been reduced, resulting in higher
disposable income, which has fuelled credit growth in the banking sector. Liquidity in the system has
recently been reduced through the decline in foreign reserves and the RBF has communicated a
monetary tightening bias, including raising the policy rate to stem rapid credit growth. The RBF is
closely monitoring credit growth and has stepped up supervision with onsite examinations.

B. Fiscal policy
17.
Fiscal policy has been prudent and well focused in recent years, but the expansionary
2014 budget is a departure from these trends. The overall deficit in the 2014 budget is estimated
at 7.8 percent of GDP, of which about 6 percentage points are expected to be financed from the
proceeds of privatization and the remaining 1.9 percent from debt financing. The Budget continues
the focus on improving infrastructure and expands health and education spending. On the other
hand, it also increases civil service wages significantly, albeit after several years of wage freezes.
More importantly, the budget relies heavily on prospects of large-scale government asset sales to
finance the expansion in recurrent expenditures, risking funding shortfall possibly in the current year
and in the years ahead.
18.
Given the likely large shortfall in privatization receipts, the authorities are striving to
meet the 2014 financing gap by proactively developing contingency plans. The planned largescale privatization sales seem unlikely to be realized in 2014, judging from the progress made so far
in the complex and long process of privatizing state-owned companies and properties. The current
strong consumption and import growth are likely to increase tax and duties revenue above the

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF FIJI

planned level, and partially offset the asset sale shortfall. The ambitious capital spending budget
may encounter capacity constraints, resulting in under spending. Nevertheless, keeping the debt
financing of the 2014 budget to below 1.9 percent will require broad-based and deep expenditure
restraint, including on the budgeted 20 percent increase in the civil service wage bill. To the extent
that deficit targets are threatened, the authorities should continue to rein in expenditure, including
delaying filling civil service vacancies. From a cyclical point of view, fiscal restraint in 2014 would be
helpful in limiting overheating concerns, including pressure on reserves due to strong import growth,
in the context of above potential growth.
19.
The challenge intensifies as the authorities prepare the 2015 budget. While the increase
in recurrent expenditure in the 2014 budget elevates baseline expenditures in 2015, the temporary
revenue boost from above-potential growth in 2014 is likely to dissipate in 2015. Against this
backdrop, it will be challenging for the 2015 budget to meet the authorities’ medium-term deficit
plan which envisages a further reduction in the deficit to 1.5 percent of GDP for the year.
20.
In view of elevated expenditure levels and dissipation of the temporary revenue boost,
it is unlikely that the authorities’ deficit and debt targets can be met without increases in
current revenues. Base-broadening measures should be the first in line, as the abundant use of
income-tax holidays and tax incentives have narrowed the direct tax revenue base and added
complexity to the tax system. As the general environment for investment and political stability
improve, the need for these ad hoc tax incentives diminish. Using the broad mandate for continued
economic reform, the authorities should proceed to curtail these ad hoc tax subsidies significantly,
and only well-targeted and temporary incentives should be provided after rigorous cost-benefit
analysis. Likewise, ad hoc fees, administrative charges and fines, as well as irregular treatment of
deductibles, have worsened the business environment, and should also be drastically curtailed.
21.
Fiscal policy should continue to balance the need to strengthen the fiscal position
against the need for public investment spending. To address severe infrastructure backlogs,
which constrains the economy's supply capacity and affects public safety, capital spending has
increased in recent budgets. This has alleviated some of the most urgent needs. However, the
infrastructure improvement needs for the next ten years remain significant and requires continued
focus on improving infrastructure in the budget, including maintenance. The authorities are
encouraged to coordinate development projects closely with donors including the World Bank and
the Asian Development Bank.

22.
Public debt has declined since 2010 and is broadly sustainable. The debt sustainability
analysis indicates that public debt is sustainable, but points to some caution on external financing.
Fiji’s external debt remains low from a regional perspective, but it has increased sharply recently,
largely reflecting the US$250 million sovereign bond issued in 2011, and increased reliance on
bilateral loans from nontraditional sources for infrastructure financing. State-owned enterprise (SOE)
reform is progressing well and the authorities continue to pursue divestment and corporatization of
the SOEs. On a consolidated basis, SOEs produced a net profit. Among the larger, the Fiji Sugar
Corporation and Fiji Electricity Authority were profitable in 2013, while other SOEs such as the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

REPUBLIC OF FIJI

Housing Authority still require subsidies. Contingent liabilities have also declined in recent years
through the SOE and FNPF reform.
23.
Debt management strategies should be geared to preserving policy options. The USdollar denominated sovereign bond issued in 2011 matures in early 2016. To maintain policy buffers
and reduce the risk of being forced to roll over the bond in a volatile international financial market,
debt management needs to be prudent, including maintaining sufficient balances in the sinking
fund to retire the bond if necessary. With the planned re-engagement of traditional development
partners following the recent elections, the authorities are urged to consider the use of concessional
financing to lower the cost of funding.

Authorities’ Views
24.
The authorities are confident that the debt financing gap of the 2014 budget deficit will not
be breached, similar to the recent past where the actual deficit outcomes have been lower than
budgeted. On the revenue side, the authorities agreed that the recent revenue performance may not
be sustained, particularly on the VAT side. The authorities view some tax incentives as necessary to
continue to attract foreign investment, but they intend to review the tax incentive regime in due
course. On debt management, the authorities remain committed to preserve policy options.

C. Exchange Rate Policy and External Balance
25.
International reserves coverage has recently declined owing to strong import growth
and sluggish exports. Fiji’s narrow export base and susceptibility to shocks would suggest the need
for a relatively higher reserves target in the range of 4 to 5 months of retained imports. Under
current projections, the reserves level would be in the lower end of the range at end-2014.
26.
The competitive boost from the April 2009 devaluation has been largely eroded by
creeping real exchange rate appreciation, driven by partner-country inflation differentials.
The Fund’s standard exchange rate assessment approaches indicate that the real exchange rate
remains moderately higher (in the range of 2-14 percent) than the level consistent with mediumterm macroeconomic fundamentals (see Box 3), although the estimates are subject to considerable
uncertainty.
27.
A more flexible exchange rate would help absorb shocks and protect the reserve
position. Although the level of international reserves is currently adequate, a more flexible
exchange rate, through periodic reviews and adjustments as needed, would help prevent creeping
overvaluation and avoid the disruptive large devaluations experienced in the past and safeguard
balance of payments sustainability. The current environment provides a good opportunity to lay the
foundation for a more flexible exchange rate, including by considering a crawling peg system which
can ensure that the exchange rate remains fair valued over the medium term.
28.
Exchange restrictions arising from the tax certification requirements and from the
limits on large payments should be made compatible with the IMF’s Article VIII. A number of

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF FIJI

exchange restrictions are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a). These exchange
restrictions arise from tax certification requirements on the transfer abroad of profits and dividends
and on the proceeds of airline ticket sales, and on the making of external debt and maintenance
payments, and from limits on large payments. These exchange restrictions should be made
compatible with requirements under Article VIII. While the restrictions arising from the tax
certification requirements are designed to promote tax compliance, exchange restrictions are not
the appropriate means to this end as they weaken the business climate and dampen foreign
investment. In addition, to promote the integrity of the financial sector, and in advance of the
upcoming AML/CFT assessment scheduled for next year, the authorities are urged to further
strengthen the AML/CFT regime.

Authorities’ Views
29.
The authorities view the current level of the exchange rate as generally in line with economic
fundamentals. The authorities agreed that more exchange rate flexibility is desirable in the mediumterm, but the timing of this will depend on alignment with the appropriate monetary and fiscal
policy framework as well as when macroeconomic circumstances warrant such a move. They also
highlighted the role of different currencies in the Fijian currency basket, and the challenges in
making assessments of competitiveness when basket currencies move in different directions. On
exchange restrictions, the authorities remain committed to working with staff to make the
restrictions more compatible with the Fund’s Article VIII.

D. Structural Reforms
30.
The structural reform agenda has advanced well over the past four years, but
continued reform momentum is needed to support increased investment. Structural reform
priorities include relaxation of price controls, increased efficiency of land use, an improved
consultative process, predictability and streamlining of government regulation and implementation,
continued focus on infrastructure upgrades, and better aligned incentives for expanding electricity
production and transmission. Continued reform momentum would reduce the economy’s supply
bottlenecks and enhance the ability of the economy to utilize productively the increase in private
sector investment necessary to raise potential growth without fueling price increases.
31.
Price controls should be scaled back significantly. There may be a case for regulating a
few basic commodities for the benefit of the poor, given that oligopolistic behavior is not
uncommon in small economies and it is difficult to prosecute anti-competitive practices. However,
the current micromanagement of price controls could distort price signals, create uncertainty, is
costly to administer and comply with, gives vendors incentives to reduce product quality and/or
supply, and reduces incentives for investment. With inflationary pressures currently low, the price
controls should be scaled back significantly to enhance competition, transparency, cost-efficiency,
and predictability.
32.
Continued progress on sector-specific reforms in energy, land use and sugarcane
industry is needed to improve the investment climate and broaden the export base.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

REPUBLIC OF FIJI

•

Energy. A reliable energy supply is essential to meet the increasing demands of the
economy and crucial to improve the investment environment. In this context, a national
energy policy that provides clear incentives for energy producers to significantly increase
supply, especially in renewable energy sources like solar, is needed.

•

Efficiency of land utilization. Increased efficiency in utilization of land is also a key factor in
facilitating investment. The establishment of the Land Bank is welcome, but further progress
is needed to provide a predictable and stable supply of land for long-term investment. The
limited supply of land for housing development is also a factor in the recent rapid increases
in real estate prices.

•

Sugarcane sector. The government has made good plans for reforming the sugar-cane
sector, and its output has bottomed out in 2012. However, the issue of unreliable land
leases, aging workers, lack of larger-scale mechanization, and obsolete and poorly
maintained facilities are structural challenges that need to be addressed. With EU
preferential purchase agreements expiring, it is imperative to continue reform efforts to
ensure the industry remains competitive over the medium term. Reform in this sector also
has a large implication in national energy supply through co-generation and ethanol
production.

Given that the availability of energy and land are important determinants of the investment climate,
it is imperative to accelerate reforms in these sectors so that the potential increased investment in
the broader private sector can be encouraged.
33.
Continued improvements in data quality and coverage are urgently needed for
informed policy making. The Fiji Bureau of Statistics (FBOS) has received additional resources to
improve the quality and timeliness of statistics, including the technical assistance from the Fund.
Continued efforts are needed to increase data coverage and quality, particularly in the areas of
balance of payments, national accounts, including GDP by expenditure, unemployment, and
household and corporate debt, through strengthening the capacity of FBOS. Increased cooperation
and information sharing between government entities are needed to improve the quality and
coverage of the statistics, for instance through a stakeholder steering committee.
34.
The structural reform momentum needs to be maintained to unlock Fiji’s potential.
While significant reform has been put in train over the past three years – e.g. sugarcane sector, civil
service, land utilization, pension system, infrastructure improvements – a slowing down in the reform
momentum now will likely cause potential growth to stall at around 2-3 percent. The recent focus
on improving infrastructure is appropriate and will likely lead to higher potential growth over the
medium term. Both domestic and foreign investments are expected to pick up significantly as
political uncertainty is reduced. However, the economy urgently needs to boost investor confidence
and expand its capacity to accommodate increased private sector investment to foster inclusive
growth and reduce unemployment. Under a successful reform scenario, with an improved

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF FIJI

investment climate stimulating both domestic and foreign investment without triggering absorptive
constraints, potential growth can be raised to about 4-5 percent.5

Authorities’ Views
35.
The authorities broadly agreed on the structural reform agenda and the urgency to maintain
the reform momentum. They point to significant progress on the structural reform agenda, including
infrastructure improvements, pension reform, and improving the efficiency of land use, over the past
few years. The authorities acknowledge the need to scale back price controls, but view some
controls as essential to protect the poor given the lack of competition in some of the geographically
dispersed markets of Fiji. The authorities acknowledge the need to improve the business climate
including improving the efficiency of government bureaucracy. The authorities also recognize the
need for continued improvement in the quality and timeliness of statistics in the areas of national
accounts, unemployment and the balance of payments, among others.

STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
The return to a democratically-elected government will further boost confidence but
continued structural reform momentum is needed to unlock Fiji’s potential. The authorities
need to continue to improve the investment climate and absorptive capacity to take full advantage
of potential increases in investments following the elections. In this context, structural reform
priorities include relaxation of price controls, increased efficiency of land use, an improved
consultative process, predictability and streamlining of government regulation and implementation,
continued focus on infrastructure upgrades, and better aligned incentives for expanding electricity
production and transmission.
37.
With the economy now growing above potential, near-term macroeconomic
management needs to be carefully calibrated. The accommodative monetary policy has
stimulated economic activity over the past two years. The RBF should now adopt a tightening bias to
moderate credit growth. In particular, the RBF should enhance its supervision and conduct stress
testing of banks. To the extent that targeted measures are insufficient to limit credit growth, the RBF
should tighten monetary conditions through open market operations and raising the reserve
requirement. The RBF should also consider raising the policy rate as a preemptive move to moderate
demand pressure on the economy.
38.
Fiscal policy has been prudent in recent years, but the 2014 budget is a departure from
this trend. As privatization receipts are likely to fall short of the 2014 budget targets, the authorities
have commendably adopted contingency plans, including strong expenditure restraint, to contain
the deficit. Fiscal restraint in 2014 would also be helpful in limiting overheating concerns in light of
the positive output gap. More broadly, expansion of recurrent expenditure should not be financed

with one-off asset sales, risking funding shortfall also during the years ahead. To meet the
authorities’ medium-term deficit and debt targets, base-broadening revenue measures are needed,
significantly curtailing income-tax holidays and tax incentives that have narrowed the direct tax base
and added complexity to the tax system, in the context of general improvement in the investment
climate. Only well-targeted and temporary incentives should be provided after rigorous cost-benefit
analysis.
39.
The current environment provides a good opportunity to lay the foundation for a
more flexible exchange rate. A more flexible exchange rate would help absorb shocks and protect
the reserve position. Although the level of international reserves is currently adequate, a more
flexible exchange rate, through periodic reviews and adjustments as needed, would help prevent
creeping overvaluation and avoid the disruptive large devaluations experienced in the past and
safeguard balance of payments sustainability.
40.
Improved data quality is urgently needed for informed policy making. With the help of
technical assistance, the authorities have accelerated efforts to increase data coverage and quality,
particularly in the areas of balance of payments and national accounts, including GDP by
expenditure. The capacity of the FBOS should continue to be strengthened, supported by technical
assistance from development partners. Increased statistics provision to the public is also
encouraged. Government ministries and agencies are encouraged to make data more expeditiously
available for FBOS.
41.
A number of exchange restrictions are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII.
Restrictions arise from tax certification requirements on the transfer abroad of profits and dividends,
and on the proceeds of airline ticket sales, and on the making of external debt and maintenance
payments, and from direct limits on large payments. These should be made compatible with
requirement under Article VIII. The authorities are urged to further strengthen the AML/CFT regime.

Box 1. Fiji: Re-engagement of Traditional Development Partners
The political situation following the coup in 2006 limited Fiji’s access to concessional financing from
traditional development partners such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the World Bank, and
Australia. In view of the limited concessional financing from traditional development partners, the
authorities have developed ties with the EXIM Banks of China and Malaysia, primarily to finance
infrastructure projects, and these agencies have been the main source of external finance over the
past years. The traditional development partners are in the process of formulating their Fiji
assistance strategies and Fiji’s access to concessional finance is likely to improve following the
elections, to address key development priories:


ADB. The ADB engagement in Fiji has focused on promoting sustained economic growth
through direct investments in economic infrastructure (transport, water and sanitation and
energy), and improved public sector management. The draft country partnership strategy
for 2014–2018 positions ADB to re-engage quickly with a financing envelope up to US$350
million to help Fiji overcome its key development challenges: raise Fiji’s growth potential by
encouraging private investment, make growth more inclusive and improve service delivery,
and reduce volatility and build resilience.



World Bank. The World Bank is currently preparing its country strategy for Fiji, for
consideration by end-2014. Program sector focus and allocations remain to be determined,
but are likely to include early significant investment in road infrastructure.



Australia. Australia and Fiji have long-standing trade and investment links. Australia is Fiji’s
largest bilateral aid donor, source of tourism demand, and foreign direct investment. In late
2013, the Australian government announced a new policy of enhanced engagement with Fiji
centered on increased cooperation in political and economic relations and both countries
expanded high-level contact in 2014. In 2014-15, Australia will invest in strengthening
human development in Fiji by improving education, health and community development.
Australian aid will support effective governance and enhance Australia’s engagement with
Fiji’s public sector.

Continued political uncertainty delays investment and development

Slow progress in structural reform, leading to low investment, lower
foreign exchange earnings from the sugar sector as EU preferential
purchase agreement expires. Policy response includes stronger
coordination efforts to improve the investment climate, modernize the
sugar sector.
Low
The large-scale privatization plans are complex and may not
materialize, which could jeopardize the authorities’ medium-term debt
and deficit targets. Policy response includes developing contingency
plans with expenditure and revenue measures to ensure fiscal targets
are met.
Medium
Large capital inflows should stimulate medium-term growth but the
positive impact may be partially offset by short-term appreciation
pressures and absorptive capacity constraints. Policy response
includes accelerated structural reform to improve absorptive capacity
and productivity. Fiscal restraint would also contribute to limiting
overheating concerns.

Medium
Australia and New Zealand are the largest tourism source countries for
Fiji. A slowdown in China and elsewhere could affect commodity
exporting economies such as Australia and New Zealand through
lower commodity prices, exchange rate depreciation, and this could
trigger a decline in tourism in Fiji.
Allowing automatic stabilizers would be the first line of defense. If the
slump persists, limited fiscal stimulus could be envisioned. If the
reserve target is threatened, a more flexible exchange rate could be
appropriate.
Low
Prospects of less accommodative monetary policy in advanced
economies could trigger a sustained reversal of capital flows and repricing of risk across emerging markets, and an intensification of
liquidity strains. Portfolio flows to Fiji have been limited and the
impact of reversal of such flows minor. However, Fiji's bond repayment
in 2016 in conjunction with protracted external volatility may result in
possibly unfavorable conditions for refinancing. Policy response
includes building macroeconomic policy buffers, including debt
management strategies to preserve refinancing options.

Box 3. Fiji: Exchange Rate Assessment
Staff estimates that the Fiji dollar is moderately stronger than the value consistent with mediumterm fundamentals. Three complementary approaches are used to assess the degree of Fiji’s real
exchange rate (REER) alignment:
i) Macroeconomic balance: The current account deficit “norm” is estimated at -5.3 percent of GDP,
while the “underlying” current account deficit is estimated at -9.3 percent of GDP.1 The difference
between the norm and the underlying current account suggests that the REER is about 12 percent
stronger than consistent with medium-term fundamentals.
ii) Equilibrium exchange rate approach: A comparison of the current value of the REER and an
estimate of its medium-term equilibrium value indicates that the REER is about 2 percent higher
than the equilibrium value.
iii) External sustainability: Assuming a negative NFA of 75 percent of GDP, Fiji’s current account
norm is estimated at -4.4 percent of GDP. Taken together with the underlying current account deficit
of 9.3 percent of GDP, this suggests the REER is about 14 percent stronger than the level implied by
medium-term fundamentals.

Appendix III. FSAP Recommendations and Implementation
Recommendation
Bank Supervision

Enhance supervision while
economizing
on
RBF’s
resources. Make greater use
of external and financial
institution internal auditors
to deal with targeted areas;

Fully introduce risk-based
supervision to ensure that
supervision is focused on the
areas and institutions of
greatest concern

Clarify the status of “credit
institutions” in law and
regulation.

Status of Implementation

The RBF has implemented the recommendation though the
following:
 The role of internal auditors (IA) is outlined in the RBF
Corporate Governance supervision policies (BSPS No. 11) for
banks and (ISPS No. 4) insurance companies. IA roles are also
captured under the Operational Risk policy for banks and
credit institutions (BSPS No. 16). These policies cover the
functions that are, as a minimum expected of IAs for licensed
institutions.


Specific supervision policies are also issued for the role of
external auditors (EA) in the supervision of banks and credit
institutions (BSPS No. 7). The policy provides an avenue that if
need be, the RBF can leverage off the EA’s expertise and
resources to examine specific areas of regulatory concern. This
policy is currently being reviewed, since it was initially issued in
2001.



Additionally, the RBF conducts on-site examinations whereby
discussion sessions are held with the internal audit function of
regulated institutions. Internal audit reports are reviewed and
on-site discussions provide an opportunity to the IA function
to frankly discuss its review processes and findings, the
responses received, key risk areas and concerns directly with
the RBF.



RBF has moved to risk-based supervision with all key
supervisory processes reviewed to be in line with risk-based
supervision objectives. The changes made are now being
documented in a ‘Risk Based Supervision’ manual to be
finalized by the end of 2014.



The move to risk-based supervision has allowed the
establishment of a clear link between off-site monitoring, onsite reviews, identification of systemic issues and the
establishment of a macroprudential supervision framework.



No further work has been undertaken on this as the RBF still
relies on the definitions provided under the Banking Act to
differentiate between a bank and a credit institution.



The RBF has however discussed internally the need to establish
some “tiering” of supervised institutions to determine intensity
of supervision activities, as part of its risk-based supervision
framework, and this will be undertaken in 2015.

Monetary policy framework and transparency
Strengthen liquidity
forecasting capacity to
improve forecasting of
foreign reserves and the net
position of the government;
and



There is continuous improvement to fine tune the forecast of
foreign reserves. The RBF will continue to liaise closely with the
Ministry of Finance and relevant industry stakeholders to
improve the timeliness and quality of the data.

and the MOF.

 This has been considered in the review of the RBF Act but the proposed
amendments coming out of the review are yet to be approved.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF FIJI

Government securities market development
Establish joint group
between the FNPF, the MOF
and the RBF to share
information and agree on
the transitional pace of FNPF
diversification out of the
bond market and publicly
disclose broad parameters of
FNPF’s planned
diversification in order to
limit disruptions to the
government securities
market.

 No specific group or committee has been set up. However since then,
there has been a more measured and pragmatic view on the
diversification of the FNPF’s investments. A confluence of factors has
contributed to shaping this view: our recall of their foreign investment
due to wider national considerations, the exposed risk of “other
investments” (Momi, Natadola), and availability of domestic alternatives
that matched the FNPF’s liabilities and objectives.
 The RBF continues to liaise closely with the Ministry of Finance as
bankers to Government on their funding needs. Should there be a need
to rope in the FNPF as the largest player in the market to avoid
disruptions to the Government’s securities market this has been done
and will continue.

Fiji National Provident Fund
Implement a clear separation
of accounts by area of
activity and place the annuity
business
on
a
sound
actuarial basis; and

 The Provident Fund is nearing the completion of a 3-year reform
programme aimed at strongly establishing its operations and
sustainability. The coming into effect of the FNPF Decree 2011 (replacing
the FNPF Act) provided the legal framework for significant changes to
the structure of the Provident Fund’s pension/annuity business
(Retirement Income Fund (RIF)) and its accumulation fund (the FNPF). As
part of the reform, the FNPF has introduced actuarially valued and age
based pension rates from March 1 2012.
 The separation of accounts by activity is being initiated with the
Provident Fund now having the RIF and FNPF as two separate funds with
their own assets and liabilities. Both funds are required to meet specific
solvency requirements and be actuarially evaluated on an annual basis.
 The Provident Fund will now have to work on the reporting obligations
of the two funds in its annual financial statements.

Prudent investment
principles, including
appropriate levels of
international diversification
for all providers of
retirement savings, need to
be adopted. The foreign
assets of the FNPF and other
providers of retirement
savings should not be
subject to recall. Gradual
implementation of these
principles is necessary to
ensure consistency with
macroeconomic stability.

 Prudent investment principles are now incorporated in the FNPF Decree
2011 (a revision of the FNPF Act). With capital controls still an important
feature of the RBF’s monetary policy framework due to the objective of
ensuring the maintenance of an adequate level of foreign reserves, the
recall requirement is still a condition stipulated for off-shore investments
of the FNPF.
 The RBF however is fully aware of the consequences on such a recall on
FNPF investments and considers this as the very last option.

Appendix IV. Main Recommendations of the 2013 Article IV
Consultation
Main Staff Recommendation

Policy Actions

Structural reform:
Staff welcomed the progress in structural
reforms and identified raising potential growth,
reducing vulnerability to shocks, and further
reducing poverty as the key policy challenges.

Since the last Article IV Executive Board
discussion in November 2013, the authorities
have made progress on the structural reform
agenda by continuing the focus on improving
infrastructure, land use efficiency, improving the
provision of statistics and reform of state
enterprises.

Macroeconomic policies:
Staff viewed the macroeconomic policies as
broadly appropriate. Staff recommended close
monitoring of the pickup in credit growth, and
welcomed progress on financial inclusion. Staff
urged structural reform to broaden the revenue
base, continued restraint on operating
expenditure to create space for capital
investment.

The RBF is carefully monitoring the rapid credit
growth and has intensified its surveillance
through targeted onsite bank examinations. The
RBF is leading efforts to increase financial
inclusion. Through the National Banking Task
Force, the targets for increased financial
inclusion set in 2010 have been met. Over the
past year, agricultural lending has increased. The
authorities have maintained their focus on
improving infrastructure.

Exchange Rate Arrangements
Fiji’s de facto exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. Since April 1975, the exchange rate
of the Fiji dollar has been linked to a basket of currencies of Fiji’s five major trading partners: the
U.S., Australian, and New Zealand dollars; the pound sterling (replaced by the Euro at the beginning
of 1999); and the Japanese yen. The weights used in the basket, based mainly on the value of trade
and tourist transactions are reviewed annually. The exchange rate of the Fiji dollar against
U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is determined daily by the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) in relation
to the currency basket. The RBF’s buying and selling rates for transactions in U.S. dollars are
communicated to commercial banks. On April 15, 2009, the Fiji dollar was devalued by 20 percent
against the basket. The exchange rate was F$1.9054 per U.S. dollar as of September 22, 2014.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF FIJI

Exchange and capital controls were tightened significantly in early 2009 following the devaluation of
the currency. Some of the exchange restrictions have been eliminated and amended since then.
Remaining exchange restrictions subject to Article VIII arise from the Fiji Revenue and Customs
Authority tax certification requirements on the transfer abroad of profits and dividends, on the
proceeds of airline ticket sales, and on the making of external debt and maintenance payments and
from limits on large payments (e.g., oil imports and dividends repatriation of foreign banks).
Approval of most current payments was delegated to commercial banks and foreign exchange dealers
in the late 1990s. However, the extent of delegation was tightened during periods of stress on foreign
exchange reserves, most recently in April 2009. In December 2009, the RBF announced an increase in
the delegated ceilings for commercial banks and foreign exchange dealers for most current payments,
effective January 1, 2010, and further increases in delegated limits were announced to come into effect
in January 2014. Banks have also been allowed to have net forward contracts of up to F$40 million, and
the delegated limit on dividends and profits for companies per annum was raised from F$500,000 to
F$1,000,000.
Last Article IV Consultation
The 2013 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Suva during August 1–15, 2013. The
consultation (Country Report No. 13/370) was completed by the Executive Board on November 4,
2013. Fiji is on a 12-month cycle with the concurrence of the authorities.
Safeguards Assessment
The first-time safeguards assessment of the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) was finalized in January 2011
and found key safeguards elements in place. The RBF publishes annual financial statements that are
both prepared and audited in accordance with internationally recognized standards. The assessment
confirmed, however, that the level of autonomy of the RBF is very low with the legislation
supporting a wide scope of political interference. Proposed amendments would address some but
not all of these weaknesses; alternative measures were recommended by the staff for others. An
action plan has been put in place where there is capacity to prepare IFRS financial statements and
commenced with the financial statements for the year ended 2010 during 2011.
Resident Representative
The Regional Resident Representative Office for Pacific Islands based in Suva, Fiji was opened on
September 13, 2010 and the office covers Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Palau, Papua
New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. Mr. Tubagus Feridhanusetyawan
is the resident representative.

close working relationship and have an ongoing dialogue on a range of macroeconomic and
structural issues.
Cooperation over the past year has included World Bank involvement in the July 2014 Article IV
mission to Fiji. The Bank’s participation facilitated discussions with the authorities in areas of mutual
interest such as social protection, civil service reform, and growth priorities.
Based on the above cooperation, the Bank and Fund teams continue to agree that Fiji's main
macroeconomic challenges are to safeguard fiscal and external stability, as well as address structural
obstacles that are impeding growth. The authorities have accelerated reforms in recent years, but
the key policy challenge remains to raise the potential growth, reduce unemployment and increase
resilience to shocks. The need for faster and deeper structural reform is urgent to boost investor
confidence, reduce the economy’s supply bottlenecks and raise the absorptive capacity in order to
take full advantage of a potential increase in foreign and domestic investments following the
elections in 2014. These obstacles are detailed in the main text of the report, but some of the
structural reforms seen by the Bank and the Fund as macro-critical include:


Increased efficiency of land use, which is critical for Fiji’s growth prospects and economic
diversification.



Price decontrol, to re-establish price signals and encourage investment.



Sugar-cane sector reform, to revitalize a key sector. The government has made good plans
for reforming the sugar-cane sector, including using the by-products of sugar production for
ethanol and electricity generation. However, the issue of unstable land lease, aging workers,
lack of larger-scale mechanization, and obsolete and poorly maintained facilities are longterm challenges. With EU preferential purchase agreements expiring, it is imperative to
continue the reform efforts to ensure the industry remains viable



Civil service reform. The authorities have made some progress with civil service reform.
Over the medium term, functional reviews are required to identify core service areas and
ensure that the structure of the public service remains appropriate.



Public enterprise reform. The pace of implementation of reforms of other public
enterprises aimed at improving services and reducing fiscal costs needs to be accelerated.
These reforms will help reduce the government’s direct and contingent liabilities, help
ensure fiscal sustainability, and promote growth.



Review of the social safety net. Fiji has recently achieved significant gains in protecting the
vulnerable through the strengthening of social safety nets. From this point, efforts should
continue to enhance the definition of eligibility criteria, improve targeting, and increase
coverage of vulnerable groups. A stronger safety net will help to ensure the success of Fiji’s
reform agenda.



Tax policy and administration reform. Efforts to broaden the tax base should continue,
including review of the tax incentive regime. Fiji continues to benefit greatly from TA in this
area provided by the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center (PFTAC) located in Suva.



Debt management. Debt management strategies should be geared toward careful
evaluation of and optimization between all policy options and building up buffers.



Strengthening statistical capacity and statistics. Fiji should ensure that it continues to
develop personnel with the capacity to produce accurate and timely economic statistics.
Good statistics are important both for macro policy formulation and good public financial
management (e.g. establishment payroll and wage bill control). Fiji continues to benefit from
a broad range of statistical advice from PFTAC.

The Bank and Fund teams agreed to continue close collaboration going forward. Appendix I details
those activities that the Bank and Fund will work on over the coming year.

(As of September 19, 2014)
Background
Fiji has been one of PFTAC’s largest users of TA in recent years. The PFM sector has recently
become the main area of focus, but significant contributions in Revenue Policy/Administration and
Macroeconomic Statistics also continue. In the PFM area, support has been focused on training for
budget analysts, building internal audit and accounting capacity, and assisting authorities to develop a
PFM Reform Roadmap. PFTAC has supported FRCA in a comprehensive modernization process
including the development of enhanced corporate planning, simplified income tax legislation and
streamlined personal income taxation policies and procedures. There has also been significant
progress made in the Statistics area with improved national accounts balance of payments and price
statistics. In macroeconomics the focus has been on building modeling skills, including for potential
natural resource revenues.
PFTAC TA aims to sustain the authorities’ progress on fiscal consolidation and enhance the
framework for macroeconomic policy making. In the fiscal area, revenue will continue to be the
main focus as the authorities are keen to improve revenue performance.
Strategy 2013-2015
PFTAC’s TA strategy is guided by the APD regional strategy note and is planned within the results
framework for the current PFTAC funding cycle.2
PFTAC TA aims to support the authorities sustain progress on fiscal consolidation and
enhance the framework for macroeconomic policy making. In the fiscal area the majority of
inputs will continue to be in the revenue area with support on PFM systems and fiscal forecasting.
Enhanced statistics will support strengthened modeling capacity in RBF and Ministry of Finance
which should ensure policy makers are better informed.
In the Public Financial Management area, the main focus will be assisting in strengthening
weaknesses identified in the 2012 PEFA assessment. With PFTAC support the Fiji MOF started a PFM
Reform Roadmap in April 2014 (RBM 1.2). Budget analyst training started in 2013 has continued
with a particular focus on changes to the process for reviewing line ministry requests for new

resources (RBM 1.6). Assistance has also been provided on implementation of international
accounting and reporting standards, including implementation of accrual accounting. Other areas
of specific follow-up assistance will be influenced by the PFM Roadmap currently being finalized.
These may be focused on review of the roles, responsibilities and structure of the Ministry of
Finance; strengthening accounting and financial reporting processes and systems; formal adoption
of IPSAS; transition to accrual accounting (perhaps drawing on IMF HQ expertise); and budget
execution (1.7). Assistance in cash and debt management may also be a focus (RBM 1.7), if resources
are available. PFTAC will coordinate closely with the ADB’s PEM TA project. PFTAC will coordinate
closely with the ADB’s PEM TA project.
In the revenue administration area Fiji continues to progress with its most recent achievement
being the implementation of the PAYE final withholding tax regime. PFTAC assistance for 2014/2015
will focus on: (1) implementation of strategic objectives identified in the new strategic plan designed
with PFTAC assistance; (2) facilitate the implementation of business systems and processes which are
based on modern risk management principles and assist in the implementation of a self assessment
regime; (3) assist in strengthening compliance improvement plans and strategies that are risk based
and utilize a mixture of service and enforcement approaches; and (4) review and recommend
improvements to core tax functions. PFTAC recently provided extensive assistance in the design of
the user requirements for a new IT system, for which a tender will be issued by end December, 2014.
In statistics, the focus of support will be further development of the national accounts. The ultimate
aim is to have preliminary quarterly national accounts estimates being produced with limited
circulation by June 2015 (4.4) and to start general publication by the end of December 2015. In
addition, supply and use tables for 2011 are planned for completion by April 2015 which will provide
important input into the planned December 2015 rebase of the constant price accounts. PFTAC will
also support the development of GDP estimates by expenditure and income with the expectation of
producing experimental estimates by the beginning of 2015 for publication in August 2015 (4.1) and
will continue to provide follow-up on price indices with support of both IMF HQ (4.8) and the
Australian Bureau of Statistics. IMF HQ will also provide support for enhancing balance of payment
statistics and government finance statistics.
In financial sector supervision, the PFTAC advisor will continue to be available for consultations
with RBF staff and will work on regional issues with the RBF’s head of bank supervision who is
executive director of AFSPC. PFTAC will stage a three day workshop on consolidated supervision of
conglomerates in September for 24 members of its banking supervision department. The RBF will
also participate in the mid year sub regional PFTAC workshop on Risk Based Banking Supervision to
be held in Samoa. The RBF further indicated an interest in receiving technical assistance during its
anticipated Credit Union’s legislative and oversight modernization program of that sector.
In the area of macroeconomic analysis, technical assistance will focus on building capacity in
macroeconomic modeling (5.1) and debt sustainability (5.3). Working with RBF staff to develop
macroeconomic models to capture unique features of the monetary policy transmission mechanism
will be a key area of analysis (5.1). On the fiscal side, the main project will entail assisting MOF staff
in incorporating debt dynamics into the medium-term fiscal planning framework (5.3).

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of September 23, 2014)
ADB engagement in Fiji since a coup in 2006 has been guided by the Fiji Islands: Reengagement
Approach.3
With elections in September 2014 meeting criteria for re-engagement, and with broad based
shareholder support, ADB intends submit a new country partnership strategy, drafted in consultation
with the Fiji government, to its Board of Executive Directors in December 2014.
Since 1970, ADB has provided $317 million in loans and $27 million in technical assistance (TA).
ADB’s support has focused primarily on transport (ports and roads); and water and sanitation.
Although there were limited new investments since 2006, ADB continued to implement ongoing
projects, finance emergency needs following natural disasters and maintained policy dialogue with
the government.
ADB’s support since the 2006 coup continued to be a relevant response to the country context and
government priorities and was aligned with ADB’s Strategy 2020. This was achieved by maintaining
sector selection and continuity in economic infrastructure (ports, roads and water and sanitation),
continued strong coordination and harmonization with other development partners, particularly in
terms of ongoing policy dialogue on public sector management, and appropriate allocation of
resources via supplementary financing for ongoing projects and emergency assistance.
In 2009, ADB approved $49.8 million in additional financing to complete road and water supply and
sewerage investment have been a focus of ADB’s engagement. Additional support was provided in
2009 ($17.6 million) and 2012 via two separate $1 million grants from the Asia-Pacific Disaster
Response Facility in response to devastating floods. These investments will be completed by the end
of 2014. ADB has also provided TA in 2012 to SOE reform, and in 2013 to develop a National 20 Year
Transport Strategy (inclusive of roads and maritime transport) and an Urban Water and Sanitation
Master Plan (as part of the overall National Water Resources and Sanitation Plan due for Cabinet
Approval in 2014). Fiji also continues to participate in ADB regional TA projects in areas such as
climate change, public sector management, information and communication technology and trade
facilitation.
Reflecting country challenges, ADB’s partnership for the medium term will be focused on three
interlinked priorities of: (i) raising Fiji’s longer-term growth potential; (ii) building resilience and
reducing vulnerability, and (iii) reducing poverty through more inclusive growth and better service
delivery. Fiji is eligible for assistance from ADB’s Ordinary Capital Resources (OCR). Up to $350
million in OCR resources is available during the 5 year period from 2014 to 2018. TA will also be

provided to develop sector plans, prepare investments, and build capacity for broader policy and
institutional reform. Lending operations are anticipated for a transport (roads, bridges, jetties and
wharves) project for $100 million (with possible co-financing by the World Bank), and an urban
water and sanitation investment of up to $100 million in 2015. These will be guided by current
technical assistance to prepare a 20 year national transport plan and an urban water and sanitation
master plan.
The ADB has recently supported the preparation of Fiji’s Green Growth framework and will continue
to contribute to Fiji’s development efforts.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Despite significant shortcomings in some areas, especially GDP and balance of
payments data, core economic and financial data provided to the Fund are broadly adequate for
surveillance. Macroeconomic data are in the process of improving, owing in part to the
considerable technical assistance provided by the Fund and PFTAC in recent years.
The Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) publishes the Annual Report, the Quarterly Review, and the
monthly Economic Review. The Fiji Bureau of Statistics (BoS) publishes a quarterly Current
Economic Statistics and a monthly Statistical News. The Ministry of Finance and National Planning
(MoF) issues the Budget Address and the Supplement to the Budget Address on an annual basis.
All of these publications are received by APD on a regular basis.
Formal participation in the GDDS commenced on May 9, 2000, marked by the posting of the
metadata on the IMF’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. The metadata were last updated
in November 2002.
National Accounts: Production-side estimates of GDP at current and constant prices are
available up to 2011. Revised data were published in April 2013 using the 2002 Household
Income and Expenditure Survey, a new business census, and estimates of the informal sector.
Expenditure-side GDP data in constant prices are not available and expenditure-side GDP data in
current prices are only available through 2005. The authorities are currently refining the
methodology for estimating GDP from the expenditure side. In addition, GDP broken down by
income is only available through 2005.
Price statistics: CPI data are published monthly, with data available up to August 2013. The BoS
is currently updating the CPI weights from the current 2008 base using results of the 2008/09
Household Expenditure and Income survey.
Government finance statistics: While Fiji has provided metadata for central government
operations and central government debt, the metadata were last updated in 2005. Fiji last
reported data for publication in the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) in
2006. The authorities have participated in the regional GFS capacity building project funding by
the Government of Japan, sending participants to regional training in 2012 and 2013 and
receiving a TA mission in January 2013. Data for budgetary central government has been
compiled and advances have been made in collecting the source data required to expand
coverage to general government. The authorities are encouraged to review and update the
GDDS fiscal metadata and resume reporting data for publication in the GFSY and commence
reporting in the International Financial Statistics.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF FIJI

Monetary and financial statistics: Data on the central bank, other depository corporations
(ODCs), and other financial corporations (OFCs) are comprehensive and provided to APD and
STA on a regular and timely basis. Progress has been achieved by the RBF in most areas of the
collection, compilation, and dissemination of monetary and financial statistics (MFS), leading to
the introduction of the standardized reporting forms for the central bank, ODCs, and OFCs. This
resulted in the publication of data aligned to the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual
(MFSM) in the RBF’s website and International Financial Statistics. The full implementation of the
November 2005 workshop and January 2008, July 2011, and April 2012 missions’
recommendations will constitute a very important step towards the compilation in a timely and
efficient manner, of monetary statistics fully consistent with the MFSM and Monetary and
Financial Statistics Compilation Guide. Efforts are now concentrated in improving source data for
ODCs and OFCs and compiling a financial corporations survey with full institutional coverage.
Financial soundness indicators are not reported to STA.
Balance of payments: Balance of payments statistics weaknesses persist and there is a need to
improve the coverage, classification and compilation methodology of the external sector
statistics (ESS). Fiji reports its balance of payments data for dissemination purposes in the
Fund’s International Financial Statistics (IFS) and in the Balance of Payments Statistics
Yearbook (BOPSY). BoS has undertaken a number of actions that were recommended to improve
timeliness in ESS dissemination and to enhance consistency with the sixth edition of the Balance
of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6), albeit at a slow pace.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Fiji is a GDDS participant.

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Fiji
On October 31, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Fiji.1
Background
With landmark elections in September 2014, Fiji took a decisive stride toward returning to
democratic government for the first time since 2006. The successful elections are expected to
solidify the recent improvements in relationships with traditional development partners, improve
access to concessional development finance, and boost confidence in the economy.
Growth in 2013 accelerated to 4.6 percent. The latest available consumption and investment
indicators suggest continued strength in 2014, with economic growth projected at 3.8 percent.
Headline inflation is currently low as imported commodity and food prices have remained stable.
The Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) lowered its policy rate to 0.5 percent in 2011 and monetary
policy has been on hold since then. The lower policy rate and persistent excess liquidity in the
banking system have slowly been transmitted to lower lending rates. In response to lower rates
and improved confidence, net domestic credit accelerated in the first half of 2014. The fiscal
deficit was smaller than expected in 2013, but the 2014 budget was expansionary. In the 2014
budget, the authorities have provided for a large increase in expenditures with the bulk of the
increased spending financed from privatization receipts. Large parts of the planned privatization
financing will not materialize in 2014, and the authorities have developed and implemented
expenditure and revenue contingency plans aimed at containing the deficit. Based on
developments in the first half of 2014, the deficit financing target is on track to be met.
The authorities have accelerated economic reforms in recent years, for example in the sugar
sector and pension schemes, but the key policy challenges remain to raise potential growth,
reduce unemployment, improve financial inclusion, and increase resilience to shocks. Following
the elections, continued structural reform momentum is needed to improve the business
environment, address the infrastructure backlog, and raise the absorptive capacity to take full
advantage of a potential increase in investments.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Fiji’s successful national elections, which are expected to boost
confidence in the economy, solidify relationships with traditional development partners and
improve access to concessional development finance. Directors encouraged the authorities to
take advantage of the post-election environment to accelerate the pace of structural reforms in
order to support sustainable, higher and broad-based growth, and reduce vulnerability to shocks.
Directors agreed that near-term macroeconomic management needs to be carefully calibrated,
with the economy now growing above potential. They noted that fiscal policy has been prudent
and well focused in recent years, but that the 2014 budget is a departure from trend. While
welcoming the contingency plans developed by the authorities, Directors cautioned against
financing an expansion of recurrent expenditure with one-off asset sales. To enhance buffers and
create space for needed public investment, they stressed that base-broadening revenue measures
are needed, alongside current spending restraint. These measures should include a significant
reduction in income-tax holidays and tax incentives, within the context of a general improvement
in the investment climate.
Directors called for the adoption of a tightening bias in the monetary stance to curb demand
pressures, given strong credit growth and the positive output gap. They advised an appropriate
policy mix consisting of targeted prudential measures, open market operations, raising reserve
requirements, and if needed, a gradual adjustment of the policy rate. Directors viewed the postelection environment as a good window of opportunity to lay the foundation for moving toward a
more flexible exchange rate, designed to enhance external competitiveness and resilience to
shocks. They encouraged the authorities to bring exchange restrictions in compliance with
Article VIII requirements.
Directors acknowledged the soundness of the banking system, but called for enhanced financial
oversight to mitigate risks stemming from rapid credit expansion. They recommended
strengthening the financial sector’s supervisory and macroprudential frameworks, monitoring
banking sector risks through regular stress testing, and further improving the AML/CFT regime.
Directors commended the success in increasing financial inclusion, and encouraged further
efforts in this regard.
While welcoming recent progress, Directors supported deeper and faster structural reforms to lift
Fiji’s potential growth, reduce external vulnerabilities, and alleviate poverty. Priority should be
given to improving the investment climate by streamlining government regulations, relaxing
price controls while protecting the most vulnerable, further enhancing the efficiency of land use,
and upgrading infrastructure. Efforts are also needed to boost the energy supply and ensure the
viability of the sugarcane industry. Directors also looked forward to continued improvements in
data quality.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Introduction
1.
The Fijian authorities would like to thank the IMF team for the constructive and
useful discussions held during the 2014 Article IV Consultations in July. The authorities are
in broad agreement with the staff assessment on the economy and the focus on policy and
reform priorities that will boost growth potential and sustain broad-based and inclusive
growth in the post-election period. The successful September 17 national election was
deemed credible, free and fair by the Multinational Observer Group and marked Fiji’s return
to parliamentary democracy after 8 years. The decisive victory by the Fiji First party which
secured a majority 32 seats in the new 50-member parliament implies the entrenchment and
continuation of policies by the Bainimarama Government that have achieved positive growth
and reform momentum during the past four years. The positive result of the election has
boosted investment and growth prospects and cemented a path towards a stronger and more
dynamic economy. This statement provides an update on recent developments in Fiji and
elaborates on key policy issues for clarification and emphasis.
Recent economic developments and outlook
2.
Latest provisional estimates released by the Fiji Bureau of Statistics show that Fiji’s
economy grew by 4.6 percent in 2013, higher than the earlier forecast of 3.6 percent
reflecting better-than-expected performances in sectors including finance, transport,
construction, education and services. The higher growth last year, underpinned by strong
consumption and investment activity, is expected to moderate slightly to 4.0 percent this
year. Staff estimates are in line with authorities’ assessment. Partial data so far this year
show increases in sales of new vehicles and cement for construction activity, higher bank
lending, strong imports, and robust Value Added Tax collections suggesting that private
consumption and investment activity remain key drivers of growth. Headline inflation has
remained low, falling further to 0.3 percent in September, reflecting stable international
commodity and food prices as well as free primary and secondary education. Credit growth
picked up from 9 percent in 2013 to 17 percent in the first eight months of this year,
reflecting higher lending to the wholesale, retail, hotels and restaurants, transport and
housing and private individuals sectors. The fiscal deficit is forecast at around 1.9 percent in
2014, slightly more expansionary than the 2013 deficit of 0.5 percent. Commensurate with
the deficit levels, the Government debt-to-GDP ratio fell slightly to 49.8 percent at the end of
September 2014 from 51.4 percent at the end of last year. Foreign reserves have recently
declined owing to the strong expansion in imports and sluggish exports, however, remain at a
comfortable level. Tourism and remittances inflows are expected to grow this year and
provide some some buffer for the external sector.

2
Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
3.
The authorities have maintained an accommodative monetary policy stance, keeping
the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) Overnight Policy Rate at 0.5 percent, consistent with the
assessment on the outlook for growth and inflation. This has seen bank lending rates fall
further and credit growth pick up, as the lending environment is supported by higher
disposable incomes from the tax cuts and growing confidence in the economy. Financial
stability continues to be preserved by well-capitalized banks and low NPLs. Nevertheless,
the rapid growth in credit to certain sectors, and sharp increases in house prices and imports
seen in recent months have led to increased vigilance by the RBF in closely monitoring bank
activity and the liquidity situation. The RBF remains closely engaged with the banks
bilaterally and jointly through the quarterly Association of Banks forum to discuss the latest
macroeconomic situation and outlook and implications for monetary policy and financial
stability. The RBF continues to enhance its supervision through more risk-based assessment
of banks and ongoing training for staff to improve the overall supervisory framework. In the
meantime, the RBF will continue to assess the need for sectoral measures while it stands
ready, on a tightening bias, to implement open market operations and raise the policy rate as
warranted.
4.
Fiji has made huge strides towards improving financial inclusion through the National
Financial Inclusion Taskforce (NFIT), whose work has received international accolade and
modeled by countries in the region. Since 2010, the RBF as chair of the NFIT, has driven
national efforts in financial inclusion that has seen the over-achievement on the target of
reaching 150,000 unbanked by 2014, implementation of a Poverty Progress Index Scorecard
to track client poverty over time, and ongoing survey work that will provide a baseline for a
new National Financial Inclusion Strategy for 2015-2020. Moreover, ongoing outreach
through financial inclusion expositions in conjunction with financial literacy training
programs held outside urban centers and the integration of financial education into core
subjects in schools from Year one to Year 12, have increased awareness and demand for
financial services and improved consumer empowerment.
Exchange Rate Policy and External Balance
5.
Fiji’s reliance on trade and tourism make it susceptible to external shocks especially
in trading partner demand and commodity prices. As such, the authorities see merit in
allowing greater exchange rate flexibility for shock absorption and will continue to review
the timing for this as the macroeconomic situation warrants it. In the meantime, the current
exchange rate basket regime continues to provide an important anchor for inflation and
benefit to Fiji’s trade through the role of different currencies in the basket whose offsetting
movements help minimize the overall impact on the Fiji dollar. On exchange restrictions, the
authorities are working with staff to bring these measures in line with requirements under the
Fund’s Article VIII.

6.
The authorities recognize the importance of safeguarding the financial system from
money laundering and other criminal activities, and continue to strengthen its AML/CFT
framework in line with international standards. Better coordination and information
exchange with partner agencies domestically and internationally and close liaison with
financial institutions should improve compliance with the Financial Transactions Reporting
Act. This year, the FIU is working closely with key agencies in implementing the new law
on “unexplained wealth”, as well as some provisions of the new 2013 Constitution,
particularly those relating to the code of conduct, assets disclosure and governance for public
sector officials.
Fiscal Policy
7.
On the fiscal front, the authorities are committed to gradually consolidating finances
over the medium term while remaining supportive of policies that will achieve sustainable
and inclusive growth. This year’s budget strategy aims to build further on the 2013 budget
priorities of improving the country’s infrastructure and expanding health and education
spending. So far this year, the fiscal performance has been marked by strong tax revenue
collections, weak non-tax revenue collections mainly due to the delays in asset sales and
below-budget recurrent and capital spending. The resulting budget deficit of 1.5 percent of
GDP for the January-September 2014 period, while reflecting the revenue shortfall from
privatization receipts, remains within the 1.9 percent annual deficit target. The authorities
are aware of the current pressures from the privatization delays to this year’s fiscal position
and are undertaking all efforts to rein in expenditures to ensure the deficit target is
achievable. At the same time however, authorities are mindful of the potential impact of
halting the momentum of investment spending on the economy and remain careful to
appropriately balance its deficit and growth targets. The direction for fiscal policy under the
medium term fiscal framework for 2015 and beyond, which will be announced on November
21, 2014, is expected to remain centered on fostering investment-led growth in a fiscally
sustainable environment.
8.
Revenue policy will continue to focus on ensuring a tax system that is equitable, nondistortionary and simple to administer. Ongoing efforts to strengthen tax administration and
improve revenue mobilization through streamlining tax administrative processes and
procedures, improving compliance, reviewing of tariff rates and government fees, fines and
charges, as well as improving internal controls, are aimed at providing a conducive
environment that will stimulate investment. Expenditure policy will remain focused on
improving funding allocations to key sectors such as transport infrastructure development to
improve connectivity and increase supply capacity, as well as health, education and poverty
alleviation. In line with fiscal deficits of below 2.0 percent of GDP over the past five years,
Government debt has been declining. Under its debt management framework, government
aims to further reduce debt towards its medium term target of 45 percent, by prudently
managing public finances, Government guarantees and contingent liabilities and building up
its offshore fund for the global bond repayment in 2016.

Structural Reforms
9.
The authorities have made significant progress in certain areas of reforms, where
outcomes have been evident, and will continue to drive the reform process to increase the
productive capacity of the economy and improve the business environment to raise the
economy’s competitiveness and strengthen its resilience to shocks.
10.
Land reform is crucial to unlocking Fiji’s economic potential. Ongoing work by the
government’s Committee for Better Utilization of Land and the Land Bank Initiative are
central to its aim to make more land available for productive use and ensure equitable returns
to both the tenant and landlord via long term leases and market-based returns. Recent efforts
are focusing on stronger monitoring of lease renewals to ensure land is utilized to raise
production and productivity, concerns on speculators are addressed and there is close liaison
with stakeholders to improve capacity support, competence, innovation and sustainability for
farmers. The increase in land deposits with the Land Bank unit has brought economic
benefits to landowners and boosted private sector interest in the economy. The government
plans to develop more state land for 99 year leasing to improve squatter dwelling as well as
continue its assistance programs including support to the Housing Authority and Public
Rental Board institutions that provide affordable housing to Fijians.
11.
Reforms to revitalize the sugar industry since 2010 have borne positive results
through higher production and a positive turnaround in the sugar company FSC’s financial
performance which has stabilized this important industry on which a large part of the
population depend. Under its Sugar Cane Industry Action Plan 2013-22, the government will
focus on improving key areas of the sector that will raise sugar output and exports, prepare
the industry for the withdrawal of EU preferential prices in 2017, and sustain the industry
over the next ten years.
12.
Despite the addition of more renewable power to Fiji’s energy sector, the increased
demand for services and infrastructure in a growing economy continues to drive authorities’
efforts to improve the industry’s supply of accessible, affordable, safe and reliable power.
Joint efforts between government and industry stakeholders will soon culminate in the
implementation of a new Energy Policy for 2014-2020, aimed at addressing the country’s
energy needs and ensuring that the sector remains resource efficient, cost effective and
environmentally sustainable. Government plans for the sector include fast-tracking
outstanding electrification projects and amending legislation to allow households to sell
power from alternative energy sources to the national grid.
13.
The reform of the FNPF which contributes 36 percent of total financial sector assets
is critical to ensure sustainable returns to members’ funds and to safeguard the stability of the
financial system. The latest review by the Fund’s Actuary confirmed that the pension
scheme is now based on an actuarially-calculated rate, which will be reviewed periodically to
ensure that it remains sound. In line with international best practices, separate funds were

5
established for each business and a solvency reserve regulated. Effective November 1 2014,
member accounts will be split into a Preserved fund for retirement and a General fund to
cater for pre-retirement withdrawals inclusive of education, medical, unemployment,
housing. Governance for the Fund has been strengthened under prudential guidelines for
proper supervision and the RBF, as regulator, monitors compliance with solvency guidelines
for the sustainability of the Fund. At the same time, the Fund has instituted a robust risk
management framework and governance structure to strengthen the Fund’s internal controls.
14.
The smallness, isolation and lack of competitive nature of local markets sometimes
give rise to exorbitant price increases in market commodities that have a huge negative
impact on the poor and rural population, and as such result in Government’s intervention that
include adjusting the transmission lag for price changes to soften the impact on consumers.
Nevertheless, the authorities are aware of the need to improve price signals in the market and
continue to assess this need with a view to scaling back controls while ensuring that the poor
are not disadvantaged. Since 2011, the authorities have gradually relaxed regulation on
several items including basic food, rent, and pharmaceuticals.
Final remarks
15.
The Fijian authorities are committed to implementing appropriate economic policies
and maintaining the reform momentum to ensure that near term needs of the economy are
met and macroeconomic stability and sustainable growth are achieved over the medium and
long term. With the expected boost in investor optimism following the successful elections,
the authorities look forward to working closely with development partners to broaden and
maximize new economic opportunities for the country.
16.
The authorities acknowledge the support provided by the Fund, World Bank, ADB
and other development partners, particularly technical assistance through the PFTAC in the
area of public financial management, revenue administration, statistics, financial supervision
and macroeconomic analysis. Closer engagement with authorities through regional forums,
training, and surveillance missions, will continue to strengthen collaboration and partnership
with the Fund.
17.
Finally, the authorities wish to thank the Mission Chief Mr Chikahisa Sumi and Mr
Dan Nyberg and the team for a well-written report and useful policy suggestions.
