IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Benin
On December 11, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Benin.
For the third consecutive year, Benin is expected to reach solid economic growth in 2015 at
around 5 percent, despite recent headwinds from the economic slowdown in Nigeria—Benin’s
major trading partner. In 2016, increased public investment is expected to keep real GDP growth
at about 5½ percent, with inflation to remain subdued. The medium-term outlook is also positive
overall, but subject to significant risks, including a further slowdown in Nigeria and delays of
structural reforms that could weaken growth dynamics.
Low debt levels help accommodate the government’s ambitious plans to further scale up
investment over the medium term. To implement investment plans for 2015 despite revenue
shortfalls, the government has sharply increased the amount of bonds issued in the regional
financial market to support higher investment spending prior to the February 2016 elections.
Reliance on the regional financial market for budget financing has been facilitated by the regional
central bank’s (BCEAO) accommodative monetary policy
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They commended the authorities’
prudent policies, which have contributed to a solid macroeconomic performance. Nevertheless,

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually

every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms
the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.
2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of

Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

higher, sustainable, and more inclusive growth is required to reduce poverty against the
backdrop of a more challenging environment, including the economic slowdown in
neighboring Nigeria. Directors emphasized the need for further progress in improving fiscal
policy management and faster implementation of structural reforms to enhance the business
environment and foster greater diversification.
Directors agreed that the authorities’ plan to scale up infrastructure investment is well placed
to strengthen growth, and that prudent fiscal policy in the past provides some space to
finance higher investment. However, they recommended a more gradual and prioritized
approach to raising investment. This would provide more time to further improve public
financial management, which is crucial to ensure high-quality investments with a strong
impact on economic growth. Directors also recommended caution regarding the sharp
increase in domestic financing, stressing that the higher fiscal costs of such financing
compared to concessional financing, as well as the associated macro-financial risks from
sovereign-bank linkages, need to be closely monitored.
Directors supported the authorities’ efforts to undertake structural fiscal reforms and called
for their timely implementation. In view of rising debt to finance investment, they stressed
that internal revenue mobilization, through a further deepening of customs and tax reforms,
will be crucial to ensure fiscal sustainability over the medium term. Further improvements in
debt management, including broadening the coverage to include the debt of state-owned
enterprises, will also be important to monitor risks.
Directors called for further improvements in the business environment and the financial
market infrastructure to strengthen the foundation for more diversified, private sector-led
growth. Accelerating the establishment of a credit bureau and reforming property titles,
would go a long way in improving financial inclusion and supporting private credit growth,
while pressing ahead with judicial reform would facilitate contract enforcement and financial
deepening. Directors noted that improvements to the business environment, together with
timely payment of government obligations to banks and private companies, would help bring
down high non-performing loans. They also called for stronger supervision in view of loan
concentration risks, and for action to improve oversight of the microfinance sector to
preserve its role in facilitating access to financial services for low-income households.

3

Directors looked forward to continued efforts to improve the quality and timeliness of
economic data, in particular fiscal and external sector data.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Benin will be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context and outlook. Economic growth improved against the backdrop of a restrained
fiscal stance and progress in structural reforms during the authorities’ ECF-supported
program in 2010–14. Growth is projected to exceed 5 percent in 2015–16 despite recent
headwinds from the slowdown in Nigeria, reflecting stepped-up public investment to
address infrastructure bottlenecks in 2015–19. Achieving the authorities’ objective of
accelerating growth will require stronger progress in structural reforms in the business
environment, public financial management, and domestic revenue mobilization.
Policy discussions. The authorities and staff agreed that Benin’s macroeconomic
performance remains solid, and discussions focused on how to strengthen fiscal policy
to ensure that the scaling up of public investment is successful and achieve maximum
growth impact without jeopardizing debt sustainability.


Prudent fiscal policy in recent years has generated some fiscal space for investment,
but in light of capacity and funding constraints, a more measured pace of
investment increase, especially in the near-term, would help achieve quality results
while containing the rising risk from relying on financing in the regional bond
market.



Accelerating structural reforms to enhance domestic revenue mobilization, raise
expenditure efficiency, and further strengthen debt management is critical to sustain
fiscal space without jeopardizing debt sustainability.



In addition to infrastructure gaps and the weak business environment, constraints to
financing have impeded growth, with private credit growth lagging behind the
WAEMU average, reflecting constraints of high non-performing loans (NPLs) related
to gaps in financial market infrastructure. Looking for opportunities to make profits,
banks have been lending increasingly to the government, refinanced by the BCEAO
with its accommodative monetary policy. Consequently, macro-financial risks are on
the rise.

BACKGROUND
1.
Macroeconomic performance has been
encouraging in recent years. Economic growth remained
steady at around 5 percent in 2015 despite headwinds
from Nigeria. Three consecutive years of strong growth
has helped Benin close the gap of per capita income
growth with the Sub-Sahara Africa (SSA) region. Inflation
has remained low. Fiscal policy has been prudent,
preserving debt at around 30 percent of GDP by end2014—10 percentage points below the WAEMU average.

Benin is now at a critical juncture, with opportunities to turn the three-year growth
recovery into high and sustainable growth, but there are also risks from Nigerian spillovers
and weak institutions:


The government’s ambitious plan to scale up investment provides an opportunity to boost
growth, if accompanied by strong structural reforms. In a Round Table conference with
donors and private investors in Paris in June 2014, the government presented investment
projects to address infrastructure bottlenecks to growth, mainly in energy and transport. The low
debt level provides some scope for increasing investment without jeopardizing debt
sustainability, but structural reforms are essential to ensure that investment spending results in
high quality infrastructure. For a strong private sector response to improved infrastructure,
further progress in improving the business environment is essential.



Close trade links to Nigeria expose Benin to risks from volatile commodity prices (Box1),
but the proximity creates opportunities to accelerate economic development. The common
External Tariff (CET) for the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) countries
(including Benin and Nigeria), effective since January 2015, may adversely affect informal trade
between Nigeria and Benin and, consequently, Benin’s fiscal revenues, as transition
arrangements are gradually phased out. However, enhanced access to the bigger ECOWAS
market should help Benin boost trade and diversify the economy. The growth potential is also
strong in the agricultural sector, which accounts for 80 percent of employment. 1

Box 1. Spillovers from Nigeria
The Beninese economy is deeply interconnected with Nigeria. Staff
estimates that a 1 percentage point reduction in Nigerian growth is
associated with 0.3 percentage point reduction in Benin’s growth rate.
Spillovers occur through the following channels:
Informal trade. Nigeria has import bans and high tariffs on a wide range of
products, leading to arbitrage trade. The World Bank (2015) estimates that
about 20 percent of Benin’s GDP is related to this informal trade. Nigerian
domestic demand thus significantly affects Benin’s growth. The ECOWAS
CET is expected to reduce tariffs in Nigeria gradually,2 likely leading to a
decline in informal trade over time.
Fuel prices and subsidies. Nigeria’s subsidized fuel prices have attracted
informal fuel exports to Benin, where 85 percent of the gasoline is
estimated to be from Nigeria. Nigeria’s temporary cut of fuel subsidies in
January 2012 triggered an immediate fuel price spike in Benin. As trading
smuggled fuel is a significant source of income for poor households, a
reduction in fuel subsidies in Nigeria, as currently under consideration,
would negatively affect these people.

addition to customs duties and processing fees, VAT is levied on these
imports, which have to be declared for domestic consumption because the Beninese authorities refuse to process
imports prohibited by Nigeria as transit goods.

Financial sector. The principal shareholders of two banks in Benin are Nigerian. They are sufficiently capitalized and
possess some buffer against possible shocks to Nigeria’s banking system. Another bank under receivership also has
Nigerian ownership. These three banks hold about 15 percent of Beninese deposits and a similar amount of loans.
However, the portfolio of banks in Benin is highly concentrated on commerce, which, in turn, depends on Nigeria’s
performance.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
4.
While growth prospects for 2015 should benefit from a planned rise in public
investment, bad weather conditions and the slowdown in Nigeria will affect growth. These
negative factors are expected to reduce economic growth compared to 2014 even if the sharp
increase of investment in the 2015 budget, equivalent to 2½ percentage points of GDP, materializes.
Inflation remains subdued despite a moderate uptick in food prices, reflecting the effect of bad
weather conditions on food production. Some progress has been made in improving human
development indicators (Table 7), particularly access to education, health, and water services, but
poverty remains high.4
2

The ECOWAS CET has a provision for temporary Import Adjustment Tax to allow non WAEMU countries to adjust to
the CET during the 5-year transitional period ending in 2019. Nigeria intends to use this provision.

Implementation of the government’s ambitious structural reform agenda has shown
mixed performance, contributing to slow investment budget execution (see Box 2 for a
detailed description of fiscal reform progress). Reform objectives in public financial
management (PFM) focus on improving the efficiency of investment spending and developing
capacity to manage PPPs. To broaden the fiscal space for higher investment, revenue measures
were identified with a particular focus on reducing the dependency on volatile customs revenues.
While the four-year program with the IMF, supported by the Extended Credit Facility (ECF), expired
in June 2014, Fund staff has continued to assist the government in capacity-building projects
through technical assistance missions (see Informational Annex).
8.
Increased public investment is expected to widen the external current account deficit
in 2015 and beyond. The current account deficit reached around 9 percent of GDP in 2013–14,
financed mainly by concessional funding and foreign direct investment (FDI), but would widen to
11 percent of GDP in 2015 reflecting higher imports for investments (Table 4).
9.
The exchange rate assessment indicates that the real exchange rate is moderately
overvalued. As the widening current account deficit over the next years reflects the temporary rise
in investment, it has only limited effect on the external stability analysis, which indicates that the real
effective exchange rate is moderately overvalued as in the last Article IV consultation (2012). Weak
broader competitiveness indicators underline the urgency for implementing structural reforms
(Annex II).
10.
Persistent problems with non-performing loans (NPLs)—among the highest in the
WAEMU—have constrained credit to the private sector (Table 6 and text chart).7 In 2014, the
large exposure by several banks’ to a business group that encountered difficulties aggravated the

already high NPL ratio. Although guarantees provided by

the business group limited provisioning needs in the end,
(percent, average 2012-2014)
which would otherwise have led to an undercapitalization of
a few banks, capital adequacy remains low at just above
8 percent. The provisioning rate is also low at about
50 percent, 10 percentage points below the WAEMU
average. Loan concentration has remained high, partly
reflecting Benin’s underdeveloped financial sector and weak
business environment, particularly the lack of property titles
and borrower information. This kept credit growth to the
private sector below the WAEMU average and likely reduced Benin’s growth.

11.
Progress has been made in resolving two banks under receivership after long delays.
NPLs of a bank under receivership since 2012, equivalent to around ½ percent of GDP, are expected
to be assumed by the government to complete its restructuring, but no timing has been confirmed.
Another bank under receivership has been merged with a pan-African bank. Three new banks have
been licensed, and two opened in Benin in 2015.
12.
In view of high risks in the private sector, banks have shifted towards lending to the
government, but this has created new risks related to payment delays. Lending to the
government has become a major source of profits for banks because of the interest margin of
3 percentage points between one-year government bonds and the BCEAO refinancing rate.8
Implementation of the government’s recent plan not to service short-term bank loans due, but offer
long-term regional treasury bonds in exchange would render this rising exposure to sovereign risks
particularly worrisome. Moreover, payment delays have been detrimental for businesses’ confidence
in the state.9
13.
In contrast to banks, microfinance institutions (MFIs) have experienced fast growth,
but the expansion of unauthorized MFIs is a concern (Figure 1). MFIs have been growing at a
rapid pace and currently account for about 10 percent of the assets of the financial system. They
provide financial services to 2.1 million clients, or 20 percent of the population. However, the share
of credits at risk of even the authorized MFIs has been high and reached 7 percent in 2014, above
the norm set at 3 percent. The authorities have started enhancing supervision and enforcement to
address financial stability concerns. Measures include the establishment of an inter-ministerial
committee in charge of cleaning up unregistered MFIs and the assignment of supervision of large
MFIs to the WAEMU Banking Commission and BCEAO, and by upgrading the Ministry of Finance’s
directorate responsible for supervising the other MFIs to a new agency in 2015. Despite these
efforts, only six out of an estimated 500-600 unauthorized MFIs have been closed since 2010.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
15.
The economic outlook remains positive overall. In 2016, increased investment is
expected to keep real GDP growth steady at about 5½ percent. Improved infrastructure combined
with structural reforms would steadily raise growth to 6 percent over the medium-term. Moderate
increases in domestic revenue mobilization are projected to help bringing down the fiscal deficit to
about 4¾ percent of GDP by 2020 (Baseline Scenario).

16.

However, this outlook is subject to significant risks (Annex IV), including:



A further slowdown in Nigeria owing to low oil prices, which could weaken Benin’s exports, fiscal
position, and growth.



Weak institutional capacity that could delay structural reforms, undermine the quality of
investment, and weaken the private sector response to rising public investment.



Banking sector vulnerabilities to credit risk and macro-financial risks. Stress tests find banks
vulnerable to higher NPLs, default of concentrated exposures, and sovereign risk.

17.
The Risk Scenario in Text Table 2 illustrates how the macroeconomic situation would
change if the first two of these risks were to materialize. Assuming that the impact of public
investment scaling up on private investment is limited and that Nigeria’s growth is around
2 percentage points below the baseline for 2016 and 2017, Benin’s growth would drop to below
5 percent in 2016 and level out at around 4½ percent over the medium-term.

Box 2. Benin: Progress in Fiscal Structural Reforms
Tax and customs administration: The lack of coordination between tax and customs administration has prevented
the coherent use of the unique tax identification number—a core reform of the last IMF-supported program. In an
economy so dependent on trade, customs information is essential to broaden the domestic taxpayer base, but there
is a lack of coordination. However, within the tax and customs directorates, some progress has been made:
Tax administration: Work on a comprehensive tax administration reform plan has been ongoing for several years,
including with FAD technical assistance, without a definitive outcome. The government is now also working on the
plan with Canadian assistance, complemented by a new IT system. After long delays, electronic tax payments have
been introduced. The one-stop business and tax registration for micro and small firms is also a positive
development.
Customs administration: Progress has been made in upgrading IT and establishing a risk management system, but its
effect was muted by incomplete application of the risk management system’s findings when selecting goods for
inspection. This could also reduce the efficiency of the recently purchased scanners. An external consultant has
started to work with customs staff to enhance valuation, which has potential to improve revenue collection and
improve governance.
Tax policy: The extension of the professional tax to micro and small enterprises has been planned to support their
move to the formal sector but its application will not be effective before 2016. Revenue losses from exemptions have
been rising until 2015, but the authorities have reduced ad hoc tax expenditures by not renewing exemptions on
telecommunication and postal services in the draft 2016 budget.
Debt management: In line with Fund technical assistance recommendations, the debt management agency (CAA)
has recently streamlined responsibilities with the Treasury directorate, reorganized its structure along front-middleback office lines, and developed its strategy. Once the Treasury directorate has implemented similar efforts, the new
organization setup will allow for better coordinated debt management. Commendable plans are also under way at
the CAA to increase reporting, widen the monitoring of government liabilities to include SOEs, and improve
governance by establishing internal audit systems.
PFM: The authorities have initiated medium-term reforms to implement the new organic budget law that includes
state of the art practices like accrual accounting and program budgeting, which have already led to the preparation
of a multi-year budget framework in the draft 2016 budget. However, progress in addressing weaknesses in day to
day operations has been mixed.
Budget and treasury management has continued to suffer from problems in managing the expenditure chain as
commitments were not sufficiently adjusted to revenue shortfalls. To prevent reporting of arrears, processing of
expenditures has been delayed, and some treasury checks issued to private firms have not been cleared.
Coverage and transparency of budget reporting has been constrained by insufficient reporting of costs stemming
from SOEs, including subsidies to the cotton campaign and the electricity sector. Contingent liabilities have not been
sufficiently monitored or reported despite recent efforts. Efforts to establish a sound framework for managing PPPs
and monitoring associated risks have been delayed.
Audit capacity has been identified as a major weakness in the 2014 PEFA, which makes public spending vulnerable
to corruption. To address this shortcoming, confirmed by the forensic audit in reaction to fraud in a donor-financed
water project, the authorities prepared an anti-corruption action plan which includes sanctions against those
responsible and preventive measures against reoccurrence. The newly created Bureau of the Auditor General (BAG)
has started positive efforts in capacity building in internal audit, enforcement of timely external audits of SOEs, and
systematic follow up on audit recommendations.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
18.
While Benin’s macroeconomic performance remains solid, sustaining strong and
inclusive growth remains a challenge. Three consecutive years of sustained growth above 5
percent helped Benin reverse a decade’s weaker performance relative to its peers, but poverty has
not come down. Moving forward, staff and the authorities agreed that sustaining strong and more
inclusive growth requires increasing public infrastructure investment while safeguarding debt
sustainability and advancing structural reforms to foster a vibrant private sector that can create jobs
for Benin’s young and growing population.11 In this context, discussions centered on how to ensure
that the scaling up of investment yields the maximum growth dividend. In particular, the focus was
on:


improving fiscal policy management to support the scaling up of investment, including by
strengthening revenue to broaden fiscal space, preserving debt sustainability, and enhancing
implementation capacity to achieve value for money; and



bolstering the business environment so that private sector investment responds positively to
improvement in public infrastructure, including through removing obstacles for the financial
sector.

A. Strengthen Fiscal Policy to Successfully Scale up Public Investment
19.
Government plans to scale up investment are projected to widen the fiscal deficit
from around 3½ percent (2011–14) to an average of 5½ percent over the next five years.
While some uncertainty remains regarding the total investment volume, the draft 2016–18 multiyear program budget includes central government investment equivalent to around 10 percent of
GDP.12 These investments would be complemented by investments by State-Owned Enterprises
(SOEs) of around 4 percent of GDP, including a hydropower project jointly with Togo, for which
discussions are under way with the Exim Bank of China. In addition, a large Private Public Partnership
(PPP) has been established for a regional railroad project, but no information on terms and
conditions is available yet. Reflecting the scarcity of external concessional financing, the government
identified other financing options, including syndicated loans through the West African
Development Bank (BOAD).
20.
Reflecting debt relief and prudent fiscal policy in the past, the planned investment
and financing mix would increase but keep the risk of debt distress at the low level (see debt

sustainability analysis (DSA)). Although the DSA’s ratio of the present value (PV) of external debt
to exports marginally and temporarily breaches the threshold under a shock scenario, all other
indicators remain comfortably below their thresholds. This conclusion remains valid when total
public debt is considered. However, the upward trajectory in the fixed primary deficit scenario
underscores the need for caution. When using the Risk Scenario (Text table 2) as a baseline in the
DSA, the risk of debt distress would even rise to moderate. Moreover, the recent confirmation of a
regional court ruling that orders the state to pay about CFAF 144 billion, equivalent to around
3 percent of GDP, to a business group for contract breach is not incorporated in the DSA, as the
government has stated that it will take the case to international courts.
21.
The authorities emphasized continued commitment to sustainable fiscal policy.
Regarding external vulnerabilities, they pointed out that the breach of the threshold mainly reflects
Benin’s high historical export volatility due to the large share of informal re-exports. Recent
successes in diversifying exports, notably cashews and cement, should mitigate export volatility, and
improved infrastructure and business environment would continue to boost exports. Benin’s
WAEMU membership also assures its ability to pay in case of a temporary shock. Ongoing debt
management reform will further strengthen the ability to balance pressing investment needs with
the debt sustainability objective.
22.
However, for 2016, the planned continued reliance on the regional market to finance
investment carries risks for budget execution. The authorities are convinced that the strong
demand for government bonds and their historically low interest rates provide an opportunity to
raise financing for important development projects, in particular, the energy shortage that has
plagued the economy with frequent power outages. With increased regional market appetite for
securities with long maturities, rollover risks have diminished. They also pointed out that the
telecommunication privatization, originally scheduled for 2015, would reduce domestic financing
needs. Staff cautioned that privatization proceeds might not materialize fully, given weakening risk
appetite by international investors. Moreover, increased government borrowing could crowd out the
private sector, especially should the BCEAO reverse its current accommodative monetary policy.
Implementation of the recent government plan to issue a large amount of long-term regional bonds
to banks in exchange for short-term credits to the government would increase banks’ liquidity risks,
potentially further limiting their capacity to support the private sector. Reducing the government
borrowing need would help banks to cut their high sovereign exposure, and would thus reduce the
high macro-financial risk. The government emphasized that any meaningful reform of treasury
processes requires addressing payment delays that have been accumulating. Replacing short-term
bank loans with long-term treasury bonds would further improve the maturity structure of
government debt.
23.
A more gradual increase in investment would not only reduce the risk of repeating
bumpy budget execution, but also give time to improve PFM. While the authorities
acknowledged for 2015 the low capital spending execution until August, they expect the pace to
pick up, as many projects proposed during the 2014 Round Table are now shovel-ready. Staff
emphasized the importance of advancing PFM reforms in order to avoid compromising the quality

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

BENIN

of public investment. In particular, it is necessary to address key weaknesses identified in the 2014
PEFA, including cash forecasting and management, public procurement, and audit. An analysis
comparing Benin’s efficiency in health and education spending with other countries also reveals
scope for improving spending efficiency in the social sectors.13
24.
For the medium-term, domestic revenue mobilization is critical for enhancing fiscal
sustainability and reducing vulnerabilities. Fund staff and the authorities agreed that to reduce
vulnerabilities from Nigeria and from further trade liberalization, domestic revenues need to grow
faster than in the past. Based on a comparison with regional peers, Benin’s tax gap is estimated at
about 2 percent of GDP. 14 To help close the gap, comprehensive tax administration reform and
better cooperation between customs and tax administration are critical. Further, reducing and
streamlining exemptions, including by revisiting the provisions of the investment code, will also
enhance revenue. In this regard, the elimination of some ad hoc exemptions in the 2016 draft
budget is a step in the right direction. The authorities noted that reforms to mobilize more domestic
revenue have started but results would take time to materialize.
25.
Data quality, including on fiscal reporting, needs to be improved to provide a good
basis for policy decisions and enhance transparency to the public. The lack of timely reporting
of transactions between SOEs involved in cotton production and the budget makes it difficult to
assess cotton subsidies, now estimated by the government at ½ percent of GDP. Assessing subsidies
to the electricity sector, recently augmented to address electricity shortages, faces similar
constraints.15 Therefore, estimates for these subsidies are preliminary (Table 2 and 3), which
underlines the need for more timely and transparent fiscal reporting and SOE audits. A decision of
the Council of Ministers in November 2015 to pay for debt owned by CEB16 to Nigeria by issuing
government bonds equivalent to about ½ percent of GDP underlines the potential fiscal risks from
SOEs. Developing a framework to implement the Government Financial Statistics Manual (GFSM)
2001 would provide a good roadmap to improve fiscal data, and the Fund is providing technical
assistance on this. For the real sector, the recent re-basing of national accounts is an improvement
(Annex 1), but resource constraints at the National Institute of Statistics (INSAE) hamper prospects for
compiling quarterly GDP data to better support the authorities’ policy decisions. The 2016 budget
does not provide for additional resources for INSAE. Capacity constraints also affect Benin’s
reporting of external sector and debt statistics to the IMF.

Paper.

B. Business Environment Reforms to Support Higher Growth
26.
As pointed out in the growth diagnostic,17 the weak business environment has been
holding back growth, including by hampering financial intermediation. Problems in the
financial sector are closely linked with the overall weak business environment. While progress has
been made in improving some areas of the business environment, progress in closing gaps in
financial market infrastructure that cause obstacles to financial intermediation have been limited.
27.
To support banks’ financing of private investment, gaps in financial market
infrastructure that constrain risk assessment for lending need to be addressed. Bank
emphasized that the lack of property titles, asymmetric information, and the weak judicial system
are key barriers to more efficient intermediation. Uncertainty about the quality of collateral makes
financial institutions hesitant to lend unless the borrower provides exceptional and large guarantees,
which has been found to have a significant adverse effect on growth and financial inclusion.18 The
authorities noted progress in issuing land titles in Cotonou, but acknowledged the need for further
progress in providing electronic title registration for easy use and in extending titling to the whole
country. The government and BCEAO are working with parliament to accelerate approval of draft
legislation to establish a credit bureau in line with WAEMU directives. While judicial reform has been
slow, the authorities underlined their intention to improve capacity by extending training on
commercial regulation and creating commercial courts and arbitration mechanisms.
28.
These gaps in financial market infrastructure are also at the root of the stubbornly
high NPLs. Reducing Benin’s NPL to the WAEMU average level is estimated to be able to raise
private credit growth by about 4 to 6 percentage points.19 Such an increase would also translate into
higher growth and job creation by the private sector. While structural reforms for financial
deepening would help address this weakness, the government’s non-compliance to pay private
firms on time is according to banks a frequent source of firms’ late payments for loans. A banking
sector stress test finds that credit risks, including from loan concentration risks, are a severe
vulnerability for the banking system—exceeding the level faced by banking systems in most other
WAEMU countries.20 In particular, banks’ concentration to loans in the service sector exposes them
to heightened risks of lower informal trade with Nigeria. Staff advised that the regional authorities
should address forbearance by stricter enforcement of prudential norms on loan concentration,
which has been on the rise, and tighten the monitoring and reporting requirements on risk-based
capital. The authorities’ agreed with the findings of the stress test analysis, and noted that
implementation of a WAEMU directive that increases banks’ minimum capital requirement would
strengthen banks’ resilience. Regarding credit concentration, they pointed out that while this

constitutes a risk for banks, it is a common phenomenon in developing countries with shallow
financial markets and a large informal sector.

risks when liquidity conditions tighten.
Stress tests show that banks’ capital
adequacy ratio could fall below the minimum 8 percent in case of a partial default on sovereign
bonds. Implementation of the recent government plan to replace short-term bank loans by longterm government bonds would increase liquidity risks as well as sovereign risks on banks’ balance
sheets. A more measured pace in increasing investment and stronger implementation of structural
reforms to enhance the financial market infrastructure would help to contain macro-financial risk.

Despite some recent progress, the bank resolution regime lacks time constraints for
resolution, resulting in increasing losses in problem banks. The protracted bank resolution has
allowed loss making banks to remain in operation, accumulating further losses and increasing the
final cost for the budget for one bank. The authorities pointed to a recent decision of the WAEMU
Council of Ministers to develop a harmonized regional resolution framework.
31.
While fast-growing MFIs contribute to higher financial inclusion, their supervision
and regulation needs urgent improvement. The size of potential liabilities from deposits in
unauthorized MFIs would be a manageable fiscal risk in case of a crisis (equivalent to about
½ percent of GDP),21 but a microfinance system failure triggered by failed MFIs would hurt access to
finance for the most vulnerable parts of the population.22 Increasing the number of supervisors,
especially in rural areas, is necessary for timely supervision and enforcement of regulations,
including through closures. Regarding the regulatory framework for MFIs, staff noted that the ceiling
on the lending rate of 24 percent for MFIs may warrant a re-evaluation to enhance the sustainability
of MFIs, given that few MFIs observe it and the ceiling appears low compared to other developing

A plan to assess the impact of access to microfinance on poverty by analyzing household survey data did not
materialize during the Article IV consultation because the survey data were not provided. Once available, the
authorities intend to pursue this project with Fund staff.

countries.23 The authorities noted that setting this WAEMU-wide ceiling was based on a participatory
process, and some tax exemptions and below-market financing by the National Microfinance Fund
would offset the impact. They also pointed out that the WAEMU’s regional deposit insurance
scheme is close to becoming operational,24 which would strengthen stability in the banking and
microfinance sectors. Staff underscored the need for enhanced risk-based supervision to support
the effective functioning of the deposit insurance scheme.
32.
Coherent implementation of the legislative and regulatory framework for AML/CFT
would improve governance, both in the public and private sector. In particular, the
collaboration between the Financial Intelligence Unit (CENTIF) and financial sector supervisors
should be strengthened. These agencies should also implement a risk-based approach focusing
their limited resources on the main risks, including those related to corruption.
33.
The latest (December 2013) assessment of the WAEMU common central bank, BCEAO,
found a continuing strong control environment. In this context, implementation of the 2010
Institutional Reform of the WAEMU has enhanced the BCEAO’s governance framework. Specifically,
an internal audit committee was established and progress is underway to strengthen its capacity
with external expertise to oversee the audit and financial reporting processes; transparency has
increased with more timely publication of audited financial statements; and the BCEAO is committed
to fully comply with international financial reporting standards for the audit of FY 2015. The
assessment also identified some limitations in the external audit process and recommended that
steps be taken to ensure the adequacy of the mechanism through selection of a second experienced
audit firm to conduct joint external audits, which was done in 2015.

STAFF APPRAISAL

Economic growth in Benin has increased, but higher, sustainable, and more inclusive
growth is required to reduce poverty. Improved growth has contributed to some amelioration in
human development indicators, but poverty remains high. Only if the private sector can create jobs
for Benin’s young and growing population will poverty come down sustainably. The real exchange
rate is found to be moderately overvalued, and broader competitiveness indicators need further
improvement.
35.
Debt relief and low fiscal deficits have provided some fiscal space for investment, but
a more gradual approach to raising investments is recommended to ensure their quality,
preserve comfortable buffers against risks of debt distress, and minimize financing risks. With
23

A Millennium Challenge Account study in 2008–09 on Benin, Mali, and Senegal finds that an effective interest rate
that ensures sustainability of MFIs needs is about 36.6 percent. A recent World Bank study on Benin’s MFI confirms a
similar finding, see the SIP for details.
24

The deposit insurance agency has been created, and its operation is pending on the appointment of its
management. WAEMU agreement on setting up the regional deposit insurance allows automatic participation of
Benin and can cover deposit-taking MFIs.

the planned investment acceleration, Benin moves close to face a moderate risk of debt distress,
underlining the need to use the fiscal space wisely. This requires stronger implementation of critical
PFM and business environment reforms to translate this ambitious investment into higher growth.
In particular, forceful actions to strengthen governance are essential. Expenditure prioritization in
the context of enhanced PFM would help create addition fiscal space. The sharp increase in the
issuance of government securities, which would be amplified by the recent government plan to
substitute a large amount of regional bonds for debt repayments to banks, is costly, contradicts the
government’s intention to improve the business environment, and increases macro-financial risks
given banks’ already high sovereign exposure.
36.
Stronger domestic revenue mobilization would reduce reliance on expensive
domestic bank financing in the near-term and facilitate fiscal consolidation in the mediumterm. In this regard, improvements in customs management reform initiated under the last ECFsupported program need to be consolidated and strengthened. The long overdue reform blueprint
for tax administration is essential to allow domestic revenues to gradually offset declining and
volatile customs revenues. Better coordination between tax and customs administration is
technically a low-hanging fruit to improve revenue performance in the short-term.
37.
Stronger government implementation of structural reforms is required for the
banking sector to better support growth. Further improvements in the business environment, and
timely payment of government obligations to banks and private companies should be the starting
point to bring down high NPLs. In addition, correcting information asymmetries through
accelerating the establishment of a credit bureau and reforming property titles would go a long way
in improving financial inclusion and supporting private investment. Enhancing judicial reforms to
facilitate contract enforcement is a long-term, but crucial reform objective.
38.
The recent decision of the WAEMU Council of Ministers to develop a harmonized
framework for banking resolution offers an opportunity to enforce a time limit. The need for a
time limit is underlined by the fiscal cost for a problem bank that has been under receivership for
three years.
39.
While MFIs have been an important contributor to financial inclusion, these
achievements could disappear if stability risks materialize. Faster progress in reducing the large
number of unauthorized MFIs, as well as improving supervision is warranted to ensure that
achievements in financial inclusion are not jeopardized.
40.
Data provision is broadly adequate for standard surveillance, but further progress is
needed. In particular, quality and timeliness of national accounts and fiscal data should be improved
to better inform policy decisions. This requires additional resources, especially for INSAE.
41.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12–
month cycle.

Annex I. National Accounts Re-basing
The Benin National Institute of Statistics (INSAE) published re-based national accounts in 2015,
changing the base year from 1985 to 2007. The re-based figures show that nominal GDP in 2013 was
10 percent higher than the earlier figure. On average, annual real GDP growth was 0.1 percentage point
higher in 2000–13. In comparison, the average increase in GDP in five SSA countries that re-based during
the last three years has been about 60 percent.1
The re-based GDP series reflect improved methodology, source data, and structural changes of the
economy between 1985 and 2007. They provide better measures for agriculture, the informal sector,
and service activities, while the coverage of the secondary sector has been broadened with agri-food
processing and energy production. As a result, in the re-based figures for 2013, there is some shift from
the primary to the secondary sector, while the tertiary sector has slightly gained in weight.

Annex II. External Stability Assessment
Benin’s current account deficit is projected to widen over 2015–19, reflecting a large scaling-up of
public investment, but is then expected to improve progressively from 2020 on as investment and
import growth stabilize. The empirical assessment suggests a moderate overvaluation of the real
effective exchange rate (REER), broadly unchanged compared to the previous 2012 exchange rate
assessment. The analysis of structural indicators points to Benin’s low external competitiveness.
Balance of Payments
1.
The current account deficit (excluding grants) is expected to decrease over the
medium term, reflecting large investments scaling up. Higher imports of capital goods related to
manufacturing and other new investments widened the current account from 7.6 percent of GDP in
2011 to 9.8 percent of GDP in 2013. A large scaling-up of public investment, equivalent to
10 percentage points of GDP, would lead to a further widening to 10.7 percent of GDP in 2019. By
2020, when the scaling-up of investment comes to an end, the current account deficit would narrow
to 10.5 percent of GDP.
2.
Concessional financing and foreign direct investment (FDI) are the main sources of
external financing. External financing of the current account deficit remained relatively stable over
the past three years. Short-term capital flows and medium and long-term private loans were
equivalent to 1 percent of GDP. Foreign direct inflows were equivalent to 3.2 of GDP and are
expected to stabilize at 4.5 percent of GDP during 2015–19. Other capital flows, such as project
loans, remained at 2 percent of GDP over the past three years and are expected to stabilize at the
same level during 2015–19. Overall, non-debt creating flows are projected to remain the main
source of current account deficit financing.
Reserves adequacy and debt risks
3.
Gross international reserve coverage in the WAEMU has increased slightly in 2014 and
debt risks remain contained. 1 Gross international reserves coverage in WAEMU system declined
substantially since 2010 when it stood at 6.6 month of import reserve coverage stabilized at around
4 ½ months of imports in 2013 and 14. Gross reserves cover about 40 percent of broad money and
80 percent of short term debt. Benin’s gross external debt is low at 19.6 percent in 2014 (below the
average WEAMU countries).

Exchange Rate Assessment
4.
Benin’s current account position is assessed using the EBA-lite methodology.2 The
EBA-lite exchange rate assessment includes three approaches. The current account (CA) model and
the index of the real exchange rate (IRER) are panel regression-based analyses of the CA and real
exchange rate, while the third method, external sustainability (ES), is model-free and focused on
sustainability analysis. The EBA makes distinction between descriptive understanding of the current
accounts and real exchange rates and making normative evaluations:
Actual CA= CA Gap+ (Fitted CA-Policy Gap)
The term in parentheses is the current account norm and the CA Gap is the deviation of the actual
current from the norm, i.e., the misalignment. The term Policy Gap is the change in the current
account that results from a deviation of Benin’s policies from its optimal level and also on account of
the average policy misalignment to rest of the world.
5.
The analysis for 2014 suggests that Benin’s REER is moderately overvalued. Driven
mainly by its relatively tight fiscal stance, Benin’s policy gap is positive which decrease the current
account norm to -4.7 percent of GDP. The current gap of -3.8 percent of GDP then implies an
overvaluation of the REER by 10 percent3 (Figure 1). The IRER approach shows a smaller
overvaluation at 4 percent, while the ES approach indicates an overvaluation of 13.5 percent, with
the end-2014 NFA position of -25.6 percent of GDP as a benchmark, (Table 1).

Structural Competitiveness
6.
The deterioration of survey-based competitiveness indicators measuring institutional
and policy factors points to impediments to external competitiveness. Ranked 122 out of
140 countries in the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Global Competitiveness Report 2015–16, Benin
is lagging behind other WAEMU countries such as Senegal and Ivory Coast (Table 2). This reflects
weakness in all subcategories, most notably macroeconomic environment, labor market efficiency,
and financial sector development. In most categories Benin scored below the Sub-Saharan African
average.4 In the WEF Enabling Trade Index, Benin’s ranking deteriorated by 12 places compared to
the previous assessment (Table 3). Survey participants list access to trade finance, difficulties in
meeting requirements of buyers, and identification of markets for buyers as the most problematic
factors for exporting (Figure 2). Burdensome procedures, tariff and non-tariff barriers and corruption
at the border as listed as most severe obstacles to importing (Figure 4).
7.
The business climate has improved in Benin, but remains challenging. Benin’s ranking
increased by 4 places in the latest ranking of Doing Business indicators. This improvement reflects
progress in trading across borders by a full dematerialization of all pre-clearance documents
through an electronic platform at the port of Cotonou, in starting a business through introduction of
a one-stop shop, and in issuing construction permits. Paying taxes, inefficient bureaucracy,
corruption, and resolving disputes remain the main bottlenecks.

to have significant under-execution and governance issues;

Improving the access to financial services,
resolve problem banks quickly, and enhance
financial sector oversight; put in place
stronger supervision of microfinance

Progress in improving the access to finance through MFI’s;
Progress in resolution of problem banks after long delays;
Contingency plans for resolving banks have been developed;
Credit bureau legislation is pending in parliament; land title
reform pilot was completed but the system is still not
operational;
New agency for supervising microfinance was established,
but limited progress in cleaning up unauthorized MFIs;

Effective Implementation of the AML/CFT
regime.

The legal framework to combat money laundering in the
financial sector is in place; implementation needs to be

Decision point - point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country qualifies for
assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to be committed.
Interim assistance - amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance committed at
the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional circumstances).
Completion point - point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance
committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income as
defined in footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the implementation of
pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).
Implementation of Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief (PCDR): Not Applicable.
Exchange Arrangement:
Benin is a member of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The union’s common currency,
the CFA franc, is pegged to the Euro at a rate of CFAF 655.957 = EUR 1, consistent with the official
conversions rate of the French franc to the Euro and the previous fixed rate of the CFA franc to the
French franc of CFAF 100= F 1. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the WAEMU
countries has been reclassified to the category of conventional pegged arrangement from the
category of exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on
the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a
separate legal tender. The new classification thus only reflects a definitional change, and is not
based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other
policies of the currency union or its members. As of June 1, 1996, Benin and other members of
WEAMU accepted the obligations of Articles VIII, section2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of
Agreement. Benin’s exchange system has no restrictions on making payments or transfers for
current international transactions and the country does not engage in multiple currency practices.
Article IV Consultations:
The last completed Article IV consultation discussions were held in Cotonou during July 16–30, 2012.
The staff report (Country Report No 13/9; 1/11/13) and selected issues paper were discussed by the
Executive Board, concluding the 2012 Article IV consultation on November 9, 2012.
ROSC Assessment:
A Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) mission conducted the fiscal module of a Report on Observance of
Standards and Codes (ROSC) in May 2001. The mission recommended the adoption of a three-year
action plan containing measures to improve expenditure management. The mission also identified a
list of actions to be taken quickly to ensure that the authorities were able to monitor budget
execution. The ROSC fiscal transparency module for Benin was circulated to the Board on
June 6, 2002 (Country Report No. 02/217). In 2009, the World Bank conducted an Accounting and
Auditing ROSC, for which the report was published on April 18, 2009.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Benin: STATISTICAL ISSUES

As of October 2015
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Weaknesses exist in
the areas of national accounts, public finance, monetary statistics, financial sector prudential indicators, and
balance of payments.
National Accounts: Inadequate resources and weaknesses in data hamper the accuracy and reliability of the
national accounts. Efforts to address these shortcomings are ongoing. Benin participated in WAEMU’s
harmonization of statistical methodologies and in the GDDS project for AFRITAC West countries to implement
the 1993 SNA, and now intends to move to the 2008 SNA (by 2018). The West AFRITAC missions in 201115
sought to accelerate the process and support the compilation of the revised accounts, and assisted in rebasing
the national accounts from 1985 to 2007.
Price Statistics: Consumer price data, measured using the WAEMU harmonized consumer price index, are
adequate for surveillance. The methodology for the WAEMU harmonized consumer price index has been revised
to be consistent with other WAEMU countries with the assistance of AFRISTAT. The current index covers the
capital city only, but Benin is participating in a regional project aimed at extending the coverage of the CPI to
the whole country.
Government Finance Statistics: The quality of fiscal data is broadly adequate for surveillance, but has some
shortcomings in coverage, periodicity, timeliness, and accessibility. The authorities report budgetary central
government’s “statement of government operations” for publication in the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook one year after the reference year and report quarterly data for publication in the International
Financial Statistics. Benin is working toward implementing the new TOFE directive based on the Government
Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). Currently this TOFE is produced on a trial basis along with the TOFE
based GFSM 1986. The new TOFE will be implemented in January 2016. To that end, three tables are being
prepared: i) TOFE based GFSM 2001, ii) Statement of sources and uses of cash, and ii) statement of public debt
(at face value). The authorities are working as well to produce the TOFE using the Trial Balance as the source
data. The authorities have yet to expand the coverage of the TOFE to include all the subsectors of the general
government.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Monetary and financial statistics (MFS) are compiled and disseminated by
the regional Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO). The BCEAO does not report MFS data in the IMFrecommended format of standardized report forms (SRFs). Despite recent improvements, monetary statistics
continue to have shortcomings. These include inconsistencies in source data and lack of proper sectorization of
the domestic economy to ensure that the BCEAO adheres fully to the methodology of the Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual. The 2011, 2013, and 2014 STA missions to the BCEAO’s headquarters in Dakar,
Senegal, made a number of recommendations for addressing the above shortcomings. The missions also
assisted BCEAO staff in developing SRFs for the central bank accounts and initiated work on the SRF for
reporting the data of other depository corporations (ODCs).

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BENIN

Financial sector surveillance: Financial sector indicators are available with a significant lag, which makes
evaluating the state of the financial sector difficult. The BCEAO is participating in a three-year TA project on
financial soundness indicators (FSIs) for selected African, Asian, and Pacific countries funded by the Government
of Japan. The main objective of the JSA-FSI Project is to strengthen capacities of the participating countries to
compile and disseminate FSIs.
External sector statistics: Benin reports balance of payments and international investment position (IIP)
statistics to STA using the methodology of the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International
Investment Position Manual (BPM6) since 2011. The authorities have submitted 2013 balance of payments and
IIP data for publication in the 2015 Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY).
However, despite the recent improvements in applying the guidelines of BPM6, external statistics are still
affected by shortcomings that prevent an accurate and timely assessment of current account transactions and
capital and financial flows. In November 2004, a STA technical assistance mission noted that the human
resources devoted to balance of payments statistics by the national agency of the BCEAO were inadequate, and
highlighted a series of methodological problems including the use of untested hypotheses and reference bases,
the limited coverage of direct investment, and shortcomings in the compilation of net external assets and
international investment position. Balance of payments statistics are also disseminated with a lag of almost one
year and the international investment position data with a lag of 18 months. Some progress has been achieved
in the reconciliation of regional trade data with those of regional partners, and the compilation of trade statistics
has been enhanced by the installation of the ASYCUDA++ customs computer system in all main border customs
houses, the port, the airport, and some regional offices, which was further improved by the implementation of
ASYCUDA World with some improved features. Effective implementation of ASYCUDA World would further
enhance external trade statistics. However, the overall improvement depends largely on the sincerity of data
that reporters provide and the integrity of customs officers as regards recording correct information. Progress is
also needed in improving contacts with reporting bodies and enhancing the management of human and
technical resources. Financial account data can be improved by extending the coverage of foreign assets of the
private non-banking sector, expanding the surveys of residents’ foreign assets, and using other data source,
such as Bank of International Settlements (BIS) statistics. The BCEAO has updated the compilation of commercial
bank data on payments involving nonresidents; however, these data are not used to produce annual balance of
payments statistics.
External debt data are broadly adequate for surveillance, but are comprehensive only for central government
public debt. Data are collected by the Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement (CAA), which is responsible for signing
international loan agreements and servicing the government's external debt obligations. The CAA's database is
fairly comprehensive and up-to-date, and contains accurate stock data, but does not produce projections of
debt-service flows on a loan-by-loan basis. Regular statements are not received from creditors.
II.

Data Standards and Quality

The country is an e-GDDS participant. However,
most of its metadata, with the exception of the real
sector and socio-demographic meta data, have not
been updated since October 2002.

No data ROSC is available.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

Approved By
Abebe Aemro Selassie
and Peter Allum (IMF)
and John Panzer (IDA)

Prepared by staffs of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
and the International Development Association (IDA)1

This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) for Benin finds a low risk of debt distress, as in the 2012
DSA, but the margin from a moderate risk of debt distress has become thin. All projected external
debt indicators in the baseline and most indicators under stress tests remain below the policydependant thresholds. However, one indicator, the ratio of the PV of external debt to exports,
exceeds its threshold marginally and temporarily in the case of an extreme shock to exports, while
the debt-to-GDP ratio and all debt service indicators remain below thresholds. This mainly
reflects Benin’s high historical export volatility, and its membership in the West Africa Economic
and Monetary Union (WAEMU) assures its ability to pay in case of such a temporary shock.
Improving debt management is essential to contain risk at the low level. While total debt
indicators inclusive of domestic public debt confirm this conclusion, the fixed primary balance
scenario underscores that medium-term fiscal consolidation is needed to strengthen long-term
fiscal sustainability.

1

Prepared in collaboration with the Beninese authorities. The fiscal year for Benin is January 1–December 31.
The previous DSA update was completed in October 2012 (IMF Country Report No. 13/09).

BENIN

BACKGROUND AND KEY ASSUMPTIONS
1. Benin’s total public and external debt has remained low, thanks to sound fiscal policy and strong
growth during an IMF-supported program in 2010–14.2 Real GDP growth averaged 6½ percent in 2013–14,
closing a gap of 2 percentage points in per capita GDP growth with Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), while inflation
remained subdued. Meanwhile, prudent fiscal policy kept debt low. Total public debt in 2014 was 31 percent of
GDP,3 while external debt was 20 percent of GDP. These ratios compare favorably with other countries in the
West Africa Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), whose average public debt4 was about 40 percent of
GDP, and external debt about 36 percent of GDP in 2014. Going forward, growth is projected to exceed
5 percent in 2015 for the third consecutive year, and reach a similar level in 2016 despite the slowdown in
Nigeria—Benin’s neighbor and dominant trade partner. However, poverty remains high,5 and thus higher and
more inclusive growth is required to reduce it.
2. The Beninese authorities plan to scale up public investments to address infrastructure bottlenecks
and accelerate growth. The authorities convened a Round Table conference with donors and private sector
representatives in Paris in June 2014 and announced a public investment increase equivalent to about
18 percent of GDP in 2014–19. Most projects are in energy, transport, and rural infrastructure, while a few are
aimed at improving education and health services. Donor pledges were broadly in line with the authorities’
funding request, but significant uncertainties remain in disbursement and financing terms. The scale of the
investment increase has since been revised down to about 10 percent of GDP6 for 2015–20, using the “medium”
scenario in the authorities’ draft 2016 medium-term projections (Text Table 1). The planned scaling up did not
materialize in 2014 due to shortfalls in revenue and financing, and while investment execution has also been
low for the first eight month of 2015, the government continues to expects for 2015 an increase by 2½ percent
of GDP compared to the 2014 public-investment outturn. Around 1/3 of public investments from 2016 onward
are to be implemented by State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), while Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) have also
been planned.7 Furthermore, the authorities have committed to maintaining prudent fiscal policies and
advancing structural reforms to improve fiscal management and support private sector growth.

3. Despite some PFM weaknesses, increased investments would have a positive growth impact (Text
table 1). Benin’s governance indicators suggest that it can achieve a growth impact from higher investments
similar to what is discussed in the literature.8 The World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment
(CPIA) classifies Benin as having medium government capacity, and the latest CPIA component ratings related
to fiscal management compare Benin favorably with averages for SSA and WAEMU (Text Figure 1). The 2014
PEFA assessment scores Benin broadly in line with the SSA average, although the lack of improvement since
2007 indicates the need for accelerated reforms.9 In line with the literature, higher investments of 1 percentage
point is expected to increase growth by about 0.2 percentage point on average in 2015–20 compared with
projections at the sixth ECF review in June 2014 (Table 1 and Box 1). Medium-term growth is projected to
remain at about 6 percent until 2025, ¼ percentage point higher than the average outturn in 2012–14, and then
returns to about 4.8 percent.

negotiation and a few road projects financed off-budget. These projects have expected total debt-creating disbursement
of about 4 percent of GDP in 5 years, starting in 2016. However, no sufficient information is available on the planned PPPs
for analysis in the DSA.

investments.

4. This DSA assumes that central government investment is mainly financed by concessional
resources, but also includes some non-concessional borrowing. While the authorities continue to work
with potential financiers, progress has been achieved in mobilizing concessional financing. In particular, Benin
was found eligible for a second compact under the Millennium Challenge Account (estimated grant financing of
about US$ 375 million in 2016–21), which was signed in September 2015 with conditional disbursement
expected to begin in late 2016. For 2015–16, the authorities are planning to mainly rely on bond issuance in the
regional market to finance the increase in public investment. Also, about 2 percent of GDP in privatization
proceeds is expected in 2016–17. While the authorities plan to use some non-concessional borrowing, they
have committed that its size will be limited to ensure that the country’s risk of debt distress not exceed the
moderate level, with sufficient buffer. A projected total amount of about 4 percent of GDP in non-concessional
financing10 during 2016–20, to be channeled through SOEs, is included in the DSA to conservatively estimate
the potential impact on public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt.
5. The large size of the informal sector continues to complicate the DSA. Recent estimates indicate that
about 80 percent of Benin’s imports are subsequently informally re-exported to Nigeria. While the Central Bank
of West-African States’ (BCEAO) BOP statistics attempt to differentiate between re-exports and export
originating in Benin, this remains a possible source of statistical errors for the trade statistics, and could also be a
reason for the high export volatility recorded in the past.11

10

Based on available information, the grant element is estimated to be about 17 percent.

11

Overestimation of exports results in large residuals in the external DSA; the residual is projected to decline in the long
term.

BENIN

Box 1. Benin: Key Assumptions Underlying the DSA
The assumptions in the baseline scenario are consistent with the medium-term macroeconomic framework
underlying the Staff Report for the 2015 Article IV Consultation.
The authorities’ investment increase equivalent to 10 percent of GDP is fully implemented and matches the
average quality achieved in developing countries. No PPPs has been reflected for lack of information.
Growth impact: The projected increases in growth rates range from 0.5 percentage point in 2015 to an average
of 0.2 percentage points in 2016–20; the projected growth in 2021–24 is ¼ percentage point higher than the
2012–14 outturn and returns to 4.8 percent from 2025 onward. The projected growth rates also reflected lower
Nigeria growth as compared to projections in the 6th ECF review completed in 2014.
Inflation: Capital goods will be partly imported, and the effect on non-tradables would be muted by high
unemployment and labor mobility in WAEMU. CPI is projected to increase by up to 1 percentage point during
the scaling up but remain below the 3-percent WAEMU convergence criterion.
Fiscal impact: tax revenue is projected to be flat in 2015–16 but increase by 0.1 percent of GDP per year on
average in 2017–20 as the expected reforms in tax policy and administration mature.12 The primary deficit rises
temporarily with higher capital spending and then gradually returns to about 1 percent of GDP in the medium
term. In particular, privatization receipts and improved revenue reduces primary deficit from 5.1 percent to
2.9 percent from 2015 to 2018.
Current account impact: commensurate with the investment increase, the current account deficit is projected to
widen by about 1.5 to 2 percent of GDP in 2015–20 from the baseline given higher imports of capital goods.
The deficit returns to about 8 percent of GDP in the medium-term because export growth outpaces import
growth due to eased infrastructure bottlenecks and improved business environment, which support exports
(including non-traditional agricultural products, cement, and tourism) more strongly and reduce some imports
(e.g., electricity and cement).
Financing: The increase of central government investments of 5 percent of GDP is predominately financed by
concessional resources, with some domestic financing. Non-concessional PPG debt financing of about
4 percent GDP in 2016-20 is also included. Also, the recent rise of FDI in construction, manufacturing, and
services are projected to continue, in line with Benin’s recent achievements in improving its Doing Business
indicators, ranked among Top 10 most improved countries in 2013–15.

6. Risks to the baseline are to the downside. Main risks include weak external demand and soft
commodity prices in light of the fragile global recovery, particularly the recent slowdown in Nigeria driven by
lower oil prices. Also, achieving the expected growth and export impact requires the authorities to rigorously
implement structural reforms to improve PFM and the business environment. Furthermore, our assumptions on
non-concessional borrowing are conservative, and, for lack of information, no PPPs are yet included in the DSA,
even though some are under discussion. Finally, enhancing domestic revenue performance is essential to
reduce Benin’s dependence on the informal re-exports to Nigeria over time. Given the significant risk of lower
growth, a customized alternative scenario is included to compare the impact.

12

Recent IMF staff analysis finds that when benchmarked by regional peers, Benin has significant scope for raising tax
revenue, by about 2 percent of GDP, particularly through better domestic revenue mobilization. For example, tax
expenditure is estimated to be about 1 percent of GDP per year.

EXTERNAL AND PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
A.

External Debt Sustainability Analysis

7. The 2015 DSA results show that Benin continues to face a low risk of debt distress as in the 2012
DSA, but the margin toward a moderate risk of debt distress has become thin (Figure 1, Table 1 and 3). In
the baseline, all debt indicators remain below their relevant policy-dependent thresholds. The present value (PV)
of total PPG external debt is expected to rise from about 16 percent of GDP in 2015 to 18 percent of GDP in
2019 and then decline to about 16 percent of GDP in 2025 and 11 percent of GDP in 2035. The ratio would
remain below the corresponding threshold of 40 percent of GDP throughout the projection period. However,
one indicator, the ratio of the PV of external debt to exports, exceeds its threshold marginally and temporarily13
in the case of an extreme shock to exports, while the debt-to-GDP ratio and all debt service indicators remain
below thresholds. This mainly reflects Benin’s high historical export volatility14 despite more diversified recent
exports, while improved infrastructure and business environment will continue to boost net export and reduce
export volatility over time. Benin’s WAEMU membership assures its ability to pay in case of such a temporary
shock. The debt dynamic also exhibits some vulnerability to shocks in financing terms and a one-off CFA
depreciation, although all indicators remain below thresholds in the corresponding stress scenarios. Thus
overall, Benin’s risk of external debt distress is assessed to continue to be low,15 as in the 2012 DSA, although
further improving debt management is essential to contain risk at this level.
8. A customized downside scenario shows that Benin will face a moderate risk of debt distress (Text
Figure 2). This scenario assumes that Nigeria’s growth further deteriorates in the near term, and sluggish
structural reforms hamper private investment. Projected growth for 2016 declines by about ¾ percentage point
in 2016 and by about 1½ percentage points in 2020. While public investment remains the same, private
investment is projected to decline by about ¾ to 1½ percentage points in the same period. As a result, the PV
debt to exports ratio would exceed the threshold longer and by a larger margin in the shock scenario, which
indicates a moderate risk of debt distress. This suggests the importance of business environment reforms and
the need for prudent fiscal policy in light of the growth risk in Nigeria.

13

The ratio exceeds the threshold of 150 percent by an average of 7 percentage points for two years before it falls below
it and on a downward trajectory.
14

The export shock in the stress test is one standard deviation lower than the historical average export growth. For Benin,
the ratio of the standard deviation to average level of the export growth over the last 10 years is about 1.7 and thus
makes the shock particularly large relative to the baseline export growth. In contrast, the ratio is about 1 in the four
WAEMU countries for which 2014 DSAs are available (Burkina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire, Togo, and Senegal).
15

The risk rating is also found low using a probabilistic approach that reflects Benin-specific data in setting the thresholds.

Benin: Comparison of PV Debt-to-Exports Ratio
In a lower-growth risk scenario with growth reduced by about 1.2 percentage points per year on average in 2016-20,
the ratio exceeds threshold by a larger margin and for a longer period, indicating a moderate risk of debt distress. But
there is no qualitatively different results in other indicators in this lower-growth risk scenario.

B.

Public Debt Sustainability Analysis

9. Total public (external and domestic) debt is projected to rise moderately during the scaling up of
public investment and decline afterwards (Figure 2, Tables 2 and 4). The PV of debt to GDP ratio is projected
to rise from 29 percent in 2015 to 37 percent at the end of the scaling up in 2020 and then decline. The ratio
remains consistently below the indicative benchmark of 56 percent, a level that research has linked to increased
probability of debt distress.16 The debt level also remains below the WAEMU convergence criteria. In the most
extreme shock scenario, the peak PV of debt to GDP ratio exceeds 50 percent around 2025 only in the scenario
when primary balance is unchanged from 2015, while the peak debt service to revenue ratio remains below
30 percent. Nevertheless, these indicators show some vulnerability to shocks. In particular, the scenario under
fixed primary 2015 deficit exhibits a rising debt path and underscores the importance of medium-term fiscal
consolidation. Nevertheless, current dynamics in total public debt are consistent with a low risk of debt distress.

C.

Debt Management Capacity

10. The authorities’ recently started reforms to boost debt management capacity would also enhance
medium-term debt sustainability. Benin’s current debt monitoring capacity is assessed as weak. The reforms
include streamlining of the fragmented public debt management between the treasury and the debt
management agency—Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement (CAA), in line with recent IMF TA recommendations.
In particular, the authorities plan to enhance CAA’s capacity for more comprehensive and timely debt recording,
and extend the coverage of debt monitoring, including key SOEs that undertake significant investment projects.
The capacity to fully analyze the impact of non-concessional borrowing needs to be enhanced to avoid
increasing the risk of debt distress. In this context, a planned joint World Bank/IMF mission on Medium-Term
Debt Strategy in November 2015 is expected to assist their efforts.

CONCLUSION
11. The updated DSA shows that Benin continues to face a low risk of debt distress with the planned
scaling up of public investment, if accompanied by sufficient structural reforms, but the margin with a
moderate risk of debt distress has become thin. While most debt indicators remain below the corresponding
thresholds, one indicator—PV of debt-to-export ratio—exceeds its threshold marginally and temporarily in an
extreme shock scenario. The inclusion of domestic public debt in the analysis also confirms the conclusion.
Achieving the expected salutary impact of the scaling up of public investment requires that the authorities
continue to pursue prudent fiscal policies and pro-growth structural reforms, including in mobilizing domestic
revenue and improving PFM and the business environment. Medium-term fiscal consolidation is also needed to
support long-term fiscal sustainability. Finally, risks to this baseline DSA are to the downside.
12. The authorities agree with the staff’s conclusions. They concur that debt sustainability will depend
crucially on quality public investments, progress in reforms to support competitiveness and exports in the
private sector, and a sound fiscal policy, which includes mobilizing more domestic revenue and prudent
borrowing mainly through concessional financing. They also committed to enhancing debt management
capacity to further minimize the risk of debt distress.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION—
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
1.
This supplement reports on fiscal developments since the staff report
(SM/15/290) was issued.
2.
Compared to projections in the staff report, the third quarter turned out
more expansionary due to higher recurrent spending, while the government’s
objective to sharply increase investment spending was partly missed. The endSeptember fiscal deficit reached 5.6 percent of GDP (cash basis, excluding grants),
exceeding projections by 1.2 percentage points of GDP, mostly due to higher wage bill,
pensions, and transfers. While externally-financed investment was higher than foreseen,
continued under-execution of domestically-financed investment underlines capacity
constraints described in the staff report. Somewhat weaker than projected customs
revenues also contributed to the higher deficit, which was financed through government
bonds in the regional financial market.
3.
The planned additional placement of government bonds discussed in the
staff report (Paragraphs 6, 12, 22, and 35) has materialized in the government’s
announcement to issue CFAF 250 billion (about 5 percent of GDP) in the regional
financial market. The first issuance took place in early December, soliciting
CFAF 150 billion at a rate of 6.5 percent, with a maturity of 7 years and a grace period of
2 years. Over-subscriptions led the government to keep CFAF 165 billion. The second is
planned for mid-December for CFAF 100 billion, at a rate of 6.25 percent, with a maturity
of 5 years and a grace period of 3 years. These terms show higher rates, but also longer
maturities than earlier issuances.
4.
While part of this amount is related to the government decision to mobilize
liquidity to clear de facto arrears (now reported by the government at about
2 percent of GDP), the authorities explained that the rest is meant to assure
budget execution going forward. In this context, the authorities underlined their
intention to meet short-term obligations to banks contrary to information received by
staff (Paragraph 6). Instead, they emphasized concern that early-2016 presidential
elections could complicate budget financing in the first quarter. The large bond
placement in December will allow smooth execution of priority spending in early-2016,
including election spending. According to the authorities, the issuances planned in the
2016 budget would be reduced commensurately, and overall 2016 budget aggregates
would remain broadly unchanged. The authorities viewed the potential impact on the

BENIN

banking system as benign, as the government’s clearance of de facto arrears has a
positive effect on banks’ balance sheets, and banks would be able to use bonds
obtained as collateral for BCEAO refinancing.
5.
Based on these developments, staff reiterated that the rising reliance on
domestic financing increases costs and risks for the budget, but also expressed
concern about the realism of spending projections for 2015 and 2016. While
welcome from the perspective of clearing de facto arrears, the switch to domestic
financing raises costs compared to concessional external financing. It also further
increases banks’ already high sovereign exposure and dependence on BCEAO
refinancing. Budget execution during the third quarter not only deepens concerns
regarding the realism of the authorities’ investment spending projections, but adds
concerns that the cash from the bond issuances could be used for recurrent spending.
While information made available by the government is insufficient to provide revised
projections for the fourth quarter and 2015 full year, the overrun in recurrent spending
and prospects for higher-than-projected arrears clearance could lead to a higher 2015
deficit than presented in the staff report. The DSA is not significantly affected by the
different timing and terms of budget financing relative to that projected in the staff
report. Finally, the amount of de facto arrears underscores the urgent need to improve
fiscal reporting.

Statement by Mr. Yambaye, Executive Director for Benin,
and Mr. Nguema-Affane, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
December 11, 2015
On behalf on my Beninese authorities, I would like to thank Management and staff for the
continued advice and technical assistance provided to them in their ongoing development
efforts. They are particularly appreciative of the valuable contribution of the Fund in the
organization of a conference in Cotonou in June 2014. The objective of the conference was to
identify priority structural reforms that would boost growth over the medium-term in the
context of their new national development plan rolled out in 2014.
The national development plan envisages, among others, a scaling-up of public investment
between 2014 and 2018, in the context of a structural investment program, which focuses on
upgrading physical infrastructure, notably in the energy and transport sectors and through
PPPs. In this regard, the Beninese authorities organized in June 2014 a roundtable in Paris
with donors and private investors to mobilize public and private financing for the
implementation of the investment program. They secured a US$375-million financing from
the Millenium Challenge Corporation in September 2015 to strengthen Benin’s national
utility, attract private sector investment, and fund infrastructure investments in electric
generation and distribution as well as off-grid electrification for poor and unserved
households.
The present staff report gives a good account of the discussions held in Cotonou and of the
authorities’ medium-term financial and economic policies. My Beninese authorities
appreciate the focus of the Selected Issues Paper on the financial sector’s contribution to
sustainable economic growth. They also welcome the policy recommendations of the
systematic growth and fiscal analysis recently carried out by staff on ways to pursue the
envisaged investment program without jeopardizing the country’s solid macroeconomic
performance.
I. Recent Developments
Real GDP growth is slowing down in 2015 but is expected to remain high at more that
5 percent for the third consecutive year. The lower growth reflects the impact of bad weather
conditions and the economic slowdown in Nigeria, Benin’s main trading partner. Growth was
driven by the higher public investment. Inflation remained subdued despite a pickup in food
prices due to adverse weather conditions.
The fiscal position deteriorated due to higher expenditures, notably investment spending, and
lower financing. Revenues, however, are projected to remain stable but delays in the
privatization of the telecom companies and in donor funding constrained the financing of the
budget for 2015. My Beninese authorities reacted to these developments by slowing down

2
the pace of public investment. Yet, total capital expenditures will be higher than in 2014. As
staff noted, payment arrears increased despite cuts in spending. Public debt increased in 2014
and 2015 along with higher investment but Benin continues to face a low risk of debt distress
as described in the DSA report.
To address the revenue shortfalls, my authorities are placing two bond issues in December
2015. The resources mobilized will be used, among others, to catch up delays in investment
spending, clear payment arrears and finance part of the 2016 budget, notably the cost of the
presidential election scheduled for March 2016. These actions will lay the ground for a
meaningful reform of treasury processes that aim at reducing payment delays and help
preserve the stability of the financial sector.
The implementation of the fiscal reforms continued although at slower than anticipated pace.
Positive developments in this area include the introduction of electronic tax payments, the
establishment of a one-stop window for business and tax registration for micro and small
firms, and the upgrading of IT systems in the tax and customs administrations. In addition
other reforms to strengthen tax policy and public financial management are advancing well.
Following the uncovered fraud scheme in a donor-financed project, my authorities have
strengthened the framework for combating corruption and improved transparency with
notably the preparation of an anti-corruption action plan and the establishment of a Bureau of
Auditor General. The improvement of the debt management framework has started with the
issuance of a decree on public debt policy and debt management strategy, the delineation of
debt management competences between the debt management agency (CAA) and the
Treasury, and the reorganization of the CAA along front-middle-back office lines, in line
with recent Fund technical assistance recommendations. The progress made in facilitating
business registration and streamlining processes at the port and customs translated into an
improved ranking in the last World Bank’s Doing Business report.
The financial sector remains broadly stable, although vulnerabilities increased, notably in the
banking sector, according to the latest stress tests. The capital adequacy ratio remains above
8 percent and non-performing loans in the banking sector remained high at 21.9 percent in
2014 and 21.5 percent at end-June 2015. Good progress is being made to resolve the two
banks in difficulties, in cooperation with the regional banking commission. The banks’
exposure to sovereign risks through holding of government bonds is rising as banks seek to
benefit from the 3-percent interest margin between the sovereign bond rate and the central
bank refinancing rate to improve their bottom line.
The microfinance sector has experienced a strong growth, partly due to the expansion of
unauthorized microfinance institutions (MFIs). To address financial stability concerns arising
from high credits at risks in the authorized MFIs, my Beninese authorities have taken
measures to enhance supervision of that sector through notably the assignment of supervision
of largest MFIs to the WAEMU Banking Commission and the central bank (BCEAO).

3
Moreover, they upgraded the Ministry of finance’s directorate responsible for supervising
smaller MFIs into a new agency in 2015. In addition, they have set up an inter-ministerial
committee to identify and shut down unauthorized MFIs.
II. Policies for the medium-term
My Beninese authorities remain committed to maintain prudent policies over the mediumterm. Nevertheless, they recognize that sustaining the current level of growth over the
medium term and make it more inclusive will be challenging especially as the country is still
highly dependent on developments in Nigeria and weather conditions. In addition, poverty
remains high despite the progress made in improving some social indicators in the past years.
Going forward, my authorities intend to pursue the implementation of the investment
program over the next few years. They remain convinced that a pickup in investment is
needed to close the infrastructure gaps and remove bottlenecks to growth. They will use the
fiscal space generated by prudent fiscal policy in the past to accommodate higher capital
expenditures while preserving debt sustainability. They will pursue concomitantly the
implementation of structural reforms aimed at strengthening public financial management
and improving the business climate, in order for the planned incremental investment
spending to yield the anticipated growth dividend.
My authorities remain committed to a sustainable fiscal policy. They agree with staff that
achieving a successful investment surge, and reducing vulnerabilities stemming from Nigeria
and further trade liberalization will require making greater strides in the implementation of
fiscal reforms. In this regard, they will step up their efforts to increase domestic revenue
mobilization through the strengthening of the cooperation between the tax and customs
administrations to take full advantage of the unique tax identification number and the
elimination of tax exemptions starting in 2016. They will also continue to address the
weaknesses identified in the 2014 PEFA, including cash forecasting and management, public
procurement, and audit.
My authorities will pursue a prudent debt management policy. Improved revenue
performance and public financial management will help limit their recourse to the regional
capital market for investment finance. As these reforms will take time to bear results, the
authorities will continue, in the meantime, to seize the opportunity provided by the strong
investor appetite for government bonds and low interest rates to raise financing for
investment. In addition, they will take advantage of the increased demand for securities with
long maturities to improve the maturity structure of government debt and will remain
mindful of the impact of the debt strategy on the health of the domestic financial sector. That
said, the government’s debt strategy gives priority to securing concessional financing when
available. They will continue the debt management reforms initiated in 2015.

4
My authorities will continue to strengthen the financial sector. The strengthening of the
financial sector regulatory and supervisory framework is the responsibility of regional
institutions in the WAEMU region, including the WAEMU Commission and the BCEAO. As
noted during the last Board meeting on WAEMU in April 2015, the regional authorities are
taking steps to upgrade that framework to international standards. In particular, the regional
deposit insurance scheme for both banks and MFIs has been developed and the deposit
insurance agency is about to become operational. More recently, the WAEMU Council of
Ministers adopted a few decisions including the development of a harmonized regional
resolution framework and the BCEAO’s adherence to the Alliance for Financial Inclusion
(AFI) which is a global network of financial policymakers from developing and emerging
countries working together to increase access to appropriate financial services for the poor.
My authorities recognize that vulnerabilities in the financial sector have increased as
evidenced by the recent stress tests. Policies going forward will be geared towards ensuring
continued banks’ compliance with the regional regulations and directives while fostering
greater financial inclusion. Specifically, they will continue to closely monitor banks and
ensure that they meet the new (higher) minimum capital requirements, in accordance with the
WAEMU directive. On the higher loan concentration, my authorities note that this is
symptomatic of developing countries with shallow financial markets and a large informal
sector. Nevertheless, they will ensure that related prudential norms are fully enforced. Efforts
will be pursued to enforce regulations in the microfinance sector, following the division of
supervisory powers between the BCEAO and the government’s new MFI agency. Likewise
the implementation of the legislative and regulatory framework for AML/CFT will continue.
Structural reforms aimed at improving the business climate and enhancing financial sector’s
support to private sector development will be pursued. In particular, further strides are being
made to advance land titling throughout the country, notably through the use of electronic
title registration. A draft legislation establishing a credit bureau that was prepared jointly
with the BCEAO is expected to be adopted next year. Likewise, the judicial reform will be
accelerated.
Under these envisaged policies, economic prospects for 2016 and the medium-term look
positive. Growth is projected to remain high at more than 5 percent over the medium-term on
the back of sustained high public investment and satisfactory progress in the implementation
of the reform agenda. My authorities are cognizant of the risks to this outlook stemming from
adverse developments in Nigeria, delays in the implementation of structural reforms and
increasing vulnerabilities in the financial sector. They believe that their medium-term
policies will contribute to reduce those risks.
