STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION, SIXTH
June 10, 2013

REVIEW UNDER THE POLICY SUPPORT INSTRUMENT, REQUEST
FOR A THREE-YEAR POLICY SUPPORT INSTRUMENT AND
CANCELLATION OF CURRENT POLICY SUPPORT INSTRUMENT

KEY ISSUES
Context, outlook, and risks. Macroeconomic performance remains strong and
program implementation satisfactory. Economic growth continues to be broad-based,
with a boom in mining due to the start-up of coal production and exports.
Fiscal policy and debt sustainability. The revised budget is in line with the mediumterm fiscal strategy, while addressing the impact of severe floods in early 2013. The
authorities‘ fiscal strategy envisages a gradual move to domestic primary surpluses
while keeping external borrowing within the bounds of debt sustainability against the
backdrop of an increasing contribution of mineral resources to the economy.
External sustainability. The external current account deficit is and will remain wide in
the medium term, funded by large FDI and privately-financed mining operations.
International reserves are adequate though need to keep up with the steady growth in
the economy and imports beyond mining activities. The DSA update moves
Mozambique from low to moderate risk of debt distress, reflecting the new potential
and risks implied by the exploration and prospective liquefaction of natural gas.
Program issues. Staff recommends waivers for nonobservance of the end-December
2012 assessment criteria on net credit to the government and reserve money, and
completion of the sixth PSI review. Staff supports the authorities‘ request for a new
three-year PSI to maintain macroeconomic stability and target poverty reduction
through: (i) capacity building in economic management; (ii) more focused priority
spending; (iii) enhanced debt management; (iv) financial sector efficiency; and
(v) improvements in the business climate and competitiveness.
Article IV. Discussions focused on ensuring sustainable macroeconomic policies and
inclusive growth over the medium term, while strengthening natural resource
management. The last Article IV consultation was completed in June 2011.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PROGRAM PERFORMANCE
A. Macroeconomic Developments
1.
The Mozambican economy registered strong growth in 2012, but
floods in early 2013 have diminished prospects slightly. Preliminary data
MEFP ¶2
suggest that real GDP rose by 7.4 percent in 2012. This was broad-based and
led by the start-up of coal production and exports, agriculture, construction and financial services. In
early 2013, severe floods destroyed agricultural crops in the South and severely damaged
infrastructure (roads, railways and the power transmission line to South Africa). Real GDP is
nevertheless projected to grow by 7 percent in 2013 reflecting a further boost in coal exports with
improvements in rail transport capacity and the implementation of other large infrastructure
projects.

by banks‘ perception of a paucity of safe
lending opportunities in the private sector. Despite some mopping up of liquidity in late 2012, the
BM could not fully neutralize the effect of higher-than-programmed bank deposits at the central
bank on reserve money. The assessment criterion was missed by Mt 1 billion or 3 percent of reserve
money, which is a minor deviation relative to the large uncertainties affecting money demand. The
corresponding indicative target for March 2013 was also exceeded (by Mt 1.6 billion or 4 percent of
reserve money) against the backdrop of a weak cash return to the banking system in the post-flood
period, and large accumulation of government deposits in commercial banks.
5.
Net international reserves (NIR) exceeded program targets in 2012, but fell back in
early 2013. Reserve accumulation in 2012 exceeded the end-year target slightly and gross reserves
reached $2.8 billion. However, in early 2013 flood-related lower exports and higher imports and
delays in aid disbursements ($45 million against $194 million) resulted in a drawdown of NIR by
about $0.3 billion to 3.8 months coverage of 2013 non-megaproject imports, below the end-March
indicative target.

C. Fiscal response
6.
Fiscal performance was largely consistent with the program in 2012, notwithstanding
higher capital spending and some overrun in bank credit to the government late in the year.
Revenue was slightly below the indicative target as one-off capital gains tax receipts offset
therevenue impact of lower-than-expected inflation and transition problems in customs with the
introduction of a single trade window in the second quarter. However, an overrun in grant-financed
investment and spending on special programs late in the year led the overall deficit and government
domestic borrowing (NCG) to exceed their end-year targets. The authorities took some corrective
action to tighten expenditure control. Priority spending exceeded its indicative target at end-2012,
reflecting the authorities‘ continued efforts to implement their poverty reduction strategy.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUN 5

7.
Fiscal performance in early 2013 reflected a number of different factors. The
government restrained other current expenditure in favor of emergency spending on flood
mitigation, but protected priority spending (March indicative target was met). It limited externallyfinanced capital spending when some donor budget support was delayed over governance concern1
(generating a $150 million shortfall). Donor support should resume with the remedial actions being
taken by the authorities. Fiscal revenue, boosted by large capital gains windfall receipts ($224 million), significantly exceeded the March indicative target. These factors combined to a much lowerthan-programmed flow of NCG in the first quarter (target met).

D. Structural Reforms
8.
The authorities continued their structural reform agenda and focused on debt
management and financial stability and development (see Table 9). The structural benchmark on
adopting an Annual Domestic Borrowing Plan was met on time in January. The submission to the
Council of Ministers of the draft Financial Sector Development Strategy (FSDS) was delayed to
March and swiftly approved thereafter. The Financial Sector Contingency Plan was approved by the
BM in early April and implementation is starting.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
9.
Mozambique’s medium-term growth outlook remains strong.
Growth across sectors is projected to remain vigorous at 8.5 percent in 2014,
with strong medium-term stimuli provided by a rebound in agriculture
(reflecting both productivity increases and an expansion of arable land under cultivation) and
infrastructure investments and the start of construction of a gas liquefaction plant (LNG). Inflation is
expected to remain contained in the absence of major food or fuel price shocks and continued
prudent monetary policy.
10.
The external outlook reflects the need for massive investments in the next few years
to commercialize natural gas reserves. The external current account deficit is projected at around
40 percent of GDP during the initial 4-5 year construction phase of the LNG plant starting in 2014,
financed largely by FDI and private commercial borrowing. As improvements in rail transport
capacity allow more coal exports over time, and once LNG exports start around 2020, exports would
rise sharply and the current account deficit would decline. With the completion of the LNG plant
likely by 2023, imports should also see a steep decline, further lowering the external current account
deficit to more sustainable levels.
11.
Risks to this outlook stem from both the global and domestic environments (see Box
1). Mozambique has been relatively isolated from the global recession as its interconnections with
neighboring countries are mainly of a logistical nature for hinterland countries. Its trade with the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

region is centered on South Africa, and exports (mainly electricity) and imports (food and
manufactured goods) have been fairly steady and not shown significant spillovers. While Portuguese
banks dominate the Mozambican banking sector, they are funded locally and operations are largely
separated from developments in Portugal. Nonetheless, Mozambique is exposed to risks of climate
disasters, commodity price shocks for its major export or import commodities (coal, gas, fuel), and
the impact of a decline in donor funding. Domestic risks include delays in upgrading transport
infrastructure, especially railways and ports, electricity supply constraints, and policy slippages in the
context of the November 2013 municipal and October 2014 presidential elections. Nevertheless,
there are strong mitigating factors: financial support from BRICs is increasing, prospects for coal
production and exports are bright, as well as for continued strong FDI inflows in several
megaprojects, including LNG development.
12.
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s assessment of the outlook and
associated risks and policy options. While acknowledging that the impact of high economic
growth on poverty reduction had been limited in recent years, they emphasized that poverty
reduction and more inclusive growth were the main pillars of their economic strategy. Their strategy
includes: continued macroeconomic stability; faster progress in reforms to enhance competitiveness
and improve the business environment; and continued high investment in social sectors (health,
education and job training) and infrastructure (transport, water and electricity).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ARTICLE IV DISCUSSIONS
13.
Discussions centered on the appropriate fiscal and monetary policies for 2013 and the medium
term, given the strong foreign-financed investment stream and the need to facilitate credit to the
economy in the context of emerging moderate inflationary pressures. Optimizing the benefits from the
increasing contribution of the extractive industry to the economy was also at the core of discussions.
14.
The government’s economic policies have been implemented in line with its mediumterm agenda and were broadly consistent with Fund advice during the 2011 Article IV
consultation. The authorities and the staff generally agreed on the appropriate macroeconomic
policy stance and the focus of the structural reform agenda. These were consistent with the
government‘s 2010–13 PSI-supported economic program focused on maintaining macroeconomic
stability, promoting infrastructure investment, capacity building, and fostering inclusive growth.
Progress toward these objectives has been good regarding macro-economic performance and the
PSI-supported program is on track with all reviews completed on schedule. Mozambique has been
declared compliant with the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) in October 2012.
Capacity building is ongoing thanks to an extensive technical assistance program involving IFIs and
donors.
15.
The 2013 Article IV discussions focused on the development agenda and appropriate
policy priorities to successfully transition to a resource-rich era. These include skillful mediumterm management of the impact of developing coal and gas resources and high public investment
spending on growth, external competitiveness and, through increased commercial borrowing, on
debt sustainability and investment planning. These priorities are consistent with the government‘s
2010-2014 plan (Plano Quinquenal do Governo), its long-term vision described in the Agenda 2025,
and are supporting the 2011-14 Poverty Reduction Strategy (PARP). All aim at maintaining
macroeconomic stability, investing in infrastructure and social sectors, fostering inclusive growth,
and building capacity in various areas.

A. Preparing for Natural Resource Management
16.
The authorities and staff discussed how to adapt macroeconomic management to the
demands of a resource rich economy. Preliminary estimates suggest that coal and natural gas
production could potentially boost growth by 2 percentage points annually during 2013-23. While
fiscal revenues from megaprojects will remain moderate in the short and medium term, revenues could
reach a quarter of total fiscal revenues in the longer run, mostly from the natural gas sector.2

See Appendix III.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 9

012 THE REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

17.
The authorities and staff shared the view that while major
MEFP ¶6, 24-29
public and private investment is necessary to realize the extractive
industry’s potential, related fiscal revenues are expected to remain
modest for a decade. Confirmed coal deposits and natural gas reserves make the country a
potential leading exporter, and hydropower potential is vast. The investments required to fully
exploit this potential are very large relative to the size of the economy, either for LNG (about
$40 billion or 2.7 times 2012 GDP) or for other large projects, including railroads, ports, power
generation and transmission. As regular resource revenue will grow only gradually, exceeding
current aid flows ($1.2 billion in 2012) only in a decade, staff advised the authorities to continue to
prudently manage public expectations.

18.
Strengthening revenue forecasting in the context of a natural resource rich
environment would help to guide the formulation of a fiscal policy strategy. While the
revenues stemming from gas production and exports will be generated only in a decade, coal
revenues have started to make a contribution to the country‘s tax revenue/GDP ratio. Tax policy
should evolve in line with the changing structure of the economy. Combined revenue from coal and
LNG is projected to reach 9 percent of non-coal, non-LNG GDP by 2030, or about a quarter of all
government revenue. The medium-term fiscal strategy should evolve to distinguish ―core revenues‖
from resource revenue (e.g. royalties) and other one-off receipts (e.g. capital gains taxes).
19.
The authorities concurred that continued capacity building will enable the country to
reap the benefits from the mining and hydrocarbon activities. Staff encouraged the authorities
to continue strengthening internal proficiency in regulatory and fiscal frameworks, macroeconomic
and fiscal projections, as well as assessing and optimizing the impact of megaprojects and any
financial government participation in them. This is all the more critical at the present juncture: the
new mining and petroleum legislation, which is before Parliament, will need to be transposed into
10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

regulations and implemented, and a revision of the fiscal regimes of the mining and hydrocarbon
sectors is underway with technical assistance from the IMF and others.
20.
Ensuring high transparency in all aspects of the resource sector is essential.
Mozambique has gained international recognition in complying with the EITI; the coverage of its
reports on extractive industry payments and government receipts has been expanded from 6 to 46
enterprises, and payments reported by mining companies correspond very closely to receipts
recorded by the government. Staff noted that transparency of contracts, regulation, taxation and
revenues builds confidence and allows for checks and balances to secure a fair share of resource
wealth for corporate partners, the government and the population at large.
21.
The authorities agreed with the staff’s analysis and are determined to further enhance
macro-management capacity. Improvements in statistics on production and economic sectors are
ongoing. Inter-institutional coordination is being strengthened to deepen economic analysis and
the basis for policy formulation.

B. Fiscal Policy
22.
The government’s objective to maintain elevated spending on
public investment and social development, while maintaining
MEFP ¶15-20
macroeconomic stability, is appropriate. The authorities‘ fiscal anchor
implies a gradual improvement in the domestic primary balance from a deficit of 2¾ percent of GDP
in 2013 to a small surplus in 2017, while keeping borrowing, particularly externally on commercial
terms, within the bounds of debt sustainability (see IMF-World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis).
Even with an expected gradual decline in external concessional funding as a share of GDP, the
overall deficit after grants would remain at 5–8 percent of GDP per year, underpinned by a revenue
objective, and could be financed by modest commercial foreign borrowing (1-2 percent of GDP) and
some domestic borrowing (up to about 1 percent of GDP).
23.
A rule for the use of revenue windfalls should be established. Fiscal
risks are currently on the upside; a capital gains tax revenue stemming from
MEFP ¶17
the sale of stakes among investors received in early 2013 ($224 million;
1.5 percent of GDP) is funding the supplementary budget for 2013. It allows mostly for investment
spending in post-flood reconstruction and resettlements in the context of infrastructure projects.
More such windfalls could materialize in 2013, and the authorities may consider establishing an
explicit rule for spending these on infrastructure, either directly or through state-owned enterprises,
and debt reduction, including accelerating the clearing of VAT refund arrears.3
24.
The VAT administration and refund process needs to be reformed. The budget records
VAT on a gross basis and includes an allowance for VAT refunds as an expenditure item. Staff
3

Existing legislation allows the use of actual revenue in excess of budgeted amounts for debt reduction or
investment.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 11

012 THE REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

emphasized that a true VAT is inherently net of refunds, and adjusted its analytical presentation
accordingly in line with best practice.



The budget should record VAT revenue on a net basis, ensuring
timely payment of VAT refunds. The authorities agreed to devise a
MEFP ¶23
comprehensive action plan to modernize the VAT administration and
overall refund process by October, drawing on IMF technical assistance. They thought that they
could only gradually move to net VAT budgeting and envisaged it for the 2015 budget.



Unsettled VAT refund requests have accumulated and at end-2012
reached 1.3 percent of 2013 GDP, representing a cost to the private
MEFP ¶17
sector. Staff urged the authorities to settle this backlog. The authorities
agreed that possible additional windfall revenue in 2013 could be applied towards clearing this.

25.
Consistent with their poverty reduction strategy, the authorities continue to prioritize
spending towards infrastructure and social development while limiting fiscal risks. Two thirds
of budgetary spending is in priority sectors.



Containing the public wage bill. The lion share of the wage bill goes
MEFP ¶18, 21
to education and its increase reflects significant new hiring in priority
sectors in recent years, including education and health, and efforts to
decompress wage scales in the civil service. The wage bill in the 2013 revised budget
(10.8 percent of GDP) absorbs ½ of current spending. The government recognizes the need to
slow down the decompression of the salary scales and the pace of recruitment in non-priority
areas and aims to contain the wage bill at around 8.5 percent of GDP in the medium term. It
continues to align the multiple payroll systems used and move forward the rollout of the
electronic payroll system (e-Folha) and the integrated civil service database (e-CAF). Staff
suggested also to develop a system to link compensation to results.



Prioritizing public investments. Mozambique has a high rate of public
MEFP ¶22
investment (nearly 15 percent of GDP) of which more than half is
financed domestically. The authorities are working to strengthen their
project selection and economic profitability analysis capacity, and to assess the impact of related
borrowing on public debt. The Ministry of Planning of Development is preparing an Integrated
Investment Program in this perspective, and is working with line ministries to apply the new
manual for the appraisal and evaluation of public investments projects.



Managing public enterprises. Following the adoption of the Public
Enterprises Act (Law 6/2012 of February 2012), state-owned enterprises‘
MEFP ¶30-32
investment and borrowing plans need to be approved by the sector
ministry and the Ministry of Finance. The government will also enforce the publication of the
annual reports of large state-owned companies. Staff suggested to improve transparency of the
government‘s financial relations (including transfers and debt forgiveness) with public

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

enterprises. It should limit subsidies to state enterprises, and monitor closely their financial
participation in large infrastructure projects to contain fiscal risks.



Transparency of energy subsidies. Electricity tariffs are below costMEFP ¶20
recovery levels and the financial situation of the electricity company
(EDM) is deteriorating. The government has provided transfers through cancellation of on-lent
loans and a new management contract is under negotiation. However, a tariff study has
suggested a restructuring of and increases in tariffs, keeping costs to low-income consumers
low. The proposals are expected to be presented to the Council of Ministers soon. Staff
suggested that the government should cover investment costs of the rural electrification
program and its own use of electricity (e.g. municipal street lighting), and gradually adjust tariffs
to cost recovery levels. A sound financial footing for EDM would help attract investors to the
sector‘s massive expansion plans and improve access to electricity, which currently reaches only
38 percent of the population and hinders business development. The government maintains
administered prices for fuels, cross-subsidizing the consumption of fuel outside the megaprojects.
It determines compensation payments to fuel importers based on a market-linked pricing
formula. The 2013 budget includes 0.3 percent of GDP in payments to importers. Staff noted
that differentiated pricing for diesel provides incentives for corruption and distorts price signals;
the price-setting formula should be applied to the retail prices of all petroleum products.



Social protection. The government has substantially increased the
budget for social protection (0.4 percent of GDP in the budget for 2013).
MEFP ¶19
It plans to increase the allocation further over the medium term, while
better targeting beneficiaries, including establishing a consolidated electronic registry, and
coordinating the allocation system.

26.
The authorities generally concurred with staff’s analysis, but pointed to political
economy constraints. They noted that reform efforts are under way in many areas and need time
to show results. Staff encouraged the authorities to communicate more publicly about the need for
reforms, and the government‘s plans to address the challenges, especially with respect to civil
service compensation and energy pricing.

Box 2. Social Protection Floor in Mozambique
Social protection is an essential ingredient in
Mozambique’s poverty reduction strategy
(PARP). The scheme is designed to address both
the sheer level of poverty (over half of the
population live below the poverty line), and the
country‘s exposure to economic and climatic
shocks that undermine and often reverse efforts
to enhance skills and enable the poor to move
out of low-productivity sectors, especially
subsistence agriculture. Social protection can
mitigate these risks, further social and human
development and thus allow for more inclusive
growth.
The government has made significant
progress in establishing the legal and
institutional framework for a national social
protection floor. A 2007 Social Protection Law
set the legal and institutional framework with
broad components (social transfers, health,
education, and social inclusion through work)
defined in the 2010 National Strategy for Basic
Social Security (ENSBB). New social protection
programs created in 2011 expanded the ENSSB
into a comprehensive social safety net consisting
of a cash transfer program, targeting extremely
poor households with no able-bodied income
earner and a direct employment program in
public works projects.

Spending on social protection has increased
significantly in recent years. It has risen from
around $13 million in 2008 to $57 million under
the 2013 budget (0.4 percent of GDP). The
government intends to increase budgetary
appropriations to 0.8 percent of GDP over the
medium term, reach around 0.9 million
beneficiaries, and raise the level of cash
transfers to bring recipients to the poverty line.
Work is on-going to address numerous
implementation challenges. With the support
of the World Bank, the UN system, and other
development partners, the government is
developing a common targeting system that
combines geographical identification with
community targeting to minimize exclusion
errors and a proxy means-test instrument to
minimize inclusion errors; a single registry of
beneficiaries, and an information management
system. Payment procedures are to be
outsourced to commercial banks and mobile
operators. Most systems are expected to be
operational by 2014. Capacity is also being built
at the district level. The creation of a common
fund to secure further donor resources is under
discussion.

C. Debt Management and Borrowing Strategy
27.
External borrowing has risen significantly since 2012, especially on commercial terms.
The government has increased its use of external non-concessional financing to fund several
infrastructure investments. Combined with the major structural changes in the BOP due largely to
the recent gas exploration and LNG investments, the current debt sustainability analysis (DSA) is
moving the country from an outlook of low to moderate risk of debt distress. The authorities plan to
continue public infrastructure investment at a high level, and have requested a new NCB ceiling
based on the prospective contracting of new loans and the DSA outlook. Staff estimates that, at the
current 3 percent discount rate, a new ceiling of $2 billion over the next 3 years is consistent with
maintaining debt sustainability.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

28.
Staff modeled alternative approaches to public investment scaling up. Applying a new
quantitative tool designed to analyze the effects of alternative paths of public investment scaling-up
in resource-abundant developing countries4, shows that a gradual scaling up that anticipates some
future LNG revenue would be appropriate in the case of Mozambique, and is consistent with the
assumptions in the DSA. An aggressive scaling up approach is not likely to yield better growth
outcomes than a more gradual approach due to absorptive capacity constraints, and could put debt
sustainability at risk (see Appendix V).
29.
Strengthening debt management and project selection is a
strategic priority. The authorities have made some progress in making
MEFP ¶22
debt management more forward-looking. Yet various economic planning
tools (Integrated Investment Plan, DSA, medium-term budget and debt strategy) are still to be
linked and used as inputs to the annual budget preparation. Staff emphasized the urgent need to
strengthen project analysis, selection and monitoring capacity and to anticipate the related
financing in the DSA.
30.
The authorities stressed their priority for continued high public investments and
concurred with the staff’s analysis. They agreed to moderate the pace of new borrowing over the
medium term until the coming on stream of revenues from the coal and natural gas sectors, while
strengthening the absorption capacity and effectiveness of investment. The authorities noted that
this was consistent with maintaining sustainable debt ratios, and these were expected to fall sharply
when exports and GDP rise sharply in the LNG production phase.

D. Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Issues
31.
Monetary policy was loosened in 2012, and is geared towards
MEFP ¶10-14
containing inflationary pressures while supporting economic activity.
The BM aims to keep reserve money growth slightly above nominal GDP
growth to support financial deepening and the provision of credit to the economy, while
maintaining inflation at 5-6 percent in the medium term.
32.
Inflationary pressures should be closely monitored and controlled within the overall
macroeconomic policy mix. Staff suggested that the BM remain vigilant of possible lagged effects
of monetary loosening, and monitor any second-round pass-through effects from the flood-related
food prices increase. The impact of recent wage increases in the public sector and adjustments to
some administered prices also need to be factored in. The authorities expressed their readiness to
tighten monetary conditions if inflation accelerates beyond their current projections.5

DIGNAR (Debt, Investment, Growth and Natural Resources).

The BM forecasts somewhat higher inflation than staff for 2013 based on its internal model, which the staff
considers to reflect an upward bias due to its historic base period.

Staff suggested that strong monetary

easing had one little to increase credit to
the productive sector, especially SMEs, and that the authorities should focus instead on structural
policies, including enhancing the creditworthiness of borrowers. Also, developments in credit to
households and non-performing loans need to be closely monitored. The authorities acknowledged
the concentration of credit in few large companies and underscored that diversifying SME‘s sources
of financing is a critical pillar of the Financial Sector‘s Development Strategy. They also pointed to
the steady and low level of non-performing loans.
34.
The BM continues to modernize its monetary policy
operations framework. They are strengthening coordination on cash
MEFP ¶11
flow planning with the Ministry of Finance, which is essential to better
control base money developments and manage liquidity, and enhancing monetary policy
instruments while contributing to developing the domestic securities market. Primary government
bond dealers have been accredited for the first time recently, and the
first-ever auction of treasury bonds (TB) was held that was significantly
MEFP ¶22
oversubscribed (market-clearing interest rate was 7.5 percent for 4-year
TBs). To help develop capital markets, TBs will be auctioned in several smaller batches during the
year, against a single annual placement in the past.
35.
The authorities are enhancing their financial stability framework. Prudential indicators
of the predominantly Portuguese-owned banking sector remain sound. Updated stress-tests
conducted by an IMF TA mission in December 2012 suggest that the overall system may be fairly
resilient to both solvency and liquidity shocks, and that contagion risks may be limited because of
low interbank exposures. The fast expansion of the banking sector (18 banks compared to 12 in
2007) nevertheless calls for vigilance. The BM is developing its own stress-testing exercise, revising
the regulation on the definition of nonperforming loans to make it internationally comparable, and
planning a revision of regulations on concentration limits. Risk management guidelines and a legal
and analytical framework for risk-based surveillance were adopted in March 2013, moving closer to
the adoption of the Basel II Capital Accord in 2014. Moreover, the financial
sector contingency plan has been completed and simulation exercises will
MEFP ¶38-39
be conducted with the support of the World Bank, while a deposit
insurance fund will soon become operational upon release of donor funding.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Also, a draft AML/CFT law incorporating comments from the IMF Legal Department is expected to
be approved by Parliament soon.
36.
The authorities have adopted a Financial Sector Development Strategy aimed at
deepening financial inclusion (Box 3). The financial strategy for 2013-2022 was subject to a
comprehensive consultation process. It aims at strengthening financial stability and facilitating longterm financing of the private sector, and includes a broad range of targeted measures to enhance
financial inclusion and deepening, competition, consumer protection and financial literacy.
37.
The authorities are concerned about the supply and high cost of credit to the economy
and agree with the need to focus on structural reforms. They acknowledged the need to deepen
the analysis of monetary policy transmission mechanisms. The draft law on the creation of private
credit registry bureaus is expected to be submitted to the Council of Ministers by June 2013
(structural benchmark), and should facilitate access to finance for SMEs; the deepening of domestic
capital markets will also contribute to the financing of the economy.

Box 3. Financial Inclusion in Mozambique
Financial deepening in Mozambique is increasing amid
banks’ fast expansion. The number of branches of credit
institutions rose from 228 in 2005 to 502 in 2012, and the
credit-to-GDP ratio rose from 13.2 percent to 28.8 percent
(Figure 1).1 The share of the adult population that has a
bank account increased to 20 percent in 2012.2 By end2012, the sector consisted of 18 banks, 8 microbanks, 7
credit unions, 11 savings and loans organizations, 202
microcredit operators, 1 electronic money institution and
3
3,051 agents of mobile banking.

The BM has constructed an index of financial
inclusion (IFI)4 showing an upward trend overall, but
with regional asymmetries. The index rose from 9.2 in
2005 to 13.1 in 2012, with the jump in 2011 explained
mainly by the emergence of mobile banking services.
However, while Maputo city had a very high IFI at end2012 (91.8), other provinces remained with very low
access to financial services (Figure 2).

Yet, the sector remains concentrated and
uncompetitive. Around 85 percent of the system assets
are held by the 3 largest banks. Almost 80 percent of bank
agencies and ATMs are located in urban areas, around half
in Maputo.
There is evidence of increased financial inclusion in
recent years, as documented by a BM study. Reflecting in
part the expansion of the branch network and
improvements in access to telecommunications and
electricity, the number of branches per 10,000 km2
increased by 4 between 2005 and 2012, and the number of
ATMs and POSs in 10,000 km2 increased by 8 and 58,
respectively.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Despite higher financial inclusion, access to credit
continues to be a major concern, particularly for
SMEs. Interest rates on loans have been declining
gradually, but remain high, and credit remains biased
towards middle-income households at the exclusion of
productive sectors such as agriculture and industry.
Looking forward, it is necessary to address the
challenges to financial inclusion, both on the supply
and demand sides. The authorities have reached a key
milestone with the approval of the Financial Sector
Development Strategy in March 2013, which
appropriately lays out a number of policies to improve
access to financial services.

38.
The real effective exchange rate (REER)
fluctuated somewhat in recent years. The REER
reached a peak in early 2009, then depreciated
through late 2010,as a result of the Bank of
Mozambique loosening monetary policy in
response to the world economic crisis. It
recovered in 2011 as the authorities tightened
monetary policy, and depreciated slightly in 2012
and early 2013 following the monetary easing.
Since 2011 the REER has remained above its
average level in previous years, which is likely to
be related partly to the start up of coal exports in
2011, and thus could signal future further
appreciation.

39.
On balance, staff views the real effective exchange rate (REER) as broadly in line with
fundamentals. Standard CGER calculations suggest a large overvaluation, but this can be
misleading as the calculated current

parameters derived from historical values.

sectors will likely cause the exchange rate

40.
The current reserve coverage appears adequate to withstand external shocks and is
projected to remain so over the medium term. Mozambique‘s current reserve coverage of about
4 months of projected non-megaproject imports of goods and services appears adequate
considering various measures of reserve adequacy. The relevant measure of reserve cover in
Mozambique is imports of goods and services excluding megaprojects because the megaproject
imports are financed by FDI and are, in effect, self-financing. Moreover, a one standard deviation
shock to the current account or exports in terms of GDP reveals that the impact on Mozambique—
between one and two months of imports—could be weathered.
41.
Mozambique’s doing business indicators suggest that the economy’s competitiveness
can be improved through structural reforms. The country is lagging behind its peers in the region
and has shown little progress under various survey-based indicators. It is ranked near the bottom of

the World Bank‘s latest Doing Business ratings, having dropped from 139 in 2012 to 146 in 2013.
More needs to be done to improve external competitiveness, including enhancing institutions,
infrastructure (such as transportation systems), the provision of health and education services, and
further steps to enhance the business climate, such as simplifying the procedures for starting and
operating a business.
42.
The authorities agreed with the medium-term reserve adequacy level and with the
need to focus on structural reforms to enhance competitiveness. In 2012 Parliament authorized
the government to establish bankruptcy rules for insolvent companies, and a simplified licensing
regime was adopted for a range of commercial activities, while regulations are being streamlined for
others.
F.

Inclusive Growth

43.
Despite Mozambique’s 20 years of high growth, substantial development challenges
remain. Record growth since the end of the Civil War in 1992 reflected sound macro-economic
management, a number of large-scale foreign investment projects (―megaprojects‖), and strong
donor support. Yet Mozambique started from a very low base and remains among the world‘s
poorer countries with a per capita GDP of $650 in 2012. While poverty has been reduced, more than
half of the population still lives below the national poverty line according to the latest data available
(for 2009). Improvements have been most pronounced in the already more affluent Southern
regions and in urban centers, especially the Maputo area, while nationwide rural poverty continues
to be severe.

increasingly driven more by
extractive industries, which are highly capital-intensive and create (directly) few jobs for nationals.
Employment remains dominated by agriculture (78 percent of the economically active population),
mostly in subsistence activities and with very low productivity. Average skill levels in the labor force
are low and will take time to improve. The population is relatively young and growing at about
3 percent a year, with the labor force growing rapidly. Responding to these long-term challenges is
at the core of the poverty reduction strategy (PARP 2011–14) and of priority spending in the budget,
and measurable progress is likely to be gradual (see Appendix VI).
45.
Making growth more inclusive requires a decisive multidimensional strategy centered
on job creation and economic transformation. Staff agreed with the authorities that the priorities
continue to include addressing the large infrastructure gaps, strengthening productivity in
agriculture, investing in health, education and vocational training to provide a qualified workforce
and innovators to take advantage of the emerging opportunities, supporting access to credit
including for smaller or newer enterprises, facilitating the creation of markets with supporting
market infrastructure (such as transportation networks) both locally and within the region to create
demand for new products, and continued efforts to strengthen the basic social protection system to
help the most vulnerable.
46.
The authorities noted the significant progress made in improving social-development
indicators, and acknowledged the need for further reforms to expand economic
diversification and improve the business environment. They noted that these issues remain at
the core of the current PARP and its successor planned for early 2015, and the government‘s overall
economic strategy.

NEW PSI AND PROGRAM ISSUES
47.
The authorities requested (i) waivers for breaches of the end-December net credit to
government and reserve money targets considering the corrective action taken and the minor size
of the deviation, respectively, and the strong ownership and overall good performance of the Fundsupported program that they have demonstrated; and (ii) the completion of the sixth review
under the PSI.
48.
The authorities requested continued Fund support through a new three-year PSI. They
noted that the PSI has served them well in building capacity in a broad spectrum of areas,
strengthening the monitoring and implementation of their economic and social development
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

012 THE REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

strategy, and had a positive signaling effect for donor support. They appreciated the Fund‘s
flexibility in responding to shocks and addressing infrastructure gaps.
49.
In the staff’s view, the PSI remains an appropriate instrument for Mozambique. The
current PSI allowed for a close policy dialogue between the Fund and the authorities. Economic
policies established a commendable track-record of domestic and external stability that is necessary
to support strong and durable poverty reduction and growth. The macroeconomic position of the
country is broadly stable and sustainable and therefore does not require Fund financing or
significant macroeconomic policy adjustments.
50.
Staff proposes to maintain the program conditionality largely unchanged as it
adequately reflects policy priorities. The indicators relative to the quantitative assessment
variables (ACs) and indicative targets would remain the same, though the definition of government
revenue will now reflect VAT on a net basis. With respect to external borrowing limits, the PSI
maintains limits on the contracting of commercial borrowing with limits set consistent with
maintaining debt sustainability. The proposed structural conditionality (SBMs) draws on TA
recommendations from the Fund, in the areas of PFM, tax administration, investment planning,
monetary and financial sector management, and real and external sector statistics, and will be
conducive to achieving the program objectives (see paragraphs 13 and 14). The emphasis on
capacity building in macro-management will support the country‘s transition to a resource-rich
economy. In the short run, structural conditionality will focus on public financial management,
investment planning, business environment and financial sector development (see Table 4 of the
MEFP). The authorities will cancel the existing PSI at the time of approval of a successor. Reviews
and ACs will be semi-annual, with the first review by end-December 2013 based on end-June 2013
ACs and SBMs.

STAFF APPRAISAL
51.
Mozambique’s economic growth performance has been remarkable and the outlook
remains strong. Economic growth was buoyant in 2012 and inflation fell sharply. Economic growth
was broad-based and led by the start-up of coal production and exports. Performance in 2013 is
expected to remain strong with growth at 7 percent and low inflation, despite the adverse impact of
floods early this year.
52.
Several factors mitigate the identified vulnerabilities. Prospects for coal production and
exports are good, and further tax windfalls from sales of shares in gas operations could materialize
this year. Strong FDI inflows in several megaprojects, including LNG development, are ongoing and
the related widening of the external current account deficit does not signal fundamental external
imbalances.
53.
Monetary and financial policies remain broadly appropriate. The authorities‘ objective of
strengthening the BM‘s monetary policy framework should help improve the weak transmission
mechanisms. Monetary conditions should be tightened if inflation accelerates beyond the
authorities‘ current projections. Ongoing reforms of financial and prudential regulations aiming at
strengthening the soundness and supervision of the banking system and financial deepening should
be swiftly implemented along the lines of the Financial Sector Development Strategy. Staff views the
real effective exchange rate as broadly in line with fundamentals and reserve coverage as adequate.
22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

54.
Fiscal policy remains prudent, but over the medium term should be adapted to the
new natural resource-rich environment. As revenues stemming from the extractive industry will
remain modest for a number of years, continued donor support is essential to help address
Mozambique‘s significant remaining development challenges. Reforms to modernize revenue
administration and PFM need to continue across the board, and steps taken to ensure timely
settlement of VAT refunds. The authorities should focus on the results of spending and base project
selection on economic profitability The current high level of public investment can make an
important contribution to closing infrastructure gaps and enabling Mozambique to access its natural
resource wealth, but the pace of investment needs to be monitored carefully to avoid hitting
absorptive capacity constraints and to preserve debt sustainability. Thus the authorities should
strengthen their medium-term debt strategy and remain in line with the gradual borrowing
approach underlying the DSA. They also need to continue to analyze the risks to domestic and
external debt outlook on the basis of periodic DSA updates.
55.
The authorities should persist in their broad structural reform agenda. Monetary policy
and financial sector development, business environment reforms and policies to strengthen
agricultural productivity are essential to support growth in the private sector outside the
megaprojects, and advance the implementation of the poverty reduction strategy. Prompt adoption
by Parliament of the draft AML/CFT law would contribute to further support anti-corruption efforts.
Infrastructure investments and measures to build human capital through improved education, job
training and health services are also crucial, thought the latter tend to have long lead times before
showing results. Statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, and reforms to broaden
coverage and improve compilation should continue in all areas.
56.
Based on the satisfactory program performance to date, staff recommends completion
of the sixth review under the PSI. It also recommends waivers for the non-observance of the endDecember 2012 ACs on reserve money and net credit to the government, since the deviations from
the targets were minor and corrective action was taken since then to strengthen expenditure
control, and did not undermine the program objectives.
57.
Staff recommends approval of the proposed successor three-year PSI. The country has a
policy framework focused on consolidating macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability, while
deepening structural reforms in key areas that currently constrain growth and poverty reduction; the
authorities demonstrated their openness to a close policy dialogue with the Fund, through the
Fund‘s endorsement and assessment of their economic and financial policies under a PSI. Such
support would be helpful as the country enters a transition period marked by massive investments
planned largely by the private sector to bring Mozambique‘s gas reserves to the market.
58.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place within 24 months subject to the
provisions of the decision on consultation cycles in program countries.

Appendix I—Letter of Intent
Maputo, Mozambique
June 7, 2013
Ms. Christine Lagarde
Director General
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
U.S.A.

Dear Ms. Lagarde:
The Government of Mozambique requests the completion of the sixth review under the Policy
Support Instrument (PSI) and approval of a successor PSI for 2013-16. We plan to cancel the current
PSI at the time of the approval of the successor PSI. In support of this request we are transmitting the
attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), which reviews implementation of
the current PSI and establishes policy objectives and indicator targets for the short and medium term
to be adopted under the next program.
The new PSI will be based on the following four pillars:
(i) Consolidating macroeconomic stability in the context of natural resource exploration;
(ii) Attaining robust and more-inclusive growth;
(iii) Continuing institutional capacity-building in macroeconomic policy formulation and
implementation; and
(iv) Strengthening governance and public sector transparency
The program is in line with our Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PARP) for 2011-14 and with our
plans regarding its successor strategy.
The Government is of the view that the policies outlined in the MEFP are adequate to achieve the
objectives of the PSI-supported program. We stand ready to take any additional measures necessary
to achieve our policy objectives.
The Government will consult with the IMF on the adoption of these measures, and—at its own
initiative or whenever the Managing Director requests such a consultation—in advance of any
revision to the policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance with the Fund‘s policies on such
consultation. The Government will provide the IMF with such information as the IMF may request to
be able to assess the progress made in implementing the economic and financial policies and
achieving the objectives of the program.

Attachment 1—Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Policies
June 7, 2013
1.
This MEFP (i) describes recent developments and performance of the Government‗s
economic program under the three-year PSI to date, and (ii) elaborates on economic and structural
policy intentions for a new program under the PSI for 2013-16. It builds on the MEFPs underlying the
initial PSI request of May 2010 and those for its five reviews, the last of which was completed in
December 2012.
Recent Economic Developments and Performance under the Program
2.
Mozambique's economy remains robust, despite a still-fragile world economic
environment resulting from the financial crisis that shook the international economy and was
exacerbated by the Euro zone sovereign debt crisis.

38



Economic performance. Preliminary data for 2012 indicate that economic activity grew by
7.4 percent, in line with the growth forecast. This performance is explained by the expansion
and rapid rise in coal production as well as in financial services, transport and
communications, and agriculture, the last making a major contribution to GDP. Having said
that, despite no preliminary estimates as yet for economic activity in the early months of the
year, economic performance in the first quarter of 2013 is expected to be lower than the
same period in 2012 due to the negative impact of floods in early 2013, which mainly
affected the agriculture, electricity, mining, and transport and communications sectors.



Inflation The annual inflation rate slowed from 5.5 percent at end-2011 to 2.2 percent at
end-2012. However, the trend is expected to reverse in 2013, given the 5.1 percent rate
posted in April. The 2012 deceleration in inflation was the result of the good harvest and
attendant increase in food supply, the relative stability of the metical in relation to the
leading currencies, favorable developments in international prices, and stable administered
prices. Inflation is expected to increase mainly because of the rise in the prices of food, as
result of the floods, and school fees in January-April 2013.



BOP developments in 2012 were dominated by operations related to the development
of the LNG sector. FDI jumped from $2.6 billion in 2011 to $5.2 billion in 2012 primarily as a
result of the exploratory operations in the Indian Ocean in the north of the country where
massive reserves of natural gas have been identified. Related imports of goods and services
pushed the current account deficit from 24 percent of GDP in 2011 to 36 percent of GDP in
2012. Donor disbursements fell somewhat in terms of GDP from 10 to 7 percent. Traditional
exports, mainly agricultural products, continued their strong performance increasing by
almost 16 percent over 2011.



Net international reserves. Due to these BOP developments, the country had a stock of
reserves of $2.6 billion at end-December 2012, equivalent to approximately to 3.8 months of
projected imports of non-megaproject imports for 2013 compared to 3.7 months at the end
of 2011. However, as of end-March 2013, weak foreign assistance disbursement ($45 million

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

against the $194 million expected) coupled with an increase in imports to make up the food
shortages created by the floods and emergency infrastructure replacements, net international
reserves (NIR) were down to $2.3 billion, around 3.1 months coverage of 2013 imports of
goods and non-factor services.
3.
Performance under the program has been broadly satisfactory, and the authorities largely
complied with the quantitative goals for the period.



Four of the six end-December 2012 quantitative assessment criteria were met, but not
those for net credit to the Government (NCG) and reserve money (RM). The end-December
2012 average RM balance was Mt 40.3 billion, around Mt 1 billion above the target, a shift
caused by higher than projected demand for money at the end of the year. For its part, in
2012, the overall flow of NCG was Mt 2.7 billion—above the programmed target of
Mt 52 million—on account of a shortfall in revenue compared to the program target, and
higher than planned investment spending, which is hard to predict.



Among the indicative targets for March 2013, the RM target was likewise exceeded
owing to continued high demand for broad money demand and limited scope for monetary
intervention in the short term (including an increase in required reserves associated with
higher government deposits, and a weak cash return to the banking system in the post-flood
period). In contrast, NCG for March 2013 was within projections.



Nonconcessional borrowing. The Government's total external non-concessional borrowing
for 2012 was $1.2 billion, increasing the cumulative amount under the PSI to $1.4 billion,
staying below the program‘s ceiling of $1.6 billion through end-June 2013. There was no
additional non-concessional borrowing in the first four months of 2013. These loans are
intended to finance only infrastructure projects with their own debt-servicing capacity.



All structural benchmarks were met, but with some delays. The Annual Domestic
Borrowing Plan for 2013 was approved on schedule in January 2013. The Financial Sector
Contingency Plan was approved on April 2, 2013, two days later than planned. The Financial
Sector Development Strategy, which was submitted to the Cabinet in March 2013 and was
approved on April 9, 2013.

Implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy
4.
We are committed to sustain our pursuit of more inclusive growth during and beyond the
current Poverty Reduction Strategy (PARP 2011-14). The PARP aims to induce patterns of inclusive
growth by increasing the allocation of funds for investment under the following pillars: (i) enhancing
production and productivity in agriculture and fishing; (ii) creating employment; and (iii) enhancing
social and human development. A review of its quantified indicators is underway to refine them,
make them more relevant for assessing progress toward strategic aims, and ensure that they are all
measurable and adequate for the new development challenges.


Enhancing production and productivity in agriculture. Agriculture employs 78 percent of
the economically active population and contributes 23 percent to GDP. Thus productivity
increases and the expansion of areas under cultivation are key to improvements in the
livelihood of the population. To this end, we have adopted an agricultural sector
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

39

development strategy (PEDSA) for 2011-20 and just launched an agricultural investment plan
(PNISA) 2013-17 that will help to gradually shift production from subsistence to commercial
farming.
In 2012, there was progress in several areas:
-

Land use titles. Land rights to 108 community areas were delimited, covering a total area
of 1.6 million ha, mainly in the provinces of Niassa (48 communities with 1.2 million ha),
Zambézia, (27), Gaza (16) and Nampula (6). Also, 56 communities were certified with and
area of 0.1 million ha. This has allowed us to enforce community land use rights, reducing
land conflicts and ensuring land use for agriculture and other productive purposes.

-

Productivity increases. Soybean productivity increased by near 40 percent (1.17 tons per
hectare against 0.85 ton per hectare programmed for the year). Twenty five percent of
farmers had adopted new technologies, according to the 2012 agrarian Survey (TIA). The
adopted technologies included the use of improved inputs (improved seed and
mechanization) and vaccination of livestock.

-

Strengthening monitoring systems. The Agrarian Statistics Master Plan, which was
approved in 2012, combined with the Early Warning System and the TIA, provide a
"statistical framework" to measure production and productivity more accurately and
better assess progress under the PEDSA.



Creating employment. In all, 270,267 formal sector jobs were created: 92,140 in the public
sector and 178,127 in the private sector, of which more than half were for Mozambican miners to
work in South Africa in line with bilateral agreements. While this figure exceeded the goal by 6
percent, it was 14 percent lower than in 2011 reflecting mainly the contraction in the South
African mining sector affected by domestic events and the global financial crisis.



Establishment of the Labor Market Monitoring Group (Observatório do Mercado de Trabalho).
This forum of stakeholders on labor market issues will deepen interactions on the linkages
between the demand and supply of jobs, and help improve employment policies and statistics.
Views are being sought from other ministries and the regulations for its creation are expected to
be approved in April 2013.



Improvement of the business climate will be crucial to attract more investors and enhance
employment creation. We have been working in partnership with the IFC since 2010 to assess
and streamline business licensing requirements and procedures, and this work will continue.
Milestones reached in 2012 included:

40

o

Parliamentary adopted a resolution authorizing the Government to establish bankruptcy
rules for insolvent companies;

o

Cabinet Decree No. 5/2012 established simplified rules for licensing of companies in
more than two hundred types of activities in one day;

o

The Integrated Citizen Services Platform (e-BAU) was launched. It will reduce the number
of procedures, time, and costs involved in licensing and registering companies;

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

o

The Decree 49/2004 on normal corporate licensing procedures, including a standard
form to simplify the procedure for starting a business was amended by Council of
Minister on May 21, 2013;

o

The 2nd Strategic Plan to Improve the Business Environment was drafted and provides,
among others, for the simplification of forms for starting and registering companies, and
procedures for construction licensing. It is currently being aligned in discussions with the
relevant line ministries, provincial governments, and the private sector and is expected to
be submitted to the Council of Minister in June 2013 for approval in August 2013
(structural benchmark).



Enhancing social and human development. Efforts to boost primary school enrolment
continued. The school enrollment rate at age 6 in first grade increased by two percentage points
relative to 2011, and net enrollment at age 7 is close to 100 percent. Significant strides in this
regard have been the creation of an increasingly gender-equitable system, particularly in
secondary schools, and progress in monitoring and evaluating student performance in primary
schools. Also notable is the significant increase in age-appropriate enrollment at different levels.



Health sector. The 2012-16 Health Strategy and the Monitoring and Evaluation plans were
adopted recently that aim to push forward improvements in the still relatively weak public health
system. We launched the Action Plan for Pharmaceutical Logistics and finalized the
Pharmaceutical Logistics Strategy as a means to deal with the drug logistics crisis and emergency
that had arisen in 2011. PFM systems in the sector have also strengthened with bi-monthly
monitoring of the sector accounts.

Macroeconomic Policy

A.

Economic Objectives

5.
We expect growth in the medium term to remain high and robust, reflecting the boom
in the extractive industry and hydrocarbon sector. However, the still-fragile world economic
environment will constitute a risk to growth in the short term.


Over the next five years, the increased contribution of coal production and exports; the
implementation of significant infrastructure projects, including the liquefied natural gas plant;
greater dynamism in the construction and transport and communications sectors, and
continuing growth in other sectors could accelerate economic growth to rates between 7½
and 9 percent per year, in line with our objectives.



As a result of temporary shocks to our economy, we expect to see inflation accelerate in
2013. However, we maintain our medium-term inflation objective of 5 to 6 percent per year.



Developments in the external sector over the coming years will continue to be influenced by
the emergence and development of new companies involved in direct foreign investment in
mineral exploration. Thus, the current account deficit excluding grants could be around 45
percent of GDP, basically reflecting the increase in imports of goods and services to supply
the large investments made by such enterprises, funded largely by FDI and private
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

41

borrowing. We expect the import cover of international reserve cover to remain around four
months of projected imports of non-megaproject goods and non-factor services.

B.

Macroeconomic Policy Mix

6.
We will continue with our current combination of fiscal and monetary policies with a
view to maintaining macroeconomic stability in the medium-term and promoting structural
reforms. We will also strengthen our macroeconomic planning tools and economic policy
coordination within the government and with the BM.
7.
Monetary policy will remain oriented toward achieving the objectives of keeping
inflation low and stable, safeguarding the financial system, and encouraging lending to the
economy. We will continue reforms to improve operations of the banking system and broaden
further access to financial services for depositors as well as borrowers.
8.
The tax and budget policy will continue to meet the objectives in terms of natural
resource taxation, priority spending on infrastructure investment, health and education, and
income redistribution. The medium-term fiscal framework (CFMP) for 2013-15 envisages moderate
fiscal deficits, continued strong external support, and modest domestic financing needs. It
demonstrates the Government‘s efforts to increase internal revenue generation capacity and cover
the outlays necessary to keep its administrative machinery running with self-generated funds. The
CFMP provides for a decrease in the overall fiscal deficit after grants from 8.6 percent to 7 percent
between 2013 and 2015, and the Government will continue to give priority to concessional
borrowing to finance the budget deficit. However, any recourse to nonconcessional loans must be
within the approved ceiling and the funds must be used for investment in public infrastructure
projects with a proven ability to generate financial and debt-servicing capacity, as evidenced in the
summary description of the project.
9.
We will also move forward structural and governance reforms to improve the business
climate and facilitate job creation by the private sector and encourage activity outside the
megaprojects. These address, on the one hand, the need to raise average labor skills and narrow the
infrastructure gap, and on the other the need to facilitate business operations through, among
others, more client-oriented taxpayer services, streamlining of licensing requirements, and the
availability of credit and debtor information.

C.

Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies

10.
In the short term, monetary policy will aim to sustain economic growth while
maintaining macroeconomic stability. We will continue to aim for reserve money growth slightly
above nominal GDP growth to support financial deepening and the provision of credit to the
economy, while maintaining inflation at 5-6 percent in the medium term.
11.
Enhancing the framework for monetary policy operations remains a priority. The BM
will focus on the following areas:


42

Strengthening coordination with the Ministry of Finance. The BM and MF will continue to
strengthen their coordination and exchange of information as envisaged in the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

Memorandum of Understanding signed on March 25, 2011, with a view to improving
liquidity management in the economy.


Developing the domestic repo market to help improve money market management
and the liquidity of government securities. Following the July 2012 approval of the legal
framework, which made all treasury bills (BT) eligible for repo transactions and permitted
secondary trading in BTs, the electronic platform (Meticalnet Module) was modified, enabling
the launch on March 13 this year of the first primary market operation with fungible BTs.
Further improvements in the Maticalnet for the secondary market are in progress, and are
envisaged to be completed by end-June 2013.



Continued coordination with the MF with a view to using government bonds (OTs) as
security in the Interbank Money Market (MMI). The inclusion of OTs in the MMI became
an integral part of a broader project to develop the government securities market (public
debt market), the first phase of which was a diagnostic assessment of the conditions for its
implementation. This was completed in November 2012 and identified a number of technical
and legal constraints that will have to be removed in the course of 2013 ahead of
implementation scheduled for early 2014.



Transformation of the standing deposit facility into repo operations. A set of
transactions designed and tested for this purpose is currently undergoing improvements and
is scheduled for implementation in June 2013.

12.
We continue to improve monetary policy formulation and implementation, and to
communicate this. The publication of the quarterly monetary policy report as part of efforts to
enhance monetary policy communication and transparency is now an established consolidated
process. The fifth edition was published in April 2013. In terms of monetary policy implementation,
the BM will continue to improve data collection and refine its inflation and liquidity forecasting
models, as well as the analytical contents of its publications.
13.
We remain committed to a flexible exchange rate regime. The BM will allow the
exchange rate to adjust freely to evolving patterns of trade and financial flows and closely monitor
developments in the real effective exchange rate vis-à-vis a broad basket of currencies, with a view to
ensuring external competitiveness and a comfortable level of international reserves.
14.
The Mozambican authorities remain committed to their obligations under Article VIII,
sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. The BM will continue to monitor the
implementation of the new foreign exchange regulations, its implementation norms, as well as the
functioning of the foreign exchange market, with a view to avoiding practices that could be
inconsistent with Article VIII principles. We will keep IMF staff informed of any developments that
could potentially run against those principles.

D.

Fiscal Policy

15.
Fiscal policy aims at the creation of productive capacity in the country, reducing the
vulnerability to external shocks, and fostering sustainable and inclusive economic growth and
development. The 2013 Budget Law envisages an increase in the revenue ratio of 23.6 percent of
GDP through continued improvements in revenue administration. The level of spending is budgeted
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

43

at around 35.4 percent of GDP. The resulting deficit would be financed by external funds and
domestic borrowing to the tune of 11.8 percent and 0.6 percent of GDP, respectively.
16.
2013 Budget Revision. In response to the floods in early 2013 that devastated a number of
provinces in the southern, central, and northern regions of the country, leading to a slowdown in
economic growth, the Government intends to submit a revised budget to the National Assembly in
August 2013. This revision increases spending to mitigate the vulnerability of those affected and
rebuild destroyed infrastructure. This will be funded by already realized windfall revenue on capital
gains tax from sales of shares in hydrocarbon companies.
17.
Use of potential further windfall revenue. Depending on activity between private parties
involving the sale of shares in mineral/hydrocarbon projects, the government could receive further
windfall revenue in 2013. The government intends to use such windfalls to advance the socioeconomic development of the country. Existing budget rules allow the use of such fiscal space (i) to
increase investment, including the contribution of public enterprises to complex PPP investments
such as envisaged in the electricity sector, railway projects, and LNG, or (ii) to reduce government
debt, e.g. reducing the stock of VAT refunds arrears.
18.
Continuation of the wage policy. In 2013 the Government's wage bill is projected at about
10.4 percent of GDP to sustain the existing payroll, new hiring, and promotions and progressions
with a major impact on the education, health, and justice sectors, notwithstanding the impact of
other sectors. In the medium term wage policy reforms will continue to (i) advance the
decompression of the salary structure and address equity issues through differentiated adjustments
in minimum wage across sectors; (ii) strengthen the link between remuneration and productivity in
various sectors; and (iii) slow down recruitment in non-priority sectors to create room for the needs
of the priority sectors. These measures are intended to reduce the wage bill as a share of GDP to
around 8.5 percent in the medium term.
19.
Spending for priority sectors. The Government has given priority to significant spending on
priority sectors, amounting to 72.3 percent of total expenditure, excluding interest on government
debt and government financial operations, compared with 66.9 percent in 2012, in order to ensure
the implementation of measures aimed at reducing rural and urban poverty rates through
investments to boost national output capacity, productivity, and the competitiveness of domestic
inputs. In recent years, the Government has given substantial attention to social protection, in
particular measures to protect the most vulnerable. In this regard:
• Enhancing social protection. Earmarked government spending on social protection in the
2013 budget increased to Mt 1.7 billion (0.4 percent of GDP).1 We expect to draw on
additional World Bank financing for public works programs, for which pilot schemes have been
under way. The Government has renewed its commitment to increasing budget appropriations
to 0.8 percent of GDP over the medium term with the aim of reaching around 900,000
beneficiaries and raising the level of cash transfers to meet the poverty line over the coming
years.

1

Of particular note in this area is the increase in the monthly minimum basic welfare allowance from Mt 130 to
Mt 253 per beneficiary.
44

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

 Developing a more effective programmatic targeting system. The government has begun
to develop and test a set of operational tools to improve beneficiary selection and enhance the
implementation of social-protection programs with the support of development partners.
These include a common targeting system, a consolidated registry of beneficiaries, an
information-management system, and a mechanism to redress complaints and grievances. The
government has designed an innovative targeting system that combines geographical
identification with community targeting to minimize exclusion errors and a proxy means-test
instrument to minimize inclusion errors. The system will be tested in 2013 and will be used to
select the beneficiaries of the PASP beginning in 2014.
 Relief for the early-2013 floods. To alleviate the impact of the natural disasters on the
populations concerned, the Government will approve a Post-Flood Reconstruction Plan, which
includes the following measures to be implemented over the next three budgets: actions on
mitigation, resettlement and reconstruction of infrastructure (emergency and permanent
replacement of infrastructures, roads, bridges, water and sanitation, railways, public
administration buildings, enhancing flood resistance). We foresee the rehabilitation and
construction of affected infrastructure in education and health; replacement of damaged
furniture and equipment; and for the specific case of health, the replenishment of medical drug
stocks.
 Improving Infrastructure. The Government is committed to spatial planning in rural areas and
towns, and to regulate urban and peri-urban land use, with a target to demarcate 70,000 plots
across the country. Major transport investments in the coming years include the ring road
around Maputo; Beira – Machipanda road; the railway line from Moatize via Malawi to Nacala,
the deep water port in Nacala, and the Nacala international airport. In the area of water and
sanitation, we will focus on promoting sustainable water supply systems in rural areas,
expansion of systems in all cities, and rehabilitation and construction of dispersed sources of
water supply. The Government will also establish arrangements to monitor water entering
Mozambique, and to rehabilitate levees defense platforms and strengthen areas prone to
flooding and mitigation of floods and droughts.
 In the area of education, the Government‘s effort will be focused on building educational
infrastructure and improving the quality of education by increasing financial resources, human
and material, directly benefiting schools and improving student learning. Continued priority to
universalization of Primary education, with a focus on learning and developing basic skills in
reading, writing and numeracy.
 In the health sector, the government will improve the health network through the
rehabilitation and expansion of primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary networks. We will
promote equal access to health care focusing on health of women and children and other
vulnerable groups. Furthermore, we will improve the management of human resources, raising
the level of humanization of services, control the impact of endemic diseases, and reduce
malnutrition rates.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

20.

Energy subsidies.


Subsidies on petroleum products. The Government will continue to monitor fuel prices in
the international market and their appropriate framework in the domestic market. To ensure
the sustainability of fuel provision activities, including the remuneration of providers, the
Government aims to gradually eliminate blanket subsidies over the medium term, and target
subsidies exclusively at vulnerable social segments.



Compensation to fuel importers. The Government allocated around Mt 1.3 billion in the
2013 budget (0.3 percent of GDP) to pay fuel importers in compensation for fuel losses
incurred in 2012.



Electricity tariffs. The challenges facing the electricity sector include carrying out
investments to develop energy production, transmission, and distribution infrastructure;
advancing rural electrification to meet demand, which has been steadily rising in recent years
as a result of the increasingly dynamic domestic economy; and re-establishing the financial
sustainability of EDM, Mozambique's public electricity company. A tariff study has been
prepared and proposed a tariff adjustment mechanism in each consumer segment. A
proposal building on this is expected to be presented to the Council of Ministers in the first
half of 2013. Other elements such as government transfers to EDM for investments in rural
electrification are also under consideration.

Structural Reforms

A. Public Financial Management and Reporting
21.

Public financial management remains a priority.



Streamlining wage bill administration (expanding coverage of e-Folha and e-CAF). By
end-June 2013, the Government will approve the action plan for the expansion of the
electronic payroll system (including e-Folha) and of the integrated civil service database (eCAF) (structural benchmark). The e-CAF will enable the Government to make salary
payments to civil servants and government agents by direct bank transfer, in particular those
that do not meet the requirements for inclusion in e-Folha. The expansion of direct salary
payments will include all institutions covered by e-CAF and with direct access to e-SISTAFE
by end-December 2013 (structural benchmark).



Strengthening expenditure execution processes. The electronic expenditure system (eSISTAFE) is currently used largely for payment purposes. However, it is capable of handling
the three separate phases of expenditure execution: commitment when an order for goods or
services is made; verification when the delivery of goods and services received is confirmed
and their value accepted as payment obligation; and payment when the payment obligation
to the supplier is met. A pilot for the 3-step expenditure chain has been implemented for
public debt servicing, and we plan to expand this practice to other expenditure areas/units
starting in January 2014.
Migrating to IPSAS-compatible reporting. Under the action plan to reform the public
accounting system approved in October 2012, a proposal for new Accrual Accounting Rules

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

in line with International Public Accounting Standards (IPSAS) will be elaborated by July 2013.
The proposal will be open to public consultation in August; the Council of Ministers will
consider it thereafter, and then submit it to Parliament for approval.


Improving budget classification. We are working on the mapping of priority spending
according to the PARP pillars through a more detailed budget classification by spending
programs, and expect this to be completed by mid-2013 for the 2014 budget. In addition we
have started to structure the presentation of spending according to programmatic classifiers
to align it with the program structure of the Government‘s next Five Year Plan (Plano
Quinquenal do Governo). As an intermediate step, we have updated the economic and the
organic classification of expenditure for 2013 to allow a more detailed classification by
expenditure units in our accounting system.



Preparation of the new economic revenue classifier (CER). Preparation of the CER is
underway and scheduled for conclusion by end-2013 for application in the next budgets.
While the current CER aims to identify the nature of the revenue, the new classifier will
identify the origin of funds according to the economic nature of the underlying activity,
thereby affording greater precision, transparency, and consistency.

B. Investment Planning and Debt Management
22.
The Government will continue to give priority to modernizing its debt management
and investment planning procedures.


Strengthening investment planning. The Ministry of Planning and Development (MPD) will
submit by June 2013 the Integrated Investment Program (IIP) for Cabinet approval. The
document will present a list of priority projects together with sufficiently specific information
to analyze the impact of related borrowing on debt sustainability. (structural benchmark)



Strengthening project selection tools. In February 2013, the MPD completed the Project
Preparation Manual and template along with a form for a summary description of individual
projects. The Project Management and Selection Committee will start using the Manual in
July 2013 to analyze projects and, once Cabinet approved a particular project, will publish the
template and summary description on the website with relevant information on that project.
The Debt Management and Project Selection Committees will continue to provide training to
key line ministries in the use of the new project selection tools and criteria.



Enhancing debt management. The preparation of a Debt Sustainability Analysis is underway
to serve as an input for the 2014 State Budget. The DSA is scheduled for completion by endJune 2013. The Government intends to incorporate the analysis of costs and risks associated
with the public debt portfolio and borrowing plans over the medium term in the quarterly
debt report, ensuring linkages with the State Budget and the Integrated Investment Program,
as well as enhancing debt monitoring in line with the medium-term debt strategy (MTDS).
The latter was last completed at end-2012 and is forward-looking policy tool to inform the
selection of investment projects in light of the volume and composition of public debt, using
cost-risk analysis consistent with the macroeconomic projections and the DSA.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



Advancing development of capital markets and first Annual Domestic Borrowing Plan
for 2013. In order to promote public savings and stimulate domestic capital market
development, a domestic borrowing plan will be prepared annually after the budget has
been approved. The first such plan was approved and published in January 2013. Consistent
with World Bank/IMF technical assistance recommendations for an auction strategy and
determination of a yield curve for the state, as of 2013, Treasury bonds (T bonds) will be
issued in several tranches per year and interest rates will be determined at auctions held at
the stock exchange. Decree 5/2013 of March 2013 paved the way for the introduction of
specialized Treasury bond dealers (OEOT). About ¾ of the total of 20 financial institutions
invited to become OEOTs have accepted, facilitating the creation of a secondary market. The
first primary T bond auction took place in April 2013 and was substantially oversubscribed.

C. Tax Policy and Administration
23.
The modernization of tax administration will continue. The implementation of measures
aimed at the widespread adoption of information and communication technologies for managing tax
processes will remain a priority, both in customs and inland revenue, enabling increased coverage of
potential taxpayers and broadening the tax base. It will also pay particular attention to taxation of
the mining and hydrocarbon sectors as well as megaprojects more generally by building up
institutional capacities to conduct dedicated monitoring and audits.



VAT administration and refunds. The Government will follow up on April 2013 IMF
technical assistance that studied VAT budgeting and proposed steps to resolve problems
with VAT refunds. We are analyzing the recommendations as part of the overall budget
planning process, and expect to devise a plan by October 2013 (structural benchmark) to
gradually reduce the stock of pending refunds, avoid accumulating new ones, optimize the
VAT administration and refund process. We expect to increase the budget allocation for VAT
refunds in 2014 to avoid a further accumulation of pending refunds. We intend to submit any
changes to the VAT law that may be needed to Parliament in time for application of VAT on a
net basis beginning from the 2015 budget.



Implementing the single taxpayer database (NUIT) in the e-Tax Project. The NUIT
database in the framework of the e-Tax project is already available and the process of
updating information on large taxpayers in all Unidades de Grandes Contribuintes (Large Tax
Payer Units) is currently underway. The process is expected to be completed by end-June
2013. Expansion of the NUIT system to all computerized regional tax collection offices (DAFs)
is underway on the same schedule. Information on all other taxpayers, whether individuals or
legal entities, is being updated and should be completed in 2014.



Implementing tax payments through banks (e-Tax) for VAT and the simplified small
taxpayer regime (ISPC). Preparation of the business model for applying e-Tax to VAT/ISPC
was completed in terms of legislative amendment, and IT adjustment is ongoing.2 Its
implementation is now being prepared with a view to launch a pilot in the first quarter of
2014. Actual tax payments through banks will only begin in a second phase that fully

2

This involves changes to the Enterprise Tax and Policy management System (ETPM).

48

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

develops the VAT/ISPC module and a corresponding pilot is planned for the second half of
2014.



Simplifying the small taxpayers regime. General ISPC regime provisions currently are
rivaled in provisions for simplified regimes in the specific tax legislation for VAT, corporate
and personal income taxes (IRPC and IRPS). A study on the overlaps and possible
inconsistencies will be concluded by December 2013. The results of those studies will
determine the next steps in order to streamline the system for taxpayers and the tax
authority alike.



Strengthening the large taxpayers units (UGCs and DCAT). The pilot scheme phase for
the large taxpayers database installed in the Maputo UGC and the General Tax Directorate‘s
(DGI) Technical Support and Coordination Department (DCAT) is currently underway.
Installation in the remaining UGCs (cities of Beira and Nampula) is scheduled for Q4, 2013.
The database will improve handling of information on the economic activities of large
taxpayers and allow better monitoring.



Mitigating transfer pricing. To mitigate transfer pricing, the government, with technical
assistance from the IMF, is working on draft regulations which are expected to be completed
in Q4, 2013. We also intend to adopt an action plan to implement the regulations and
strengthen capacity building.



Revisiting bilateral double taxation agreements (DTAs). The Government is analyzing
existing DTAs in order to identify possible weaknesses or areas that could lead to an unfair
loss of revenues for Mozambique. We intend to negotiate the necessary adjustments with
our partners.

D. Improving Earnings from Natural Resource Exploration
24.
The Government will continue to strengthen its capacity to manage the country’s rich
natural resources and channel its benefits to the whole population. This involves improvements
in several areas, including analytical tools, sector legislation and taxation, transparency, and the
optimization of government participation in the mining and hydrocarbon sectors. The Government is
receiving technical assistance in these areas from various development partners, and will supplement
this with hiring specialized expertise where needed.
25.
The Government is strengthening the statistical tools to help analyze developments
and inform economic and social policy making and planning. This involves production statistics,
national accounts, fiscal data, balance of payments and financial sector statistics, where INE, BM, MF,
MIREM and other government bodies are working together.
26.
Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) and Transparency. Mozambique has
now published three EITI reports in keeping with the country's laws, which reconcile payments made
by previously selected companies in the mining and hydrocarbons sectors with the revenues
reported by the government agencies in charge of their collection. The 2nd EITI report rated the
country as compliant with the Initiative's rules. The inclusion of more enterprises in reconciliation
reports is a reflection of growth in the country's extractive industry: the 1st first report covered only

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

49

six enterprises, the 2nd and 3rd reports encompassed 36 and 46 enterprises, respectively. The 4th EITI
reconciliation report on extractive industry payments and government receipts covers the financial
year 2011 is currently under preparation and expected to be published by end-2013.
27.
Mining and Petroleum Legislation. The Government approved the draft revisions to the
mining and hydrocarbon laws in April 2013; the latter of which includes legal provisions for
infrastructure concessions to allow for LNG development. Public consultations were held, including
through web-posting of the draft laws. This legislation is going to be submitted to Parliament
shortly. The existing legislation on public-private partnerships (PPPs) envisages the publication of
PPP contract, and this will also be applied to mining and hydrocarbon contracts. Once the new laws
are approved, the Government will update the related regulations within 6 months. The government
expects to issue tenders for new hydrocarbon exploration areas only after the approval of the
revisions to the hydrocarbon law.
28.
Enhancing the mining and hydrocarbon fiscal regime. We continue to work on revisions
to the fiscal regimes applicable to the mining and hydrocarbon sectors with technical assistance from
the IMF and other donors. We have launched the public consultation process in May 2013, and are
confident of submitting both bills to Parliament in August 2013. We are also requesting further
technical assistance on constructing revenue forecasting tools and administrative capacity.
29.
Participation of public enterprises in mining and hydrocarbon development. In the case
of oil and gas the state hydrocarbon company ENH participates in PPPs. While this participation is
typically on a full carry basis during the exploration period, we are still considering the type of
involvement of ENH in the development and production phases with a view to maintaining debt
sustainability and managing risks.

E. Management of Public Enterprises
30.
Strengthening supervision of public enterprises. Following the adoption of the Public
Enterprises Act (Law 6/2012 of February 2012), the Government has enhanced its monitoring of the
activities of public enterprises in order to reduce fiscal risk and integrate it in the MTDS. The aim is
improving governance and strengthening accountability, as well as ensuring that investment and
borrowing plans are assessed and approved in advance by the sector ministry and financial oversight
unit in the MF.
31.
Ensuring transparency in public enterprise management. With a view to increasing
transparency in the management of public companies in line with the Public Enterprises Act, the
Government will ensure that the 2012 reports and accounts (including audit reports) of four large
state-owned companies are published in 2013, and annual publication is continued in the future.
32.
The Government’s strategy with respect to the participation of large public enterprises
in large infrastructure investments is under elaboration. Such companies/projects include the
railway CFM in the construction of new railroads and ports (Nacala line, Nacala and Techobanine
ports), ENH in hydrocarbon projects as discussed above, and EDM in electricity generation,
transmission and distribution (Mphanda Nkuwa hydropower station and backbone transmission line,
Ressano Garcia gas-fired power station with Sasol), and many potential others. The government will
carefully manage the participation of state enterprises in order to mitigate risks and keep public debt
sustainable.

F. Good Governance Framework
33.
The Government continues its efforts toward good governance and fighting
corruption. The issues are complex and have been at the center of our dialogue with development
partners, involving legislation (anti-corruption package) and its implementation as well as reforms of
the justice system and law-enforcement. The Judiciary continues to investigate all allegations of
corruption received.
34.
In 2012 the Government submitted to Parliament the remaining two laws of the anticorruption package, which are awaiting approval, namely (i) the revised and consolidated Criminal
Code and (ii) the revised Criminal Procedure Code. To guide implementation of the package, a
costed action plan is being prepared with a first draft expected in June 2013.
35.
The three other elements of the anti-corruption package already adopted are (i) the
Public Probity Law, (ii) the law on Whistleblowers and witness protection, and (iii) changes to the
organic laws of the prosecution service and Judiciary. These came into effect in November 2012 and
advances have been made to address conflicts of interest and enforce mandatory asset declarations
for those holding public office. Ethics Commissions in each public agency are tasked with the internal
follow-up, and a Central Public Ethics Commission was set up in February 2013.

Financial Sector Policies

A. Financial Sector Surveillance
36.
The BM will continue reforms aimed at enhancing financial sector surveillance despite
the difficult global environment. It remains focused on:


Strengthening banking supervision with a view to mitigating and preventing systemic
risk: A sample of lending institutions‘ data was collected for conducting the first stress tests,
with the expectation that this exercise will be performed by a designated team as part of the
quarterly surveillance process from July 2013 on, including with the respective report on
stress tests results. In this context, the regulation pertaining to nonperforming loan
accounting will be revised in June 2013 to make it internationally comparable, followed by
the revision of the regulation on concentration limits before September 2013, including
banks‘ placements abroad, and modified reporting requirements. Likewise with a view to
strengthening surveillance, the risk management guidelines and the legal and analytical
framework for risk-based surveillance were adopted on March 14, 2013, and will be put into
practice in the course of 2013, on track for the adoption of Basel II Capital Accord in 2014.



Completion of the financial sector contingency plan. The package of rules governing the
Contingency Plan and Emergency Liquidity Assistance was completed and approved in early
April 2013 (existing structural benchmark) with a short delay. The underlying legal
provisions were published in April 2013. Implementation will start in June, including the
preparatory work to conduct simulation exercises with the help of the World Bank.



Making the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) operational. The DIF's social capital has been
approved and fully constituted and the members of the DIF‘s Executive Board have been

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

51

appointed in April 2013. The DIF will become operational once the funding from KfW is
disbursed, and this process was completed with the appointment of the Executive Board in
May 2013.

B.

Financial Sector Development

37.
We will step up our efforts to improve financial inclusion as part of Mozambique's
Financial Sector Development Strategy (FSDS) for 2013-2022. In April 2013, the Cabinet
approved the FSDS. Its main objectives are to (i) maintain financial sector stability through improving
the fiscal and monetary policies and deepening the government debt market, strengthening the
bank supervision and regulation and the financial sector safety nets, and developing the insurance
and pension sectors; (ii) increase access to financial services by eliminating structural impediments in
the economy in general, and specifically in financial intermediation, particularly those that limit
access to credit and increase the costs and risks of providing credit and financial services; and
(iii) increase the supply of private capital to support private sector development by improving the
mobilization and investment of long-term funds, including PPPs, and supporting the development of
the domestic capital market, and the role and capacity of the Mozambique Stock Exchange (BVM). A
dissemination plan on the FSDS was approved by the Minister of Finance in May 2013, including
workshops and seminars planned for June 2013. Key priorities include:

52



Establishing private credit registry bureaus. A law on the creation of private credit registry
bureaus was drafted in November 2012 and is expected to be submitted to the Parliament by
November 2013. (structural benchmark)



Promoting mobile banking. Specific regulations governing mobile banking services are
under preparation by a task force at the BM and expected to be completed by endSeptember 2013. Given the dynamic nature of these particular services, an operator has
already been licensed, with the licensing of a second operator in progress.



Encouraging banking competition. We will foster competition in the banking sector by
(i) introducing laws and regulations that address anti-competitive practices, (ii) fostering
transparent pricing for financial services to allow consumers to compare costs, and (iii)
introducing low-cost online access to credit files. A consumer protection framework will be
designed and outreach will promote financial awareness so as to allow consumers (including
SMEs) to make better use of available financial services; to encourage competition and
innovation amongst financial services providers; and to provide consumers with reasonable
protections against unfair business practices, while ensuring financial institutions‘ soundness.



Strengthening the insolvency framework. An Insolvency Bill was prepared, and Parliament
authorized the government to develop the legal basis for insolvency proceedings. It is
expected that this legislation will be adopted in 2013.



Collateral framework. We will work on a Collateral Bill with an eye to establishing a
moveable collateral registry.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

C. Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing
38.
The AML/CFT framework continues to be improved. A draft AML/CFT law was approved
by Parliament on May 16, 2013. Under the new law the financing of terrorism is considered a crime.
39.
Progress in developing the AML/CFT legal framework. The government is pursuing a plan
for implementing the FATF standards approved by the FATF-style regional body (ESAAMLG). It will
build on the recommendations of an IMF Legal Department mission of April 2013 and the technical
assistance action plan for eliminating shortcomings identified in the legal system; supervision of
financial institutions and Designated Non-Financial Business Professions (DNFBP), Legal Persons and
Arrangements; and international cooperation matters. The mission also provided introductory
training on surveillance under a risk-based approach for staff from the various institutions involved in
combating money laundering.

D. Payment System
40.
The BM will further enhance financial stability and promote market development
through reforms in the national payment system. In pursuing this objective, the BM will continue
to focus mainly on oversight practices and development of the retail payment systems:


Enhancing oversight practices. The BM approved a payment systems oversight policy
strategy in March 2012 and will finalize and implement and oversight function by endNovember 2013 (structural benchmark). Key actions would include (i) the implementation
of an oversight manual, and (ii) the start of the operations of an oversight unit. The revised
regulation of the electronic clearing system (CEL) for checks will also be approved and
published by end-June 2013.



Developing the retail payments network shared by the BM and commercial banks. The
interbank retail payments network (SIMO) has been developed and successfully tested. Two
banks are currently linked to the network and expanding their services, while the remaining
banks are either conducting tests or adjusting their systems with a view to linking to the
SIMO network. We expect the platform to cover the major banks operating in the market and
handle domestic retail transactions by end-November 2013.

Program Monitoring
41.
The proposed assessment criteria and indicative targets up to December 2013 are shown in
Table 1. Table 2 provides a list of the proposed structural benchmarks. The first PSI review is
expected to be completed in December 2013, and the second PSI review by end-June 2014.

Attachment 2—Technical Memorandum of Understanding
June 7, 2013

1.
This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) defines the quantitative assessment
criteria, indicative targets, and structural benchmarks on the basis of which the implementation of
the Fund-supported program under the Policy Support Instrument (PSI) will be monitored. In
addition, the TMU establishes the terms and timeframe for transmitting the data that will enable
Fund staff to monitor program implementation.

Definitions
A. Net credit to the central government
2.
Net credit to the central government (NCG) by the banking system is defined as the
difference between the outstanding amount of bank credits to the central government and the
central government's deposits with the banking system, excluding deposits in project accounts with
the banking system, recapitalization bonds issued to the Bank of Mozambique (BM), and proceeds
from the signing fee for mineral resource exploration. Credits comprise bank loans, advances to the
central government and holdings of central government securities and promissory notes. NCG will
be calculated based on data from balance sheets of the monetary authority and commercial banks
as per the monetary survey. The limits on the change in NCG by the banking system will be
cumulative from end-December of the previous year.
3.
The central government encompasses all institutions whose revenue and expenditure are
included in the state budget (Orçamento do Estado): central government ministries, agencies without
financial autonomy, and the administration of 11 provinces. Although local governments
(43 municipalities or autarquias) are not included in the definition because they are independent,
part of their revenue is registered in the state budget as transfers to local governments.
4.
For program purposes, net disbursements on the nonconcessional Portuguese credit line are
excluded from the assessment criterion of NCG since the corresponding expenditure is not covered
under the definition of central government specified in paragraph 3.

B. Government revenue and financing
5.
Revenue is defined to include all receipts of the General Directorate of Tax (Direcção Geral
dos Impostos, DGI), the General Directorate of Customs (Direcção Geral das Alfândegas, DGA), and
nontax revenue, including certain own-generated revenues of districts and some line ministries, as
defined in the budget. Revenue is gross revenue net of verified VAT refund requests (pedidos
verificadas de reembolsos solicitados). Net receipts from privatization received by the National
Directorate of State Assets (Direcção Nacional do Património do Estado) and unrealized profits
transferred by the central bank to the treasury will not be considered as revenue (above the line)
and will be accounted for as other domestic financing (below the line).

58

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

6.
For the purpose of program monitoring, revenue is considered as collected at the time when
it is received by the relevant government collecting agencies, in cash or checks, or through transfers
into the respective bank account.

C. Priority social spending
7.
Priority social spending is based on the PARPA program categories expanded to incorporate
all areas under the new PARP. Accordingly, it will include total spending in the following sectors:
(i) education; (ii) health; (iii) HIV/AIDS; (iv) infrastructure development; (v) agriculture; (vi) rural
development; a (vii) governance and judicial system, and (viii) social action, labor and employment.

D. Reserve money
8.
For the purposes of program monitoring reserve money is defined as the sum of currency
issued by the BM and commercial banks‘ holdings at the BM. The target is defined in terms of the
average of the daily end-of-day stocks in the month of the test date. The reserve money stock will
be monitored and reported by the BM.

E. Net international reserves
9.
Net international reserves (NIR) of the BM are defined as reserve assets minus reserve
liabilities. The BM‘s reserve assets include (a) monetary gold; (b) holdings of SDRs; (c) reserve
position at the IMF; (d) holdings of foreign exchange; and (e) claims on nonresidents, such as
deposits abroad (excluding the central government‘s savings accounts related to mineral resource
extraction concessions). Reserve assets exclude assets pledged or otherwise encumbered, including
but not limited to assets used as collateral or guarantee for a third–party external liability (assets not
readily available). The BM‘s reserve liabilities include: (a) all short-term foreign exchange liabilities to
nonresidents with original maturity of up to and including one year; and (b) all liabilities to the IMF.

F. New nonconcessional external debt contracted or guaranteed by the
central government, the BM, and selected state-owned enterprises, with
maturity of more than one year
10.
The ceiling on nonconcessional external debt applies to external debt contracted or
guaranteed by the central government, the BM, the Road Fund, the water authorities (FIPAG), the
electricity company (EDM), and the hydrocarbon company (ENH), or by enterprises and agencies in
which the above entities hold a majority stake. It also applies to debt contracted by these four stateowned enterprises from domestic banks or from other state-owned enterprises that is contractually
inter-related to external nonconcessional loans.
11.
The ceiling applies to external debt with original maturity of one year or more and with a
grant element below 35 percent. The grant element is calculated using currency-specific discount
rates based on the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) commercial
interest reference rates in accordance with the annual Budget Law.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 59

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

12.
The term ‗debt‘ will have the meaning set forth in Point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance
Criteria with Respect to External Debt in Fund Arrangements adopted on August 3, 1979, as
amended August 31, 2009, effective December 1, 2009. The concept of external debt is defined on
the basis of the residency of the creditor. This assessment criterion is defined cumulatively from the
beginning of the program and will be assessed on a continuous basis.

G. Stock of short-term external debt contracted or guaranteed by the
central government
13.
The central government will not contract or guarantee external debt with original maturity of
less than one year. This assessment criterion applies to debt as defined in Point 9 of the Guidelines
on Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt in Fund Arrangements adopted on August 3,
1979, as amended August 31, 2009, effective December 1, 2009. The concept of external debt is
defined on the basis of the residency of the creditor. Excluded from this assessment criterion are
short-term, import-related trade credits. This assessment criterion will be assessed on a continuous
basis.

H. External payments arrears of the central government
14.
The government undertakes not to incur payments arrears on external debt contracted or
guaranteed by the central government, with the exception of external payments arrears arising from
central government debt that is being renegotiated with creditors. This assessment criterion will be
assessed on a continuous basis.

I. Foreign program assistance
15.
Foreign program assistance is defined as grants and loans received by the Ministry of
Finance through BM accounts excluding those related to projects (Table 1).

J. Actual external debt service payments
16.
Actual external debt service payments are defined as cash payments on external debt service
obligations of the central government and central bank, including obligations to Paris Club and

Adjusters
A. Net international reserves
17.

The quantitative targets (floors) for net international reserves (NIR) will be adjusted:



downward by the shortfall in external program aid less debt service payments (up to
US$100 million), compared to the program baseline (Table 1);



downward/upward for any revision made to the end-year figures corresponding to the previous
year; and

60

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE



downward to accommodate higher external outlays because of natural disasters, up to
US$20 million.

B. Net credit to central government
18.
The quantitative targets (ceilings) for net credit to the central government (NCG) will be
adjusted:
 upward by the shortfall in the MT value of external program aid receipts less debt service
payments (up to the MT equivalent of US$100 million at exchange rates prevailing at the
respective test dates), compared to the program baseline (Table 1);



downward by privatization proceeds in excess of those envisaged in the program, unless these
proceeds are deposited in the government‘s savings accounts abroad;



downward (upward) for any increase (decrease) in domestic financing from the nonfinancial
private sector; and



upward to accommodate the higher locally-financed outlays because of natural disasters, up to
the MT equivalent of US$20 million at exchange rates prevailing at the respective test dates.

C. Reserve money
19.
The ceiling on reserve money for every test date will be adjusted downward/upward to
reflect decreases/increases in the legal reserve requirement on the liabilities in commercial banks.
The adjuster will be calculated as the change in the reserve requirement coefficient multiplied by the
amount of commercial banks‘ liabilities subject to reserve requirement, considered at the end of the
period of constitution of the required reserves prior to the change in regulation.

Data and Other Reporting
20.

The Government will provide Fund staff with:



monthly and quarterly data needed to monitor program implementation in relation to the
program‘s quantitative targets and broader economic developments;



weekly updates of the daily data set out in Table 1;



weekly data set out in Table 4 of the TMU dated May 26, 2005;



monthly updates of the foreign exchange cash flow of the BM;



Appendix II—Mozambique: The Impact of Megaprojects on
Growth and fiscal Revenue
Along with agriculture, “megaprojects” have played an important role in the postwar development
of the Mozambican economy. With the start of operations of coal mining in Tete in 2011 and the
upcoming expansion of natural gas production, they bear the potential to radically transform the
structure of the Mozambican economy within a decade. Preliminary estimates suggest that coal
and natural gas production could potentially boost growth by 2 percentage points annually during
2013-23. While fiscal revenues from megaprojects will remain moderate in the medium term,
revenues could reach a quarter of total fiscal revenues in the long term, mostly from the natural
gas sector.

Overview of Megaprojects
1.
Starting with Cahora Bassa and Mozal, megaprojects have made an important
contribution to Mozambique’s economic success over the past two decades. Megaprojects
are large, generally foreign-owned, and capital-intensive enclave activities that rely on extracted
resources and/or imported intermediate goods, and export almost all of their production.
Currently six megaprojects operate in Mozambique (Table 1 and Figure 1): (i) the hydro-power
station Cahora Bassa; (ii) the Mozal aluminum smelter; (iii) the Sasol on-shore natural gas
extraction; (iv) the Kenmare heavy sands project; (v) the Vale coal mine; and (vi) the RioTinto coal
mine. Several potential new megaprojects are currently in the exploration or development stage,
including : (i) off-shore oil and gas exploration by Anadarko, ENI, Statoil and Petronas; (ii) the
hydro-power dam Mphanda Nkuwa 60 km downstream from Cahora Bassa, and ―backbone‖
transmission lines to South Africa, neighboring countries and for domestic distribution; (iii) JSPL
and Beacon Hill coal exploration; and (iv) exploration of heavy sands in the South of
Mozambique.
2.
Most of the current and planned megaprojects are in the extractive industries.
Mozambique is rich in a variety of mineral resources, and the country has been extracting natural
gas and heavy sands since the mid-2000s. However, it is the discovery of large coal deposits in
Tete, the Central-Western region of the country, and the recent discovery of enormous off-shore
gas fields in the Rovuma Basin, South of the border with Tanzania, that has put Mozambique on
the world stage for mineral and hydrocarbon-fuel production and has the potential to radically
transform the structure of the Mozambican economy. There are over 32 billion tons of confirmed
coal deposits in Mozambique; full exploitation of these resources could make the country one of
the world‘s leading coal exporters.1 Confirmed gas reserves in the Rovuma Basin currently
amount to 130 trillion cubic feet (comparable with Norway), and further discoveries of substantial
commercial value are expected in the near future. Thus Mozambique could become a major
exporter of natural gas over the medium term.

1

Global coal production was 7.7 billion tons in 2011, about half of which was consumed by China.

Historically, a 2-4 percentage point p.a.
boost to economic growth was observed in the
years when a major megaproject started
production.2These include the period 1998-99
(the re-launching of power generation at Cahora
Bassa) and the period 2001-03 (the launch of
Mozal). After Sasol in March 2004, no major
megaproject was launched until 2011, and the
share of megaprojects in value added was
relatively stable (Figure3.2).
4.
Megaprojects’ contribution to fiscal
revenues has been low in the past. The tax
regime for megaprojects and the extractive
industries has evolved over time. The authorities‘
primary motive for the first megaprojects was to

establish Mozambique as an attractive destination for foreign investment after a long civil war,
and therefore the fiscal terms of those contracts were very favorable to the foreign companies.
On average, megaprojects have contributed less than ½ percent of total fiscal revenues during
2007-11. Tax terms were brought closer in line with international norms with the revision of fiscal
legislation for mining and petroleum in 2007 and have applied to contracts signed since then.
The government is also planning to re-discuss the tax treatment for older megaprojects when
the initial terms expire (typically after 20 years). The tax treatment of the mining and
hydrocarbon sectors is currently being revised, with technical assistance from the Fund and
others, to adapt it to current international standards.

Key Megaprojects Going Forward: Coal and Natural Gas
5.
Looking forward, megaprojects in two emerging natural resources sectors, coal and
natural gas, are set to contribute significantly to economic growth, exports, and fiscal
revenue. Coal operations in Tete Province are led by two major operators, Vale and Rio Tinto.
Coal production reached 5 million tons in 2012 constrained mainly by railway and port capacity.
Abundant and high-quality natural gas reserves have been discovered off-shore in the Rovuma
basin. The natural gas operators (Anadarko and ENI) plan to start construction of LNG extraction,
manufacturing and transport facilities by 2014, and start exporting LNG by 2020.
6.
Staff estimated the impact of LNG sector on GDP and fiscal revenue using the Fiscal
Analysis of Resource Industries (FARI) model. The FARI model is a project-by-project model
initially developed by the IMF‘s Fiscal Affairs Department that enables detailed design, modeling,
and comparison of fiscal regimes across the entire lifecycle of petroleum or mining projects.
Output from the model depends on a series of assumptions about production, investment, cost
structure, prices, and fiscal regime. The results presented here are very preliminary, but reflect
staff‘s best estimate based on latest information from the authorities and the coal and gas
companies.



Coal: coal is currently exported through the Sena line (some 500 km), the only railway
that connects the coal mines to a port (Beira). With the ongoing rehabilitation of the
Sena line, coal production is expected to reach 9 million tons by 2014 (of which 6 million
tons of coking coal). The construction/rehabilitation of a second rail line through Malawi
by Vale that will connect to a new deep water port at Nacala (800 km) is expected to
become operational in 2015, allowing coal production and exports to be scaled up.
Production is projected to reach 22 million tons per year from 2017. Tentative plans for
another southern railway and a new deep water port near Quelimane would further
increase export volumes, but are not projected here.
Natural gas: construction of an LNG plant that consists of four LNG production units
(―trains‖) is expected to start in 2014. Each train has a capacity of manufacturing 5 million
tons of LNG per year. LNG production would start gradually between 2020 and 2023; the
first train is projected to become operational by end-2019, the second by end-2020, and
the last two trains by end-2022. The total project costs of about $40 billion (2.7 times
2012 GDP) cover all upstream (natural gas exploration, drilling, and pipelines) and
midstream (LNG plant) investments. Eventual downstream projects (domestic
distribution) are not included here.

7.
The value added from coal and LNG production is projected to exceed by far that
from existing megaprojects over the next decade. The value added share of coal and LNG
sectors is expected at about 20 percent of GDP by 2023, while the share of existing megaprojects
will decline to less than 5 percent (Figure 3.3, left panel). Coal and gas contributions to GDP
growth will average 2 percentage points per year between 2013 and 2023. GDP growth will reach
double digits in the years when some LNG trains become operational (Figure3.3, right panel). The
FARI model includes only those projects planned by the government and operating companies.3
Current reserve estimates suggest that both coal and natural gas reserves could support a much
larger production capacity than currently planned.
8.
In addition, coal and LNG-related investments will boost medium-term growth. The
coal sector will bring in more than $3 billion in investments in railways and ports in the next five
years. Gas investments so far are largely in exploration activities with very limited domestic
content. Domestic value added will increase in the LNG plant construction stage, employing local
construction workers and utilizing local construction materials and services. The exact
contributions to growth from these investments are hard to project, and they are assumed to be
included in the projected rapid GDP growth of 8 percent each year.
9.
Government revenue from coal and gas is expected to be small over the medium
term (Figure 3.4). Revenue from the coal sector will increase proportionally to coal exports.

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

About half of the revenue will be corporate income taxes; the rest is mostly royalties and other
taxes. Total revenue from coal will not exceed 2 percent of GDP. The LNG sector will not generate
any fiscal revenue before it starts production in 2020, other than possible windfall capital gain
taxes from the sale of stakes among investors.

Resource revenue is projected to become an important source of government
revenue in a decade. The bulk of the revenue will come from the LNG sector. While LNG
production would reach full capacity in 2023, fiscal revenue will increase only gradually over
course of the 2020s. This is because (i) gas companies pay lower corporate income tax in the first
8-10 years of production, and (ii) the government‘s share in profit gas will increase only gradually
due to cost-recovery provisions. The combined revenue from coal and LNG is projected to reach
9 percent of non-coal, non-LNG GDP by 2030, or about a quarter of all government revenue.4

This assumes that other government revenue will be about 27 percent of non-coal, non-LNG GDP in 2026,
slightly higher than the fiscal revenue to GDP ratio in 2012 (25 percent).

Appendix III—Mozambique: External Balance and
Reserve Adequacy Assessment1
Trade and Exchange Rate Developments
1.
Mozambique’s trade balance and current account have undergone major shifts in
with the onset of coal exports in 2011 and natural gas exploration activities. About 2/3 of
exports are from megaprojects, though traditional exports, especially from new large-scale farms,
have doubled between 2010 and 2012. Reflecting the fact that the older megaprojects have
reached their production phase, the megaprojects accounted only for about ¼ of imports in
2010. However, with the onset of large-scale new investments, megaproject imports constituted
over 1/3 of the total in 2012, and contributed to a sharp rise in service imports (largely for offshore exploration) since 2010. As a result, the current account deficit widened from 12 to 36 percent of GDP between 2010 and 2012.
2.
Exports are dominated by mega-projects (which account for over 60 percent of
total exports) and will continue so for the foreseeable future. Exports of aluminum and coal
currently account for most of current mega-project

Beginning in 2020, exports of liquid
natural gas (LNG) will transform the
composition of trade and the economy. When
LNG production reaches full capacity (projected to
be in 2023), LNG exports are projected to amount
to almost 30 percent of GDP and 50 percent of
total exports. Mozambique would become one of
the top 5 LNG exporters worldwide.

The real effective exchange rate
(REER) fluctuated somewhat in recent
years. The REER reached a peak in early
2009, then depreciated through late 2010,as
a result of the Bank of Mozambique
loosening monetary policy in response to
the global financial crisis. It recovered in
2011 as the authorities tightened monetary
policy, and depreciated slightly in 2012 and
early 2013 following the monetary easing,
Since 2011 the REER has remained above its
average level in previous years, which is
likely to be related partly to the start up of
coal exports in 2011, and thus could signal
future further appreciation.

6.
Traditional exports have performed

well. Between 2006 and 2012 traditional exports
grew almost 19 percent per year on average, led by 1100

Assessing the Exchange Rate
7.
The standard CGER calculations do not provide an accurate picture on the valuation
of the metical. Both the macro balance and external stability assessments show a large
overvaluation as they derive a current account norm based on econometric derivation of
parameters based on historical values. As noted above, however, the current account deficit has
more than tripled recently as a result of imports of goods and services related to the exploitation
of large, recently discovered natural gas reserves. Thus the standard CGER methodology needs to
be adapted to the Mozambican reality.

It is important to take into account the dominance of mega-projects (especially
natural gas) when assessing the exchange rate. Megaproject exports are virtually inelastic
to movements in the exchange rate. Moreover, the magnitude of the operations in the gas sector

come on line, LNG-related imports will
be reduced sharply and exports will boom, resulting in an abrupt reduction in the current
account deficit.
9.
Applying the CGER methodology excluding LNG from the current account shows
mixed results but suggests that the REER is relatively close to its equilibrium rate. The
deviation from the non-LNG current account norm is about 2 or 5 percentage points of GDP over
the medium term (in the

Mozambique under the small-country assumption was used instead of the standard CGER
elasticity.3 This yields a requisite depreciation of the exchange rate on the order of between -3
and 10 percent. Conversely, the equilibrium exchange rate calculation indicates an
undervaluation close to 8 percent primarily as a result of an increase in productivity in
Mozambique relative to trade partners

The Macro balance approach suggests a current account norm of –15 percent in 2018, compared to an
underlying non-LNG current balance of about –13 percent.

On balance staff views the exchange rate as broadly in line with fundamentals.
Developments in the coal and natural gas sectors will likely to cause the equilibrium exchange
rate to appreciate. The fact that traditional exports have grown at a strong pace points to
productivity gains.

prevention and mitigation benefits of holding reserves are balanced against the net financial cost

a shock and assuming various costs of holding reserves, the model shows optimal reserves
ranging from 4 months of imports (when the

External Competitiveness
14.
Even though the exchange rate appears broadly in line with the fundamentals,
Mozambique’s doing business indicators suggest there is a need for improvement in nonprice areas. It is lagging behind its peers in the region and has shown little progress under
various survey-based indicators, such as the Global Competitive Index and the World Bank‘s
Doing Business ratings. In 2012 Mozambique was ranked 139 out of 144 countries in terms of
competitiveness. It was also ranked near the bottom of the World Bank‘s latest Doing Business
rankings having dropped from 139 in 2012 to 146 in 2013.

These results suggest that improving external competitiveness will depend on
implementation of structural reforms. Several measures were implemented in 2012 to
facilitate doing business in Mozambique, such as Parliament authorizing the Government to
establish bankruptcy rules for insolvent companies and the simplification of rules and procedures
for licensing companies. More needs to be done, however, to improve external competitiveness,
including enhancement of institutions, infrastructure (such as transportation systems), the
provision of health and education services, and further steps to improve the business climate
(such as simplifying the procedure for starting a business). Mozambique is benefiting from
advice from the IFC in this area.

Appendix IV—Natural Gas, Public Investment and
Debt Sustainability1
1.
Coal mining and natural gas developments are likely to transform the Mozambican
economy over the next decades. In particular, in a decade, government revenues from liquefied
natural gas (LNG) could be substantial (up to 40 percent of total revenues). This represents an
opportunity to make growth-enhancing public investment but also a challenge to assure
macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability.
2.
Staff applied DIGNAR (Debt, Investment, Growth and Natural Resources) to the
Mozambican economy. 2 DIGNAR is a quantitative tool (developed by the Research Department
of the IMF) for analyzing the effects of public investment scaling-up in resource-abundant
developing countries and debt sustainability. The tool is based on a dynamic macroeconomic
model that captures the investment-growth nexus, as well as investment inefficiencies and
absorptive capacity constraints encountered in low-income countries.
3.

Given the uncertainty that typically surrounds LNG markets, two scenarios are analyzed:
a. a baseline scenario in which the LNG production is the same as that used for the
revenue projections obtained from the FARI model (developed by the Fiscal Affairs
Department of the IMF) and a price path observable in normal times. In particular,
production starts in 2020 and reaches a level of 1019 millions of cubic feet by 2023.
In this scenario LNG revenue rises to a peak of 40 percent of total revenues.
b. an adverse scenario in which average LNG production is smaller (80 percent of the
level in the baseline scenario), there are negative LNG price shocks of size typically
observable in oil and gas market crises as well as an earlier exhaustion of gas
reserves. In this scenario LNG revenues reach a peak of 20 percent of total revenues.

4.
Public investment, if properly planned and executed, has the potential to
significantly augment the stock of Mozambican public capital, positively impacting
productivity and hence non-LNG production and growth. However, it has to be stressed that
public investment does not automatically translate into productive public capital.

For the technical details of DIGNAR see Melina G., Yang S., and Zanna F. (2013) Debt Sustainability, Public
Investment and Natural Resources in Developing Countries, IMF Working Paper (forthcoming), Washington DC:
International Monetary Fund. The framework combines a debt sustainability analysis model (Buffie E., Berg A.,
Pattillo C., Portillo R., and Zanna L.F. (2012) Public Investment, Growth and Debt Sustainability: Putting Together
the Pieces, IMF Working Paper, 12/144, Washington DC: International Monetary Fund) and a natural resource
model (Berg A., Portillo R., Yang S., Zanna L.F. (forthcoming) Public Investment In Resource-Abundant Developing
Countries, IMF Economic Review).

5.
Empirical studies suggest that investment inefficiencies (poor planning, higherthan-expected costs, bad governance, corruption, supply bottlenecks, lack of
complementary infrastructure, etc.) are pervasive in developing countries. On average only
around half of public investment expenditure translates into effective public investment (i.e.
investment that enhances the public capital stock).
6.
If public investment is scaled up too quickly, the degree of inefficiency is likely to
increase, i.e. it is more likely to bump into absorptive capacity constraints. These are limits
on the level of public investment that the economy is able to retain. If the pace of the investment
scaling-up is too quick, these constraints are more likely to bind, investment efficiency is likely
drop further and hence a bigger part of investment expenditures will be wasted.
7.
Three alternative approaches to the public investment scaling up are explored
(Figure V.1).
a. A conservative approach would await the LNG revenues. Spending on growthenhancing investment projects (e.g. up a level 50 percent higher than 2012 in real terms)
would increase only in the years when LNG production starts. Public debt does not rise as
a share of GDP and declines over the longer term, thus no fiscal adjustment is required.
The start of LNG production would allow building strong fiscal buffers in the form of
government savings.
b. Under a gradual approach public investment is gradually increased in anticipation
of LNG production and it reaches its new level by the time production is in place.
This approach allows anticipating some of the LNG revenue. Public debt rises gradually to
a peak of 50 percent of GDP in 2019-20, then declines over the longer term to more
sustainable levels, thus the required fiscal adjustment (e.g. in terms of tax increases) is
small. The full roll-out of LNG production would allow building fiscal buffers in the form
of government savings from 2023 on.
c. An aggressive approach would fully anticipate future LNG revenues and increase
public investment spending massively early on (up to 8 percentage points of GDP).
However, due to absorptive capacity constraints, the higher investment spending delivers
a similar build-up in the public capital stock as under the gradual approach. The effect on
the additional non-LNG growth generated is dampened similarly. An aggressive
approach implies a much bigger build-up of public debt to 70 % of GDP in 2019-20, and
would require a painful fiscal adjustment in order to service the accumulated debt.

8.
In an adverse scenario with lower LNG production, lower LNG prices and an earlier
exhaustion of gas reserves, there would be no room to build up significant fiscal buffers.
Public debt would (i) not rise under the conservative approach, (ii) rise faster under a gradual
approach than in the baseline; (iii) rise explosively under an aggressive approach, requiring painful
and sustained fiscal adjustment without stopping the accumulation of debt. Simulations assume
that at least half of recurrent infrastructure costs are covered by user fees. Failure in collecting
fees exacerbates debt sustainability risks.
9.
If, over time, institutions, governance, management practices are improved, public
investment becomes, on average, more efficient and absorptive capacity constraints become less
binding. If investment projects are better designed, selected, and implemented, the average real
return of investment increases (Figure V.2). This will increase productivity of private factors for
production with a more positive impact on capital stock accumulation, growth and incomes. For
instance, a increase of average public investment efficiency from 60 to 80 per-cent over ten
years,3 combined with a better project selection that brings the average annual net economic
return on investment from 15 to 20 percent, deliver an increase in the additional non-LNG GDP
growth rate of more than half percentage point over a period of more than 15 years.
________________________________

Such an increase in efficiency has to be taken just as an example. In fact it can be very challenging for a
developing country to achieve such an efficiency improvement over ten years. This ultimately depends on policy
choices and individual country experiences.

10.
In sum, a gradual public investment scaling-up anticipating some but not all future
LNG revenue would be appropriate given Mozambique’s infrastructure investment needs
and the uncertainty regarding LNG production/revenue. Due to absorptive capacity
constraints, an aggressive approach is not likely to yield tangibly better growth outcomes and
poses threats to debt sustainability.
11.
Good governance and careful project selection and execution are key determinants
of the impact public investment has on growth. Optimizing the effectiveness of investment is
crucial to maximize its positive effects and limit the build-up of debt funding such investment.

Appendix V—Implementation of the Poverty
Reduction Strategy
Mozambique’s progress in implementing the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PARP 2011-14) has been
broadly satisfactory. Several key quantitative indicators of development—especially school enrolment
ratios and infant/maternal mortality rates—have shown clear improvements, but reflecting the broad
scope and long-term nature of the challenges, progress has been uneven.
1.

The PARP aims to induce patterns of inclusive growth by increasing the allocation of

funds for investment under the following pillars: (i) enhancing production and productivity in
agriculture and fishing; (ii) creating employment; and (iii) enhancing social and human development.
2.

Annual reports on progress under the PARP are produced by the government in its

report on economic developments (PES) as well as in a joint review by the government and a
core group of donors.


The annual PES provides a tabulation of detailed indicators of progress. While the 2013

report continues to highlight significant improvements in a broad range of social indicators,
progress has been uneven both across indicators and between different regions (see MEFP ¶4).
Progress has been strongest on improvements in school enrollment and infant/maternal
mortality rates, with less progress seen on access to medical staff, water and sanitation. The
government plans to undertake the next household expenditure survey in 2014/15 that will
provide a comprehensive view on social conditions. A more frequent survey using a much
smaller sample is also under preparation to enable higher frequency monitoring of progress.


The annual reviews with donors/development partners undertaken in May 2013concluded

that progress under the PARP has been sufficient to allow for the continuation of donor budget
support. The review highlighted important legal and institutional advances, including: (i) the
improvement of the legal framework for combating corruption (with the partial approval by
Parliament of the anti-corruption packge); (ii) the approval of the National Investment Plan for
the Agriculture Sector (PNISA), and (iii) the approval of simplified rules for the licensing of
companies. These and other legal and institutional advances have not yet, however, translated
into a clear increase in the production and productivity of small-scale agriculture or inmeeting
the increasing demand for technical and vocational skills. Additional steps discussed included
the need for: (i) a strong monitoring system with results-based indicators that can be measured
more frequently; (ii) more determined progress on reforms to business environment reforms

80

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

that has just started to build momentum, and (ii) a clear and unified vision on how to leverage
the largely unexplored resource wealth to transform and diversify Mozambique‘s economy.
3.

Budgetary spending/allocations in support of the PARP have increased. Key programs

for the period ahead to meet the PARP objectives are identified in the MEFP ¶19. Spending on
priority sectors has increased from just under half of spending in 2011 to almost ¾ in the 2013
budget, or from 15.9 percent of GDP in 2011 to 20.2 percent in 2012 and 26.2 percent in 2013. The
PFM reforms under way should allow a more detailed expenditure breakdown by function in coming
years.

FOR A THREE-YEAR POLICY SUPPORT INSTRUMENT AND
CANCELLATION OF CURRENT POLICY SUPPORT INSTRUMENT—
DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS (DSA)

Approved By
David Robinson and Vivek
Arora (IMF) and Marcelo
Giugale and Jeff Lewis
(World Bank)

Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and the International Development
Association (IDA)

This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) updates the joint IMF/IDA DSA from May 2012.
Mozambique moves from low to moderate risk of debt distress as the result of (i) a lower
discount rate, (ii) a significant increase in debt contracted in the last two years related to an
ambitious public investment program aimed at narrowing the infrastructure gap, and
facilitating the development of natural resources , and (iii) large movements in the underlying
balance of payments with the onset of coal exports and significant commercial investments in
natural gas exploration and liquefaction. Staffs agree with the authorities on the importance of
the public investment program for development. The increased risks to debt sustainability,
however, should be contained by moderating public external borrowing compared to its current
accelerated pace. The DSA highlights that further improvements in debt management and
investment planning capacity are important for continued debt sustainability, notably in the
case of commercial borrowing.1 As public debt is largely external, the evolution of total public
debt indicators mirrors that of public external debt. Private external debt is expected to increase
rapidly in importance, mainly driven by investment in the natural gas sector, and to comprise
the majority of external debt by the end of this decade.
1

The DSA presented in this document is based on the standard low-income countries (LIC) DSA
framework. See ―Debt Sustainability in Low-Income Countries: Further Considerations on an
Operational Framework, Policy Implications‖ (IMF/SM/05/109 and IDA/SECM2004/0629,
9/10/04). Under the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), Mozambique is rated as a
medium performer, albeit close to the threshold of 3.75 for strong performers, with an average
rating of 3.71 during 2009–11; the DSA uses the indicative threshold for medium performers.

UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS
1.
This DSA is consistent with the macroeconomic framework outlined in the Staff Report
for the Sixth Review under the PSI (Box 1). Compared to the previous DSA,1 the main changes in
this DSA are as follows:
a.

The medium-term macroeconomic framework has been revised (Text Table 1). In particular,
economic growth slows in 2013 as a result of widespread flooding early in the year that damaged
agricultural output and transport infrastructure. Growth is projected to bounce back quickly and
accelerate over the medium term as agriculture recovers, extractive industries boom, and
infrastructure investments materialize. The fiscal deficit was lower in 2012, among other factors
because of windfall capital gain tax revenues received. Significant revisions have been made to the
balance of payments that result in larger current account deficits and larger FDI inflows—both
historically and in the projections. The bulk of the revision is related to megaprojects, particularly the
inclusion of imports of goods and services related to exploration in the natural gas sector; the
counterpart of these imports is a large increase in recorded inward FDI.

Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions 2013–33
The medium-term assumptions in the baseline scenario for 2013-33 are consistent with the
medium-term macroeconomic framework underlying the Staff Report for the Sixth Review under
the Policy Support Instrument.
Non-LNG Real GDP growth is projected to be around 8 percent on average in the next few
years and 7½ percent in the longer term. Growth will slow down in 2013 due to the impact of
floods, but is expected to accelerate over the medium term, supported by recovery in agricultural
production, expansion in coal mining, and infrastructure investments in the pipeline, including to
support coal exports and LNG manufacturing. Growth is sustained in the long term by strong
population/labor force growth, continued infrastructure investment, and related productivity
gains. Risks to growth include public investment not achieving expected payoffs and thus
limiting productivity gains, and the possibility of Dutch disease effects. The government is aware
of the risks, and is taking steps to strengthen project evaluation and selection, and is considering
options such as fiscal rules and sovereign wealth funds to mitigate the risk of excessive real
exchange rate appreciation.
LNG sector. LNG plants are assumed to be under construction during 2014–22. The projection
assumes a moderate-sized plant consisting of four LNG manufacturing units (―trains‖). One train
is assumed to start production in 2020, followed by a second train in 2021, and the third and the
fourth train will start production in 2023. Total investment is projected at $40 billion. The sector‘s
contribution to GDP is expected to be small during the construction period due to a high import
content. Annual LNG output will reach 20 million tons in 2023, contributing more than 20 percent
of nominal GDP by then.
Consumer price inflation is projected to rise to 5–6 percent in 2013, owing to rising food prices
and an increase in public transport fares in late 2012 and also reduced domestic food supply as a
result of the floods. As per the Central Bank medium term target, inflation is assumed to stabilize
at around 5½ percent over the forecast period beginning from 2014.
Growth of exports is projected to stabilize at around 5 percent a year in the longer term as coal
and LNG exports stabilize. In the shorter term export growth rates show sharp changes as a result
of coal and LNG operations. In particular the growth rate of exports would almost double in
2020-23 due to LNG exports coming on line.
Imports are projected to increase sharply in 2014 during the LNG plant construction phase and
their growth would stabilize at around 9 percent a year in the long term.
The non-interest external current account deficit is projected to rise to over 40 percent of
GDP in the medium term largely driven by LNG-related imports. The deficit will be primarily
financed through FDI and private external borrowing. It would then stabilize at around 8 percent
of GDP in the long term as coal exports increase with transport capacity and as LNG exports start.
The non-interest primary fiscal deficit is projected to widen in 2013 and 2014, reflecting high
public investment in the pipeline to mitigate the infrastructure gap. The fiscal balance would
improve in the medium to long term as public investment tapers off to more sustainable levels
and non-interest spending falls in percent of GDP terms. The fiscal balance is expected to
improve further from 2020 onwards once LNG revenue commences.

b. The natural gas sector. The baseline scenario in this DSA has incorporated the emerging gas
sector in Mozambique. The basis for the development of the sector is one of the largest
worldwide discoveries of gas. These developments result in: (i) higher foreign direct investment
and private external borrowing for exploration (since 2010) and the construction of a 4-train gas
liquefaction (LNG) plant (2014-2022); (ii) increased imports of goods and services related to LNG;
and (iii) increased GDP and exports from 2020 onwards when the LNG plant becomes
operational. Under baseline assumptions, the LNG sector will contribute 20 percent of GDP and
half of exports by 2023. LNG-related fiscal revenue will be small in the beginning owing to cost
recovery provisions. Revenue will gradually increase over the medium to long term.
c. The coal mining sector. Coal production is expected to expand rapidly over the medium term
to 20 million tons (6 percent of GDP) in 2017 from about 5 million tons (2 percent of GDP) in
2012. Most of the coal produced will be for exports—high quality coking coal—while the
abundant lower-value thermal coal is not currently marketed due to transport capacity
constraints. Coal-related investments in mines, railways, ports, and a coal-fired power plant are
conservatively expected to amount to $5 billion during 2013–17, financed by FDI inflows.
Adverse world coal price movements constitute a risk to these expansion plans, which could
result in delayed implementation or scaling back.
d. The related substantial BOP revisions show much larger changes in variables, especially FDI,
and thus larger volatility than assumed in the last DSA. The related standard shocks in the DSA
template produce larger deviations from the baseline scenario, and thus make breaches of the
sustainability thresholds more likely and more prolonged than in the last DSA.
e. A revised public investment and external borrowing profile. Thus far, disbursements,
particularly of nonconcessional loans, have been lower than expected in the previous DSA,
mainly because of a somewhat slower start of projects. Disbursement are projected to increase
in 2013–16, in line with the recent increase in the non-concessional borrowing ceiling to $1.6 billion under the current IMF-supported program and the proposed non-concessional borrowing
ceiling under the successor program, but also through a notable increase in bilateral
concessional loans (Text Table 2). Following the acceleration of external borrowing through end2013, the authorities plan to moderate the pace of new borrowing over the medium term (Text
Figure 1). Starting at the end of this decade, new public sector borrowing is expected to decline
gradually relative to GDP in light of the coming on stream of natural resource-related revenue
from the coal and natural gas sectors. Nominal disbursements, however, are projected to
continue increasing throughout the projection period. Other large potential future investment
projects, e.g. in railroads, the LNG and power sectors, are deemed commercially viable by the
authorities and would be expected to be undertaken largely by the private sector, without
substantial need for government financing or guarantees. However, these projects could
constitute a risk for the public debt trajectory if significant government financing became
necessary. Another risk is that pressures may emerge and make it difficult to slow the future
pace of public loan contracting, particularly in light of the country‘s vast infrastructure needs.
Finally, project costs could be underestimated, as was the case for the Nacala airport.

f.

A revised grant element in financing terms for future borrowing. This DSA assumes that the
grant element for new borrowing will experience a pronounced decline during the next two
decades, contrary to the previous DSA that assumed a roughly constant 30-percent grant
element. This reflects revised assumptions on the long-run availability of donor financing with
government relying increasingly on commercial borrowing.

g. The reduction of the DSA discount rate from 4 percent a year ago to 3 percent in this DSA
yields a higher present value of debt/borrowing in this DSA compared to the previous one.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
2.
External debt is projected to rise rapidly during this decade, reflecting mainly private
sector investment in the natural gas sector. External debt (both public and private) is expected to
peak at about 128 percent of GDP in 2019, at which time private sector debt will constitute about
two thirds of total external debt. With investment in the coal sector projected to be financed
through foreign direct investment, this increase in private external debt is mostly driven by
investments in the natural gas sector. Public sector debt is also expected to peak in 2018 at 45
percent of GDP (in PV terms) on the back of infrastructure investment. The significant buildup of
private sector external debt needs to be monitored by the authorities to contain vulnerabilities.
However, with renowned global companies leading investments in the natural resource sector, the
risk for government contingent liabilities or other vulnerabilities beyond those specific to the natural
resource operations is currently considered to be low.315
3.
All baseline public external debt indicators remain below their respective thresholds
but now come closer to the thresholds than previously (Figure 1).4 While the indicators remain
contained throughout the projection period, they are significantly higher than at the time of the last
DSA, especially the PV of debt relative to GDP. It now peaks around 39 percent (in 2018), relative to
a 28½ percent peak in the previous DSA. The beginning of LNG production, however, and the
ensuing surge in GDP would drop the ratio safely back down to below 33 percent in the next decade
(Table 1). The increase of debt ratios is partly due to the lowering of the discount rate from 4 to
3 percent, which contributed to about one third (3 percentage points) of the increase in the PV of
debt to GDP ratio. PV of debt to GDP ratio would be about 6 percentage points lower throughout
the DSA period if the discount rate were at the longer-term historical average benchmark rate of
about 5 percent instead of the 3 percent assumed in this DSA (Figure 1 and Table 2).
16

3

Likewise, the risk of BOP pressures emerging as a direct result of mega project-related investment activity is
considered to be low. Care will have to be taken in the long term, however, once revenues from these ventures
materialize, as these may be volatile reflecting world commodity prices and in relation to imports. Moreover, large
natural resource exports then also hold competitiveness risks emerging from a possible exchange rate appreciation,
which will have to be carefully managed.

4.
External debt ratios remain vulnerable to FDI and exchange rate shocks. The threshold
for the PV of debt to GDP ratio is breached under stress tests for a sustained period.5 A sharp
reduction in non-debt creating FDI in 2014-2015 would push the PV Debt/GDP ratio well above the
40 percent threshold during the second half of this decade, with a peak at more than 80 percent
(Figure 1). Apart from the FDI shock, a sharp depreciation of the metical in 2014 also leads to
breaches of this threshold (Table 2). Both shocks lead to a significant overshooting of the threshold
for a sustained period: 13 years for the FDI shock and 19 years for the depreciation shock.6 The
impact of these two shocks is now much larger than in the previous DSA given revisions to historical
BOP data to account for FDI-financed natural gas exploration.7 The PV of debt will also breach two
other thresholds: 150 percent of exports, and 250 percent of revenue under the FDI shock scenario.8
The thresholds for the PV of debt to export ratio is breached by a number of indicators, particularly
a shock to non-debt creating flows. In many countries with large natural resource sectors, price
volatility adds another source of risks to external debt sustainability. Given the long-term nature of
the contracts that usually govern LNG development – including buying prices – the risk of significant
volatility for external debt sustainability seems relatively small.

5.

Ensuring that LNG production materilizes is crucial for Mozambique’s debt

sustainability. The LNG sector will contribute significantly to GDP, exports and government
revenue. A gradual public investment scaling-up under the baseline scenario anticipating some LNG
revenue would be appropriate given Mozambique‘s infrastructure investment needs. If, however,
LNG production or revenue is much lower than expected, the debt ratios would be higher over the
medium to long term.9

21

PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
6.
The evolution of public debt indicators (including domestic debt) mirrors that of the
external indicators because of the predominance of external debt (Table 3 and Figure 2). The
medium-term increase in public debt reflects the temporary surge in public investment financed in
part by external borrowing on non-concessional terms. Under the baseline scenario, the PV of public

5

The scenario in which variables are at their historical levels has been omitted given that it generates negative debt
as a result of the large changes in variables in the baseline arising from LNG activities.
6

The charts in Figure 1 display the stress test with the most adverse outcome in 2023.

7

The BOP data revisions in 2010-2012 to account for natural gas exploration lead to a higher increase in FDI
compared to previous years. As a result, the DSA‘s stress scenario for non-debt creating capital flows now assumes
that these flows are subject to higher volatility than in the previous DSA.
8

These breaches, however, should not be overemphasized as a fall in FDI would likely be linked to lower imports
rather than higher borrowing as implicitly assumed in the standard shock scenario.
9

See Staff Report for the 2013 Article IV Consultation, Appendix V ―Natural Gas, Public Investment and Debt
Sustainability‖ for discussions on public investment scaling up and risks to the debt sustainability from adverse LNG
production and price shocks.

debt remains below 50 percent of GDP throughout, therefore remaining well contained below
indicative benchmarks that research has linked to increased probability of debt distress.10
22

7.
The public DSA illustrates that it is essential for debt sustainability to moderate the
pace of new borrowing as is planned by the authorities. In other words, the fiscal primary
balance will need to be reduced in the medium and long run. For illustrative purposes, the ―Fix
Primary Balance‖ scenario11 shows the impact if the primary balance were fixed at values of its peak
years 2013-15, i.e. if such a slowing in new borrowing would not take place.12 Debt ratios would
continue to rise throughout the projection period, quickly elevating risks to debt sustainability, no
matter which assumptions are made on LNG production.
23

24

CONCLUSIONS
8.
In staffs view, while the standard DSA shocks indicate that Mozambique would be in
the moderate risk of debt distress category, the public investment program should continue
to move forward but with a more moderate pace of public borrowing. Even against the
background of a temporarily accelerated borrowing pace for infrastructure projects, the baseline
debt trajectories remain below their respective thresholds throughout. Importantly, debt service
indicators remain substantially below their thresholds, including under stress tests, and reflect
conservative assumptions regarding the grant element for future borrowing.13 The breaches under
the stress tests are temporary, would be reversed by the coming on stream of LNG production, and
seem manageable against the backdrop of the authorities‘ strong track record of prudent economic
management.
25

9.
This analysis highlights three important points for debt sustainability. First, it will be
important to continue to improve debt management and investment planning capacity to ensure
that the increasing share of non-concessional resources in the stock of debt is well managed and
that the most deserving public investment projects are selected and yield their desired payoff.
Second, it will be important for the authorities after 2013 to moderate the pace of new borrowing to
maintain debt sustainability, in line with their commitments. Third, it is becoming more important—
including from a debt sustainability perspective—to ensure that LNG production materializes in
order to lock in the beneficial effects on GDP and fiscal revenue.

10

At Mozambique‘s CPIA rating, the indicative public debt benchmark signaling higher risk of debt distress lies
between 56 and 74 percent for the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio. See IMF, 2012, ―Revisiting the Debt Sustainability
Framework for Low-Income Countries.‖
11

See Figure 2 and Table 4 (lines A2).

12

To provide this illustration, the ―Fix Primary Balance‖ scenario was adapted for this analysis from the standard of
fixing the primary balance at 2012, instead fixing the primary balance at its 2013-15 average value in percent of GDP.
This change was implemented, because the 2012 primary balance is low compared to those in the near future for two
reasons: (i) because of windfall revenues in 2012, and (ii) because major investment projects are only starting.
13

Moreover, these indicators do not account for other buffers, such as comfortable levels of international reserves
relative to non-mega project imports.

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.

1/ A discount rate of 5 percent is applied to the calcualtions of NPV of debt (discount rate is 3 percent in the baseline.)
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Implementation of Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief (PCDR): Not Applicable
Safeguards assessment
An update safeguards assessment of the Bank of Mozambique (BM) was completed on January 11,
2010 for the ESF. The assessment found improvements in financial reporting practices following the
implementation of IFRS. It noted vulnerabilities in the oversight mechanism for external and internal
auditing, controls, financial reporting, and in the BM‘s legal structure. It recommended that the BM
commission an external quality assurance review of the internal audit function.
Exchange Rate Arrangement
Mozambique has a de jure and de facto floating exchange rate arrangement. The exchange rate is
largely determined in the interbank foreign exchange market (MCI). The BM regularly intervenes in
the market to smooth seasonal fluctuations, provide foreign exchange liquidity received by the
government in the form of aid, and sterilize domestic liquidity as part of its monetary policy
operations.
On May 20, 2011, Mozambique accepted its obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the
Fund‘s Articles of Agreement (www.imf.org). A new foreign exchange law—―Foreign Exchange Law‖
Law No. 11/2009—came into effect on March 11, 2009. A new foreign exchange regulation to
implement the foreign exchange law—the ―Regulation for the Foreign Exchange Law‖ (the
―Regulation‖) (Decreto No. 83/2010)—was issued on December 31, 2010. The Regulation, in
conjunction with the implementing norms subsequently issued by the BM, fully removed the existing
exchange restrictions subject to Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund‘s Articles of Agreement
as of July 11, 2011. The two existing multiple currency practices (MCP) were also removed. The MCP
arising from the foreign exchange auction system was removed on April 27, 2011 through the
adoption of a new regulation on the interbank exchange market and that discontinued the previous
multiple price foreign exchange auction system, which in any case had not been used since 2009. The
5

The MDRI provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries qualified for the assistance.
Grant assistance from the MDRI Trust and HIPC resources provide debt relief to cover the full stock of
debt owed to the Fund as of end-2004 outstanding at the time the member qualifies for debt relief.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

MCP arising from the absence of a mechanism to prevent potential deviations between the rate used
by the BM in its foreign exchange transactions in the interbank foreign exchange market and in its
transactions with the government, public entities and the World Bank was removed on July 1, 2011
through the adoption of a new mechanism for the determination of the exchange rate for such
transactions of which the relevant parties have been notified on August 11, 2011.
AML/CFT framework
Mozambique‘s first AML/CFT Mutual Evaluation Report by the Eastern and Southern Africa AntiMoney Laundering Group (ESAAMLG) has been formally adopted by ESAAMLG and published on its
website. Based on the deficiencies identified in the report, the Financial Action Task Force‘s (FATF)
International Co-operation Review Group (ICRG) maintains Mozambique in a pool of jurisdictions
which may be taken up for review. This process is designed to publicly identify high-risk jurisdictions,
and could ultimately result in a public statement by the FATF to apply counter-measures. In order to
improve compliance with the FATF Recommendations, the Financial Intelligence Unit (GIFIM) has
begun its operations and is working towards membership of the Egmont Group of Financial
Intelligence Units. However, the number of suspicious transaction reports (STRs) still appears to be
low. Once the AML/CFT law is approved by Parliament, the BM intends to issue implementing
guidelines. In order to ensure a consistent application of the AML/CFT framework across various
regulators, the Government has established and appointed the members of the National AML/CFT
Task Force in December 2011. The AML/CFT strategic plan has been approved by the Council of
Ministers and will be submitted to ESAAMLG.
Article IV Consultation
In accordance with Decision No 12794–(02/76), as amended by Decision No 12854–(02/96),
Mozambique is on a 24-month Article IV cycle due to the approval of the successor PSI in June 2010.
The 2011 Article IV consultation was completed by the Executive Board on June 17, 2011 (Country
Report No. 11/149).
In concluding the 2011 Article IV consultation, Executive Directors commended the authorities for
their prudent policies that have resulted in a strong economic performance. They noted that,
although Mozambique‘s medium-term prospects continue to be favorable, significant challenges
remain in managing macroeconomic risks and ensuring that the benefits from growth are shared
fairly across the population. In this regard, Directors underscored that safeguarding price stability
and containing inflation expectations remain key policy priorities for the period ahead. They
welcomed the authorities‘ new Poverty Reduction Strategy (PARP), including its focus on continued
structural reforms to improve productivity and production in labor-intensive sectors such as
agriculture, create jobs through improvements in the business environment, and pursue social and
human development. These focus areas will be important to achieve sustained growth and poverty
reduction. Directors supported the authorities‘ prudent fiscal stance aimed at preserving
macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability, and encouraged the authorities to adopt a prudent
approach to generating additional budgetary revenue from the natural resource sector while
protecting Mozambique as a destination for foreign investment. Directors emphasized the
importance of adhering to a prudent borrowing strategy, further strengthening debt management,
and improving investment planning. They noted the resilience of the banking system during the
global crisis, and recommended continued vigilance in light of remaining vulnerabilities.

Ex post assessment of performance under Fund-supported programs
An ex post assessment (EPA) of Mozambique‘s performance under Fund-Supported Programs since
1987 was undertaken in December 2003 under the guidelines on assessments of countries with a
longer-term program engagement. The EPA was circulated to the Executive Board on November 21,
2003 (Country Report No. 04/53).
Directors commended the authorities for their pursuit of sound macroeconomic policies and wide
ranging structural reforms over the past fifteen years which contributed to strong growth of the
economy, and a steady decline in poverty rates. Noting that despite considerable progress
Mozambique remains a very poor and vulnerable country, Directors urged the authorities to
persevere in their efforts to consolidate macroeconomic stability and accelerate and deepen
structural reforms with a view to sustaining economic growth, encouraging employment creation,
and further reducing poverty.
FSAP participation and ROSCs
A Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) for Mozambique was undertaken during the first
quarter of 2003. The related Financial Sector Stability Assessment was circulated to the Executive
Board on November 19, 2003 (Country Report No. 04/52). An update to the FSAP took place in
February 2009 and the related Financial Sector Stability Assessment circulated to the Board on June
19, 2009 (Country Report No. 10/12). A ROSC on fiscal transparency was issued on February 22, 2001.
This ROSC was updated in the context of the 2002 Article IV consultation (Country Report
No. 02/140) and the 2003 Article IV Consultation (Country Report No. 04/50). The ROSC on fiscal
transparency was updated in May 2008. A Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC)
data module was prepared in June 2002 and issued on March 5, 2003. This data module was updated
in August 2005.
Management’s visit
At the invitation of the authorities, Mr. Kato, Deputy Managing Director, visited Maputo,
Mozambique in July 2005. Mr. de Rato, Managing Director, visited Mozambique on August 2007 for
a meeting with the African Consultative Group on Quotas, Voice, and Representation. Mr. Lipton,
Deputy Managing Director, visited Maputo, in May 2013.
Resident representative
Mr. Victor Lledo has been the IMF‘s resident representative to Mozambique since June 21, 2010.

WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION
(As of May 8, 2013)
59.
The Fund Mozambique team met with the World Bank Mozambique team in Maputo
during the sixth PSI review mission in April 2013. The objective was to identify macro-critical
structural reforms and to coordinate the two teams' work for the period May 2013 to April 2014.
2.
The teams agreed that Mozambique's main macroeconomic challenge is to sustain
higher and more inclusive economic growth going forward. To meet this challenge, Mozambique
needs to enable broader-based economic activity led by the private sector, in particular in areas
where it has competitive advantages, such as agriculture, trade-related services in support of
booming commodity export sectors, labor-intensive manufacturing, and tourism. Given the low level
of infrastructure, this will entail policies and reforms to boost public investment, coupled with
enhancements in the business environment. As traditional aid is on a gradual declining trend,
increasing public investment may require resorting to nonconcessional financing and stepping up
capacity in the investment selection and debt management areas.
3.
Based on this shared assessment, the teams identified seven structural reform areas as
macro-critical, in view of their central role in achieving higher and more inclusive growth:
Debt management and investment planning. The authorities‘ ambitious investment program will
need to be backed by a strong reform agenda to enhance capacity to manage fiscal risks and ensure
value for money. In the field of investment selection, several measures are being implemented to
establish an investment pipeline and define project selection standards and protocols. A new legal
framework supporting private-public partnership and concessions is being implemented. Debt
management will be strengthened to ensure that borrowing and investment decisions entail value
for money. This is underpinned by a new medium-term debt strategy.
Public financial management. The focus will be on enhancing the capacity to manage risks outside
the central government, including in the area of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and decentralized
administrative units. To achieve this objective, the authorities will step up risk-based controls and
audits, continue rolling out their new PFM system, and enhance budget execution and monitoring
reports. Other critical measures aim at enhancing control of the wage bill, both in budget
preparation and execution. These reforms are macro-critical since they will create fiscal space needed
to reduce poverty and increase priority spending, while managing risks related to SOE‘s large-scale
investment plans and enhancing the government‘s oversight.
Tax administration. Despite the strong increase in revenue collections, the tax system is still
complex to administer and comply with. It is marked by numerous tax benefits and an overall low
contribution from the mega-project sectors. Going forward, the government plans to facilitate tax
compliance through electronic tax payment and continue to expand the tax base to cover the large
informal sector. The revenue management system will be enhanced, in line with a set of agreed
performance indicators. The large tax-payers unit will be made fully operational.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

109

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

Social safety nets. Two decades of high GDP growth have not yet resulted in significant poverty
reduction. This, in turn, undermines the country‘s long-term growth potential. To address this, the
authorities have started to strengthen their safety nets. Measures include: (i) rationalizing and
expanding health insurance coverage; (ii) strengthening higher education and vocational training;
(iii) strengthening the financial sustainability and administration of the National Social Security Fund,
and creating a new pension system for private sector workers; and (iv) improving the targeting of
social protection systems to the most needy. These measures are macro-critical, as better health and
education services, stronger pensions systems, and a more effective social safety net can enhance the
productivity of the workforce and support social cohesion.
Natural resource wealth. Mozambique is endowed with rich natural resource reserves which are
largely not exploited so far. With the recently started coal projects in Tete and a series of other
projects in the coming years, the extractive sector is slated for a boom which could make significant
contributions to the country‘s economic growth and government revenues. This poses challenges for
economic management, the sector‘s legal and regulatory frameworks and the government‘s capacity
in managing contracts and revenues. In addition, Mozambique has attained full membership of the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).
Investment climate. Mozambique's private sector is held back by the high costs of doing business.
These arise mainly from weaknesses in governance, access to finance, power supply, tax and
regulatory systems, and contract enforcement. Wide-ranging reforms are needed to address these
issues. They are macro-critical because a better investment climate is conducive to supporting
private sector activities, thereby broadening the country‘s productive and export base, creating jobs,
and thus helping reduce poverty.
Financial sector stability and development. Strong past growth of credit to the private sector, the
expansion of the banking system and its potential exposure to cross-border risks call for
strengthening the continuous supervision of the financial sector, as well as the capacity to identity
and address potential sources of vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, improving financial intermediation and
access to credit remains a top priority. To this end, the authorities have prepared the 2013-22
Financial Sector Development Strategy which includes a wide-ranging and clearly sequenced action
plan, covering ways to, among other things, enhance financial inclusion, competition, consumer
protection, and financial literacy.

4.

The teams agreed on the following division of labor:

Debt management and investment planning reforms. The Fund will continue to play a key role in
building government capacity to assess debt sustainability and define a coherent debt strategy
through TA and continued support from HQ. Both institutions will assist the authorities in
strengthening their debt management capacity, with TA support from the Fund and on-site
assistance from the Bank. The Fund will continue to play a key role in helping the authorities plan
investments, in line with recent TA and program commitments. The Bank will continue providing
technical assistance for enhancing project investment management. The Fund review missions will
provide further opportunities to assess progress in this field and discuss possible actions with the
Bank.

110

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

Public financial management reform. The Bank and the Fund will cooperate in the field of rolling
out the new PFM system to cover local administrations and SOEs engaging in large-scale
infrastructure investments. The Fund will secure its support through regular TA missions from its
AFRITAC South office. The Bank will provide ongoing consultation from its local office and
supervision missions of projects under implementation in this area. The Fund program review
missions will provide further opportunities to assess progress in this field.
Tax administration reforms. The Fund will provide support through ongoing advice based on
regular TA. The Bank will advance reforms in this area in the context of its business environment
policies and portfolio.
Social safety net reform. The Bank will take the lead in this field through continued TA in the design
of more comprehensive and performing safety nets, in cooperation with other development partners
and international organizations (including UNICEF and ILO). The Fund will play its role in identifying
the fiscal space for the safety nets. The results will be discussed among the collaborators on a regular
basis, so as to inform policy discussions with the authorities. The Bank is also taking the lead in
public pension reforms.
Natural resource wealth. The Fund will provide TA under the newly established Topical Trust Fund
for Managing Natural Resource Wealth (TTF-MNRW), relating to the fiscal regime of the extractive
sector, revenue forecasting, and natural resource statistics, all being crucial to increase the sector‘s
contribution to the budget and support the country‘s development agenda. The Bank is supporting
Mozambique‘s implementation of EITI through its Multi-donor Trust Fund (MDTF). The Bank also
funds the update of the mining law and regulations and the model mining contract, and the
development of a concessions database for gas and mining projects to support the government's
forecasting and contract monitoring functions. The Bank is also implementing a program of
analytical support for enhanced fiscal policy in a resource rich setting, including a public expenditure
review.
Investment climate reform. The Bank will take the lead in working with government to enhance the
investment climate, by deepening its agenda to help the authorities cut red tape and simplify the
legal and regulatory framework. The results will be shared on an ongoing basis and discussed during
the Fund program review missions.
Financial sector stability and development. The Fund will continue to help the Bank of
Mozambique to build its capacity to assess risks to financial stability of the banking sector, while the
Bank will take the lead in supporting financial sector development and reforms, including through
enhanced financial inclusion, competition, consumer protection, and financial literacy. The results of
their respective work will be shared and discussed regularly.
5.

The teams have the following requests for information from their counterparts:



The Fund team requests to be kept informed of progress in the above macro-critical
structural reform areas. Timing: when milestones are reached; and at least semiannually

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
Despite the increase in budget resources allocated to the compilation of official statistics,
continued high reliance on external funding raises concerns about the sustainability of the
programs of the National Institute of Statistics (INE). The authorities are making efforts to
improve the quality and timeliness of economic and financial data through participation in the
Fund‘s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and in the external sector module of the
GDDS Project for Anglophone African Countries (funded by the U.K. Department for International
Development (DFID)). Weaknesses exist, particularly in the areas of national accounts, prices, and
government finance statistics.
Real sector statistics: The national accounts are prepared by the INE in accordance with the 1993
System of National Accounts (1993 SNA). In August 2007, the INE released quarterly GDP estimates
at constant prices covering 2000–07 for the first time, along with a revised annual GDP series for
the period 1991–2006, with 2003 as the new base year. The authorities are working to strengthen
quarterly national accounts compilation at current prices. The INE‘s new household income and
expenditure survey and economic censuses leading to a new business registry still need to be
incorporated to strengthen the national accounts. A revamped consumer price index for Maputo
based on weights derived from the 2008–09 household survey was released in February 2011. A
national index obtained by integrating the indices for Maputo, Beira, and Nampula was released in
April 2006. INE has adopted a new software from INE Portugal which helps to correct a probable
downward bias caused by carry-forward techniques for discontinued products. Several issues
remain outstanding, however, including how to improve the housing market rent sample and
expand coverage to include the Quelimane and Greater Maputo areas. There are insufficient
sectoral labor market and employment data, and where available, they have limited coverage. A
one-year labor market survey of the entire country, undertaken by INE in collaboration with the
Labor Ministry, was launched in October 2004.
Monetary and financial statistics: A 2004 work plan was developed to implement the Monetary
and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM) and develop an integrated monetary database (IMD) to
meet the needs of the Bank of Mozambique (BM), AFR, and STA. In November 2007 the IMD was
completed and allows the derivation of accurate and timely monthly monetary statistics, while
reducing BM‘s reporting burden.
Balance of payments: With assistance from STA, provided in the context of the GDDS regional
project, the BM has made significant progress toward compiling and disseminating balance of
payments (BOP) and international investment position (IIP) statistics that are fully aligned with
the Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5). The BM has an adequate institutional
framework for the compilation of BOP and IIP statistics. However, further strengthening of
114

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

external sector statistics needs to focus on: strengthening information technology (especially to
apply data warehouse and on-line analytical processing tools); excluding the effects of price and
exchange rate fluctuations from reserve asset flows; applying a methodology (provided through
STA technical assistance) to estimate reinvested profits and stocks of financial assets and
liabilities held abroad by the nonfinancial public sector; improving business surveys; publishing
methodological notes, in general, and more data covering the Reserves Template, foreign direct
investment, goods trade and current transfers; and beginning the gradual process to implement
the new Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, sixth edition. Joint
work with other institutions to improve the quality of external trade data, especially with regard
to price and volume indices, also merits attention.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Mozambique commenced its participation in

prepared. Improvements in the institutional
environment and increased allocation of
resources for the compilation of national
accounts and balance of payments statistics
aimed to address weaknesses in the
prerequisites for the quality of the statistics.
Methodological soundness, accuracy, and
reliability of macroeconomic statistics began to
show improvements as a result of these efforts.

Mozambique does not report fiscal data for publication in the IFS or the Government Finance
Statistic Yearbook (GFSY). Mozambique now reports monthly monetary data to STA using the
standardized reporting forms (SRFs). As a result, these enhanced data are being published in the
International Financial Statistics (IFS) Supplement. In 2007, the BM started to compile and report
comprehensive IIP data in the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with
Mozambique
On June 24, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Mozambique.1
Background
Mozambique has sustained strong economic growth over nearly two decades, helped by foreign
investment, mainly in mega-projects in the natural resource sector, and generous support by
development partners. However, while poverty has been reduced, more than half of the
population still lives below the national poverty line. Improvements have been most pronounced
in the more affluent Southern regions and in urban centers, especially the Maputo area. This
underlines the need for building a more inclusive growth through economic diversification,
employment creation, and the expansion of social protection.
Mozambique’s economy remains robust, despite a still-fragile world economic environment
resulting from the financial crisis. Reflecting the rapid expansion in coal production as well as in
financial services, transport and communications, and agriculture, Mozambique’s real gross
domestic product (GDP) growth is estimated to have reached 7½ percent in 2012. Severe
floods in early 2013 have had a significant impact, destroying crops in the South and severely
damaging infrastructure. But real GDP is still projected to grow by around 7 percent this year as
mining expands further and overall agricultural production is set to recover speedily. Consumer
price inflation slowed sharply to 2.2 percent in December 2012, one of the lowest in the region.
In early 2013, floods pushed up food prices, though inflation is projected to remain low at
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares
a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can
be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

around 5-6 percent over the medium term. External transactions are increasingly dominated by
large private investments in the mining and hydrocarbon sectors, financed mostly by foreign
direct investment and some private borrowing abroad. Fiscal performance has been largely in
line with the program. External borrowing has risen in 2012 as the authorities have stepped up
borrowing on commercial terms to fund investments; overall debt levels remain low.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the authorities for their policies, which have translated into a strong
macroeconomic performance in recent years. While the medium-term growth outlook is
favorable, it will be important to manage risks stemming from the external and internal
environments. Directors called for continued commitment to sound policies and structural
reforms to preserve macroeconomic stability, foster inclusive growth, and reduce poverty.
Recognizing the need to support public investment and social development, Directors
emphasized the importance of fiscal prudence as revenues from extractive industries will
remain modest in the near term. To limit fiscal risks, they advised prioritization of current
spending, in particular containing the wage bill. They also called for steps to modernize revenue
administration, strengthen public financial management, and ensure timely settlement of VAT
refunds. Directors also saw merit in developing a fiscal policy framework that incorporates the
anticipated natural resource receipts over the medium term.
Directors acknowledged that the current high level of public investment can make an important
contribution to improving infrastructure and enabling Mozambique to access its natural resource
wealth. However, they recommended careful monitoring of the pace and effectiveness of these
investments in order to maximize returns, avoid hitting absorptive capacity constraints, and
preserve debt sustainability. In this context, Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to
strengthen their medium-term debt strategy as well as project selection and monitoring.
Directors endorsed the authorities’ monetary policy stance but underscored the need to remain
vigilant and tighten policy if inflationary pressures emerge. They welcomed steps underway to
improve monetary operations and strengthen the transmission mechanisms.
Directors agreed that the banking system has shown resilience during the global financial crisis.
In light of the ongoing expansion of the financial sector, they endorsed the authorities’ efforts to
develop stress-testing capacity and strengthen prudential regulations. Directors welcomed
progress in establishing a banking crisis resolution framework and adopting risk-based
surveillance. Implementation of the new Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of
Terrorism (AM/CFT) law should support further anti-corruption efforts. They looked forward to
the vigorous implementation of the new Financial Sector Development Strategy.

Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to implement their Poverty Reduction Strategy.
A renewed focus on job creation, improvements in agricultural productivity, and economic
diversification hold the key to more inclusive growth in the period ahead.

IMF Executive Board Completes Sixth Review Under Policy Support Instrument for
Mozambique and Approves a New Three-Year PSI
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the sixth
and final review under Mozambique‘s Policy Support Instrument (PSI) and approved a
new three-year PSI. To this end, the Executive Board took note of the member‘s
cancellation of the current PSI, which was scheduled to expire on July 31, 2013 (see Press
Release No. 10/242). In completing the review, the Board also approved waivers for the
non-observance of the end-December 2012 assessment criteria on the stock of reserve
money and the net credit to the central government of Mozambique by the banking
system.
The IMF's framework for PSIs is designed for low-income countries that may not need, or
want, IMF financial assistance, but still seek IMF advice, monitoring, and endorsement of
their policies (see Public Information Notice No. 05/145).
The PSI for Mozambique aims to maintain macroeconomic stability and target poverty
reduction through capacity building in economic management; more focused priority
spending; enhanced debt management; financial sector efficiency; and improvements in
the business climate and competitiveness.
Following the Executive Board‘s discussion of Mozambique, Min Zhu, Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair, stated:
―Mozambique‘s economic performance and outlook remain strong. Helped by
appropriate macroeconomic policies, the economy proved resilient to the global financial
crisis. The country is poised for continued strong economic growth over the medium
term, reflecting expanded production in the natural resource sector.
―While inflation remains moderate, inflationary pressures should be closely monitored.
The authorities should stand ready to tighten policies should inflation exceed projections.
―The Poverty Reduction Strategy outlines a challenging development agenda aimed at
fostering inclusiveness and improve social development indicators. Its emphasis on
economic diversification and job creation is appropriate.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

―The authorities‘ development strategy needs to adapt to an increasing contribution of
the extractive industry to the economy. It will thus be important to continue to modernize
revenue administration and public financial management. Tapping Mozambique‘s natural
resource wealth will require an elevated level of infrastructure spending. It is critical,
however, that the pace of public investment be commensurate with absorptive capacity
and debt sustainability. Accordingly, the authorities are well advised to strengthen
medium-term debt management as well as project selection and implementation.
―The banking system has proven resilient during the global financial crisis. Recent
improvements in the crisis resolution framework, banking supervision, and AMF/CTL
legislation are welcome. Vigorous implementation of the new Financial Sector
Development Strategy will be important going forward.‖

Statement by Mr. Momodou Bamba Saho, Executive Director for Mozambique
June 24, 2013
My authorities greatly appreciate the Fund’s constructive engagement and support that is
helping Mozambique lay a strong foundation for sustainable economic growth. They share
the broad thrust of the staff report which provides a comprehensive assessment of recent
economic developments and program performance. My authorities welcome the staff’s
understanding of the difficult challenges facing Mozambique now and in the near future.
Recent economic developments
Mozambique’s strong economic growth is a reflection of the authorities’ commitment to
prudent fiscal and monetary policies in line with their Poverty Reduction Strategy
(PARP) set for 2011 – 2014 supported by the Policy Support Instrument (PSI). Real
economic growth has been sustained above 7 percent over the past twenty years, and
remained high in 2012 at 7.4 percent, bolstered by the substantial contribution from the
mineral sector, agriculture and financial services. In spite of recent estimates that indicate
that growth could contract slightly as a result of the flood that damaged infrastructures during
the first quarter of 2013, GDP growth is expected to remain above 7 percent by year end.
Nevertheless, my authorities are aware that economic growth itself does not provide
appropriate responses to the adverse socio- economic environment and despite perseverance
in undertaking prudent macroeconomic policies and embarking on structural reforms,
achieving poverty reduction and inclusive growth remain serious policy challenges. My
authorities’ fiscal policy shall continue to focus on prudent use of non-concessional
external borrowing to help bridge the gap between the country’s vast infrastructure
financing needs and a trend decline in donor support, while ensuring macroeconomic
stability.
Monetary policy remains geared towards domestic credit expansion in support of private
sector investment while remaining committed to the maintenance of price stability. My
authorities have successfully kept inflation in the lower single digits. At 2.2 percent,
Mozambique achieved the lowest inflation rate in the sub region. However, a slight increase
in the inflation rate in 2013 is expected due to the rise in food prices as a result of lower
performance in agriculture following heavy floods.
The authorities remain committed to strengthening banking supervision to enhance
monetary policy transmission mechanism. Bank of Mozambique (BM) has taken actions
aimed at creating adequate capital buffers in the banking system through better diversified
banking instruments.
The Mozambican authorities are also strengthening financial inclusion as part of
Mozambique’s Financial Sector Development Strategy (FSDS) for 2013-2022. The aim is
to deepen the government debt market. My authorities envisage enhancing financial sector
surveillance mechanisms through improved banking supervision. In this respect, they have
recently concluded the financial sector contingency plan and are making the Deposit
Insurance Fund operational. Furthermore, my authorities have reviewed the legal framework
with the aim of implementing AML/CFT. In its determination to sustain a strong banking
INTERNATIO

system the BM launched its own stress-test exercise and in March 2013 established a risk
management guideline and a legal and analytical framework for risk-based surveillance,
preparing the way for the adoption in 2014 of the Basel II Capital Accord.
Mozambique’s external sector remains viable despite the high current account to GDP
deficit ratio. Driven by the real exchange rate, the export sector has witnessed steady
growth while FDI flows have also remained buoyant resulting in a declining external
current account deficit in percentage of GDP. However, delays in financial disbursement
by some donors and significant increases in imports of goods, in response to domestic
shortages caused by floods, reduced international reserves more than expected. Overall,
available reserves can finance three months of goods and services.
Program performance under the PSI program
Performance under the program has been good with all but two quantitative assessment
criteria (AC) set for end-December 2012 being met. Reserve money (RM) surpassed the
end-December target due to temporary high seasonal demand for money at end-year. Net
credit to the government (NCG) surpassed the programmed amount on account of a shortfall
in revenue and higher than anticipated investment spending. However, NCG was within
projections at end-March 2013. The authorities also took important steps to achieve the endDecember 2012 program’s structural benchmarks for the Annual Domestic Borrowing Plan
for 2013 that was approved as scheduled in January 2013. The Financial Sector Contingency
Plan and the Financial Sector Development Strategy- two structural benchmarks set for end2012 were also approved in April 2013. In view of the strong program performance, my
authorities request waivers for the nonobservance of the two missed end-December
assessment criteria and request the Executive Board’s support for the completion of the
sixth review under the PSI. My authorities also request the Executive Board’s approval
of a new three-year PSI and cancelation of the current PSI.
Fiscal Policy
While being supportive of the disinflation effort, the fiscal policy stance would
accommodate a revival in public investment over the next years to rebuild
infrastructure damaged by floods and address the social and human development
objectives, including expansion in social protection, enhancing productivity in agriculture
and fisheries and strengthening job opportunities and job creation. The authorities have
increased social spending to more than U$57 million in 2013 from around U$11 million in
2007, and are committed to further improvements in social safety nets in the medium term.
The National Strategy for Basic Social Security approved in 2010 was expanded through new
social protection programs with the aim of targeting the more vulnerable.
On account of the tax reforms undertaken through the introduction of the Janela-Unica
(single trade window for taxpayers), tax revenues were higher than programmed in
March 2013. Ongoing reforms in taxation of the mining and hydrocarbon sectors are
enabling increased coverage and broadening of the tax base. My authorities have agreed
to change the VAT law that will allow the application of VAT on a net basis starting from the
2015 budget and the implementation of tax payments through banks in order to simplify the
tax collection.
124

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLI REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

While Mozambique’s transition from agricultural to mineral resource economy represents a
strong evidence of a structural change, nevertheless the structural reform agenda of my
authorities remains focused on improving public finance management and enhancing its
human and institutional capacity in anticipation of the role the extractive sector shall play
in the long-term. Against this backdrop, my authorities are determined in ensuring high
fiscal transparency in the execution of its megaprojects. They remain committed to
strengthening proficiency in regulatory and fiscal framework, and will remain compliant
with the Extractive Industry and Transparency Initiative (EITI) requirements.
Revised Budget for 2013
My authorities are determined to foster investment and ensure social and political stability.
This is necessary to sustain robust growth. In this regard, a revised budget was presented to
the Parliament aimed at rebuilding economic infrastructure in the six provinces badly
affected by floods. They intend to finance most of the reconstruction with the revenue
accumulated from capital gains tax in extractive activities in 2012. The authorities agreed
with staff to draw on the envisaged windfall revenues to reduce government debt and to
refund the VAT backlog starting from 2015. They also agreed that the current fiscal surplus
should be used, in part, to ramp-up capital investment and socio-economic development
which would in turn improve their ability to reduce the pending refunds going forward.
In 2013, they are allocating 72.3 percent of total capital expenditure to prioritized
sectors such as agriculture and fisheries, energy, health and education, with the aim of
reducing poverty and strengthening productivity and competitiveness, while protecting
the most vulnerable. Furthermore, to compensate fuel importers for losses incurred in 2012
the authorities allocated Mt1.3 billion in the 2013 budget. This allows the overall fiscal
deficit after grants to fall in the range of 5-8 percent of GDP between 2013 and 2015.
Managing the public wage bill
My authorities have implemented a decompressed salary structure aimed at reducing
gross wage inequality in the public sector, as well as boosting domestic consumption. In
this regard, the wage bill increased particularly for civil servants in the education and health
sectors. Consequently, the public wage bill absorbs 10.8 percent of GDP and my authorities
intend to freeze new recruitments in the non-priority sectors. Going forward, they are
determined to keep the wage bill at around 8.5 percent of GDP in the medium term.
Non-concessional borrowing and debt sustainability

As envisaged in their Visao das Financas Publicas 2011 – 2025 (Long-term Public
Financial Strategy 2011 – 2025) my authorities remain committed to prudent public
debt management that enhances Mozambique’s credibility. In this regard, they have
established a Public Debt Management Unit and Project Selection and Coordination
Committee in 2011, aimed at achieving a more comprehensive investment program.
In 2012, Mozambique contracted non-concessional loans of about U$ 1.2 billion,
reaching a cumulative amount of U$1.387 billion; which, as at end-June 2013 remains
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

125

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

below the threshold agreed under the PSI program of U$ 1.6 billion. My authorities are
of the view that new loans would only accommodate infrastructure projects, particularly in
energy and transport. These projects are expected to generate positive spillovers in the
economy. They agreed with staff to increase the non-concessional borrowing threshold from
U$1.6 to U$2.0 billion over the next three years providing more space for additional capital
spending until 2016. My authorities provided the staff with the list of the proposed integrated
projects all of which are based on supportive feasibility studies, cost-benefits analysis and
full evaluation of the opportunity costs.
With the benefit of Fund TA, my authorities completed a DSA in 2010, 2011 and 2012.
They have also concluded the Medium-Term Public Debt Management Strategy for
2012 – 2015 that was approved by Parliament in September 2012. Anxious to promote
domestic savings and stimulate capital market development, my authorities also completed
the first Borrowing Plan for 2013 based on 2013 budget projections, which enhances
sovereign bond issuance, revamps the stock market and strengthens investor confidence.
Overall, debt sustainability remains moderate in the medium term and my authorities will
continue to prioritize grants over concessional loans going forward.
Managing natural resources
My authorities intend to strengthen their ability to manage the country’s natural
resource endowment through the improvement of the mining and hydrocarbon fiscal regime
and full implementation of the EITI membership requirements. In that respect, they will
persevere with reforms in debt management and investment planning as well as in tax
administration in order to continue with sustained strong revenue mobilization. The
implementation of a single taxpayer database and registration that allows steady
improvements in tax collection, are steps in the right direction. My authorities are in the early
stages of TA that will reorient their fiscal framework to that of a resource based economy.
Constructive discussions were initiated during the last staff visit and sixth review under the
PSI and my authorities are willing to continue with these analyses going forward.
Relationship with the Fund
My Mozambican authorities truly appreciated the recent visit of the First Deputy Managing
Director. They interpreted as additional evidence of good cooperation with the Fund.
Mozambique has agreed to host the Africa-IMF Conference in 2014 that would bring
together African Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors as well as IMF
management, business leaders and civil society, to discuss ways of building a stronger
partnership between the Continent and the Fund. My authorities are of the view that it will be
a good opportunity for Mozambique to showcase its achievements while playing an
important role in bringing to the fore issues that are important for Africa in its engagement
with the IMF. My authorities remain engaged with the Fund and will focus the new PSI
framework in the areas of poverty reduction, achieving inclusive growth and consolidating
macroeconomic stability.
