IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Nigeria
On March, 30, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Nigeria.
The Nigerian economy is facing substantial challenges. While the non-oil sector accounts for
90 percent of GDP, the oil sector plays a central role in the economy. Lower oil prices have
significantly affected the fiscal and external accounts, decimating government revenues to just
7.8 percent of GDP and resulting in the doubling of the general government deficit to about
3.7 percent of GDP in 2015. Exports dropped about 40 percent in 2015, pushing the current
account from a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP to a deficit projected at 2.4 percent of GDP. With
foreign portfolio inflows slowing significantly, reserves fell to $28.3 billion at end-2015.
Exchange restrictions introduced by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to protect reserves have
impacted significantly segments of the private sector that depend on an adequate supply of
foreign currencies. Coupled with fuel shortages in the first half of the year and lower investor
confidence, growth slowed sharply from 6.3 percent in 2014 to an estimated 2.7 percent in 2015,
weakening corporate balance sheets, lowering the resilience of the banking system, and likely
reversing progress in reducing unemployment and poverty. Inflation increased to 9.6 percent in
January (up from 7.9 percent in December, 2014), above the CBN’s medium-term target range of
6–9 percent.
The recovery in economic activity is likely to be modest over the medium term, but with
significant downside risks. Growth in 2016 is expected to decline further to 2.3 percent, with
non-oil sector growth projected to slow from 3.6 percent in 2015 to 3.1 percent in 2016 before
recovering to 3.5 percent in 2017, based on the results of policies under implementation—
particularly in the oil sector—as well as an improvement in the terms of trade. The general
government deficit is projected to widen somewhat in 2016 before improving in 2017, while the
external current account deficit is likely to worsen further. Key risks to the outlook include lower
oil prices, shortfalls in non-oil revenues, a further deterioration in finances of state and local

Governments, deepening disruptions in private sector activity due to constraints on access to
foreign exchange, and resurgence in security concerns.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the authorities’ policy agenda of enhancing transparency,
strengthening governance, improving security, and creating jobs. Directors noted that the
Nigerian economy has been hit hard by the decline in oil prices, which has slowed growth
sharply and led to macroeconomic imbalances. Given the uncertain global outlook and the
likelihood of oil prices remaining low, Directors stressed the need for significant macroeconomic
adjustment. They highlighted the importance of implementing urgently a coherent package of
policies, in consultation with Fund staff and development partners, to safeguard fiscal
sustainability and reduce external imbalances, and advancing structural reforms to support
inclusive growth.
Directors emphasized the critical need to raise non-oil revenues to ensure fiscal sustainability
while maintaining infrastructure and social spending. They urged a gradual increase in the VAT
rate, further improvements in revenue administration, and a broadening of the tax base. Directors
supported an orderly adjustment of budgets at the sub-national level through reform in budget
preparation and execution. They also stressed the importance of strengthened public financial
management and service delivery. Directors encouraged the implementation of an independent
price-setting mechanism to address petroleum subsidies, while strengthening the social safety
net. Directors underlined the need for continued efforts to foster transparency and enhanced
accountability.
Directors noted that the policy approach of expansionary monetary policy, together with a
relatively fixed exchange rate and exchange restrictions had adversely impacted economic
activity. It also raised concerns about the authorities’ commitment to their inflation objective.
They underscored the need for credible adjustment to the large terms-of-trade shock, including
through greater exchange rate flexibility and speedy unwinding of exchange restrictions to
facilitate an exchange rate consistent with fundamentals. In this context, they welcomed the
recent monetary policy tightening and recommended that the central bank target price stability to
maintain inflation within the target range.
Directors observed that further strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory frameworks
would help improve resilience even as financial sector soundness indicators remain favorable.
With declining asset quality a concern as growth slows, intensified monitoring of banks and
enhanced contingency planning and resolution frameworks would be important. Directors also
noted that lowering interest rate spreads and increasing efficiency could enhance credit growth,
especially for small and medium enterprises.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors stressed the need for structural reforms to enhance competitiveness and support
investment. They encouraged the authorities to continue core infrastructure investment, further
reduce the cost of doing business through greater transparency and accountability, and promote
employment of youth and women. Directors welcomed renewed effort to adopt legislation to
spur investment in the oil and gas sector, and promote policies to strengthen governance of the
sector, including targeted AML/CFT measures.
Directors welcomed progress in improving the quality and availability of economic statistics.
They welcomed the authorities’ commitment to implement the e-GDDS, including a National
Summary Data Page, and encouraged efforts to improve balance of payments data and
compilation of sub-national fiscal accounts.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
March 17, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context. The Nigerian economy is facing substantial challenges. Low oil prices, a lengthy
period of policy uncertainty, and ongoing security concerns, have produced: a widening
fiscal gap with salary arrears at state and local governments; a weaker external current
account and the introduction of exchange restrictions as international reserves declined;
lower financial sector resilience; and sharply slower growth. These shocks have compounded
an already challenging development environment—inadequate infrastructure, high
unemployment (9.9 percent) and a high poverty rate (above 50 percent in the northern
states).
Outlook and Risks. Growth is expected to slow further in 2016 before a modest
recovery over the medium term, but with significant downside risks and reduced buffers.
Some components of the policy package to adjust to the permanent terms of trade
shock are now in place but with little improvement expected in external conditions and
large policy distortions remaining, growth is likely to remain well below historical
averages. There are significant risks to this outlook: uncertainty on the path of oil prices
and oil production; the impact of reforms to raise non-oil revenues; late disbursement of
external financing or less-than-desired access to international markets; a further
deterioration in the fiscal position of state and local governments; and disruption to
private sector activity due to exchange restrictions. Meeting fiscal slippages through
additional domestic borrowing could raise the Federal government interest payment-torevenue ratio to an unsustainable level and crowd out lending to the private sector. The
combination of wide fiscal deficits and accommodative monetary policy with an
overvalued exchange rate could widen the current account deficit further, add pressure
to the exchange rate and international reserves, and result in further delays in much
needed foreign capital inflows and investment.
Policy recommendations. In light of the significant macroeconomic adjustment needed, it
will be important to initiate urgently a coherent package of policies anchored on:
(i) safeguarding fiscal sustainability; (ii) reducing external imbalances (including real
exchange rate realignment); (iii) enhancing resilience and further improving the efficiency of
the banking sector; and (iv) implementing structural reforms for sustained and inclusive
growth.

BACKGROUND: A CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT
1.
Nigeria’s economy has been hit hard by global developments that have aggravated
longstanding development weaknesses. Three major economic transitions—the slowdown and
rebalancing of the Chinese economy, lower commodity prices, and tightening financial conditions
and risk aversion of international investors—have impacted the Nigerian economy through trade,
exchange rates, asset markets (including commodity prices), and capital flows. These shocks
compounded an already challenging development environment—inadequate infrastructure, high
unemployment (9.9 percent), and a high poverty rate (above 50 percent in the northern states).
2.
Macro-financial outcomes are closely linked with the price of oil. While the non-oil
sector accounts for 90 percent
of GDP, the oil sector plays a
Figure 1. Nigeria: Macro and Financial Impact of Lower Oil
central role in the economy
Prices
(Figure 1). With the fiscal and
external accounts highly
dependent on oil receipts,
lower oil prices reduce
aggregate demand from the
public sector and affect growth
in the non-oil sector through
consumption, investment, asset
(including equity) prices, and
cost channels. A lower supply of
foreign exchange adversely
impacts corporate sector
activity, and combined with
high costs of doing business
(inadequate infrastructure, low
access to credit, and high interest rates) weakens balance sheets in corporate and banking sectors
and lowers investment and growth. Although the banking sector is relatively small (about 20 percent
of GDP), the transmission of shocks has widespread impact as conditions in the formal sector have
trickle-down effects on informal credit and trading activities.
3.
Policy uncertainty amplified the impact of global developments. President Buhari was
inaugurated in May 2015, having led the All Progressives Congress (APC)—a merger of four
opposition parties—to victory in the March 28 elections, the first democratic transition of
government in Nigeria’s history. The administration has listed fighting corruption, enhancing
transparency, improving security, and creating jobs as key elements of its policy agenda. While
progress has been made against Boko Haram, in addressing corruption, and strengthening
governance, the delay in appointing a cabinet until November 2015 limited the scope for a timely
and comprehensive policy response to the oil price shock.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGERIA

4.
Capacity constraints have also limited the policy response. Following the
recommendations of the 2014 Article IV consultation, progress has been made in improving
capacity, in particular in public financial management (PFM) at the federal government level, helping
to strengthen fiscal discipline and accountability. This effort is now being extended to the State and
Local Governments (SLGs) (Annex I).

MACRO-FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK,
RISKS AND SPILLOVERS
A. Macroeconomic Developments
5.
Macroeconomic outcomes deteriorated sharply in 2015. The collapse in oil prices has
decimated government revenues, which fell to just 7.8 percent of GDP and doubled the general
government deficit to about 3.7 percent of GDP in 2015. Exports dropped about 40 percent in 2015,
pushing the current account from a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP to a deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP
and, with uncertainty about policy direction, foreign portfolio inflows slowed significantly. Foreign
exchange shortages, fuel stoppages, and continued security challenges significantly impacted
private sector activity and growth slowed sharply to 2.7 percent in 2015 (from 6.3 percent in 2014),
likely reversing progress in reducing unemployment (9.9 percent) and poverty (above 50 percent in
the northern states) (Figure 2).
6.
The slowdown in the economy weakened corporate balance sheets and lowered assets
quality of the banking system. As opposed to the 2008-09 global crisis, the non-oil corporate
sector entered the 2014-15 crisis with weaker performance and more leveraged balance sheets. The
interest cover ratio of the corporate sector declined from 4 in 2008 to 2 by end-2014. With the
corporate sector accounting for 80 percent of bank loans, further financial deterioration of the
corporate sector could impair bank resilience and provision of credit to the economy.
7.
The CBN adjusted various instruments in an attempt to meet multiple objectives. In
response to pressures in the Foreign Exchange (FX) market, the CBN imposed restrictions on
commercial banks’ FX trading, closed the official FX auction window, and channeled those
transactions to the interbank market, effectively devaluing the official rate to the interbank rate by
about 18 percent (February 2015). Since then, it has tightly managed the interbank exchange rate
and introduced restrictions on access to FX, which has resulted in a wide spread between the rates
on the interbank and Bureau de Change (BDC) markets (Figure 2). The drop in FX market liquidity
resulting from these measures led J.P. Morgan to exclude Nigerian domestic bonds from its local
currency government bond indexes. At the same time, to stimulate the slowing economy, the CBN
expanded special intervention schemes and since September 2015 eased the monetary policy rate
and reversed the increases in the reserve requirements implemented in November 2014 and May
2015, notwithstanding inflation rising above the medium-term target range. The resultant increase
in liquidity has pushed short-term interest rates to near zero.

Near-term vulnerabilities have risen sharply. The real effective exchange rate has
appreciated over 25 percent since 2011. Gross international reserves (GIR) have continued to fall (to
$28.3 billion at end-2015), despite the introduction of foreign exchange restrictions, reducing
reserve coverage to 100 percent of the standard IMF reserve adequacy metric and increasing the
ratio of the sum of short-term external debt liabilities and the current account deficit to reserves
from about 50 percent to 100 percent. The Excess Crude Account is at a low $2.3 billion (from
$11 billion in 2012) and FGN interest payments-to-revenue ratio is estimated (in 2015) to have
increased to 32 percent (from 27 percent in 2014). The unemployment rate has increased from
6.4 percent in 2014Q4 to 9.9 percent in 2015Q3, with the youth unemployment (below age 24) now
at 18 percent.

B. Outlook and Risks
9.
Adjusting to the lower oil price environment will take time, with growth likely to
remain well below past trends and with reduced buffers.


For 2016, the weak growth seen in 2015 is expected to continue as the authorities put in place
their policy package. Overall growth is projected at 2.3 percent, below the 2.7 percent recorded
in 2015. The draft 2016 budget submitted to the National Assembly in December should provide
some support to growth through a significant shift in the composition of fiscal spending
towards capital investment (mainly power and transport), while increasing the allocation for a
social safety net. The exchange restrictions and the large misalignment of the real exchange rate
(no adjustment in the interbank exchange rate is assumed) will continue to provide a drag on
private sector activity and non-oil growth is projected at just 3.1 percent (compared to 3.6
percent in 2015 and 7.3 percent in 2014). The oil sector also faces uncertain prospects and,
despite ongoing efforts to enhance governance and reduce leakages, is likely to record another
year of negative growth.



For 2017, growth is projected to recover to 3.5 percent based on the results of policies under
implementation—particularly in the oil sector—as well as an improvement in the terms of trade.
Improved governance in the oil sector should facilitate an expansion in production with the
greater clarity in the regulation of the sector and the gradual rebound in international oil prices
supporting renewed investment. The revised Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), focusing on industry
structure and regulation, presented to the National Assembly could release significant
investment in the oil and gas sector, though the impact could occur over time. The combination
of the rebound in the terms of trade, and improvements in power and electricity generation as a
result of the public infrastructure investments would support a recovery in non-oil growth to
about 3.5 percent despite the continued drag on the private sector from the distortions in the
foreign exchange market. This is significantly below past trends (non-oil growth averaged
around 8 percent over the past decade) and barely above population growth estimated at
2.7 percent.

In this baseline scenario, there is insufficient progress in closing the existing
macroeconomic imbalances, resulting in the further drawdown of buffers, heightening
vulnerabilities. Fiscal deficits remain large resulting in the continued need for both domestic and
external financing, with the FGN interest rate to revenue ratio—a key indicator of debt
sustainability—likely to increase to above 40 percent. International reserves would be expected to
decline throughout the medium term, though pressures on reserves would reduce with the
anticipated recovery in international oil prices. A more accelerated adjustment path—could lower
these risks and facilitate an earlier move of the economy to a more sustainable growth path, while
further delays in policy adjustment would simply exacerbate the risks (Box 2).
11.

There are significant downside risks to this outlook: (Risk Assessment Matrix)



Weaker global growth, particularly in emerging markets, a continued lull in commodity/oil
prices, higher international interest rates, and a shift in investor appetite away from emerging
and developing countries could delay a growth rebound. The spread between Nigeria’s
Eurobond and U.S. Treasury has been widening, reflecting markets’ assessment of worsening
economic conditions.



Failure to achieve the envisaged reorientation of public spending to capital investment or low
rates of return on public investment and/or absorptive capacity constraints could delay
implementation and lower medium-term growth.



Lower-than-expected oil revenue, shortfalls in yields from tax administration reforms,
unbudgeted fuel subsidy payments, and late disbursement of external financing or an inability
to access international markets at competitive interest rates could increase domestic financing
requirements. Coupled with lower growth and potentially higher borrowing costs, these risks
could push the federal government’s interest payments-to-revenue ratio to an unsustainable
path.



Needed adjustment at the SLG level could stall. The SLGs are reeling from the loss of oil
revenues and, with few policy tools and generally weak public financial management,
adjustment has been slow. In 2015, the FGN addressed salary arrears of SLGs through a partial
bailout and facilitated the restructuring (longer maturities and lower rates) of commercial bank
loans (N575.52 billion, 0.6 percent of GDP) to 23 states. Already wage arrears are reported to
have started to accumulate again and would impact household consumption (the public sector
provides the most reliable income flows to employees’ villages). Lack of timely or accurate data
makes it difficult to assess the degree of adjustment needed—or the stock of cumulated
arrears—at the SLGs.



While banks (apart from two) remain adequately capitalized, rising NPLs and reduced
creditworthiness of borrowers suggest some increase in vulnerabilities in the banking system
and could dampen private sector credit growth—a doubling of NPLs from the corporate sector
could reduce the ability of banks to extend credit by 11 percent. Further, with firms much more
leveraged and exposed to FX debt (partly explained by global liquidity conditions), they are

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

NIGERIA

more vulnerable to changes in external liquidity conditions and the exchange rate.
Consequently, weaker profit margins/retained earnings and lower credit growth, both formal
and informal, could constrain private investment and growth (Figure 3, Box 1 and SIP).
There is a risk of a disorderly adjustment of the exchange rate. The combination of a wider fiscal
deficit and accommodative monetary policy with a fixed exchange rate could lead to further
pressure on the exchange rate, inflation, real appreciation of the naira, widening of the current
account deficit, deepening distortions in access to foreign exchange, and further pressure on the
exchange rate.

C. Spillovers


Inward spillovers from changes in global liquidity conditions. Nigeria saw large portfolio inflows
in 2012-13 and outflows in 2014-15, reflecting both “push” and “pull” factors, such as favorable
domestic and external financial conditions, expected high growth rates and oil prices, and
overall positive sentiment toward emerging markets. Going forward, the risks are tilted to
sluggish net capital flows (SIP on Capital flows).



Outward spillovers via regional trade channels. The foreign exchange restrictions are impacting
exporters in trading partners such as South Africa, while the growth slowdown is adversely
impacting growth in neighboring countries, mainly through informal trade and rapidly growing
cross-border bank channels—for example, it is estimated that a 1 percent reduction in Nigeria’s
growth generates a 0.3 percent reduction in Benin’s growth.



Outward Spillovers to the region via financial channels. While the funding model appears to
mitigate spillover risks through financial channels, the growing cross-border activity of
Nigerian-based banks poses regulatory and supervisory challenges.1 Nine banks have a
significant presence in Benin, the Gambia, Ghana, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. For example, United
Bank of Africa has a meaningful market share (assets between 3 percent and 7 percent of GDP)
in Liberia, Benin, and Burkina Faso, while Guaranty Trust Bank is systemically important (assets
greater than 7 percent of GDP) for the Gambia.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS: URGENCY IN DEALING WITH
THE IMPACT OF THE OIL PRICE SHOCK
The large permanent terms-of-trade shock requires a significant macroeconomic adjustment. It is
important to initiate urgently an integrated package of policies centered around: (i) a fundamental
change in the nature of government; (ii) reducing external imbalances (including real exchange
rate realignment); (iii) further safeguarding the resilience and improving the efficiency of the
banking sector; and (iv) implementing structural reforms for inclusive growth. The policy measures
envisaged in the draft 2016 budget with aggressive revenue mobilization efforts and a shift from
recurrent to capital spending are in the right directions, though more is needed.

A. Changing the Nature of Government
12.
The urgently needed near-term fiscal adjustment should be used to jump start
medium-term fiscal policy goals—delivery of key public services. The new reality of low oil
prices and low oil revenues means that the nature of government—all tiers of government—needs
to fundamentally change. The fiscal challenge is no longer about how to divide the proceeds of
Nigeria’s oil wealth, but what needs to be done to effectively deliver public services, be it in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGERIA

education, health, or infrastructure. In this context, immediate fiscal adjustment is unavoidable. With
the lowest non-oil revenues among major commodity producers (Figure 4) and consolidated
government spending already relatively low (11½ percent of GDP in 2015), the fiscal adjustment
should be tilted to raising revenues.
13.
A fiscal adjustment of about 3 percent of GDP is needed to ensure medium-term debt
sustainability. While public debt is low at 14.4 percent of GDP, the FGN interest payments-torevenue ratio has increased significantly to about 32 percent. With the sharp decline in the growth
rate and despite the recent reduction in domestic real interest rates, the overall primary balance
required to keep debt on a sustainable path is now at about -1 percent of GDP (see Annex III). This
implies that the primary balance (currently at about -4 percent of GDP) needs to be adjusted by
3 percent of GDP. The 3-percent fiscal adjustment will also ensure that the long-term management
of the oil wealth remains sound and sustainable (SIP on fiscal rules). Efforts toward fiscal
consolidation in the draft 2016 budget are in the right direction, but with oil prices expected to
remain low (and below oil price in the draft budget) more will be needed.

The composition of the adjustment should reflect a realistic pace for raising non-oil
revenue, which is critical to allow budget to be implemented. At just 4 percent of GDP, non-oil
revenues are simply too low for the government to be able to meet its expenditure priorities,
including addressing lagging indicators for infrastructure and social development (Figure 4).2
Reforms could target a non-oil revenue-to-non-oil-GDP ratio that is more in line with that of peers
and yet achievable, such as 8 percent over the medium term (against a target of 6.4 under the
current policies). Such an objective could be achieved, as a priority, by raising the standard VAT rate
initially from 5 percent to 7.5 percent and further over the medium term to provide a strong revenue
2

The World Bank estimates that capital expenditure of about $14 billion a year for over a decade is needed to close
identified infrastructure gaps (Foster and Pushak, 2011).

NIGERIA

base for SLG s (85 percent is distributed to SLGs),3 in addition, broadening the base (from currently
16 percent of GDP to about 50 percent of GDP), and revamping the design to allow the offsetting of
input tax credits.4 Another priority is the strengthening of tax administration for corporate income
tax and customs taxes and excises, which can increase collection efficiency by 20 percent by closing
loopholes, reducing tax exemptions, and improving compliance. In particular, as an immediate
revenue protection measure government could announce a moratorium on new tax incentives,
which would stem revenue losses until an overall review of the Nigerian income tax system is
concluded. While the draft 2016 budget prioritizes early action on administrative improvements—
and steps are underway—adjustment in tax rates could provide greater certainty that revenue
objectives could be achieved.
Authorities’ views: The authorities acknowledged the importance of non-oil revenue mobilization,
especially in the context of permanently lower oil prices. They are open to consider an increase in
the VAT rate over the medium term, but believe that a sufficient increase in revenue effort can result
immediately from strengthening collection efficiency, with a focus on broadening the base,
improving compliance, closing loopholes, and reducing tax exemptions.
15.
Streamlining recurrent expenditure is key to ensure the efficiency of public service
delivery and foster fiscal adjustment.


The establishment of an Efficiency-Unit is a promising and important initiative to streamline the
cost of government and improve efficiency of public service. A mechanism could also be
introduced to promote cooperation with SLGs, strengthening expenditure rationalization across
tiers of government. The broader streamlining review could also incorporate a strategic
prioritization of spending towards high sustained growth and social development.



Tax expenditures could be reduced to create space for higher-priority spending. Tax
exemptions/incentives should be streamlined and phased. Where they exist, sunset clauses
should be well-specified, and there should be a strict cost-benefit assessment, with strong
monitoring of outcome-based performance indicators.



Transfers should be well targeted. In particular, continuing the move (in the draft 2016 budget)
to eliminate resources allocated to fuel subsidies would allow spending on innovative social
programs for the most needy and for other public services. With regulated prices only just
covering current costs, any increases in international prices (and/or currency depreciation) will
require a decision on whether to discontinue the subsidy regime or request a supplementary
budget (as occurred in 2015).

3

The average VAT rate in ECOWAS (excluding Nigeria) is 16½ percent.

4
Broadening the VAT base entails enforcing compliance across all tax types and taxpayers categories by focusing on
audits and clearing backlogs; improving the registration of all taxpayer categories by focusing on unregistered
corporate and other relevant governmental agencies; and using technology to block leakages through the
introduction of the Auto-VAT collection platform for new sectors such as telecoms, power, hospitality, e-commerce,
and financial services.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

NIGERIA

Authorities’ views: The authorities indicated that in the Medium Term Expenditure Framework
(MTEF) for 2016-18, recurrent expenditure as a share of nominal GDP is projected to be broadly
contained, from 2.6 percent of GDP in 2015 to 2.3 percent in 2018 (based on authorities GDP
numbers). The authorities see scope for streamlining further, beyond measures reflected in the draft
2016 budget. They noted that they have already taken steps to contain recurrent expenditure at the
Federal level through a Zero-Based Budgeting approach. On fuel subsidies, they noted that no
provision is needed, given low oil prices. They stressed, however, that they would be clearing arrears
to oil marketers, and reviewing product pricing on a quarterly basis.
16.
Capital expenditure should focus on high-impact and high value-added projects. Staff
supports the government’s focus on power, integrated transportation (roads, rail, air, and ports), and
housing, but noted the importance of ensuring the return on investment remains high. In this
respect, staff welcomes the emphasis on monitoring and evaluation at the Ministry of Budget and
National Planning. Staff also emphasizes the publication of those reports to improve transparency
and public awareness of how tax money is used.
Authorities’ views: The authorities agree that the process of implementing capital expenditure
needs to improve in order to deliver the highest payoffs and indicated that publication of reports
will be on a quarterly basis. They have given spending priority to the completion of high impact
projects that are near completion and are streamlining the process to reduce the implementation
delays.
17.
SLG finances remain a concern, with the risk of deepening arrears and, potentially
constitute an important contingent fiscal liability. The combination of loan restructuring and soft
loans provided during 2015Q3 to clear the wage arrears has improved current cash flows for the
SLGs, but mortgaged a portion of future revenues and left open the potential for moral hazard. With
data on SLGs sparse and varied, a clear picture has not emerged on how SLGs plan to adjust their
spending and increase internally generated revenues to manage the projected lower oil revenue
allocations. Staff supports an orderly adjustment of sub-national budgets, through emphasis on
raising VAT receipts, encouraging reform of budget preparation and execution, and strengthening
public financial management (including through technical assistance on TSA and cash management,
a capturing of all committed (multi-year) liabilities, and strengthening of budget preparation and
reporting). Further, terms for emerging assistance could be strengthened to enhance accountability
and reduce the likelihood for additional bailouts.
Authorities’ views: The authorities expressed great concern about the sustainability of SLG
finances. In particular, they noted that they intend to strengthen enforcement of guidelines that
require bank loans to be spent for investment—including withholding irrevocable standing payment
orders for non-investment-related loans—and to improve transparency and accountability of state
government spending. They inquired about best practices in countries with federation structures,
while noting that the best fora to discuss these issues with state governors are the Federal Accounts
Allocation Committee (FAAC) and the National Economic Council (NEC) meetings. The authorities
also see the need for more technical assistance to improve PFM at the state government level
(Box 4).

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGERIA

18.
Pursuing a minimum cost, risk-based debt management strategy is crucial. Continuing
to rely heavily on domestic financing may constrain the government’s ambitious capital investment
plan, especially as the exclusion from the J.P. Morgan local government bond indexes could lower
participation of foreign investors. Instead staff recommends designing a medium-term debt
management strategy (MTDS) that supports financing for development. This may entail rebalancing
the external-domestic debt mix with more external debt, though access to international capital
markets may be constrained by the deterioration in Nigeria’s credit profile and global market
conditions.. A joint IMF–WB TA mission visited Abuja in February 2016 to provide assistance in
developing a MTDS.
Authorities’ views: The authorities are planning on tapping external resources going forward as
proposed in the draft 2016 budget. Indeed, for 2016, the authorities plan to secure half of gross
financing externally, with 80 percent of that to be secured from multilateral sources. Sukuk and
Diaspora bonds are also options being explored. Furthermore, the debt management office (DMO)
plans to revise the MTDS to take into account the current state of the economy.
19.
The fiscal framework needs strengthening. Under the current arrangement, the budget oil
price is highly politicized and subject to negotiations between the Executive and Legislative
branches. Fiscal buffers can be used flexibly to fund augmentations, discretionary allocations,
subsidies, and social projects. As a result, the medium-term non-oil primary deficit is strongly linked
to oil price fluctuations. In addition, the fiscal responsibility law applies mostly to the federal
government while fiscal sustainability refers to all three tiers of government. Finally, the Sovereign
Wealth Fund (SWF) is small ($1.75 billion including $500 million raised through Eurobond issuance)
and currently excluded from the fiscal framework.
20.
The fiscal responsibility law has not proven sufficient to ensure sustainability of oil
wealth. Staff estimates, for example, that a “depoliticized” budget rule using a combination of past
5-year average oil price, the current year oil price, and forward looking 5-year oil-price, together
with a structural primary surplus target of 2½ percent of non-oil GDP, is one option (subject to preannounced exceptions) that could provide a basis for long-term sustainability and the preservation
of oil wealth, while limiting the effect of oil price volatility (SIP on Fiscal Rules).
Authorities’ views: The authorities welcome the proposal to institutionalize budget oil pricing. It
would help reduce the annual friction that results from fixing the oil benchmark and enhance overall
budget preparation. However, they expressed caution, highlighting the possible need for flexibility
to accommodate extreme price movements and specific circumstances (e.g., security issues), and
noted that a similar model was being discussed with the World Bank.

B. Achieving External Adjustment
21.
The strategy of supporting a de facto exchange rate peg through exchange
restrictions is significantly distorting the economy and weighing on economic activity. The
restrictions have served to protect certain sectors of the economy, but many other sectors are
cutting production and shedding labor, resulting in cuts to investment and consumption. The BOP
impact of reducing imports has been offset to a large extent by lower investment and reduced nonoil exports, as firms have experienced difficulties in obtaining inputs for their production, and some
domestic production that was previously exported has been diverted to the local market. Foreign
exchange shortages and the associated increase in the spread between the interbank rate and the
rates on the BDC and parallel markets have also contributed to higher prices, undermining the
desired anti-inflationary impact of the restrictions.
22.
Staff views a comprehensive policy response, including tighter monetary policy and
adjustment of the exchange rate, as urgently needed to facilitate the much-needed external
adjustment. While imports have been contained to some extent through prioritization by the CBN,
adjustment has been hampered by the monetary easing and a de facto fixed overvalued exchange
rate (see Annex IV), contributing to the combination of above-target inflation, capital outflows, and
loss of international reserves.5 Meanwhile, monetary easing has failed to spur economic activity due
to increased banking system credit to the public sector, deterioration in borrower creditworthiness,
and uncertainty over the economic outlook. Adjustment in the exchange rate, accompanied by a
tighter monetary and fiscal stance and measures to facilitate removal of the exchange restrictions,
would defend reserves, facilitate an orderly adjustment, and permit the return to a normal
functioning of the foreign exchange market.
Authorities’ views: The authorities consider that the foreign exchange controls have provided
necessary breathing space amidst declining oil prices by slowing the loss of reserves, and, in their
assessment, stimulating production and employment in some sectors. The authorities note inflation
slightly above their target range, but view the recent monetary easing as necessary to buffer the
economic slowdown.
23.
Exchange system. Nigeria has recently introduced measures in the foreign exchange
market that give rise to exchange restrictions and a multiple currency practice (MCP) under Article
VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3, of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement: (i) an exchange restriction arising from
the prohibition to access foreign exchange at the Nigerian foreign exchange markets for the
payment of imports of 40 categories of items; (ii) an exchange restriction arising from the rationing
of foreign exchange and its allocation based on the CBN’s determination of priority categories of

5
The estimated exchange rate gap for 2015 as a whole, including the contributions of related policies, was a
15 percent to 20 percent overvaluation. With fundamentals changing over the course of 2015 and into early 2016,
especially the continuing low price of oil (the average price for Nigerian oil expected for 2016 based on futures
market prices is about 30 percent lower than the average price for 2015), the estimated current account and
exchange rate gaps, and the associated balance of payments risks, likely have increased.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGERIA

transactions; and (iii) an MCP arising from the large spread between the rate set by the CBN for
commercial banks, and the rates in the BDC and parallel market. In addition, existing limits on the
amounts of FX available when traveling abroad, which cannot be exceeded even upon verification of
the bona fide nature of the transaction, also give rise to an exchange restriction under Article VIII.
Authorities’ views: The authorities are not requesting Fund approval of the exchange restrictions
and MCP. While not committing to a timetable for their removal, the authorities see the exchange
measures as temporary and plan to adjust or remove them upon reserves being restored to more
adequate levels, supported by strengthened monetary and fiscal policies and planned structural
reforms. They also noted that these measures were implemented for balance of payments needs,
and are non-discriminatory in implementation.
24.
Greater flexibility in the exchange rate is needed to allow the economy to adjust to
external shocks. Greater flexibility has pros and cons for commodity-dependent exporters like
Nigeria (see Box 5). In staff’s view, a more flexible regime would facilitate attempts to diversify the
export base and permit the economy to adjust more smoothly to changes in fundamentals, lowering
the potential for episodes of exchange rate misalignment and reducing reliance on reserves to
buffer external shocks. Increased flexibility would also free up the CBN to focus more on price
stability as its primary objective and increase the scope for countercyclical monetary policy.
Increasing flexibility could start with implementing a central parity rate within a band, then
increasing the width of the band and allowing the central parity to respond to the supply and
demand of FX. Such a regime transition should be aided by supporting macroeconomic policies,
establishing an alternative nominal anchor, strengthening technical implementation capacity and
communications, and adopting measures (for example, to deepen hedging markets) to help the
financial, corporate, and household sectors deal with exchange rate volatility.
Authorities’ views: The authorities emphasized the role the exchange rate peg had played as a
nominal anchor and considered current account and exchange rate gaps to be smaller than
estimated by staff. The authorities acknowledged that the price of foreign exchange should reflect
changes in economic fundamentals, but expressed concern about the impact of exchange rate
volatility on financial and corporate balance sheets.

C. Safeguarding Resilience and Improving Efficiency of the Banking Sector
25.
Vulnerabilities are increasing in the Nigerian banking system; although capital remains
resilient, liquidity has declined and asset quality has deteriorated. The current economic
challenges facing Nigeria represent an ongoing risk to credit quality that could put pressure on the
capital adequacy and liquidity of the system, constraining the banks’ capacity to extend credit to the
private sector.
26.
To preserve financial sector stability, the CBN should be ready to promptly address
any undercapitalized banks, including by requiring that current shareholders provide new
capital. If the necessary capital support is not forthcoming, the CBN should prepare for intervention
and resolution (using existing instruments) so as to mitigate adverse spillovers to the wider system.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

NIGERIA

Given the sharp increase in NPLs, the authorities should actively promote corrective action for any
bank where NPLs are rising rapidly.
Authorities’ views: The authorities conveyed that they are fully aware of the rising risks to the
banking sector and remain vigilant. They continue to monitor the health of the banking sector and
have taken proactive measures by increasing the general provision for performing loans to 2 percent
(from 1 percent).
27.
Staff recommends reviewing the framework for the provision of emergency liquidity
assistance and ensuring active monitoring of liquidity conditions at weaker institutions to mitigate
the potential impact of deposit runs. Staff also recommends advancing efforts to strengthen the
legal framework for resolution, following the 2012 FSAP recommendations. Specific actions include
enhancing statutory powers to override shareholders’ rights, ensuring effective implementation of
existing resolution tools, and facilitating an expansion of the toolkit to include mandatory
recapitalization; the power to write down capital; the power to carry out a bail-in; harmonization of
statutory triggers for resolution across the Banks & Other Financial Institutions Act and the Nigeria
Deposit Insurance Corporation Act; and amending the bank liquidation regime to address legal
challenges and protracted delays.
Authorities’ views: The authorities consider current arrangements are sufficient to pre-empt
situations from developing into full blown crises and to provide assistance as necessary.
28.
It is important that the authorities increase their emphasis on price stability as the
primary, overriding objective of monetary policy. While the legal framework for monetary policy
is broadly adequate, in practice the use of
multiple instruments—to pursue multiple,
sometimes inconsistent, objectives—has
sent mixed signals of the policy stance and
marred the effectiveness of policy. A
clearer focus on price stability and
increased use of market-based instruments
would assist the CBN in enhancing the
credibility that is needed to implement
monetary policy. Going forward, staff
recommends elaborating a forwardlooking monetary policy strategy that
provides guidance on the path of monetary policy based on economic conditions and expected
monetary policy transmission (see SIP).
Authorities’ views: The authorities consider promoting sustainable economic development as
within the mandate of the CBN. In their view, the significant impact of the external shock has
necessitated supporting growth as an overriding policy objective, even if inflation remains above
target for some time.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGERIA

29.
The authorities view subsidized lending/on-lending schemes as promoting
development, by reducing the high cost of financing, but these schemes have many adverse
effects.6 Most recently, a waiver on the Cash Reserve Requirements (CRR) was introduced. That is,
banks extending loans to employment-generating activities in preferred sectors (e.g., agriculture,
infrastructure, and solid minerals) would be entitled to a reduction on the CRR. These schemes have
many adverse effects: they distort the allocation of resources and investment decisions; impose
unfairness between recipients versus non-recipients; increase quasi-fiscal expenditure; and create
unnecessary uncertainty that impact consumption and investment decisions. Staff recommends
encouraging competition among banks and lowering the cost of doing business to help lower the
lending-to-deposit rate spread rather than resorting to specific interventions.

D. Implementing Structural Reforms
30.
Nigeria suffers from a serious infrastructure deficit (see the 2014 Article IV Staff Report).
Without power and transportation, Nigeria’s cost of production remains high and domestic
production uncompetitive. Various efforts are ongoing and will require a sustained effort over the
long term to bridge the substantial deficit. In that regard, prioritization and cost-benefit analysis of
potential infrastructure projects are critical. Reducing the cost of production by ensuring functioning
transportation and power supply networks will help offset the impact of the appreciation of the real
effective exchange rate that occurred over the past five years.
Authorities’ views: Relevant ministries such the Budget and Planning, Power, Works, and Housing,
and Transportation have started planning for the development of much needed infrastructure. The
authorities acknowledge the constrained environment they have to work under and are focusing on
prioritizing near-completed, high-impact projects that are consistent with the government
development strategy, and on creating an enabling environment to attract investment. They are also
reviewing projects suitable for PPPs, and have completed some feasibility studies. The authorities
recognize also the importance of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of projects and to continue
publishing those reports periodically to enhance transparency and regain confidence in the
government.
31.
Access to credit remains poor, especially for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises
(MSMEs). It is important to continue providing support for MSMEs, promoting the use of financial
services, and improving financial infrastructure. Efforts to increase financial inclusion, however, have
become more challenging, given that both the corporate and banking sectors are leveraged and
impacted by the oil price shock and the consequent slowdown in economic activity.
Authorities’ views: The authorities acknowledged the challenges faced by MSMEs in accessing
credit. They noted that a number of steps are already being implemented to address these
challenges, including establishing the Development Bank of Nigeria (DBN) and the Movable Asset
Collateral Registry (MACR) at the CBN. The DBN has received funding commitments of over
6

$1.5 billion (N300 billion) from international finance institutions (IFIs) and the Federal Government of
Nigeria and is expected to commence operations by mid-2016. The DBN is expected to provide
MSMEs with loans of up to 10 years and up to 18 months moratorium. The MACR is to be launched
by the CBN in the first quarter of 2016 and will enable individuals to obtain loans from financial
institutions using movable assets and intellectual property as collateral.
32.
Given demographics, the pace of job creation needs accelerating. Key initiatives have
focused on supporting the agriculture industry, which could reduce migration of youth to the urban
areas and lower youth unemployment. Subject to review, it will be important to scale-up recent
government pilot programs to improve access to agricultural inputs, the use of conditional cash
transfer schemes linked to girls’ enrolment in schools, and delivery of gender-based initiatives
(Annex V).
33.
Plans to improve governance, in particular of the oil sector, should be implemented
expeditiously. At the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), the senior management was
replaced and financial management improved by migrating accounting processes to the Treasury
Single Account (TSA). The passage of the revised Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) is also expected to
strengthen governance in the sector. The government also took initiatives to strengthen policies
against corruption and oil theft. Targeted Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of
Terrorism (AML/CFT) measures can play an important role in tackling theft and corruption in the oil
sector by tracing the associated financial flows. Efforts to improve the understanding of the pattern
of such flows should be pursued, notably by completing the national risk assessment to enhance the
effectiveness of banks’ AML/CFT controls and CBN’s supervision. Further, AML/CFT risks of BDCs
need to be properly mitigated (see Appendix II).
Authorities’ views: The authorities highlighted the new administration’s commitment to fighting
corruption. They view the plan to restructure the NNPC as a promising step forward to enhance
transparency and accountability of the oil sector. They concur that effective implementation of
targeted AML/CFT measures, including tracing financial flows, could facilitate detection and
investigation and help tackle economic crimes such as oil theft and corruption.
34.
Enhanced governance and transparency are vital to the transition to a new notion of
government. Coordination and cooperation are needed not only within the public sector, but
across sectors of society (government, bankers, nonbank private sector, households). Hence, it will
be important to communicate the need for reform, while improving transparency. For example,
revenue mobilization entails minimizing leakages by improving compliance and enhancing
collection efficiency. But improving the transparency of how tax revenue is spent is equally central
for gaining credibility, and in turn broadening the tax base. Communicating how tax revenue is
allocated to public services and how it is benefitting the people must be an overriding priority for
the entire public sector. Robust measures to strengthen anti-corruption legal frameworks and
ensure acts of corruption are criminalized (in line with international standards) would help enhance
transparency. Further, good practice suggests the importance of requiring senior public sector
officials, including those with regulatory mandates, to declare and make public the assets they own.

Data compilation and dissemination continue to improve. Further progress is needed in
improving data for the external sector assessment: e.g., reducing errors and omissions in the balance
of payments by better capturing financial account flows and improving granularity of currency and
maturity compositions in the monetary survey. Updating the weights for the consumer price index
and resuming the producer price index survey would help improve the real sector assessment. Staff
underscored continued Fund support to help strengthen institutional capacity, including efforts to
improve further the publication of a number of Enhanced Data Dissemination System (e-GDDS) data
categories, and highlighted the role of the AFRITAC W2 and the importance of strong participation
by Nigeria in the Steering Committee of the Center.

STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
Nigeria’s economy has been hit hard by the sharp decline in oil prices. Reflecting the
continued heavy dependence of the fiscal and external sector accounts on oil receipts, the oil price
collapse resulted in a doubling of the general government deficit, a sharp reduction in public
investment, and a transition to a deficit on the current account. With uncertainty about policy
direction, foreign portfolio flows slowed significantly, and reserves fell. Growth is estimated to have
slowed sharply—reflecting fuel shortages in the first half of the year and less availability of foreign
exchange—weakening corporate balance sheets, lowering the resilience of the banking system, and
likely reversing progress in reducing unemployment and poverty. At the same time, inflation
increased, ending above the CBN’s medium term target range.
37.
Given the prospects for oil prices remaining lower-for-longer, continuing risk aversion
by international investors, and downside risks in the global economy, the government needs
to adroitly manage the immediate impact of the shocks, while implementing structural reforms
for economic resilience. Growth is projected to soften in 2016, but could rebound gradually in 2017,
assuming the implementation of the measures envisaged in the draft 2016 budget—especially
priority infrastructure investments—continued progress with governance reforms in the oil sector,
and with uptick in oil prices as currently projected. Key risks to the outlook include lower oil prices,
shortfalls in non-oil revenues owing to uncertain yields from administrative measures, a further
deterioration in finances of State and Local Governments, resurgence in security concerns, and
policy paralysis.
38.
Addressing the macroeconomic challenges requires urgent action to introduce and
implement an appropriate and coherent set of policies. Given the large permanent terms-oftrade shock and the significant adjustment needed, it will be important to initiate in the near-term
an integrated package of policies centered around: (i) safeguarding fiscal sustainability while
improving public service delivery; (ii) reducing external imbalances; (iii) strengthening resilience and
further improving efficiency of the banking sector; and (iv) advancing structural reforms. Together
these measures could reduce macroeconomic imbalances while supporting sustained growth and
job creation. Delaying the needed adjustment would run down fiscal and external buffers, thereby
heightening vulnerabilities.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

NIGERIA

39.
Establishing medium-term fiscal policy goals that support fiscal sustainability is a
priority, with a critical need to raise non-oil revenues. Measures should be implemented to:
(i) contain the fiscal deficit across all tiers of government; (ii) boost the ratio of non-oil revenue to
GDP, through a combination of improvements in revenue administration, broadening the tax base,
and adjusting tax rates; (iii) rationalize expenditure, including through curtailing of waivers and
exemptions, and implementing an independent price-setting mechanism to minimize/eliminate
petroleum subsidies; (iv) adopt safety nets for the most vulnerable; and (v) foster transparency and
enhanced accountability and an orderly adjustment of sub-national budgets, by encouraging reform
of budget preparation and execution and strengthening public financial management.
40.
Achieving external adjustment requires a renewed focus on ensuring the
competitiveness of the economy, including greater flexibility in the exchange rate, and a
more forward-looking monetary policy strategy. The combination of monetary easing, an
inflexible exchange rate regime, and exchange restrictions has failed to spur economic activity, while
fueling expectations of currency devaluation, and casting doubt on the authorities’ commitment to
their inflation objective. This has eroded external buffers and given rise to a situation where the
external position is weaker than what would be consistent with Nigeria's fundamentals and desirable
policy settings. With the implementation of a credible package of policies to support the adjustment
of the economy to the large, permanent terms-of-trade shock, the exchange rate should be allowed
to adjust to the underlying fundamentals and exchange restrictions removed, facilitating the
diversification of the economy. A forward-looking monetary policy strategy should be elaborated to
help improve its effectiveness.
41.
Staff does not support the policies that have given rise to the exchange restrictions
and MCP. Staff urges the authorities to articulate a speedy and monitorable exit strategy for their
removal, thus allowing an improved functioning of the foreign exchange market. This would help
narrow the exchange rate spread between the BDC/parallel and the interbank markets.
42.
Advancing structural reforms is also key to a transition to a lower oil-dependent,
competitive, investment-driven economy. The authorities have made progress in that regard,
especially in anti-money laundering and financial sector supervision (Annex I). The authorities’
strategy appears appropriate, focusing on: (i) promoting targeted and core infrastructure (in power,
integrated transport network, housing); (ii) reducing business environment costs through greater
transparency and accountability, encouraging value-chain sectors linkages across sectors
(agriculture and manufacturing); and (iii) promoting employment of youth and female populations.
Emphasis should be sustained on improving the efficiency of public sector service delivery,
accelerating and broadening public financial management reforms, improving effective capacity at
sub-national levels of government—and on creating an enabling environment to attract investment.
In addition, adopting a sound Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) along with strong measures to tackle
theft and corruption in the oil sector, including by applying targeted AML/CFT measures, will help
strengthen the regulatory framework for the oil sector and enhance its transparency and integrity.

22

43.
Further strengthening the regulatory and supervisory frameworks can help foster a
strong and resilient financial sector. Greater efficiency in the functioning of the banking system
can help support private sector investment across production segments (including MSMEs) at
reasonable financing costs. With declining asset quality a concern in a low growth environment,
intensified monitoring of banks and enhanced contingency planning and resolution frameworks
become even more critical for handling emergency assistance.
44.
Progress has been made in improving the quality and availability of economic
statistics. The authorities’ commitment to implement the Enhanced General Data Dissemination
System (e-GDDS) and the disseminating of a National Summary Data Page (NSDP) on the National
Bureau of Statistics website, are welcome steps. Further efforts are needed, however, to improve
BOP data, in particular financial account flows, and coverage of the subnational governments’ fiscal
accounts.
45.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Box 1. Nigeria: Financial Sector Vulnerabilities
The authorities regularly assess the resilience of the banking sector to a range of shocks. The stress tests
described in the June 2015 Financial Stability Report, highlight that, relative to December 2014, overall
vulnerabilities, as well as those of smaller banks, have increased. Staff estimates that, if needed,
recapitalization of all small banks could cost about 0.5 percent of GDP.



Resilience to general credit shock. This test shows that, on average, large- and medium-sized banks
would remain resilient to a generalized credit shock involving a 100 to 200 percent increase in NPLs.
However, the position of smaller banks has deteriorated significantly relative to December 2014, making
them more at risk of becoming insolvent (Figure).



Resilience to a default on oil and gas loans. Reflecting the concentration of lending to the oil and gas
industry (comprising 24 percent of total loans), the authorities assess the impact of two shocks on large
and medium-sized banks. An extreme event (50 percent default on these loans) would reduce the CAR
of large banks from 18.6 to 14.5 percent and of medium-sized banks from 14.6 to 11.25 percent. This
would mean that large banks would fall below the prudential minimum of 16 percent (including the
capital surcharge for domestic systemically important banks (DSIBs)), but would remain well capitalized
by international standards, and the Basel II capital requirement framework. However, an extreme tail
event (100 percent loss) would wipe out the total capital of these banks.



Resilience to liquidity risk. Liquidity conditions have tightened and there are signs that individual
banks’ cost of funding has increased—between December 2014 and June 2015, banks’ net interest
margin relative to gross income fell from 51 to 43 percent, while interest expenses rose from 43 percent
to 54 percent. While the relatively high prudential standards mean the system as a whole can withstand
a 30-day cumulative liquidity shock, individual banks’ positions vary considerably. In particular, four
banks would experience a liquidity shortfall following a 1-5 day liquidity shock, while six would have
shortfalls following a cumulative 30-day shock. Consequently, conditions merit ongoing monitoring.

Banks also remain exposed to state governments. Although the potential for these loans to develop into
non-performing loans has been mitigated by the recent restructuring of loans to 23 states into FGN bonds,
the credit quality of any new loans to states remains weak without a clear fiscal strengthening plan.

Box 2. Nigeria: The Pace of Adjustment
Economic developments over the next several years will be significantly impacted not just by the policies
implemented but also the timing of their implementation. The baseline scenario presented in the report reflects
the delay in the passage of the 2016 budget (although some of the policy initiatives are underway). This box
presents an alternative scenario in which a more rapid adjustment, in line with Fund advice, is implemented. These
scenarios are designed to illustrate the policy trade-offs and the importance of timely policy implementation to
lower risks.
In the baseline scenario: VAT compliance improves from 16 percent to 50 percent of GDP over the medium term;
the collection efficiency of the corporate income tax (CIT) doubles, by reviewing existing CIT incentives and
placing a moratorium on new ones; the effective collection rate of customs rises by one-fifth; there are no fuel
subsidy payments; and recurrent expenditure follows the 2016-18 MTEF. The baseline assumes no change in the
nominal exchange rate in 2016 and 2017 and no adjustment in the real exchange rate in the medium term.
Further, inflation rises slightly beyond the target range, as monetary policy eases to stimulate the economy.
The adjustment scenario comprises; in line with staff advice: (i) more aggressive revenue mobilization (e.g., raising
the VAT rate to 10 percent by 2018 and 15 percent by 2021); (ii) upfront exchange rate adjustment in 2016
(assumed here for illustrative purposes to be a 15 percent real adjustment in 2016 and along with fundamentals
thereafter); and (iii) a tight

Box 3. Nigeria: Non-oil Revenue Mobilization1
Nigeria’s non-oil revenue is one of the lowest among major commodity producers. In 2014, non-oil tax
revenue was estimated at only 4 percent of GDP, far below the average of 15 percent of GDP for other
oil exporters. Increasing fiscal space through more non-oil revenue collection holds the keys for a
growth and social-friendly orientation of the Nigerian economy.
There is scope to improve Nigeria’s revenue-to-GDP fourfold. Crivelli and Gupta (2014) study the nonresource tax effort in 35 resource-rich countries (including Nigeria) over 1992-2009 and find that each
additional percentage point of GDP of resource revenue reduces non-resource revenues by 0.3-0.4
percentage points of GDP. In addition, the share of agriculture in GDP is negatively related to tax
revenue, with magnitude similar to the impact of resource revenue, while inflation is positively related.
Applying their estimated elasticities to Nigeria’s current economic conditions suggest that non-oil tax
potential could be about 18 percent of GDP.

Box 3. Nigeria: Non-oil Revenue Mobilization (concluded)
The low tax performance in the non-oil sector reflects a combination of tax rates, exemptions, and
enforcement issues on VAT, CIT, and customs and excises. VAT collection efficiency is low compared to
other oil exporters, owing to the rate and design. At 5 percent, Nigeria has one of the lowest VAT rates
in the World, well below the regional ECOWAS requirement of 10 percent. In addition, the current VAT
is not neutral, as it disallows input tax credits to businesses on purchases of capital goods, thereby
imposing a consumption tax on real investments and undermining competitiveness. CIT performance is
below peers. Despite a rate slightly above comparators, CIT revenue is much lower (1.5 percent of GDP
against an average of 5 percent in other oil exporters). The wide use of exemptions and poor
compliance are two important factors explaining the relatively low CIT collection.
In the medium term, fiscal reforms should focus on increasing collection efforts on various taxes,
including improving compliance across the board. Raising the standard VAT rate and permitting the
offsetting of input tax credits could be early actions, while a tax on mobile phone transactions could be
introduced gradually. In addition, CIT collection could benefit from the closing of loopholes, reducing
tax exemptions, and improving compliance, while excise taxes could be increased on alcohol and
tobacco.

Box 4. Nigeria: Capacity Building in Public Financial Management
The IMF’s ongoing technical assistance program in public financial management has helped establish a
strong partnership between the Nigerian authorities and the IMF to implement reforms that would
reinforce aggregate fiscal discipline, facilitate a more strategic allocation of expenditure, and help build
the foundation for greater fiscal transparency and accountability in Nigeria.



Since 2010, the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) has been supporting the Federal
Government of Nigeria (FGN) in the design and implementation of public financial management
reforms, specifically related to treasury single account (TSA), cash management, and budgeting.
Starting in 2015, FAD and the IMF’s regional technical assistance center (AFRITAC West2) based in
Accra have been supporting the authorities’ efforts to extend these reforms to interested States.



A FAD technical assistance mission visited Abuja in February 2015 and reviewed the progress
made by FGN in TSA and cash management. It recommended enhancing functionalities in the
Government Integrated Financial Management Information System (GIFMIS), and advised a
phased approach to piloting program-based budgeting, starting with a few sector ministries.



In response to a request from the Federal Ministry of Finance, AFRITAC West2 fielded several
short-term expert missions during September–December 2015 to assist the Kaduna State
authorities with establishing a TSA system along the lines being implemented by the FGN and
developing associated documentation, including a TSA manual. Following the Kaduna State
initiative, several States have expressed an interest in establishing TSA systems.



Staff have remained engaged, including through presentations on Nigeria’s macroeconomic
context and international experience with TSA reforms to the National Economic Council.



More recently, a FAD mission visited Abuja (January/February 2016) to advise on next steps in
TSA, cash management, and budget preparation, options for implementing TSA reform in States,
and a framework for a spending review, to identify potential savings from fiscal consolidation and
unlock fiscal space for spending on developmental needs.

Box 5. Nigeria: What Role for the Exchange Rate in Commodity Exporters?
Commodity exporters have adopted a range of approaches to achieving the external adjustment
following the sharp decline in commodity prices since mid-2014. Independent of the exchange rate
regime, establishing a credible package of macroeconomic policies is critical to achieving a smooth
adjustment. Countries that had flexible regimes—such as Ghana, South Africa, and Zambia—have persevered
with their floats and in some cases seen significant depreciations amplified by the difficulty in establishing a
credible package of supporting policies. Some who operated more managed floats, such as Kazakhstan and
Russia, have introduced greater flexibility into their regimes. Several countries with soft pegs, including
Algeria, Angola and Azerbaijan in addition to Nigeria, have sought to preserve a peg by allowing a limited
number of realignments and seeking to protect reserves through restrictions on access to foreign exchange.
Other countries with pegged regimes, such as CEMAC and the GCC countries have preserved their long
established pegs using a combination of running down reserves and fiscal adjustment.
Greater exchange rate flexibility in a commodity exporter creates both pros and cons that need to be
weighed carefully. In the case of Nigeria:



It cannot on its own increase non-oil exports and thereby “cushion” the size of import contraction as
high costs of production (due to domestic supply-side bottlenecks) need to be addressed. Greater
flexibility may stimulate non-oil exports to some extent, but the immediate impact would be limited by
the narrow non-oil export base. Structural reforms to improve productivity and diversify the export base
would have a greater impact.



It cannot get rid of the two-tier foreign currency market and arbitrage opportunities, as long as the CBN
continues to sell in the foreign currency market at a specific price or at a range that is not aligned with
the underlying fundamentals. As the government (hence CBN) is the dominant recipient of foreign
currency income, an alternative transparent mechanism for the CBN to supply the market could be
identified.



It can create fiscal space, for development spending, through increasing the naira value of oil receipts.
This would be partially offset by higher Naira external debt and fuel subsidy payments.



It can aggravate corporate and financial sector vulnerabilities for those with forex exposures. This impact
has already occurred but may not yet be recognized on balance sheets.



It can signal to the market that the medium-term development strategy includes a clear strategy for
forex earnings. Without it, access and the cost of external borrowing will become increasingly
unfavorable and will limit Nigeria’s (and West Africa’s) full growth potential.



It can reduce overvaluation that is contributing to keeping foreign capital from flowing in, causing
Nigerians to both keep their FX offshore and hold back from domestic investment owing to the
uncertainty, and contributing to speculative demand for foreign exchange.



It can achieve a better allocation of scarce FX among competing demands, relative to the current policy
of restrictions and priority allocations. Imposing foreign exchange restrictions on certain imports could
look appealing, but is costly. These measures should be temporary, to minimize distortions and limit
their adverse impact on private sector activity and investment.



It can remove the risk of rent seeking by enabling equal access to forex rather than just for a select
group who have preferential access.

Comments

Goal 1 is not likely to be achieved, though
there is no poverty measure that is
comparable across time.

Goal 2 is not likely to be achieved. In fact
the primary completion rate has declined
since 2005.
Goal 3 is closed to be achieved for children
5-14 year old. GHS-Panel 2012/13 shows
the ratio is at 97 percent.
Goal 4 is not likely to be achieved, as
mortality of children under 5 has declined
only by 47 percent since 1990 (as opposed
to 2/3).
Goal 5 is not likely to be achieved, as
maternal mortality has declined only by 49
percent since 1990 (as opposed to 3/4).

Goal 6 is not likely to be achieved, as only a
half of children with fever received
antimalarial drugs in 2010. Not enough
information on universal access to
treatment for HIV/AIDS.

Goal 7 is not likely to be achieved, as those
without access to water declined only by 29
percent since 1990 (as opposed to 1/2).

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment
of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM
reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly. “Short term” and “medium
term” are meant to indicate that the risk could materialize within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

Annex II. Tackling Theft and Corruption in Nigeria’s Oil Sector by
Applying AML/CFT Framework
A.

Background

Although the magnitude is largely unknown, Nigeria’s oil sector has long suffered from theft 1
and corruption due to weak governance. 2 The main weaknesses in governance identified include,
among others, lack of transparency and accountability and weak enforcement of sector laws.3 These
issues have centered on the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), which generates a large
share of Nigeria’s oil production. In 2015, around 72 percent of Federal government’s oil revenue was
channeled through the NNPC. 4 Furthermore, corruption creates an enabling environment for organized
crime groups to exploit the weak safeguard of oil pipelines and facilities to steal oil. There has been
evidence that the proceeds of high-level corruption and oil theft are laundered in international financial
centers outside Nigeria. 5

B.

Recent Developments and Policy Initiatives

Combating theft
There is little information to ascertain the effect of the sharp decline oil prices since 2014 on the
volume of theft. From January to November 2015, the NNPC recorded 2,447 pipelines theft points
(34.3 percent lower than 2014), resulting in a loss of crude and products valued at N56.68billon. It is
however difficult to estimate the volume of proceeds generated by theft.6 According to the authorities,
the decrease of pipelines breaks are attributable to comprehensive security reforms, including the
operations of the Joint Task Force that are aimed at enhancing military and naval operations against
illegal vandalism and bunkering.

1

“Oil theft” is a broad term that can refer to various illegal activities including illegal bunkering, pipelines vandalism, fuel
scooping, illegal refining, among others. Furthermore, the relationship between spills, sabotage and theft cannot be
measured systematically. See 2013 Report on Nigeria’s Criminal Crude: Combat the Export of the Stolen Oil of Chatham
House: https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/public/Research/Africa/0913pr_nigeriaoil_es.pdf.

Oil sector reforms
Enhancing transparency and integrity of the oil sector is a priority of the administration. The
NNPC has been publishing monthly financial and operations reports since October 2015, a welcome
step to improving transparency. This allows easier access to information by the general public as well as
by agencies such as Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiatives (NEITI), which audit the oil
industry. Further, the administration has announced ambitious plans to reform the NNPC and the legal
framework governing the oil industry, which may have important implications to the sector’s integrity.
Anti-corruption measures
The government also took initiatives to strengthen anti-corruption measures beyond the oil
industry. A Presidential Advisory Commission was set up in August 2015, and tasked with developing a
national strategy on anti-corruption.

C.
Using Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of
Terrorism (AML/CFT) Framework to Combat Oil Theft and Corruption
The AML/CFT framework can help detect financial flows from theft and corruption, and facilitate
confiscation of proceeds from crime. Some key components of the framework and how they can help
tackle the proceeds of theft and corruption in the oil sector are analyzed below.
National Risk Assessment (NRA) on Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism (ML/FT)
The NRA is a cornerstone of the revised international standard on AML/CFT, the Financial Action Task
Force (FATF) Recommendation. The NRA aims to identify and assess the ML/FT risks faced by the
country and inform national policy making in establishing priorities with a view to mitigating these risks.
Coordinated by the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) at the operational level, Nigeria launched
its first NRA in 2013 and expects to conclude this exercise prior to the mutual evaluation of its AML/CFT
framework in the first half of 2017. Twenty-six institutions/agencies are involved in the exercise,
including law enforcement agencies such as the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC), the
Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offense Commission (ICPC), and Nigeria Customs
Service; supervisory bodies such as the CBN; and the private sector. According to authorities, both oil
theft and corruption are covered in the analysis.
CBN’s AML/CFT supervision
The CBN oversees banks’ implementation of AML/CFT obligations using a risk-based approach.
Commercial banks in Nigeria are required to assess ML/FT risks and apply risk-sensitive controls
including due diligence on customers and beneficial owners, monitoring of domestic politically exposed
persons (including senior executives of stated owned corporations) and reporting suspicious
transactions. It seems that banks have considered corruption as the most significant proceeds
generating crime in Nigeria and taken mitigating measures, but have paid less attention to oil theft.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

45

NIGERIA

The CBN is also charged with supervising more than 2,800 bureau de changes (BDCs) including with
respect to the implementation of AML/CFT measures. BDCs may be particularly vulnerable to money
laundering schemes that involve moving the criminal proceeds abroad through massive cash smuggling
(see below). In 2015, the CBN inspected 135 BDCs (or 5 percent) and found their compliance level to be
generally poor. BDCs filed no suspicious transaction reports (STRs) in 2014 and 2015.
NFIU’s strategic analysis
The NFIU has established a unit responsible for conducting thematic strategic analysis with a view to
identifying ML and FT trends and typologies prevalent in the country. In this capacity, the NFIU relies
mainly on the intelligence generated by itself and has not systemically benefited from other information
in particular cases investigated by law enforcement agencies which were not triggered by NFIU. To date
the NFIU has published one typology report on terrorist financing. It has however identified oil theft
and corruption among priority topics for strategic analysis in 2016.
EFCC’s investigation and prosecution
Supported by intelligence generated by the NFIU, the EFCC investigates and prosecutes ML and
predicate offences including oil theft, and assists the ICPC in investigating corruption cases. These
activities are carried out at regional level. In oil producing regions, oil theft is considered a priority and
constitutes the majority of investigations. While some investigations on oil theft resulted in successful
convictions, majority of the proceeds generated are widely believed to have been moved abroad thus
prove difficult to trace and recover.
Anti-corruption work of ICPC and Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB)
The ICPC is charged with investigating and prosecuting corruption related offences defined under the
ICPC Act and other Acts. It is empowered to trace, seize, freeze, confiscate and forfeit all proceeds of
corruption and related offences. The CCB is mandated by the third and fifth schedules of the
Constitution to receive assets declarations by public officers; examine the declaration; retain custody of
such declarations and make them available to Nigerian citizens.
Tackling cash smuggling
One potential means to move ill-gotten funds abroad is massive cash smuggling. A Joint Task Force
comprising, among other, the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) and the EFCC has been set up to tackle
the issue. The NFIU also receives from the NCS information on declarations of cash transportation of a
value over USD 10,000 or equivalent, but is not informed when custom officers take provisional
measures (such as seizure).

Policy Advice

The authorities’ efforts to tackle theft and corruption in the oil sector should be pursued further.
Enhancing implementation of existing measures:


Expedite the NRA process and ensure it provides a comprehensive assessment of risks posed by
oil theft, corruption, tax evasion and related money laundering and informs the national policy
on AML/CFT (short term);



Conduct robust strategic analysis on macro-relevant crimes including oil theft, corruption and
tax evasion supported by enhanced information sharing between the NFIU and law enforcement
agencies, and publishing typology reports in a timely manner (short term);



Strengthen AML/CFT supervision of banks focused on the risks of laundering of the proceeds of
corruption and in particular oil theft (short term);



Seek synergy between AML/CFT policy and national strategies on combating oil theft and anticorruption (medium term);

Reviewing the legal and regulatory framework to fully address risks associated with oil theft,
corruption and the laundering of proceeds generated:


Review the anti-corruption legal framework to ensure all corruption acts are criminalized in
accordance with the United Nations Convention against Corruption and the offences are
applicable to directors and senior executives of NNPC (short term);



Review the AML/CFT regulatory framework of BDCs with a view to improving AML/CFT
compliance (medium term).

Enhancing transparency of assets owned by senior officials. In this regard, measures can be built
upon the existing constitutional requirement on public officers to declare assets: 7

7



Require the publication of comprehensive asset declarations by senior officials, including directors
and senior executives of NNPC and of the oil sector regulator. It should cover assets owned
abroad and assets of which the official (or executive, director) is a beneficial owner (short term).



Ensure non-declaration or false declaration are subject to dissuasive sanctions (short term).

Annex III. Fiscal and External Debt Sustainability1
Public debt sustainability analysis2
Although at low levels, Nigeria’s debt profile reveals weaknesses. Because of higher-than-historical fiscal
deficits and unfavorable financing terms, public debt in percent of GDP is projected to rise by eight
percentage points between 2015 and 2021. Gross financing needs are now forecast to remain
significantly higher than the historical average and debt service is projected to represent a higher share
of fiscal revenue. Nigeria’s debt dynamic is vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks, especially to primary
balance and interest rate shocks. To stabilize debt and reduce financing pressures, bold fiscal reforms
will be necessary. In particular, it is essential to boost non-oil revenue mobilization.
BASELINE PROJECTIONS
The baseline scenario assumes a very challenging macroeconomic situation going forward. Real GDP
growth is projected to reach 4 percent, well below historical outturns, on the back of lower oil prices, a
deteriorating fiscal stance, and weak global growth and private sector confidence. Inflation measured by
the GDP deflator is estimated to accelerate from 8.7 percent in 2016 to 11.3 percent in 2018 and decline
thereafter to 7.5 percent in the medium term. With the envisaged consolidation plan in the 2016-18
MTEF (including expenditure containment, VAT rate increase, and broad tax administration measures),
the “imputed” primary deficit is projected to narrow significantly to 2.8 percent of GDP by 20213.
Baseline assumptions do not point to a significant bias in the forecast track record, which is broadly in
line with those observed in other surveillance countries. Reflecting the volatility of oil price, past
projections of the primary balance show some bias tilted toward the optimistic side.
Nigeria’s public debt is set to rise, but remains at a comfortable level. Mostly domestic and maturing in
the medium term, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to increase by one half from 14.4 percent in
2015 to 25 percent in 2021. The growing debt ratio is largely driven by larger-than-historical deficits
stemming primarily from the reduction in oil revenue due to the recent drop in prices. The contribution
of growth to debt reduction will not be large enough to offset adverse dynamics from real interest
rates. Over the medium term, the current policy course will lead to higher financing needs. Gross
financing needs in percent of GDP are projected to increase to above 7 percent over the medium-term.
Though declining, public debt service (interest payments and amortization) will continue to represent a
considerable share of general government revenue, remaining above 50 percent over the medium term.

STRESS TESTS
Stress tests indicate that Nigeria’s debt and financing profile needs are particularly sensitive to interest
rate and primary balance shocks.
Primary balance shock. This constitutes the main risk to Nigeria debt sustainability. This scenario
assumes a deterioration of the primary balance from the baseline by 2.3 percentage points in 2017 and
2018. In such case, the debt-to-GDP ratio will increase significantly than the baseline, reaching almost
31.8 percent in 2021. Financing requirements in percent of GDP will peak at 11.1 percent in 2018 and
will decline thereafter at a higher level than the outcome in the baseline.
Interest rate shock. Because debt service already represents a large share of revenue, higher interest
rates are a key risk to debt sustainability. In this scenario, nominal interest rate increases to reflect the
real interest rate observed over the past 10 years. For Nigeria, it is assumed that the spreads increase by
about 500 bps from 2017 onward. The debt-to-GDP ratio reaches 30.6 percent at the end of the
projection horizon, with gross financing needs projected at around 9.4 percent of GDP.
Growth shock. In this scenario, real output growth rates are lowered in 2016 and 2017 by one standard
deviation (2.4 percentage points, as observed over the past 10 years). Under this assumption, the debtto-GDP ratio is driven by an unfavorable interest rate growth differential and is expected to be higher
than the baseline, reaching 29.3 percent in 2021. Gross financing needs will be higher than that of the
baseline, at around 7.9 percent of GDP by 2021.
Real exchange rate shock. In this scenario, it is assumed that exchange rate depreciates to the
maximum historical movement observed over the 10 past years (that is, an 18 percent depreciation as in
2009). Under this scenario, the debt and gross financing needs -to-GDP ratios will be above that of the
baseline, at 27.6 and 7.6 percent of GDP by 2021, respectively.
Combined macro-fiscal shock. A combined shock incorporates the effects of individual shocks on all
relevant variables (real GDP growth, inflation, primary balance, exchange rate and interest rate). This will
increase debt to 37.5 percent of GDP by 2021. Gross financing needs will reach 10.7 percent of GDP at
the end of the projection horizon.
Contingent liability shock. In the absence of concrete estimates of contingent liabilities, a one-time
bail out of the financial sector that increases non-interest expenditures by 10 percent of banking sector
assets is assumed to represent a hypothetical realization of such contingent liabilities. The debt-to-GDP
ratio will exceed 30 percent at the end of the projection horizon. Gross financing needs will be slightly
above that of the baseline until 2021.
Fan charts. There is a significant uncertainty around the baseline. The width of the symmetric fan chart,
estimated at around 35 percent of GDP, illustrates the degree of uncertainty for equal-probability
upside and downside shocks. An extreme downside shock that constrains growth to zero in the
asymmetric fan chart results in a more upward-sloping debt path. This reflects a balance of risks skewed
to the downside.

The analysis of Nigeria’s debt profile underlines higher-than-historical debt and financing needs ratios
in the medium term. The heat map assessment indicates that Nigeria’s debt-to-GDP profile is well
below warning thresholds. However, public debt service will reach a concerning level amounting to
more than 50 percent of general government revenue. Higher interest rates constitute the main risks for
Nigeria’s debt as reflected by already-high bond spreads, which signal that market participants assign a
non-negligible probability of default. Decisive fiscal actions are essential to curb financing pressures and
stabilize debt—specifically, a debt-stabilizing primary balance of -1.1 percent of GDP will be required. In
particular, strengthening non-oil revenue mobilization could help achieve this objective.
External debt sustainability analysis
The level of external debt is low but is projected to increase modestly in the baseline, owing to rising public
external borrowing. While the level of external debt is projected to remain low, the sustainability of the
debt path would be vulnerable to a failure of oil prices to recover as expected, a substantial devaluation of
the naira, or the inability to access market financing for an extended period.
The level of external debt (covering both the public and the private sector) is low, at about 10 percent
of GDP in 2015, but has risen moderately in recent years (Table 2).4 Nigeria’s increasing financial
integration has led to higher private sector external debt, public sector external debt from commercial
sources, and non-resident holdings of public sector domestic securities. The increased prevalence of
commercial financing sources and private borrowers has been reflected in a rising interest rate on
external debt. Furthermore, other key ratios have deteriorated as lower oil prices have reduced oil
exports. The ratio of external debt to exports has increased from 24 percent in 2011 to 98 percent in
2015. Gross external financing needs were negative through 2013; nevertheless external debt increased
as errors and omissions outflows largely offset the current account surplus. For 2015 the estimated
gross external financing need amounted to $27.9 billion, over 5 percent of GDP; about $5 billion was
financed through drawing down gross reserves.
In the baseline scenario, external debt is forecast to increase modestly in the medium term, to
14 percent of GDP in 2021. With oil prices remaining low and economic activity recovering only
gradually, private sector external borrowing is projected to be below the levels prevailing in 2011–2013.
The public sector is expected to draw on financing from multilateral, bilateral, and commercial external
sources, while the recent lower level of participation of foreign investors in the domestic debt market is
expected to persist. The increase in interest rates on external debt is projected to continue given the
expected normalization of monetary policy in advanced economies and Nigeria’s deteriorating
macroeconomic risk profile.

4

The analysis is subject to gaps in Nigeria’s International Investment Position data, as well as incomplete coverage of
external interest payments. The analysis here uses staff estimates based on the estimated stock of non-resident holdings
of securities issued on the domestic market (total stock outstanding minus identified holdings of domestic financial
institutions), capital markets data on securities issued abroad, and average interest rates on such securities.

External financing needs are projected to remain well above historical levels, reflecting projected current
account deficits and gradually rising amortization. Given Nigeria’s relatively short history of accessing
commercial financing and the lending capacity of multilateral and bilateral creditors to the public sector,
the sustainability of this debt path will hinge critically on the ability to maintain market access.
Scenarios are used to illustrate the sensitivity of debt levels (external debt sustainability) to various
shocks, including oil prices and the exchange rate. Higher interest rates on external debt or a slowdown
in economic growth would not, by themselves, lead to outcomes substantially different from the
baseline scenario. On the other hand, a shock to the non-interest current account, which given the
structure of Nigeria’s trade can be interpreted as a decline in oil exports of substantial magnitude,
would more than double the external debt-to-GDP ratio, relative to the baseline.5 This result is driven by
the high historical volatility of Nigeria’s current account balance, which owes largely to fluctuations in
oil prices. A combined (interest rate, growth, current account) shock has a similar impact on debt, driven
by the current account dynamics. Debt dynamics also become quickly unfavorable under a one-time
real depreciation of 30 percent, given the lower base of GDP in U.S. dollars.

5

If the shock occurred entirely through lower oil prices, the scenario would correspond to prices remaining around
$30 per barrel in the medium term.

Annex IV. External Sustainability Assessment
Nigeria’s external position weakened in 2015, with the current account deteriorating and reserves
falling. While data gaps complicate the assessment, staff finds that the real exchange rate is
moderately overvalued and that a higher level of external buffers would be advisable given the high
dependence on oil and consequent volatility of exports. The low level of non-oil exports points to the
need for structural reforms to improve competitiveness, which would contribute to reducing oil
dependence and increasing the stability of external receipts.

I. Current Account and Exchange Rate
Nigeria’s current account balance has shifted
to a deficit driven by the decline in oil prices.
The oil trade balance, which was over
14 percent of GDP in 2013, fell to less than
7 percent of GDP in 2015 (Figure 1). Other
components of the current account have
provided partial offset, as deficits in the
services and income balances have narrowed
(including as a result of lower dividend
payments on oil-related foreign investment),
and non-oil imports have fallen after spiking in
2014. However, non-oil exports have remained
below 2 percent of GDP and oil continues to
account for over 80 percent of exports of
goods and services.
The naira depreciated against the U.S. dollar
by 9 percent in 2015 and a cumulative
19 percent since October 2014, but with the
dollar stronger against other currencies, the
devaluation has only been about 10 percent in
nominal effective terms (Figure 2). With
inflation higher than among trading partners,
the real effective exchange rate (REER) only
depreciated by 3 percent in that time, leaving
the naira 25 percent stronger in real terms
than in 2011.

Caution is warranted in interpreting the valuation of the naira for both theoretical and practical
reasons:


As an oil producer, Nigeria should be seeking to accumulate financial assets via current account
surpluses to preserve at least a portion of the oil wealth for future generations. On the other
hand, as a low-income developing country with substantial development needs, a case could be
made for using the oil proceeds for infrastructure investment (see SIP on Fiscal Framework).
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

59

NIGERIA



From a more near-term perspective, unexpected movements in oil prices could lead to
substantial changes in the external position that could affect the assessment.



In late June the Central Bank of Nigeria imposed restrictions on the acquisition of foreign
exchange in the domestic market for the importation of 40 categories of goods. The temporary
diversion of demand away from these products would tend to improve the current account in the
short run. However, there would be offsets owing to reductions in Nigeria’s exports of the
affected products as domestic production is diverted to the domestic market, and of exports that
use the affected products as inputs. Staff’s discussions with the authorities and the private sector
suggested these offsets could be sizable. Thus, the impact on the current account of these
measures is uncertain.



Data gaps also add uncertainty. Large errors and omissions outflows suggest imprecision in
existing estimates of the current account balance and/or the net foreign asset position, which are
two of the main concepts in the assessment. Alternative data sources are used to construct an
estimate for portfolio liabilities to non-residents, which is a key input into the assessment of
reserve adequacy.

Quantitative estimates of external equilibrium suggest that the naira is moderately overvalued. In
particular:


EBA-lite current account model. Under the External Balance Assessment (EBA)-lite
methodology, the current account balance is modeled as a function of its fundamentals (fiscal
balance, private credit, change in reserves, net foreign assets, oil and gas trade balance, relative
income, relative GDP growth, demographics, institutional environment, aid and remittances
flows, terms of trade gap, and output gap).1 The current account reference is the estimated
deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP for 2015. The estimated norm was a deficit of 0.2 percent of GDP
(Table 1). Macroeconomic policies contributed 1.4 percent of GDP to the current account gap.
The policy gap owed to the fiscal deficit and foreign exchange intervention during the year.



External sustainability approach. This approach sets a medium-term current account norm at
the level that would bring net foreign assets-to-GDP to zero in ten years, by end-2025. On this
basis, the estimated norm is a surplus of 0.9 percent of GDP, compared to the medium-term
current account forecast of a deficit of 0.9 percent of GDP (Table 1).



Equilibrium REER approach. This price-based approach directly models a REER norm within a
panel framework as a function of the many of the fundamentals used in the EBA approach, with
the addition of the real short-term interest rate given its importance in the short-run empirical
behavior of exchange rates. The approach has the shortcoming that it relies on fixed effects
estimation, which forces each country’s regression residuals to sum to zero over the sample
period, which may make the results less reliable for countries with a short sample span or where

NIGERIA

large structural changes have occurred that are not captured by the regression.2 Given the
applicability of these caveats to Nigeria, the results of this approach, which suggest an exchange
rate gap of 9.5 percent, should be viewed with caution (Table 1).

Positive numbers indicate overvaluation. Elasticity of current account to real exchange rate gap is 0.10.

These quantitative approaches point to an external position that is weaker than that implied by
medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings, with a current account gap of 1.5 percent
to 2 percent of GDP and a real exchange rate gap of about 15-20 percent. The analysis points to the
macroeconomic policy stance as a factor contributing to this outcome. The current account model
suggests that over half of the above gaps could have been closed if other macroeconomic policies
had been at their desirable settings. This provides a measure of the component of the estimated
overvaluation that would ideally be addressed by other policy levers, leaving the remainder to be
addressed through real exchange rate adjustment, or, in the medium term, structural policies to
improve competitiveness. These dynamics are illustrated by the inability of the 2014-15 devaluations
to significantly alter the real effective exchange rate, which points to the need for a package of
supportive macroeconomic policies to restore external sustainability.
The behavior of other key indicators is consistent with the picture given by the quantitative
approaches. The slow adjustment in the non-oil current account is noted above, driven in part by a
drop in non-oil exports that is described in more detail below. In addition, capital inflows have tailed
off (see SIP on Capital Flows) and reserves have declined. Finally, the exchange rate implied by

non-deliverable naira forwards traded offshore, the outlook from Consensus Forecasts, and the

II. Reserve Adequacy
Gross international reserves were $28.3 billion at end- 2015, down from $42.8 billion at end-2013.
Reserves are 100 percent of the IMF’s composite metric, at the low end of the adequate range
(Figure 4). However, the metric does not capture some factors that would point to a higher level of
external vulnerabilities:


Oil dependence. Recent IMF work on reserve adequacy has suggested augmenting the
composite metric with a buffer for commodity-intensive exporters based on a cautious forecast
of futures prices.3 This approach yields a buffer of less than $1 billion, not fundamentally
changing the assessment. Given the degree to which volatility in oil prices has prompted large
swings in Nigeria’s exports and reserves, this buffer would not seem sufficient to address
potential vulnerabilities (Figure 5). For example, the contribution of oil exports to the standard
metric dropped almost $5 billion from 2013–2015 (Figure 4). Indeed, the standard deviation of
Nigeria’s annual export growth over the last 20 years was the fourth-largest out of 79 emerging
market countries, and more than twice that of the median country (Figure 6).4 The adequacy
range of 100 to 150 percent of the composite metric is selected in view of the uncertainty
inherent in the estimation of balance of payments risks. In light of the high volatility of exports

3

See Assessing Reserve Adequacy—Specific Proposals, SM/14/334 (12/19/2014). The price applied is one standard
deviation below the market futures price, calculated using options on oil futures prices.

The volatility of broad money to GDP is also in the top quintile of countries in the sample. Lack of data availability
for many countries prevented a similar analysis of short-term and other liabilities to non-residents.

62

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

and the degree to which this has passed through to reserves, it would be advisable for Nigeria to
consider holding a level of reserves in the upper end of the adequacy range, with a floor of at
least 125 percent of the metric. In this context, Nigeria’s current level of reserves, which is about
$7 billion below the middle of the adequacy range, would not appear sufficient to buffer balance
of payments risks (Figure 7).

Foreign exchange swaps. Net inflows to the Central
Bank from foreign exchange swaps were about
$4.8 billion (17 percent of gross reserves) in 2014 and
2015. This predetermined outflow of foreign exchange
implies that the extent of foreign currency liquidity
buffers at the disposal of the authorities is lower than
the headline gross reserves figure. At end-2015, gross
reserves minus foreign exchange swaps stood at
about 85 percent of the standard composite metric
(Figure 7).
Unfavorable balance of payments outlook. The decline
in reserves projected for 2016 would bring gross
reserves to less than 75 percent of the composite
metric (Figure 7). Under staff’s baseline scenario, this
shortfall would worsen in the medium term.

III. Competitiveness of Non-Oil Exports
Structural reforms are needed to improve competitiveness over the medium term, which would

63

exports of non-oil goods and services amounted to just 1.2 percent of GDP in 2015, and have
remained in a narrow range below 2 percent of GDP over the past decade. Performance has lagged
that of other Sub-Saharan African oil exporters, who in the last five years have experienced some
gains in their world market share and increases in the ratio of non-oil exports to GDP (Figure 8).

Non-oil exports to GDP

Non-oil export growth

While an appreciating real exchange rate and foreign exchange restrictions may explain some of the
recent slow growth in Nigeria’s non-oil exports, the persistently low level of exports is likely rooted in
more structural causes. Previous IMF reports have pointed to structural impediments to growth in
general and the export sector in particular.5 These include the high cost and unreliability of electricity
supply, the low incidence of paved roads, low access to credit, gaps in health and education levels,
and shortcomings in the business environment and governance indicators. Several of these areas
rank as key reform priorities of the new administration.

IV. Overall Assessment
Taken together, the above analysis suggests that the external position is weaker than that implied by
medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings, with a current account gap of 1.5 percent
to 2 percent of GDP and a real exchange rate gap of about 15 to 20 percent. Furthermore, foreign
currency buffers are below desirable levels. The analysis points to the macroeconomic policy stance
and structural factors inhibiting competitiveness as factors contributing to these outcomes. It should
be noted that this assessment refers to outcomes for 2015 as a whole. With fundamentals changing
over the course of the year and into early 2016, especially the continuing low oil prices, the
estimated current account and exchange rate gaps, and the associated balance of payments risks,
may have increased.

Annex V. Women and Gender Inclusion
Income-Generating Activities: Women comprise 50.2 percent of the total population and account
for about 42 percent of total labor force, which is low compared to peers. The General Household
Survey Panel (GHS-panel), which compiled data on income from a nationally representative sample
of 5,000 households, reports that agriculture (49 percent) is the main employment sector for men,
with trading in second place (10 percent), while trading (37 percent) tops for women, with agriculture
in second place (33 percent). Trading is the primary income-generating activity for 42 percent of
women aged 45-59 and for 65 percent of women aged 45-59 living in urban areas. Women also
spend a significant portion of the day engaged in collecting water and wood for fuel: on average
women spend 24 minutes per day while men spend 20 minutes per day with a large regional
disparity between women in North Central spending as much as 60 minutes and women in North
West spending 13 minutes.
Education: Literacy rates among women aged 15 and above stand at 41 percent, which is low
compared to men at 61 percent (in 2008) as well as to other peers in Sub-Sahara Africa Frontier
market economies and BRICS. The GHS-panel conducted in 2012/13 also shows higher rates of
self-reported literacy for males than for females and the gap increases for older individuals: for 5-9,
39 percent and 37 percent for males and females respectively; while for 20-30, 83 percent and 66
percent for males and females respectively. GHS-panel also shows higher school enrollment rates for
males than for females (69 percent and 67 percent respectively) with the lowest enrollment rates for
females in North West (50 percent) compared to those in South East (84 percent).
Health: Maternal mortality is higher at 560 per 100,000 live births, compared to 446 for SSA. Health
needs in Nigeria are significant with limited access to health care facilities. For example, GHS-Panel
shows that the average time to reach the nearest hospital or health facility is 49 minutes for male
and 43 minutes for female. The regional disparity is high—for some regions (e.g., North East) the
average time is as high as 115 minutes while other regions (e.g., South West), the average time is 27
minutes.
Significant progress has been made in recent years in promoting economic participation and
opportunity for Nigerian women, a trend that should feature in the development of Nigeria’s
sustainable development goals. Key initiatives include:




In Kano, working with the UK Department for International Development, the authorities have
piloted a conditional cash transfer scheme to poor households that is linked to girls' enrolment
in school, which is now up by 40 percent. A special development program for north-eastern
Nigeria is being developed.
The government has gone further, introducing gender-sensitive budgeting. In agriculture,
Nigeria has enrolled 3 million women into an e-wallet program, providing them with mobile
phones so that they can receive subsidized seeds, fertilizers and pesticides.
In public works, the government is developing women's groups across the country as
maintenance clubs to repair local roads. Women are also being given opportunities as
subcontractors on public-works projects.
Finally, the ministry of health is supporting medical programs for young women with support of
the World Bank.
The government also launched the Safe Schools Initiative to provide security so that parents and
pupils are reassured about our determination to protect them.

Exchange Rate Arrangement
In Nigeria, the foreign exchange market comprises the interbank and bureau de change segments.
The de jure exchange arrangement is a managed float. Nigeria’s de facto exchange rate
arrangement is a stabilized arrangement, as the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has maintained the
naira at a pegged rate within a 2 percent band against the U.S. dollar in the interbank market since
March 9, 2015. Nigeria currently maintains the following exchange restrictions and MCP subject to
Fund approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3, of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement: (i) an
exchange restriction arising from the prohibition to access foreign exchange at the Nigerian foreign
exchange markets for the payment of imports of 40 categories of items; (ii) an exchange restriction
arising from the rationing of foreign exchange and its allocation based on the CBN’s determination
of priority categories of transactions; and (iii) an MCP arising from the large spread between the rate
set by the CBN for commercial banks, and the rates in the BDC and parallel market. In addition,
existing limits on the amounts of FX available when traveling abroad, which cannot be exceeded
even upon verification of the bona fide nature of the transaction, also give rise to an exchange
restriction under Article VIII. Nigeria continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements of
Article XIV, although it no longer maintains any restrictions under this provision.
Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the CBN was subject to a full safeguards assessment
with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement that expired on October 31, 2001. The assessment, which
included an on-site visit, was completed on November 28, 2001. The assessment concluded that, at
that time, vulnerabilities existed in the areas of financial reporting and legal structure of the Central
Bank.
Article IV Consultation
Nigeria is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. The previous Article IV
consultation was concluded on February 27, 2015.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of March 1, 2016)

I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data are broadly adequate for surveillance; however data deficiencies remain—in particular,
inadequate information on subnational public finances and large errors and omissions in the balance
of payments. The Statistics Act of 2007, which established the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) as the
main coordinating agency for data management, has led to a number of improvements, including
better information sharing between data producing and collecting agencies. There has been an
improvement in the compilation of timely and internally consistent data, for example, the Government
Integrated Financial Management Information System (GIFMIS) is now used for budget preparations
and the coverage of the Treasury Single Account (TSA) is now completed at the Federal Government
level. These efforts are being extended to the subnational levels, including through Fund TA support.
National accounts: Basic statistics are extensively available for the compilation of national accounts
and the NBS employed major methodological updates in 2014 by adopting the System of National
Accounts (SNA 2008 version), the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC revision 4). The
weaknesses associated with the reliance on the consumer price index to construct the constant price
GDP series has improved by developing the supply and use table (SUT) framework (first time in its
history) and collecting producer price data. The introduction of additional indices, such as a producer
price index, would facilitate more accurate estimation of the constant price measure. The authorities
received Technical Assistance (TA) from the Fund, World Bank, and African Development Bank in
completing the GDP rebasing exercise, and ongoing assistance will support the next rebasing,
scheduled for 2016. The rebased GDP (base year=2010) and supply and use table reflected the
significant change that had taken place in the structure of the economy since the previous rebasing in
1990. In addition, the conduct of a census of businesses, a census of agriculture, and a household
living conditions survey in 2014 contributed to further improvements in the measurement of GDP.
Further TA support since the rebasing has focused on finalizing the SUT and backcasting for the
rebased annual national accounts.
Prices statistics: The official monthly consumer price index (CPI), a composite of urban and rural
price data, is available on a timely basis. The index expenditure weights are still based on the 2003/04
National Consumer Expenditure Survey (and therefore are unlikely to be representative of current
expenditure patterns) even though a Harmonized Nigeria Living Standard Survey (HNLSS) was
conducted during 2009/2010. A TA mission is planned for early 2016 to assist with updating the CPI.
The producer price index (PPI) survey was suspended in 2013. The authorities have expressed interest
in receiving TA to resume compilation, but a timeline has not been established.

Government finance statistics: The most pressing shortcoming is related to inadequate data
coverage, particularly of the subnational governments, which comprise almost one half of total
government expenditure. The federal government has limited information on the subnational
fiscal accounts, making it difficult to target a consolidated fiscal balance; efforts to address this
issue have been stymied by constitutional restrictions. However, the oil price shock and need for
financial bailouts at the state and local governments could provide a catalyst for this effort. The
CBN disseminates survey data on state and local governments budgets, but survey responses do

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

NIGERIA

not necessarily follow the same definitions, and these data are not consolidated with data from
other levels of government. To facilitate the timely preparation of a consolidated set of fiscal
accounts, however, governments at all levels need to use budget classification, chart of accounts,
and accounting systems that will allow consistent classifications of the data. Current plan for
nationwide adoption of International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) on a cash basis
at the Federal and State levels is ongoing and are instrumental to this end.
Monetary and financial statistics: There have been improvements in the compilation of monetary
statistics. Most recently a TA mission from STA visited Abuja (January 18-29, 2016) to discuss and
address methodological and compilation issues in monetary and financial statistics (MFS). After the
implementation of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in the financial statements in
most of the other depositary corporations (ODCs), the CBN recently embarked on a project to expand
the institutional coverage of MFS. There is need to expedite the implementation of the new
technological platform by providing the data breakdown for national and foreign currency, as well as
better sectorization to help improve the compilation of MFS data. Follow-up work is needed to
introduce the standardized report forms (SRF) for other financial corporation’s (OFCs), which will be
contingent on meeting the established benchmarks, namely: (1) expansion of the ODCs coverage in
the MFS compilation; (2) implementation of the call report forms for pension funds, specialized finance
and development institutions, and asset management companies; and (3) improve granularity of the
currency and maturity breakdown of the monetary survey.
Financial sector surveillance: The CBN compiles financial soundness indicators (FSIs) on a quarterly
basis and these FSIs are submitted to STA for public dissemination. The reported FSIs are ten out of
twelve of the core set and seven of the encouraged set. The CBN received support from STA to
improve the methodology used to compile FSIs. However, efforts need to be made by the CBN to
enhance the consolidation basis to capture cross-border activities of Nigerian bank subsidiaries and
branches, as well as to report FSIs using a breakdown into domestic and foreign currency.
External sector statistics: There have been significant efforts to improve the compilation of Nigeria’s
balance of payments data in recent years. Supported by IMF technical assistance, the authorities have
expanded the range and improved the quality of data sources, aimed at strengthening the balance of
payments and producing an international investment position (IIP). However, large errors and omissions
in the balance of payments continue to complicate the assessment of external sustainability. There is a
need for improved validation of transactions reported by banks, measurement of transactions outside
the banking system, appropriate treatment of transactions of enterprises in free trade zone (using a
residency criterion) and improved coverage of estimates of the external assets and liabilities of the
banking sector. The five-year DFID/GDDS Phase III Module that ended in 2015 has helped CBN improve
source data by recording more accurately cross-border private capital flows and stocks. Further TA from
the Fund was requested to assess recent work to reduce large errors and omissions and improve the IIP
as well as to validate work on the compilation of flow of funds.
Public external debt data are of good quality and available on a timely basis. The Debt Management
Office (DMO) is collaborating closely with the CBN to extend the coverage of their database to include
private sector liabilities and foreign investment in domestically issued debt securities.

Statement by Ms. Kapwepwe, Executive Director for Nigeria
and Mr. Odonye, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
March 30, 2016
We thank staff for their constructive engagement with the authorities and the comprehensive
Article IV and related reports. Our Nigerian authorities highly appreciate the quality of advice
they have received from staff, which has supported their efforts to enhance and maintain
macroeconomic stability and growth. Over the last decade, Nigeria has enjoyed strong growth
averaging about 7 percent of GDP, prior to the recent collapse in the oil price. Nigeria is facing
substantial challenges from a number of major global developments namely, slowdown and
rebalancing of the Chinese economy, lower commodity prices, and tightening international
financial conditions and the increase in the risk aversion of international investors, as well as
regional security concerns. The authorities note the staff analysis, and broadly agree with the
recommendations, in particular the need to implement an overall policy mix that ensures
resilience against ongoing domestic and external challenges.
Nigeria has made significant progress on its development agenda. Against the backdrop of a
maturing political system, the country recorded peaceful general elections last year, which for
the first time in its history resulted in a democratic transition between two civilian governments.
Nigeria’s economy is large and diversified with the oil sector currently less than 10 percent of
GDP. The oil sector, which accounts for 75 percent of the total export basket, however, collapsed
in the wake of major decline in oil prices with significant negative consequences for the fiscal
and current accounts position and a decline in reserves.
Against this mixed background, we welcome staff analysis of the urgency in dealing with the
impact of the oil price shock. The authorities fully recognize the large permanent terms-of- trade
shock and are in the process of initiating a mix of policies to address the situation. As part of the
immediate policy action to revamp the economy, the authorities have approved injection of N350
billion budgeted expenditure in the next few months. Authorities at federal level are also
working in collaboration with the state governments to adopt a plan for the gradual increase of
the Value Added Tax (VAT) on goods and services. These actions are part of a package of
decisions taken at a recent 2-day retreat of the governors in the 36 states of the federation and
members of the National Economic Council in Abuja.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
Economic performance was weaker in 2015, with growth slowing to 2.7 percent from 6.3 percent
in 2014. This was largely driven by the collapse in oil prices and lower economic activity in the

2

non-oil sector mainly, services, agriculture and trade. Recently, inflation has exceeded the central
bank's medium term target band of 6 to 9 percent, up at 11.4 percent in February 2016 and 9.6
percent in December 2015. The rising inflationary pressure was traced to the subsisting shortage
of fuel, exchange rate pass-through from imported goods, seasonal factors and higher electricity
tariff.
Exports have dropped, pushing the current account to a deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP in 2015
from a surplus of 0.2 percent in 2014. Portfolio inflows also slowed, while foreign exchange
shortage, fuel scarcity, and security concerns affected private sector activity. Unlike the global
crisis in 2008-09, the non-oil corporate sector entered the crisis in 2014-15 with weaker
performance and more leveraged balance sheets. A further deterioration of the corporate sector
could weaken bank resilience and extension of credit to the economy.
Economic activity is expected to slow in 2016 before a moderate recovery in 2017 and thereafter.
Improvement in the terms of trade, strengthened governance in the oil sector anchored on the
revised Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), and further improvements in electricity and energy sectors
are expected to drive growth in the immediate to medium term. However, there are significant
downside risks related to uncertainty about the path of oil prices, tighter financing conditions,
and a delay in access to planned external financing.
Macroeconomic Policies and Reforms
The economy is confronting substantial challenges and the authorities are implementing policy
measures to address the drop in revenue and revamp the economy. Considering the multiple
challenges facing the economy, the authorities have firmly resolved to collaborate and undertake
complementary policies to reinvigorate growth.
Fiscal Policy
Mindful of the lower oil price environment, the authorities have pursued prudent fiscal policies
that have sought to mobilize non-oil revenue, contain recurrent expenditure, and ensure debt
sustainability. The 2016 budget proposes raising non-oil revenue by 0.4 percent, and further
enhancing resources through more efficiency in the sector, including improvement in tax
compliance, broadening the base, closing loopholes, and reducing tax exemptions. The
authorities are also seriously considering increasing the VAT rate over the medium term as
mentioned earlier. Enhancing capital expenditure is aimed at propelling growth to significantly
narrow the gap in infrastructure spending going forward. Further, the authorities remain
committed to improve value for money on capital spending. At the same time, efforts are focused

3

on streamlining the cost of government and improve the efficiency of public service as
highlighted by establishing the efficiency unit. This will reduce gross financing needs.
The authorities are also planning on accessing both market and multilateral external financing
going forward as proposed in the 2016 budget.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
The primary objective of monetary policy is price stability. Given Nigeria’s developmental
needs, price stability aims to support growth and employment creation. Monetary policy
continues to play an important role in supporting economic activity in Nigeria. The CBN
maintained accommodative monetary policy since July 2015 so as to boost financing in the real
sector. Over the period, the authorities freed more funds to Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) by
lowering both Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Monetary Policy Rate (MPR). However, as the
balance of risks tilted against price stability, the recent decision in March 2016 increased the
MPR and the CRR to 11 percent by 100 basis points and 22.50 percent by 250 basis points,
respectively.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) continues efforts to convey its decisions transparently to
gauge markets expectations. In 2016, the Committee expects to do more through greater
collaboration with the fiscal authorities, and by communicating more frequently with the relevant
players, including the media, academics and the trade unions. The actual path that MPR will
follow over the next few years will depend on the speed of implementation of the structural
reforms in the country and the economic circumstances.
The authorities envision Nigeria to become a less oil dependent economy in the medium term
and in tandem with the transformation, the CBN is gradually shifting from monetary targeting to
a more price-based monetary policy. The CBN continues to provide FX to the interbank foreign
exchange market for approved transactions. The foreign exchange measures recently introduced
by the Bank are temporary, and remain in force to moderate impact of the declining oil prices by
slowing the loss of reserves. The measures have stimulated production and employment in some
sectors. Nonetheless, the authorities are evaluating the modalities of a gradual unwinding from
the measures while strengthening policies to restore reserves to adequate levels.
Banking and Financial System Stability
Safeguarding banking system stability remains a key priority. Risk-Based Supervision (RBS)
remains the cornerstone of supervision and regulation in Nigeria. The CBN has kept an eye on
all DMBs and rates them as sound and resilient amidst headwinds from the global economy. The

4

Financial System Stability Committee (FSSC) established last year, has identified risks to
financial stability through bank supervisors/examiners. The CBN has taken action by assigning
exposure limits to mitigate risks emanating from different sectors especially oil and gas, a high
source of vulnerability to the Nigerian banking system, and a focus of the 2014 Article IV
Consultations.
Although the FSSC judges that oil and gas sector indebtedness does not pose an imminent threat
to stability, the CBN remains vigilant, ready to tackle risks that might still arise from the sector.
In addition, the CBN also continues to monitor the health of the banking system and has taken
proactive measures, including increasing the general provisions for non performing loans to 2
percent from 1 percent, and introducing regulation on capital distribution. Overall, the banking
system liquidity remains above threshold and increased from 45.68 percent in December 2014 to
48.63 percent in December 2015.
Structural Reforms
The authorities remain committed to advancing structural reforms to smooth transition to a lower
oil-dependent, competitive, investment-driven economy. Efforts are geared to strengthen antimoney laundering and financial sector supervision. The strategies include promoting targeted
and core infrastructure; integrated transport network; housing; reducing business environment
costs through greater transparency and accountability; encouraging value-chain sector linkages;
and promoting employment of youth and women.
They remain focused on ongoing improvement of efficiency of the public sector service delivery,
acceleration and broadening of public financial management reforms, and improvement of
capacity at sub-national levels as well as creation of enabling environment to attract investment.
Adopting a sound Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) is being emphasized to strengthen the regulatory
framework for the oil sector and enhance its transparency and integrity.
Infrastructure particularly, energy, power and transportation need to be improved to support
industries. The authorities are prioritizing near-completed and high-impact projects that are
consistent with the government development strategy, and implementing complementary
measures to create an enabling environment for businesses. They are also reviewing projects
suitable for Public Private Partnership (PPPs), and have completed some feasibility studies. In
addition, the authorities have set up the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework for the
assessment of projects and will periodically publish the assessment to enhance transparency and
regain confidence in the government.

In the policy discussion series (see selected issues SM/16/70), staff presents the results of three
studies to strengthen the economy and achieve a sustainable growth path. The Nigerian
authorities welcome these studies, and are evaluating the scope of the analysis and feasibility of
the proposed recommendations with a view to informing future policy decision.
Conclusion
Nigeria is facing substantial, though not insurmountable, economic challenges. Lower oil prices
have significantly affected the fiscal and external accounts decimating government revenue. .
The Government’s strategy for rebuilding key infrastructure resonates well as a testimony of the
authorities’ commitment. In an environment where the global risks are increasing, the authorities
remain focused to continue to work through plans to build on the current momentum, strengthen
resilience and prepare the country for challenges ahead both externally and domestically
