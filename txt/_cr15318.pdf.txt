IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Papua New Guinea
On October 30, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
2015 Article IV consultation1 with Papua New Guinea.
Papua New Guinea is facing strong headwinds from lower global commodity prices. While the
commencement of liquefied natural gas (LNG) production has boosted overall GDP growth in
2014–15, the slow growth of the non-resource sector calls for a renewed policy focus on
inclusive growth in the post-LNG construction period. Falling commodity prices and temporary
suspension of a large mining operation have lowered government revenue prospects
substantially, reducing the country’s fiscal space and leading to an increase in government debt,
which is likely to exceed the legislated targets in 2015.
With LNG production and exports now coming on stream, resource sector growth is projected to
expand strongly in 2015 but spillovers to the rest of the economy may be limited. Inflation
remains contained, as the effects of the kina depreciation are offset by lower oil and commodity
prices. Meanwhile, the current account balance is expected to turn into a surplus as the LNG
plant has its first full year of operation. Nevertheless, lower commodity prices and a reduction in
LNG project-related capital inflows have led to depreciation pressure on the kina since mid2013. In early June 2014, the Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) introduced measures to
require authorized dealers to transact with their customers within a trading band of 150 basis

points around the official (interbank) exchange rate. This move caused a large de facto currency
appreciation. Since then, the kina has depreciated vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar.
Risks to the outlook are increasingly skewed to the downside. Fiscal consolidation necessitated
by weaker-than-anticipated revenue performance will dampen non-resource growth over the
short run, and a weak global economy could further dampen external demand and commodity
prices. Over the longer term, LNG developments in Australia and shale gas developments around
the world could continue to put downward pressure on LNG prices and government revenue.
Global financial market instability could also affect prospects for external commercial financing
or foreign direct investment. Upside risks include the potential for a second LNG project, further
mineral resource development, and scope for increasing trade with Asia.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for achieving impressive economic growth in
recent years. While growth remains robust this year, the sharp drop in commodity prices and
slowing growth in non-resource sectors has adversely affected fiscal and external sector
performance and poses challenges going forward. Against this background, Directors stressed
the need to maintain prudent macroeconomic policies to ensure debt sustainability and safeguard
the external position. They also encouraged prompt implementation of structural reforms to
diversify the economy, boost growth potential, and promote inclusiveness in the longer run.
Directors agreed that strong fiscal consolidation is needed to keep the government debt-to-GDP
ratio on a downward trajectory over the medium term, while safeguarding key social outlays.
They stressed the importance of strengthening expenditure prioritization and public financial
management, as well as developing a medium-term debt management strategy. Directors also
welcomed the government’s efforts to set up a Sovereign Wealth Fund and supported their plans
to make the fund operational soon. They emphasized the need to channel resource revenues from
the fund through the budget to ensure transparency and accountability.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors called for greater exchange rate flexibility, and generally saw scope for further
depreciation, to safeguard external buffers and eliminate imbalances in the foreign exchange
market, supported by appropriately tight fiscal and monetary policies. They agreed that the
exchange rate should be allowed to move more quickly to a market-clearing rate, and that the
authorities should mop up excess liquidity to strengthen monetary policy effectiveness.
Directors underscored the importance of decisive implementation of structural reforms to boost
medium-term growth prospects. Priorities include improving infrastructure and law and order,
investing in health and education, strengthening the agricultural and small- and medium-size
enterprise sectors and their access to finance, increasing competition in the banking sector, and
reducing business costs. It will also be important to accelerate the reform of state-owned
enterprises. Directors welcomed the progress made on anti-money laundering and combating the
financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) legislation and encouraged its timely implementation.
Directors welcomed the recent progress to improve statistics, and called for further efforts to
enhance institutional capacity.

KEY ISSUES
Context: Facing headwinds from lower commodity prices


Despite strong growth relating to a large liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, Papua
New Guinea (PNG) faces strong headwinds from severe revenue shortfalls due to
lower global commodity prices and temporary suspension of a large mining
operation.

Policy agenda: Maintaining macroeconomic stability by…
… a measured but ambitious medium-term fiscal consolidation path…


Given the large drop in government revenues, decisive consolidation will be needed
to keep the government debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward trajectory over the
medium term. To this end, expenditure growth should slow and budget resources
should focus on high-impact spending, while safeguarding social outlays.

… measures to reduce excess liquidity…


In the near term, given the challenging fiscal environment, excess liquidity needs to
be mopped up to increase the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission, and
dampen downward pressures on the kina.

… and greater exchange rate flexibility…


Although the kina has depreciated by 16 percent vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar since June
2014 when Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) brought the market rates within a
trading band around the official rate, there is still excess demand for foreign
exchange (FX). The kina exchange rate should be allowed to depreciate more quickly
to a market clearing level, supported by appropriate fiscal and monetary policy
adjustment.

… while laying the basis for inclusive growth


A strong non-resource sector will be crucial for inclusive growth in PNG. Key reform
elements for inclusive growth include continued investment in health and education,
improvement in infrastructure, law and order, and macroeconomic statistics,
increased productivity in the agricultural sector, financial development and inclusion,
and strengthening of public financial management (PFM).

CONTEXT
1.
PNG has abundant resources including agriculture, cultural diversity, fisheries,
forestry, minerals, and petroleum/LNG. Despite a series of mineral and petroleum/LNG
discoveries since independence in 1975 that have provided the main growth drivers, PNG remains
one of the lowest income countries in the region. Moreover, growth has been volatile over the past
decade, reflecting the pace of new discoveries and fluctuations in international commodity prices.
While the commencement of LNG production boosted overall GDP growth in 2014-15, slow growth
outside of the mineral and petroleum/LNG sectors calls for a renewed policy focus on economic
transformation through developing PNG’s many renewable resources and non-resource industries
while continuing to tap its non-renewable resources in an environmentally sustainable manner that
benefits the entire population.
2.
Lack of access to finance is a key constraint on inclusive growth, in tandem with poor
infrastructure and chronic law and order problems. PNG is among the least-banked countries in
the region, despite the fact that systemic liquidity is ample, and banks and other financial
intermediaries are seeking alternatives to public sector financing given their large exposures to
government debt. While there has been good progress with mobile banking, very little bank credit is
allocated to rural businesses and households. Factors contributing to limited financial access include
the country’s level of income and economic development, relatively-skewed income distribution,
lack of competition in the banking sector, weak contract enforcement, customary land ownership
that impedes the use of land as collateral, large rural population with limited access to urban centers
and banking services, and the large informal sector.
3.
Falling commodity prices and the temporary suspension of a large mining operation
pose challenges for macroeconomic management in the near term. Revenue prospects have
worsened significantly relative to the 2015 budget. A comprehensive policy response to these and
related shocks is urgently needed that allows for a measured but ambitious medium-term fiscal
consolidation path to safeguard fiscal sustainability, improved cash and treasury management
practices, measures to reduce excess liquidity, and greater exchange rate flexibility. Although PNG’s
medium-term external position looks favorable given the large projected LNG earnings and
prospective new mineral and LNG projects, BPNG should allow the kina to move more quickly to
restore equilibrium in the FX market and maintain an adequate level of international reserves.
4.
Political setting. The political situation is stable, with the coalition government representing
almost all members of parliament. Governance reforms present an ongoing challenge. The next
general election is scheduled to be held in 2017.

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK AND RISKS
A. Recent Developments
5.
Growth is robust and inflation remains contained. Real GDP is expected to expand
strongly by about 9 percent in 2015, reflecting mostly the coming on stream of LNG production
(Box 1) and notwithstanding temporary closure of a large copper and gold mine (OK Tedi). Nonresource GDP is likely to grow by 1½ percent this year and by about 3½ percent in 2016 with
agriculture and construction dampened by unfavorable weather conditions and lower government
spending, respectively. CPI inflation is projected to stabilize at around 6 percent in 2015, as the
effects of lower oil and commodity prices are offset by the kina depreciation.
6.
The external current account balance is expected to turn into a surplus while
international reserves remain below the staff’s assessment of reserve adequacy. The current
account is expected to turn from deficit to surplus in 2015 as the LNG plant has its first full year of
operation, while the overall balance of payments is expected to be near zero including since most
commodity export receipts are kept offshore. Gross international reserves are projected to remain at
around $2 billion in 2015 (equivalent to 3 months of total goods and nonfactor services imports)
and to strengthen modestly over the medium term.
7.
Fiscal consolidation has become more difficult and the public debt to GDP ratio is
rising, albeit from a low level. The Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO) released in
early August projected a K 2.5 billion revenue shortfall in 2015 (equivalent to 5.5 percent of GDP)
compared to the K 1.3 billion shortfall expected in the budget. Non-resource revenues are also
expected to be lower mainly due to the second round effects of lower commodity prices on the
broader economy. Staff estimates that medium-term fiscal targets (i.e., a balanced budget by 2017
and debt-to-GDP ratio of below 30 percent by 2016 as envisaged in the Medium-Term Fiscal
Strategy (MTFS)) are no longer feasible. Public debt has increased from 23 to 36 percent of GDP

There are no signs of a generalized credit
boom. Overall credit growth has continued at a
moderate pace, broadly in line with nominal GDP
growth since 2010. Commercial banks have solid
capital buffers and the ratio of NPLs to total loans
remains low. Nevertheless, PNG’s ratio of domestic
private credit to GDP was well below the average
for countries at a simliar level of development in
the region and elsewhere (e.g., Pacific Island small
states with 63 percent). Other indicators also point
to low levels of financial development and access to
finance (see Selected Issues Paper on financial
inclusion).

Sources: Country authorities; and IMF staff estimates.

B. Outlook and Risks
9.
Medium-term growth is expected to converge to about 3 percent, supported by
agriculture and preparations for the hosting of APEC 2018. The government plans to spend K 3
billion over 2015-18 on the preparations for APEC 2018 (e.g., upgrading the airport). Thus, 2018 will
see a winding down of construction activity, with overall growth projected to slow down to 1½
percent in 2018 and stabilize at 3 percent over the longer term.1 Inflation is expected to stabilize at
around 5 percent, which is in line with its ten-year historical average, as imported price inflation
remains stable and domestic agricultural supply continues to expand.
10.
Risks to the outlook are increasingly skewed to the downside. Fiscal consolidation
necessitated by weaker-than-anticipated revenue performance will dampen non-resource growth
over the short run, and a weak global economy could further dampen external demand and
commodity prices. Over the longer term, LNG developments in Australia and shale gas
developments around the world could continue to put downward pressure on LNG prices and
government revenue. Global financial market instability could also affect prospects for external
commercial financing or foreign direct investment. Upside risks include the potential for a second
LNG project, further mineral resource development, and scope for increasing trade with Asia. The
mission stressed that the prospect of new mineral and LNG projects should not divert attention from
the need to tighten fiscal and monetary policy now and allow for greater exchange rate flexibility.
11.
Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly concurred with the outlook. They noted that the
longer-lasting drought caused by El Niño could prolong a temporary mine closure and worsen a

poor harvest of crops. They placed somewhat greater emphasis than the staff on an upside to
growth from a number of prospective extractive sector projects, including a second LNG project and
several major gold-copper projects, over the longer term.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
12.
Discussions centered on the policies needed to maintain macroeconomic stability in
the near term and raise growth in the medium term. The staff’s view is that this will require a
measured but ambitious medium-term fiscal consolidation path, measures to reduce excess liquidity
and tighten monetary policy, and greater exchange rate flexibility. In the medium term, structural
reforms are necessary to improve financial deepening and resilience and boost inclusive growth.

A. Maintaining Macroeconomic Stability
Fiscal Policy
13.
The mission strongly encouraged the authorities to adopt a more ambitious package
of fiscal measures. The baseline shows that the authorities’ plan to cut expenditures by K 1.3 billion
in 2015 would still yield an increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio (from 36 to 45 percent) over the
medium term despite lower fiscal deficits from 2016-20 (see the text chart below). Staff encouraged
the authorities to limit debt to 35 percent of GDP by 2020, as specified in the staff’s alternative
adjustment scenario, which would require a more ambitious set of measures totaling K 2.0 billion in
2015 and lower deficits relative to the baseline by 1 percent of GDP in 2016, and by about 2 percent
of GDP from 2017 through 2019. The under-execution of expenditure suggests there is room for
cuts and reprioritization. This more ambitious set of measures aims to balance the need for stronger
fiscal consolidation to ensure debt sustainability with the need to avoid an overly contractionary
fiscal stance and protect vulnerable groups. Given the inherent volatility of resource GDP and
revenue,2 the mission encouraged the authorities to consider using the NRPB as an underlying fiscal
target. Use of the NRPB as a policy target can help insulate fiscal policy from resource revenue
volatility and help capture the underlying fiscal policy stance, while using the overall balance as a
fiscal target tends to promote pro-cyclical spending.3
14.
A multi-pronged approach, including strengthening revenue performance and curbing
low-impact expenditures, is needed to address the immediate fiscal pressures.


Revenue measures. Staff would encourage the authorities to adopt measures to strengthen
revenue collection, including by suspending the Infrastructure Tax Credit until the Internal

See IMF (2012) “Macroeconomic Policy Frameworks for Resource-Rich Developing Countries.” For example, the
NRPB identifies the impact of government operations on domestic demand, since resource revenues typically
originate abroad. A higher non-resource primary deficit would indicate an expansionary fiscal stance.

Revenue Commission (IRC) makes recommendations based on an audit of the scheme, and
other measures recommended by the Tax Review Committee.4 Revenue measures would,
however, likely yield significant additional revenue only starting in 2016.
Expenditure cuts. The bulk of the fiscal adjustment will have to come from reductions and
reprioritizations of expenditure. The staff’s adjustment scenario requires a net expenditure
reduction of about K 2.0 billion in 2015 (about 30 percent from goods and services and
70 percent from low-impact capital expenditures), and continued spending restraint in
subsequent years, while focusing on improving the quality of spending (see the Selected
Issues Paper on structural reforms for discussion of government spending inefficiencies).
Care should be taken to ensure that consolidation does not affect high priority social
spending, including in health, education, law and justice, and agriculture.
Decisive consolidation is needed...

A sound framework for budgetary
financing needs to be put in place. Identifying
sufficient financing in 2015 is expected to be
challenging, as planned asset sales are likely to be
delayed due to complications associated with
asset pricing, financing options, and negotiations
with the large group of landowners. Given that
the banks and superannuation funds have mostly
reached their internal limits on sovereign
exposure, there is limited appetite for holding
additional government securities, which has led to
a sharp rise in T-bill yields. Announcement of a

The Tax Review Committee is currently recommending: (1) an increase of the goods and services tax rate from 10
percent to 15 percent; (2) raising the income tax threshold from K 10,000 to K 15,000; while (3) reducing the
corporate income tax rate from 30 percent to 25 percent. They are also reviewing mining and petroleum taxes in line

suitably ambitious fiscal adjustment plan at an early date would be important to bolster market
confidence, particularly given rising financing needs and a planned debut US$1 billion sovereign
Eurobond placement in the coming months. In this context, it will also be important to put in place a
Medium-Term Debt Management Strategy (MTDS) to increase the efficiency of financing and
minimize the costs and risks associated with new external funding options. The central bank should
refrain from providing direct financing to the government. An updated Debt Sustainability Analysis
(DSA) indicates that PNG’s risk of external debt distress remains low. However, there has been a
significant increase in overall public debt, which amounts to about 56 percent of GDP once arrears
to a superannuation fund and other liabilities are taken into account.5
16.
Stronger PFM is needed to improve the quality of spending and development
outcomes. Implementing further reforms identified in the recent Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) assessment, including improving cash management and the Integrated
Financial Management System (IFMS) rollout, will be important to support the authorities’ fiscal
consolidation, building upon the recent publication of the PEFA document and the final roadmap.
SOE reform is also needed to minimize fiscal risk and enhance transparency and governance. For
example, the return on equity (ROE) averaged 10.5 percent between 2003 and 2007, but fell to
3.4 percent in 2007–12, outperformed by regional peers. Sustained political commitment is needed
to improve the efficiency of SOEs by placing them on a sound commercial footing and ensuring
adequate and timely disclosure and transparency.
17.
It is important to ensure that the proposed Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) is
adequately resourced and effectively managed. The final stage of the legislation has been
approved by the Cabinet. Ensuring that all resource revenues flow through the budget will help to
improve transparency and better target national priorities for resource revenue use. The Kumul
Trust, which will consolidate the PNG government’s interests in petroleum, mining, and other stateowned enterprises, under three holding companies, should be designed to ensure that transparency
and efficiency of public investment are enhanced, with governance structures that can support the
achievement of stated corporate goals. Continued commitment to implementing the Extractive
Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) will also be important.
18.
Authorities’ views. The authorities concurred with the need for ambitious fiscal
consolidation while avoiding cuts in key priority areas such as infrastructure, health and education,
and law and order. They acknowledged the importance of agreeing and communicating the budget
adjustment measures ahead of the Eurobond issuance to reassure potential investors. For 2015, they
will consider postponement of some lower-priority projects. The authorities reiterated commitment
to adhering to the Santiago Principles in the operation of the SWF, while noting that little resource
revenue would be saved in the near term owing to PNG’s huge development needs. They will also

consider IMF technical assistance to support development of a MTDS that will help to provide a
sound framework for future financing.

Monetary Policy and Exchange Rate
19.
The kina exchange rate should be allowed to move more quickly to a market clearing
level. FX queues have reportedly increased despite the slow but steady depreciation of the kina visà-vis the U.S. dollar since the trading band was introduced in June 2014, amid reports that BPNG has
intervened in the FX market. The restricted range of USD/kina movement resulted in a change in the
de facto exchange rate regime classification, from floating to a crawl-like arrangement, effective April
2014. The mission stressed that the slow pace of depreciation would prolong the market imbalance,
giving rise to the potential for costly disruptions to business activities. Given that the currencies of
other commodity exporters had depreciated more against the U.S. dollar than the kina, the mission
stressed that the kina should be allowed to

maintained in the near term to help avoid a sharp
widening of bid/ask spreads. Over time, however, a plan should be developed to improve the
efficiency and transparency of the FX market, drawing upon follow-up IMF TA, and underpinned by
sound fiscal and monetary policies. It should be noted in this context that the medium-term, real
effective exchange rate (REER) assessment produced mixed results (Box 3), while PNG’s external
position is expected to strengthen as LNG exports increase over the medium term. PNG maintains
an exchange restriction subject to IMF approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a) of the IMF’s Articles
of Agreement arising from the requirement to obtain a tax clearance certificate evidencing the
payment of all taxes prior to making payments or transfers for certain current international
transactions.
20.
The mission advised the authorities to mop up excess liquidity to increase the
effectiveness of monetary policy transmission, tighten the monetary stance, and dampen
downward pressures on the kina. It also advised the government to support BPNG’s efforts to
deploy effective monetary policy tools including by maintaining a tighter fiscal stance and avoiding
recourse to central bank financing. In the near term, given the challenging fiscal environment, BPNG
was advised to focus on withdrawing excess liquidity, including by increasing the cash reserve
requirement (CRR), encouraging the transfer of government balances from commercial bank
accounts to BPNG, and stepping up the use of open market operations. Staff also encouraged BPNG

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

to establish an interbank interest rate corridor as recommended by recent IMF technical assistance.
As noted below, commercial banks are highly liquid, have sound capital positions, and are among
the most profitable in the world. In this context, banks are in a strong position to adapt to reduced
liquidity and a more rapid depreciation of the kina exchange rate in line with market forces without
significant adverse balance sheet effects. Accordingly, staff does not anticipate that significant real
sector effects would result from monetary tightening, particularly given the massive expansion in
LNG production this year. Staff also advised BPNG to refrain from providing any direct financing to
the government to safeguard its independence and operational effectiveness, and help maintain
macroeconomic stability.
21.
Authorities’ views. The authorities emphasized that the USD/kina rate was market
determined and that the market, not BPNG, was keeping the rate at its current level. Import
payments were not, in their view, being unduly delayed as reflected in the absence of importer
bankruptcies. They stressed the need to avoid undue exchange rate volatility and high bid/ask
spreads. They also emphasized past experience has shown that a faster pace of depreciation may
not necessarily have the desired results of stimulating FX supply and clearing the market, and would
be inflationary as PNG is heavily reliant on imports. The authorities acknowledged that excess
liquidity inhibits the monetary transmission mechanism while noting that, thus far, inflationary
pressures had remained contained despite persistent excess liquidity. They agreed that suitablytight monetary and fiscal policies were a precondition for the proper functioning of any FX market.
BPNG nevertheless reiterated its request for follow-up IMF TA regarding its participation in the FX
market, and will work on clarifying its focus. It stands ready to absorb excess liquidity and tighten
monetary policy should inflationary pressures intensify. BPNG also reiterated its intention to avoid
any direct financing of the government budget deficit. It saw no need to reform the Central Banking
Act or to strengthen its balance sheet, given that negative capital was largely attributable to
valuation losses on international reserves driven by the rapid appreciation of the kina in 2011-12.
BPNG’s balance sheet has improved following the depreciation of the kina and a partial
recapitalization of BPNG by the government using non-tradable securities.

Financial Sector
22.
The mission stressed that BPNG should remain vigilant to emerging sector-specific
risks. PNG’s financial system appears robust given strong indicators of bank capital adequacy, asset
quality, liquidity, and profitability. Looking forward, BPNG, banks, and superannuation funds should
carefully consider the potential impact of lower government spending and the temporary
suspension of a large mining operation for assets exposed to affected sectors, including real estate,
transport and logistics.
23.
Going forward, macroprudential policies should play an important role by limiting any
buildup of systemic vulnerabilities. BPNG should continue to move forward to enhance the
function of a macroprudential policy division, which is in the process of being established, and set
up a comprehensive database including sectoral loan data and household and corporate debt
measures.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

24.
The authorities are encouraged to continue strengthening the AML/CFT regime. Key
legislation aimed at improving compliance with international standards for AML/CFT has been
passed, which could facilitate removal from the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF’s) gray list. They
should continue to implement AML/CFT tools effectively to address risks of politically exposed
persons and ensure robust domestic and international cooperation on AML/CFT matters.
25.
Authorities’ views. The authorities pointed out that commercial banks’ balance sheets and
future earnings prospects are strong. They saw banks' exposure to the construction sector through
lending as a potential systemic risk, but thus far, NPLs have remained low and have not increased.
They reiterated their commitment to further strengthening monitoring of potential systemic risks
and implementing the legislation relating to AML/CFT.

B. Promoting Financial Sector Development and Resilience
26.
Structural improvements in the financial sector will be important to enhance resilience
to shocks and access to finance. As enumerated above, PNG suffers from a number of structural
barriers to improving financial access and development that have impeded growth and hampered
new investment.
27.
To promote financial development, greater efforts are required to, inter alia, address
the lack of competition, facilitate development of the capital market, and improve the
functioning of the FX market. Lack of competition for financial services impedes access to finance
and economic diversification. For instance, small farmers and agribusiness entrepreneurs are facing
credit constraints to scale up their business and invest in new processing capacity that is critical to
achieving yield and quality improvements. Underdeveloped capital markets limit the sources of
financing for government, enterprises, and individuals, while a shallow and inefficient FX market
distorts the expectations and commercial behavior of market participants, and constrains the role of
the exchange rate as a shock absorber.


Lack of competition. Three large banks (two
Australian banks and one domestic bank) play a
dominant role in providing credit to the
economy. Wide interest rate spreads in PNG are
associated with the oligopolistic nature of the
banking system, while also reflecting the costs
and risks of doing business.6 Similarly, a lack of
competition can lead to relatively high levels of
profitability,7 which can limit incentives for

for exposure to the government, forcing
the authorities to diversify its financing sources, including via a prospective Eurobond
offering of US$1 billion. Looking forward, authorities should promote development of the
domestic capital market over the medium term, including by taking measures required to
develop a secondary market for government securities.



Shallow FX market. The interbank FX market is currently one-sided given the overvalued
exchange rate and there is a structural shortage of FX. Mineral tax receipts account for about
two-thirds of FX inflows, while FX transactions are highly regulated by the BPNG. The
authorities should focus on measures that would help to eliminate FX market distortions (see
Selected Issues Paper on the FX market).

28.
Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly concurred with the need to promote financial
development, improve the capital market, and reform the FX regime over the medium term. BPNG
has put in place legislation for micro-insurance products and mobile banking services, and is taking
steps to enhance financial literacy through education and safeguard consumer protection.
Meanwhile, they have authorized five microfinance institutions.

C. Boosting Inclusive Growth
29.
The government’s structural reform agenda appropriately emphasizes agriculture and
an enabling environment for business. In agriculture, the government should continue to move
forward with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank to enhance productivity (i.e.,
the Productive Partnerships in Agriculture Project for smallholder coffee and cocoa producers), fill
the infrastructure gap, and facilitate access to finance (see Selected Issues Paper on structural
reforms). The government also needs to concentrate on reforms to lower the cost of doing business
and increase competition. Continued investment in health and education will be important in this
respect, as will improvements in infrastructure and law and order.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

PAPUA NEW GUINEA



Infrastructure. In agriculture, lack of access to market is identified as a major obstacle to
increasing the supply of perishable products. Lack of access to affordable electricity is also a
critical constraint on development. The electrification rate in PNG is among the lowest in the
world.



Health and education. Social indicators point to the challenges of basic needs, despite
recent efforts to improve access to health and education (including vocational training).
Provision of services and necessary facilities such as health clinics should be expanded and
improved, especially in rural areas.



Law and order. Chronic law and order problems need to be addressed to enhance ease of
doing business, promote more business startups, and unleash the potential in tourism.
According to the 2014 World Bank Enterprise Survey, 81 percent of businesses reported that
their decisions for further investment or expansion of their operations were adversely
affected by the poor security situation in the country. Indeed, 67 percent of firms identified
crime as a problem; this is more than four times the regional average for firms in East Asia
and the Pacific (16 percent) and higher than all of the regional averages.

30.
Continued efforts to increase access to finance will also be important to support
private sector development and growth. As noted above, PNG remains among the most underbanked economies in the region, despite recent efforts to promote financial sector development
and financial inclusion. The high level of collateralization required to obtain loans, and the large
share of customary land that cannot be used as collateral are the main obstacles to obtaining bank
credit, including for SMEs. It will thus be important to address these constraints to allow better
financial access for SMEs and support growth.
31.
Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed that agriculture is a key area for inclusive growth
given that a majority of the population relies on the sector, including those in the informal sector.
They noted that increased competition in public utilities and telecommunications is also important.
The authorities agreed that development of essential financial infrastructure is a priority, as set out
in the 2014-15 National Financial Inclusion and Literacy Strategy. They are roughly halfway towards
the goal of reaching 1 million previously un-banked citizens, 32 percent of which are women. Going
forward, BPNG will begin considering a follow-up strategy for the coming year, benefiting from
recent work and support from the World Bank, ADB, and Pacific Financial Inclusion Programme
(PFIP).

OTHER ISSUES
32.
The authorities are firmly committed to improving macroeconomic statistics. They
recognized the importance of sound macroeconomic statistics for informed policy decisions and
IMF surveillance. More decisive reform is needed to address institutional weaknesses in the National
Statistics Office (NSO) and enhance the coordination with other stakeholders. The authorities are
moving forward with the publication of new GDP estimates for 2007-13, planned for late this year.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
PNG is facing strong headwinds from lower commodity prices. While growth is expected
to increase to 9 percent this year reflecting the full year effect of LNG production which started last
year, fiscal and external performance this year have been adversely affected by the sharp drop in
LNG and other major export commodity prices. Prudent macroeconomic policies are therefore
essential to maintaining debt sustainability and safeguarding the external position.
34.
Decisive fiscal consolidation will be needed to keep the government debt to GDP ratio
on a downward trajectory over the medium term. Given the large drop in government revenues
due to commodity prices and recent disruptions in the mining sector, the authorities are strongly
encouraged to adopt a more ambitious package of fiscal measures to narrow the fiscal deficit this
year and over the medium term. They are also encouraged to adopt medium-term fiscal anchors
appropriate to the context of a commodity producer in order to help guide policy development and
assessment.
35.
Better expenditure prioritization and improvement in PFM will be crucial for
improving development outcomes. High priority should be given to implementing high-impact
projects and improving the delivery of frontline health and education services. While recent progress
on strengthening PFM is welcomed, including having published the PEFA document and finalized a
roadmap, the authorities are encouraged to implement its recommendations, including to
strengthen cash and treasury management practices.
36.
The SWF should be put into operation as soon as practicable. It is important to ensure
that all public resource revenues are channeled through the budget. This would improve
transparency and better target national priorities for resource revenue use and is consistent with the
SWF’s role in macroeconomic stabilization and wealth sharing.
37.
A further depreciation is needed to safeguard external buffers and eliminate
imbalances in the FX market. To these ends, BPNG should allow the exchange rate to be more
market-determined and move quickly to a market-clearing rate. This should be supported by
suitably-tight fiscal and monetary policies. To facilitate this adjustment and improve monetary policy
effectiveness, BPNG should mop up excess liquidity in the banking system. Staff does not
recommend Fund approval of the tax clearance certificate regime as it is not temporary and has not
been imposed for balance of payments reasons.
38.
Moving decisively to implement structural reforms will help boost medium-term
growth prospects. Continued efforts are needed to improve infrastructure, and law and order,
invest in health and education, attract more FDI, accelerate SOE reforms, and reduce business costs.
A revival of agriculture and a strengthening of the SME sector supported by innovations in financial
inclusion will also be vital for improving the livelihood of the majority of the population.

While staff welcomes the recent progress, more decisive action is needed to improve
macroeconomic statistics. The authorities’ commitment to reforming the National Statistical Office
is a strong step in this direction, with IMF TA continuing to assist reform efforts and improve
capacity. Staff looks forward to the publication of new GDP estimates later this year.
40.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with PNG will be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Box 1. Papua New Guinea—Update on the LNG and Mineral Projects
Successful commencement of LNG production has boosted the overall growth performance but brought
weaker-than-expected revenue due to falling commodity prices. There is significant upside in terms of
exploration from the second LNG project and other mining projects planned over the medium term.
PNG LNG Project
Production is expected to reach full capacity of 6.9 million tons per year in 2015. The project started
in 2010, led by ExxonMobile, with a total cost of US$19 billion. The first LNG shipment from the PNG LNG
project took place in May 2014, ahead of schedule. The main buyers are Japan, mainland China, and
Taiwan POC, with the contract price linked to the oil price (Japan Crude Cocktail). The expected
operational life of the project is 30 years.
A sizable portion of earnings will be diverted to loan repayments and partially offset by
accelerated depreciation allowances. The construction costs are financed by a mix of 30 percent equity
and 70 percent debt. While export earnings are more than adequate to cover the loan repayments,
significant tax revenues from the LNG project are not expected before 2021-22, largely due to
accelerated depreciation allowances.

Papua LNG (Elk-Antelope) Project
Industry analysis suggests Elk-Antelope will be the most competitive newly-built LNG project in
the world, with production estimated at 8 million tons per year. The joint venture consists of French
oil major Total SA as operator (40.1 percent), InterOil (36.5 percent) and Oil Search (about 23 percent).
Under the proposed project schedule, early works would begin in the third quarter of 2016, with a final
investment decision and construction starting in 2017. The total cost is estimated at around US$15
billion, which would have a significant impact on the economy.
Other Major Mining Projects
PNG has several mine projects that are scheduled to begin production over the medium term.
Among them are Wafi-Golpu (gold and copper), Frieda River (a global top 10 undeveloped open pit
copper mine), Solwara 1 (deep sea mining of gold and copper), Yandera (copper), Mt. Kare (gold),
Imwauna (gold), and new deposits/mine within the vicinity of PNG’s oldest operating mine, OK Tedi (gold
and copper).

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

Box 2. Papua New Guinea—Alternative Commodity Price Scenario
An alternative commodity price scenario suggests that the external current account balance is highly
sensitive to the commodity price projections, whereas the fiscal position would be affected to a lesser extent,
largely reflecting the base effects of the previous downward revision in resource revenues from K 2.4 billion
to K 0.6 billion for 2015.
Alternative Scenario (a further 20 percent decline in commodity prices)
Assumptions. All mineral prices (LNG, crude oil, gold and other metals) would fall further by
20 percent over 2015-20, with no change in the volume. For 2015, the price decline is assumed to
take effect during the second half of the year.
External balance. The current account would decline by around 7 percent of GDP relative to the
baseline, and would be expected to remain in deficit over 2016-20. The size of the impact on the
current account is roughly the same as the earlier LNG price drop of about 50 percent. The
impact on the overall balance of payments would be almost entirely offset by the impact on the
financial account since most commodity export receipts are kept offshore. As a result, the
international reserves would remain broadly unchanged compared to the baseline.
Fiscal position. Revenue and the overall balance would decline by about 0.5 percent of GDP on
average, relative to the baseline, owing to lower mineral tax revenues and LNG dividends.
Compared to the impact of the previous commodity price adjustment, the impact would be much
smaller because the level of resource revenue had already fallen from K 2.4 billion (in the 2015
budget) to K 0.6 billion (under the baseline) for 2015, reflecting lower commodity prices and the
temporary suspension of a major mining operation.

Box 3. Papua New Guinea—External Sector Assessment
Staff’s overall assessment is that the medium-term
external position is broadly in line with fundamentals
and desirable policies. The medium-term real
effective exchange rate assessment produced mixed
results.
The kina has been weakening since 2013, as
commodity prices fell and capital inflows
associated with the LNG project passed their
peak. The kina has depreciated by 16 percent
against the U.S. dollar from June 2014, when the
exchange rate band was introduced, to early
October 2015, but excess demand for foreign
exchange persists.

CGER-like estimates produced mixed results. The PPP approach suggests a 25 percent overvaluation,
while the other three approaches indicate a range of 4-19 percent of undervaluation. These results
suggest that the medium term current account is not out of line with fundamentals and desirable
policies. As suggested in the 2012 Board paper, “Macroeconomic Policy Frameworks for Resource-Rich
Developing Countries,” the augmented MB approach incorporates oil-related variables such as the oil
trade balance and oil wealth including LNG, and the ERER approach is conducted based on the long-run
relationship between the REER and real oil price.
The reserve metric approach suggests that PNG’s current reserve holdings are below the level
deemed adequate (estimated to be close to 5 months of imports).1 On the other hand, the optimal
reserve approach indicates that the current holdings are well above the optimal level (about 2.5 months
of imports for the fixed regime).2 This latter result depends critically on the long-term opportunity cost of
holding reserves, which is currently estimated to be 8.7 percent. Given that poor data quality may hamper
the credibility of the estimated opportunity cost, more weight should be placed on the results of the
reserve metric approach.

1/ As the authorities integrated the recurrent and development budgets from 2014 there is a discontinuity in the classification.
2/ Nonresource net lending(+)/borrowing(-).
3/ Discrepancies between the overall balance and financing arise because transactions of trust accounts are not fully accounted for

Staff Advice on Policy
Response

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize
in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline
(“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability
of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions
with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Appendix II. Papua New Guinea: Authorities’ Responses
to Fund Advice
Fund Recommendation

Policy Actions

Monetary, Financial and Exchange Rate Policies

 Remove excess liquidity to improve
monetary policy effectiveness and reduce
downside pressure on the kina exchange
rate.

The BPNG continues to actively consider options to
withdraw liquidity. The CRR has remained at 10 percent,
after having been increased in September 2014.

 Maintain a floating exchange rate regime
to help absorb external shocks.

The official interbank exchange rate was unchanged from
October 2013 to early June 2014, when the BPNG
introduced a foreign exchange (FX) trading band of 150
basis points around the official interbank rate, leading to
a de facto kina appreciation of around 17 percent. Since
then the exchange rate has depreciated by 16 percent,
but excess demand for foreign currency has persisted.

 Implement FATF AML/CFT
recommendations.

Five AML/CFT bills have recently been enacted, and
guidelines will be issued to complement the Anti-Money
Laundering and Counter Terrorist Financing Bill 2015. A
National Coordinating Committee has been established
across 15 different institutions.

Fiscal Policy

 Adopt a fiscal policy stance consistent with
putting public debt in line with the
government’s targets and ensuring debt
sustainability.

The authorities have announced an expenditure review,
and plan to cut spending in 2015 with the possibility of a
supplementary budget in October.

 Improving the quality of spending.

A draft PEFA assessment was completed in April 2015,
and identified several areas of weakness, including weak
cash management. The authorities have recently
published the PEFA assessment and finalized the PFM
roadmap. Priorities include the completion of the IFMS
rollout, to address shortcomings in collection and
recording of accounting information.

 Improving revenue collection through
improved tax compliance and rationalizing
tax exemptions and concessions.

The authorities are continuing efforts to improve revenue
collection. The 2015 budget included a review of fees and
charges, measures to improve GST and rental income tax
compliance, tougher penalties for convicted tax
offenders, and an increase in tobacco excise duties.
Further measures are expected to result from the
comprehensive tax review, which is nearing completion.

 Safeguard the integrity of the SWF for it to
play a key role in managing PNG’s resource
revenues.

SWF legislation was passed in late July 2015. The SWF will
comprise a Stabilization Fund and a Savings Fund, both
expected to be operational in 2016. The law allows for
taxes, dividends, and asset sale proceeds to be paid into
the Stabilization Fund.

Secretariat, and progress on the first EITI report which is
due in December 2015. PNG expects to undertake EITI
validation by early 2017.
The 2015 Budget announced work to develop and
implement several SOE policies including: a dividend
policy; an on-lending and guarantee policy; and a
community service obligation policy. Legislation enacted
in 2015 will see state-owned assets previously held in
IPBC transfer to Kumul Consolidated Holdings.
Legislation has recently been passed for the
establishment of three Kumul subsidiaries.

Safeguards Assessments
Under the Fund's Safeguards Assessments policy, the Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) was subject
to a transitional assessment based on its Stand-By Arrangement with the Fund, which was approved
in March 2000 and expired in September 2001. The transitional assessment was completed on
May 4, 2001 and recommendations were made to alleviate identified weaknesses. Currently, the
BPNG is not subject to the Safeguards Assessments policy.
Exchange Rate Arrangement
Papua New Guinea’s de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. From April 2014, the Kina has
reduced its volatility and followed a trend within a 2 percent band against the U.S. dollar.
Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified from floating to a crawl-like
arrangement, effective April 11, 2014. Papua New Guinea maintains an exchange restriction subject
to IMF approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a) of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement arising from the
requirement to obtain a tax clearance certificate evidencing the payment of all taxes prior to making
payments or transfers for certain current international transactions.
Article IV Consultations
The 2014 Article IV consultation discussions were held during August 8-22, 2014. The staff report was
discussed by the Executive Board and the consultation completed on November 10, 2014 (IMF
Country Report No. 14/325). Papua New Guinea is on the standard 12–month consultation cycle.
Technical Assistance from Headquarters
FAD: A joint FAD/PFTAC mission in March 2000 assisted the authorities in preparing a Report on the
Observance of Standards and Codes Fiscal Transparency Module, published in October 2000. A
mission in December 2000 provided advice on the reconciliation of large and volatile differences in
fiscal reporting based on information provided by the Treasury Department and information
reported by the Bank of Papua New Guinea. A mission in February 2002 assessed progress in
improving fiscal transparency. A joint FAD/PFTAC mission visited PNG to provide advice on the
sovereign wealth fund management in May 2011. A mission in March 2013 provided advice on
reform of the extractive industries fiscal regime.
LEG: A mission in November 2005 provided advice on the drafting of a tax administration law. A
mission in July 2006 provided a comprehensive program of assistance in the development of the
AML/CFT regime, including legislative drafting and capacity building. A mission in AugustSeptember 2007 assisted the authorities in finalizing the terms of the Revenue Administration Bill.
MFD/MCM: Technical assistance through peripatetic visits was delivered on bank regulation and
supervision (2001, February–March 2007, July–August 2009, and February 2010), medium-term
monetary policy formulation (October 2004 and September 2005), reserve management (June 2006,

STA: A multisector statistics mission occurred in September 2006 followed by a high-level STA visit
in December 2007, in collaboration with the ABS. Technical assistance was provided on monetary and
financial statistics (April 2005, May 2006, April 2008, November 2009 May 2010, and February 2013);
balance of payments and the international investment position (June 2008, November 2009, MayJune 2013, February 2014, and July 2015); government finance statistics (2012, May and October
2013, April-May and October 2014, April 2015, and September 2015); and GDDS metadata (January

RELATIONS WITH THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE CENTRE
(As of September 2015)
The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) in Suva, Fiji, is a regional technical
assistance institution operated by the IMF with financial support of the Asian Development Bank,
Australia, Korea, the European Union, and New Zealand. The Center’s aim is to build skills and
institutional capacity for effective economic and financial management that can be sustained at the
national level. Member countries are: Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati,
Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste,
Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

A. Public Financial Management
The PFTAC assisted in the preparation of a ROSC, which was published in October 2000. The PFTAC
PFM Advisor has participated in occasional FAD technical assistance missions, and an attachment of
one PNG official to PFTAC was completed in April 2007. PNG participated, with four officials, in the
U.S. Treasury study visit in September 2008. In May 2011, the PFTAC macroeconomic advisor
participated in an FAD mission on advising PNG on the SWF. In July 2013, a PFTAC PFM Advisor
visited PNG at the request of the Treasury Minister to review the budget preparation process, and
discuss with authorities plans for training in the PEFA methodology. In May-June 2014, PFTAC
provided information, communication, and technology (ICT) assessment mission and recommended
comprehensive reform strategy to better support of operation of the Department of Finance.
In 2014, however, PFTAC PFM assistance expanded heavily. Starting early in 2014, and continuing
through early 2015, PFTAC began training PNG staff to carry out a PEFA Self-Assessment.
Subsequently in March 2015 PFTAC and a team from FAD conducted an external PEFA assessment
which corroborated most of the findings of the Self-Assessment. PFTAC and FAD then worked with
Department of Finance officials to develop a PFM Reform Roadmap to address major deficiencies
identified by the PEFA Assessment.
PFTAC also sponsored several short-term missions by an ICT specialist starting in May 2014 and
continuing into mid-2015 to assess ICT operations and design and implement a comprehensive
reform strategy to better support expansion of a modern IFMS by the Department of Finance.
In addition, during 2015 PFTAC supported short-term missions to review cash management,
reconciliation, and reporting processes.

B. Tax Administration and Policy
PFTAC has not supported the Internal Revenue Commission (IRC) in revenue administration as they
are strongly supported by two Australian Programs: (1) the Strongim Gavman Program (SGP) which is

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 5

used to engage senior ATO advisors to the IRC; and (2) the Economic Public Sector Program (EPSP)
which provides support for strategic, governance, integrity matters and IT support.
A new IT system continues to be rolled out which includes new applications for withholding taxes,
Goods and Services Tax and Corporate Income Tax. Peripheral modules will follow over the next
twelve months with project completion by 2017.
A tax review diagnostic, conducted by an accounting firm, has issued a report and various issues
papers which are currently under discussion.

C. Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision
There is no current PFTAC involvement in this area. In September 2014, the BPNG hosted the annual
meeting of the Association of Financial Supervisors of Pacific Countries, for which PFTAC is the
secretariat. In March 2007, PFTAC funded an attachment for two supervisors from the Bank of Papua
New Guinea to assist the Cook Islands’ supervisory authority to undertake an on-site examination of
a domestic bank. In 2008, PFTAC funded an attachment of one supervisor to assist the Reserve Bank
of Fiji under an on-site examination of a local branch of a PNG-based bank. PFTAC has not received
any subsequent request for assistance from the BPNG.

D. Economic and Financial Statistics
In February 2006, an Advisor briefly assessed the BOP compilation with a view to improving its
quality, and to assessing progress with regard to recommendations made by previous missions. A
multi-sector statistics mission in September 2006 assessed the statistical systems (BOP, national
accounts, prices statistics, government finance statistics, and monetary statistics), with the PFTAC
Advisor assessing the national accounts and providing overall coordination. In 2008 and 2009 the
Advisor undertook BOP statistics missions to review statistics prerequisites, progress in improving
compilation methods and source data, as well as to assist BPNG statistics staff in assessing the
feasibility of electronic data collection. Since 2013, PFTAC has conducted a series of six TA missions
to assist the national statistics office (NSO), the BPNG, and the Department of Treasury in improving
national accounts statistics. PFTAC has increasingly focused its TA on improving capacities at the
NSO in the broader context of the NSO reform process initiated by the authorities in 2014. Support
has been provided in close collaboration with the ABS which has provided statistical leadership and
management advice as well as TA on data collection issues including business and household
surveys with the secondment of two ABS staff to the PNG NSO since July 2015 and until June 2016.

E. Macroeconomic Analysis
Following a request by the BPNG for assistance in building up financial programming capacity, the
development of a PNG-specific financial programming framework started in 2011. Training in the use
and updating of the framework was provided to staffs of both BPNG and the Department of Treasury
and staffs from both institutions also participated in training in financial programming techniques
provided jointly by PFTAC and the Singapore Regional Training Institute during a regional workshop

in Fiji in December 2012. A separate work program with the Department of Treasury and BPNG
developed in collaboration with the APD country team and the IMF’s Research Department modeling
tools for exploring the macroeconomic impact of the surge in natural resource revenues from the
LNG project. Further development of the financial programming framework started in 2014 as it was
found to contain a high level of detail that is resource intensive to update and not needed in day-today monitoring and projection activities. More recently work has been undertaken to improving the
BPNG’s inflation forecasting methodology following major revisions to the consumer price index
(CPI) by the National Statistics Office (NSO) in June 2014.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of August 31, 2015)
Papua New Guinea (PNG) joined the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) in 1971. The 2011-2015
country partnership strategy (CPS) guided AsDB's engagement in PNG since 2011. The CPS aimed to
help PNG deliver its second Medium-Term Development Plan (MTDP), 2011–2015. The CPS
emphasized AsDB support for transport, energy, private sector development (PSD), health, regional
cooperation and integration, and public sector management (PSM). PNG significantly scaled up its
use of AsDB resources during this period, with the active portfolio expanding from $350 million in
2010 to $1.1 billion in 2014.
In line with the government’s development agenda and AsDB’s Strategy 2020 midterm review
priorities, the 2016-2020 CPS will assist the country in planning and implementing a successful
conversion of its resource wealth into inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic growth.
The indicative resources for 2016–2018 total $637.0 million. Indicative country allocations of Asian
Development Fund (ADF) resources for PNG during 2016–2018 amount to $133.0 million. The final
allocations of ADF resources will depend on the available ADF commitment authority and the
outcome of the country performance assessments. The indicative non-lending program for 2016–
2018 totals $3.2 million, of which $1.5 million is for project preparatory technical assistance.
The government favors a programmatic approach to its partnership with AsDB, featuring
multitranche financing facility (MFF) which provide long-term, predictable finance for executing
agencies as well as supporting development partner coordination and strengthened country financial
management. AsDB will maximize the development impact of its operations by remaining focused on
a small number of larger high-impact activities, prioritizing opportunities for knowledge transfer and
capacity development. AsDB will also mainstream gender in its interventions and identify genderspecific targets within each of its core sectors of operations.
Providing knowledge solutions will be a focus of AsDB support: the PNG country knowledge plan
outlines a targeted pipeline of activities that promote public sector transparency and improved
sustainability and impact of AsDB operations. AsDB will use implementation structures established
under ongoing AsDB-funded projects to partner more closely with community groups and civil
society, particularly to manage environmental and social safeguards risks. Considering PNG’s
significant capacity constraints, and to ensure the sustainability of investments, training and capacity
development will be incorporated into all sector operations.
The majority of AsDB assistance will be in two core sectors: transport and energy. The remainder of
the financial envelope will be allocated to supporting rural primary health delivery, water and other
urban infrastructure and services, and PSM. AsDB will take the following approaches in each of these
sectors:
i.

Transport. A strong portfolio and forward pipeline has been developed in land transport and
civil aviation, with possible future opportunities in maritime transport. AsDB will support

improved sustainability through ongoing sector dialogue, support for public–private
partnerships (PPPs), as well as knowledge management and technical assistance (TA) to
improve maintenance and operating cost financing. Where established implementation
structures have a demonstrated capacity to use funds effectively, AsDB will emphasize
attracting cofinancing.
Energy. AsDB will continue to support investments in renewable energy generation and
improving transmission and distribution efficiencies on main power grids. AsDB will also
support improving electricity services to provincial centers through least-cost hydro power
projects and improved distribution systems. This will include expanding the existing power
grids to peri-urban areas and promoting innovative models led by the private sector for offgrid power delivery. This approach will help address a lack of access to affordable and
reliable power, which currently reaches only 12 percent of the population.
Health. In response to government and development partner requests, AsDB will continue its
operations in rural health access and service improvement. Support will focus on the
country’s key health challenges of maternal and child health, HIV/AIDS, and other infectious
diseases through an integrated approach to health system strengthening. Program lending
will be utilized to support regulatory and management reform as well as health workforce
recruitment and the country’s weak referral system. A focus will be placed on strengthening
partnerships with civil society and attracting new sources of cofinancing and counterpart
funding.
Water and other urban infrastructure and services. PNG’s treated water supply is
characterized by low coverage (around 20 percent), intermittent supply, and poor standards
and quality. Eighty percent of urban households lack access to latrines, 94 percent of all cities
and towns are unsewered, and 80 percent of all sewage generated is discharged untreated.
AsDB will extend efforts to promote improved water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH)
outcomes. Assistance will emphasize creating a regulatory environment conducive to private
sector investment and public sector efficiency.
Public sector management. AsDB will emphasize increasing PSM accountability and
transparency so that the government can more effectively and efficiently translate growing
public revenues into delivering services and providing infrastructure. Building upon lessons
from previous PSM reform efforts, and responding to the slow sector-wide reform progress,
AsDB will focus its support on more transparent and accountable budgeting practices, with
an emphasis on natural resource revenue management and improved infrastructure
budgeting and coordination.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
PAPUA NEW GUINEA — STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
As of September 24, 2015
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Most affected
areas are: national accounts, fiscal accounts, and balance of payments.
National Accounts: The accuracy and reliability of the statistics are affected by inadequate source data.
The most recent official national accounts statistics were published by the National Statistical Office (NSO)
for National Income, Expenditure and Product, for reference years 1993–98. These estimates were compiled
using the System of National Accounts 1968 (1968 SNA). Subsequently, a preliminary set of national
accounts (NA) estimates using the 1993 SNA for 1994–2004, rebased to 1998 prices, was compiled.
However, as these estimates were still in need of substantial improvements, the 2006 STA multisector
mission recommended against publication of the new GDP statistics until the needed revisions were made.
No further data have been provided by the NSO to STA since that time. In an attempt to fill the vacuum,
the Treasury Department began estimating the NA since reference year 2002. The Bank of Papua New
Guinea also compiles, but does not publish, its own estimates of GDP. Since August 2013, six TA missions
have been conducted by PFTAC to review the methodologies and the data sources used to compile the
national accounts statistics. These missions identified shortcomings and advised on improving the use of
administrative data, including tax data. A detailed work plan has been prepared in collaboration with the
ABS for the NSO to produce GDP estimates in current prices for the period 2007-13. These estimates
should be released in November 2015 and GDP estimates in constant prices should be released later in
2016. PFTAC conducted two sub-regional training courses during 2014 and 2015 to
support this development work. Reforming the NSO is underway with support from the ABS.
Price Statistics: The NSO currently compiles a quarterly wholesale price index (WPI) (which it does not
publish) and a quarterly consumer price index (CPI). In May 2014, the NSO began to publish a new CPI
series based on the data from the 2009-10 Household Income Expenditure Survey, ending 35 years of
the CPI using a consumption basket from the late 1970s. However, the most recent CPI published on
the NSO website is for Quarter 4, 2014.
Government Finance Statistics: Annual government finance statistics (GFS) have not been reported to STA
since 2002. Data received to that point in time suffered from insufficient coverage and timeliness. Central
government tax revenue, nontax revenue, and public expenditure data are deficient. Development budget
expenditures and the utilization of grants and project loans are recorded with long lags, and few records
on the use of trust accounts are available. Tax revenues collected by authorities (extra-budgetary units) are
generally not reflected in the central government’s financial information; this includes the portion of valueadded tax directly transferred to provinces by the revenue agency. While interest payment records are
accurate, there are timing issues regarding the recording of interest on discounted securities. These
weaknesses contribute to discrepancies in domestic financing between estimates from monetary and debt
data and those derived from fiscal records. Currently the Papua New Guinea Government is preparing to
migrate to Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014 (GFSM 2014), with a goal of using this methodology
for budget estimate and outturn presentations in the future. For the migration, the authorities are
participating in the Japan Administered Account (JSA)-funded three-year regional GFS capacity-building
project since 2013. JSA funding for GFS TA to PNG has been extended through 2018.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 11

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

Monetary and Financial Statistics: Monetary data are now being produced and reported to STA on a
regular basis. Progress has been achieved by the Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) in many areas in the
collection, compilation, and dissemination of monetary and financial statistics (MFS), leading to the
introduction of the standardized report form (SRF) for the central bank, other depository corporations
(ODCs), and the other financial corporations (OFCs). The 2013 mission introduced general insurance
companies in the institutional coverage of OFCs and an improved SRF for OFCs. Most of the monetary
statistics published in International Financial Statistics (IFS) are currently aligned with the Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM).
Financial sector surveillance: In the area of financial soundness indicators (FSIs), the BPNG has compiled
selected FSIs for deposit takers to support the financial sector assessment. Papua New Guinea is
participating in a three-year (FY2014–FY2016) TA project on FSIs for selected AFR and APD countries
funded by the Government of Japan and is expected to submit FSI data and metadata to STA for posting
on the IMF’s FSI website well before the end of the project.
External Sector Statistics: The latest balance of payments data reported to STA are those for 2012. Annual
balance of payments data are derived from the International Transactions Reporting System (ITRS). The
ITRS coverage of data is lower than that of custom declarations database. There are marked differences
between the official data on exports and imports of goods and those reported by trading partners. The
financial accounts data are of poor quality because of major deficiencies in data collection, especially in the
area of private external debt and foreign direct investment. The use of administrative data for PNG
Liquefied Natural Gas project’s transactions, a large component of PNG’s economy, is highly required for
improvement of ESS. Three TA missions have been provided under the JSA Project on the improvement of
external sector statistics (ESS) since May 2013. Despite those TA missions, overall improvements in the
quality of ESS have been very modest.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Papua New Guinea began to participate in the
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) in 2012.

No data ROSC assessment has been done for Papua
New Guinea.

III. Reporting to STA
Papua New Guinea last reported GFS for publication in Government Finance Statistics Yearbook and IFS for
1999–2002, covering only the budgetary central government. Monetary data are reported to STA for
publication in IFS on a regular monthly basis. BOP data for 2010 were reported to STA for publication in
Balance of Payments Yearbook and IFS. National accounts data for 2004 were reported to STA for publication
in IFS.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

October 8, 2015

Approved By
Hoe Ee Khor and Steven
Barnett (IMF)
Satu Kahkonen (IDA)

Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the International Development Association (IDA)1

This Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) indicates that Papua New Guinea’s (PNG) risk of
debt distress remains low based on an assessment of public and publicly-guaranteed
(PPG) external debt, in line with the results of the DSA for the 2014 Article IV
consultation.2 However, factoring in public domestic and private external debt and
contingent liabilities, the overall risk of debt distress remains heightened, and a failure to
consolidate the fiscal position would worsen debt dynamics.

1

This DSA was prepared jointly with the World Bank, in accordance with the Debt Sustainability Framework for
low-income countries approved by the Executive Boards of the IMF and the IDA.
2

Papua New Guinea is rated as a medium performer for its policies and institutions for the purposes of the
IMF-World Bank low-income country DSA framework.

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

BACKGROUND
1.
PNG’s public and external debt burdens have fallen significantly over the past decade.
Public debt declined from 62 percent of GDP at end-2004 to about 22 percent of GDP in 2011, but
rose to around 42½ percent in 2014.3 Public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt also
declined sharply, from a peak of over 50 percent of GDP in 2001 to around 16 percent in 2014.
Around 70 percent of current public external debt is owed to the Asian Development Bank and the
World Bank. Domestic debt consists of treasury bills (45 percent) and inscribed stocks (55 percent)
with an average maturity of 5 years. The main creditors are resident banks and superannuation
funds. The government is planning to issue a sovereign bond of around US$1 billion in 2015.4

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
2.
Over the medium term, PNG’s growth prospects and current account developments
will be heavily influenced by its extractive sector and the LNG price outlook. Box 1 summarizes
the medium-term macroeconomic framework underlying this DSA update. Economic activity is
projected to continue to grow in 2015, reflecting the fact that liquefied natural gas (LNG) production
reaches full capacity. The current account deficit narrowed in 2014 due to the winding down of the
construction of the LNG project. With LNG exports coming on stream this year, the deficit is
expected to turn into a surplus in 2015, while the temporary suspension of a major mining operation
will dampen mineral exports.

EXTERNAL DSA
3.
The baseline scenario indicates that all PPG external debt ratios stay well below the
indicative thresholds, while there is a short-lived breach in the extenal debt service-torevenue ratio due to the inclusion of a loan which has been moved to a public enterprise. The
present value of the external debt stock is expected to rise in the near term because of an Australian
$1.2 billion loan (6.8 percent of GDP) that government took in early 2014, but fall over the medium
term as this loan is repaid and with the expectation that new external borrowing will be moderate
(Figure 1).5 The public external debt service ratios follow a similar profile, with higher debt service
initially rising as a result of this loan but subsequently falling to very low levels, reflecting PNG’s
relatively small external debt stock as well as the fact that most of its public external debt is highly
3

For 2014, this DSA assessment includes the UBS loan in public debt. If the UBS loan is excluded, public debt is
35½ percent of GDP and PPG external debt is around 9 percent of GDP in 2014.
4

The terms and conditions have not been disclosed. For the analytical purposes, this DSA assumes 10-year maturity
with a 10 percent interest rate and that a sovereign bond will be rolled over when it matures.

5

The government contracted this loan from UBS in March 2014 to finance the purchase of a 10 percent stake in the
Oil Search Limited, an oil and gas company. It has been moved off the government balance sheet to the National
Petroleum Company PNG (NPCP). The terms and conditions of this loan have not been disclosed. For the purpose of
this DSA, staff has assumed a two-year loan maturity with 8 percent annual interest and included it as part of publicly
guaranteed external debt.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

concessional. There is a breach of the external debt service-to-revenue ratio in 2016. However, the
breach is short-lived and is mainly due to the inclusion of the UBS loan which has been moved off
the government balance sheet to the NPCP. Without this loan, the indicator would remain below the
indicative threshold and the risk to debt sustainability therefore appears to be manageable. High
levels of private external debt could potentially create balance of payments pressures by competing
with the public sector for foreign exchange. Nevertheless, such risks are mitigated by the fact that a
large part of the loans are adequately backed by expected cash flows from the LNG project.
4.
PNG is vulnerable to certain extreme shocks despite the currently low external debt
burden, but these shocks have a low probability of materializing. There is a protracted breach of
the PV of the debt-to-GDP ratio under the historical scenario and a near breach under the export
shock scenario. Also, there is a near breach of the external debt service-to-revenue ratio under the
export shock scenario, when the sovereign bond is rolled over. However, these scenarios could be
thought of as circumstances where the LNG project has completely failed or suffered a major delay.
In the historical scenario, for instance, when the current account deficit is fixed at the ten-year
average of 2005–14, the simulation effectively keeps imports at levels elevated by the LNG project
and rules out the expected large increases in LNG exports going forward. Given that LNG production
has already commenced and is set to reach a full capacity this year, such an outcome is very unlikely,
while there is potential risk of a further commodity price decline and rollover risk stemming from the
planned sovereign bond.

PUBLIC DSA
5.
The public debt dynamics for PNG remains stable, but there are risks to this outlook.6
The public debt burden is expected to decline continuously over the projection period under the
baseline (Figure 2). However, failures to consolidate the fiscal position would significantly increase
debt burden. There are also risks arising from unfunded superannuation and public enterprise
liabilities. The former are estimated to be about 6½ percent of GDP at end-2014 and the latter
about 7½ of GDP, but data on the latter are incomplete and not up to date. Once these liabilities are
taken into account, there would be a noticeable increase in the public debt burden over the medium
term, as shown in the customized scenario (“All other liabilities”) for the public DSA.7

AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS
6.
The authorities agreed with the DSA findings, noting that the current risk of debt
distress is low, but fiscal consolidation is crucial for debt sustainability. The authorities
acknowledged that a continuation of the current fiscal stance is not sustainable and that
expenditure restraint is needed to keep the debt on a downward path. They also recognized the
6

Public debt includes domestic central government debt and external public and publicly guaranteed debt.

7

This scenario assumes that the full amount of superannuation arrears is added to the debt stock, and 100 percent
of SOEs debt is realized to become actual liabilities and added to the debt stock. The SOEs debt stock is assumed to
grow in line with nominal GDP.

importance of more comprehensive data on debt and other liabilities, in particular, off-budget and
public enterprise debt, in assessing PNG’s overall debt burdens. They will consider an IMF technical
assistance mission on the Medium-Term Debt Management Strategy (MTDS) to provide a sound
framework for future budgetary financing.

CONCLUSION
7.
Papua New Guinea’s PPG external debt remains at low risk of debt stress. However, the
overall risk of public debt distress has remained heightened, given the rising stock of public
domestic debt in recent years. Contingent and non-contingent liabilities significantly increase the
public debt burden, and a failure to consolidate the fiscal position would result in unsustainable
debt dynamics. The government needs to bring the public debt on a downward trajectory over the
medium term, while focusing on improving spending quality to make the most out of a restrained
resource envelope in meeting the country’s development needs. The terms and conditions of all
loans including the UBS loan should also be published to ensure fiscal transparency and debt
sustainability. Going forward, a planned debut sovereign bond issuance should be used to improve
the debt profile and terms and cover existing commitments rather than finance new projects.

Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions Underlying the DSA Update
Macroeconomic assumptions for this DSA are generally more conservative than those for the
previous DSA. In particular, projections of GDP growth and external current account are somewhat
lower than those for the 2014 DSA, as are projections of the primary fiscal balance. This largely
reflects a less favorable outlook for the resource sector owing to lower commodity prices and a
temporary mine closure. LNG prices are assumed to decline by about 30 percent in 2015 and by
around 5 percent in 2016, reflecting the recent plunge in oil prices.





Real GDP growth is projected at around 4 percent on average over the medium term8,
and to slow to 3 percent in the long run.



Inflation is expected to be about 3½ percent over the medium term and will stabilize at
5 percent in the long run.



The current account (including grants) will turn into a surplus in 2015 as LNG production
comes on stream and imports related to the LNG project subside, and is projected to be
5 percent of GDP on average during 2015-20.



The grant element of loans is expected to average around 35 percent. A sovereign bond
reduces the grant element of loans when it is issued and rolled over with a 10-year interval.
The primary fiscal balance is estimated to be in deficit of 5 percent of GDP in 2015.
During the current medium-term fiscal strategy period (2013-17), a continuous primary
deficit of 4 percent of GDP on average is expected. After 2024, the primary fiscal balance is
projected to turn into a surplus, with an average of 0.4 percent of GDP during 2024–34.

8

The government plans to spend K 3 billion over 2015-18 on the preparations for APEC 2018. Thus, 2018 will see a
winding down of construction activity, with overall growth projected to slow down to 1½ percent in 2018 and
stabilize at 3 percent over the longer term.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Statement by the Staff Representative on Papua New Guinea
October 30, 2015
1.
On October 19, 2015, the Government of Papua New Guinea (PNG) released the
2016 Budget Strategy Paper. Highlights are as follows. The projected fiscal deficit in 2015, at
4.5 percent of GDP, is 3.1 percentage points of GDP lower than the staff’s projection (Table 1),
and close to the 2015 budget of 4.4 percent. Revenues are projected to be K 1.1 billion higher
than budgeted and expenditures K 1.4 billion lower. The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to be
34.4 percent, slightly below the 35 percent of GDP ceiling in 2015 (lower than staff’s projection
of 39.4 percent). Staff welcomes the intention for faster consolidation and is looking forward to
hearing more about the measures underpinning this effort.
2.
The government envisages further fiscal consolidation beyond 2015, with a gradual
reduction of deficit for 201619 leading to a balanced budget in 2020. Underpinning this more
ambitious consolidation than envisaged by staff are further expenditure prioritization, the
planned refining of the tax regime, and structural reforms in public enterprises. The 2016 budget
and the medium-term strategy continue to give priority to the core development enablers,
namely, health, education, law and order, agriculture, and infrastructure.
3.
The 2016 Budget will be reported under the GFSM 2014 methodology, and
aggregate numbers for total revenue and expenditure will be revised accordingly.1 The
macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts will be updated with the 2016 budget to reflect any changes
in economic and financial conditions.
4.
The proposed 2016 budget strategy does not change the staff assessment as reported
in the staff report.

In the 2016 Budget Strategy Paper, total revenue in 2016 is projected at approximately K 10.4 billion with K 9.9
billion tax revenue and K 0.6 billion non-tax revenue. Total expenditure in 2016 is projected at K 13.4 billion.

Statement by Barry Sterland, Executive Director for Papua New Guinea
and Ian South, Advisor to Executive Director
October 30, 2015
We thank staff for the quality of engagement with our authorities and the useful staff report.
As a resource rich economy, Papua New Guinea (PNG) is undergoing a significant
transition associated with the sharp downturn in global commodity prices. While growth
remains robust, the headwinds of declining commodity prices and tightening financial
conditions have required the authorities to adjust policies, including as a result of their
established macroeconomic frameworks.
In the face of the challenging external environment, the authorities are making timely fiscal
adjustments to contain public debt to prudent levels. At the same time, the authorities are
focused on continuing to meet the considerable development needs of the country by
prioritizing and improving the quality of expenditure. Monetary policy remains neutral,
supporting growth objectives as inflation remains at moderate levels. The authorities are
also supporting flexibility in the exchange rate to act as a shock absorber and help the
economy adapt to the changing external conditions.
The authorities continue to strive for a stronger and more diversified economy by translating
gains from the resources sector into sustainable investments and structural reforms in other
sectors such as education, health, law and order, energy, transport, tourism and agriculture.
OUTLOOK AND RISKS
PNG will grow strongly in 2015, but the economy has been impacted by lower
commodity prices and slowing growth in non-resource sectors. PNG will record its 14th
consecutive year of economic growth in 2015, its longest period of sustained growth. The
economy is expected to grow strongly at 9 percent this year, though this represents a
significant downward revision as a result of the impact of lower international commodity
prices and the El Niño weather pattern affecting the mining, agriculture, forestry and
fisheries sectors. Despite weaker commodity prices and the temporary closure of the Ok Tedi
copper and gold mine, the resource sector is growing strongly, largely as a result of the
commencement of the PNG LNG project. However, the non-resource sectors are growing
more slowly. Lower activity in the construction and manufacturing is expected to largely
offset growth in non-resource other sectors.
The medium term outlook is for growth to return to its long term average. However,
the authorities recognize there are a range of risks to this baseline. Further falls in
commodity prices or a worsening of the drought would impact the outlook further. A
worsening of the drought could prolong the closure of the Ok Tedi mine beyond the first
quarter of 2016. An extended drought would also further affect agricultural output, which

2
would particularly impact on large numbers of subsistence farmers. On the upside, the
authorities note that there continue to be prospects for further resource projects in the
medium-term (including for a second major LNG project), given the highly competitive
characteristics of PNG’s natural resource endowment and its record in delivering world-class
resource projects.
FISCAL POLICY AND PUBLIC DEBT MANAGEMENT
The authorities have responded to considerably lower resource revenues in 2015 with a
package of responsible fiscal measures. With lower international commodity prices and the
weather-related temporary shutdown of the Ok Tedi mine, resource revenues will be
significantly lower than budgeted in 2015. The authorities have responded prudently to these
developments by identifying expenditure savings of 1.4 billion kina, while avoiding cuts in
priority areas of education, health, infrastructure, and law and order so as to continue
supporting inclusive and sustainable development. At the same time, the authorities have also
announced revenue measures to raise an additional 1.1 billion kina from tax collections and
dividends from state entities. Together, these adjustments will contain the 2015 budget deficit
to 4.5 percent of GDP, which is close to the originally budgeted deficit of 4.4 percent of GDP
and broadly in line with staff advice.
While the level of public debt remains manageable, the authorities agree with staff on
the need to restrain its growth, particularly as financing conditions tighten. While
PNG’s public debt continues to be at a moderate level by international standards, the
authorities recognize that the recent growth should be curtailed and that steps are required to
move debt to a pathway that is consistent with a credible medium term strategy. PNG
continues to finance the deficit mainly from domestic sources. Although the domestic market
has sufficient liquidity to finance the deficit and also meet private sector borrowing needs,
some institutional investors are approaching their limits for government securities. The
authorities have therefore commenced a process to issue an international sovereign bond, and
intend to use a significant proportion of the proceeds to buy back securities and reposition the
debt portfolio. The government recognizes the importance of announcing the detail of its
fiscal strategy ahead of the bond issuance. In the coming weeks, the authorities will provide
further detail of the immediate fiscal adjustments by way of a supplementary 2015 budget.
These fiscal adjustments will assist in reducing financing pressures and interest costs
generally. The authorities have recently published the 2016 Budget Strategy, which lays out
the medium-term plans for fiscal consolidation, while ensuring the pace of this consolidation
is sensitive to the impact on growth and employment. This strategy aims to prioritize and
improve the quality of expenditure while broadening the tax base, with the immediate aim of
stabilizing public debt at 35 percent of GDP. Looking ahead, the authorities aim to return to a
balanced budget and bring debt to GDP back to 30 percent by 2020. The authorities are
considering the role the non-resource primary balance could play in anchoring fiscal policy
and look forward to further discussions with staff on this approach. The authorities have also

3
expressed interest in IMF technical assistance to review and update the existing medium-term
debt strategy to provide a sound framework for debt management and future debt financing.
The comprehensive tax review will provide options to modernize PNG’s revenue system
with the aim of improving the efficiency and competitiveness of the PNG economy. The
authorities commissioned the tax review in late-2013 as an important part of the medium
term fiscal strategy. As the tax review comes to its conclusion, it will present options on
securing a broader, more efficient and more stable revenue base, including on how best to
leverage revenues from the resources sector, that will sustainably support PNG’s
development objectives. The authorities appreciate the IMF technical assistance received
throughout the review process and look forward to further support when considering the
implementation of these significant tax reforms.
The authorities are strengthening public financial management (PFM) to improve the
quality of cash management and effectiveness of spending. The recent Public Expenditure
and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment made several significant recommendations
to improve cash management, including the overnight reconciliation of cash from a wide
variety of sources into a single public account and the greater use of electronic funds transfer.
The PFM roadmap that resulted from the PEFA assessment highlights improved cash
management among the key reforms to be implemented. The authorities are also committed
to improving the quality of expenditure and improving the rate of project execution. PNG’s
‘Vision 2050’ document highlights the focus on a new service delivery model to ensure that
spending yields tangible development outcomes. The authorities continue to embed a multiyear budgeting framework, along with sector-led budgeting that gives priority to projects and
activities with demonstrated outputs, outcomes and impacts.
The authorities are establishing a new Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) to better manage
the revenues from PNG’s considerable endowment of non-renewable resources.
Drawing on past IMF advice, the authorities have developed legislation for the SWF, which
was passed by Parliament in July 2015. As noted in the staff report, the authorities remain
committed to operating the SWF consistent with the Santiago Principles, so as to properly
manage the macroeconomic impacts of volatile resource revenues and to ensure this
endowment is safeguarded to meet PNG’s development objectives. A stabilization fund will
help protect the economy from the volatility associated with commodity cycles, while
providing a reliable source of revenues to the budget for social and development spending. A
savings fund will invest the real value of extracted mineral and petroleum resources overseas
to help with macroeconomic management and seek the best returns for future generations.
All investments will be managed by an independent and qualified board.
MONETARY POLICY AND EXCHANGE RATE
Inflation is contained and monetary policy remains neutral for the time being. Headline
inflation is projected to be around 6 percent for 2015. Inflationary pressures are expected to

4
remain in check due to the lower growth outlook for the domestic economy, lower foreign
inflation from PNG’s major trading partners, and a low pass-through of kina depreciation to
domestic prices. The BPNG continues to maintain a neutral monetary policy stance, though it
stands ready to absorb excess liquidity and tighten monetary policy should inflationary
pressures emerge.
Consistent with market forces, the kina has depreciated by over 16 percent relative to
the US dollar in the last year. As a result of lower international prices for PNG’s key export
commodities, the supply of foreign currency has been lower than demand, which has
contributed to the depreciation of the kina. The authorities consider that the exchange rate
continues to be market determined, though structural issues in the market have been
responsible for the persistent excess demand for foreign currency. Consistent with its
mandate, the BPNG has been intervening to meet some of the excess demand in the foreign
exchange market and to avoid any undue delay in meeting import orders. While staff has
suggested that a faster depreciation would be desirable, the authorities note that structural
issues associated with PNG’s commodity-export oriented economy mean that this may not
necessarily stimulate the necessary supply to smoothly clear the market. In addition, past
experience has shown that this can exert inflationary pressures, as PNG is heavily reliant on
imports. At the same time, the authorities also emphasize the need to avoid excessive
volatility in the exchange rate. Nevertheless, the authorities are exploring options to improve
the operation of the foreign exchange market, and have requested further technical assistance.
The authorities are committed to ensuring that international reserves are adequate and
do not fall below current levels. By the end of 2015, the level of international reserves is
projected to be close to USD 2 billion, which staff estimates would provide import coverage
for 3.1 months.1 The decline in reserves over recent years mainly reflects lower foreign direct
investment since the completion of the LNG project construction, while foreign exchange
outflows have increased due to a rise in import demand. Looking ahead, the proceeds from
the planned sovereign bond issuance and the anticipated sale of the PNG government’s
equity in the LNG project to local governments and landowners would be expected to
increase holdings of international reserves.
FINANCIAL SECTOR AND STRUCTURAL REFORMS
PNG’s financial sector is sound, with ongoing efforts to promote financial development
and increase access to finance. The financial sector is robust, with commercial banks
maintaining strong balance sheets and the number of non-performing loans remaining low.
The authorities recognize the need to promote further financial sector development to
facilitate better access to finance and support greater diversity in the economy. PNG has
1

BPNG measures this as sufficient to cover 7.9 months of total imports and 15.6 months of non-mineral
imports (excluding non-factor services and on the basis of 2015 figures).

5
made considerable progress in broadening access to financial services through the use of
mobile banking, though the authorities recognize that access to branches and ATMs remains
difficult for significant parts of the population, including the high proportion of citizens that
live in rural areas. The BPNG has been promoting an ambitious strategy to enhance financial
inclusion and literacy, which within two years has brought over half a million people into the
banking system for the first time, with nearly a third of these being women. The authorities
have also made progress implementing AML/CFT legislation, which is expected to facilitate
removal from the Financial Action Task Force’s gray list.
The authorities are committed to inclusive growth policies and investments in nonresource sectors that will support sustainable and broader-based growth in the medium
to long-term. In particular, the authorities are committed to supporting the development of a
more vibrant agricultural sector, given that a majority of the population relies on this sector.
Public investments in roads and increased access to finance will help to create opportunities
for a more dynamic and productive agricultural sector. Likewise, the authorities are investing
in the considerable potential of other sustainable sectors including forestry, fisheries, and
tourism. The Competition Review and the Financial Sector Services Review are currently
underway and will help identify areas for future reform. These reforms together with ongoing
transparency and governance reforms, enhanced secured lending arrangements and efforts to
reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens will also help improve the business environment,
including for SMEs. PNG’s participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative
will also contribute to an improved investment climate. Governance reforms will promote
greater efficiency and improved management of state-owned enterprises.
