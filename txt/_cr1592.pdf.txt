STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
March 11, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context. The economy is recovering steadily helped by supportive macroeconomic
policies and improved market sentiment. There has been a welcome decline in
vulnerabilities but debt levels remain elevated, leaving the economy prone to shocks,
and medium-term growth prospects appear subdued. The government took steps to
address these challenges, but the overall strategy relies on measures that increase the
role of the state in the economy and shift the burden of the adjustment to specific
sectors. This may deter private domestic and foreign direct investment.
Policy recommendations. Policies should aim at further reducing vulnerabilities and
comprehensively tackling impediments to strong, private sector-led growth.


Fiscal policy. Adopt a growth-friendly fiscal consolidation strategy to rebuild room
for policy maneuver and sustainably reduce the public debt ratio. The strategy
should rely on durable expenditure retrenchment, improved efficiency of spending,
and a simplification of the tax system, including a gradual elimination of
distortionary sectoral taxes.



Monetary policy. Monetary policy needs to guard against building disinflationary
pressures. Adequate reserves are necessary to support financial stability.



Financial sector. Strengthen efforts (and follow up on recently-announced
commitments) to repair financial intermediation by improving the operating
environment for banks. Steps should include facilitating faster cleanup of bank
portfolios and reducing the tax burden on banks. The Funding for Growth Scheme
should remain targeted and time bound; while the role of the state in the banking
sector should be contained.



Structural reforms. Increase policy predictability and reduce state interference in
the economy to help strengthen confidence and support private investment. Adopt
policies to enhance labor participation, particularly among women and older
workers; improve the business environment; and enhance competitiveness.

Discussions took place in Budapest during January 21–30, 2015.
The staff team comprised Messrs. Christou (Head) and Klein,
Mses. El-Ganainy (all EUR), Jenkner (FAD), and Sanya (SPR); and was
joined by Mr. Roaf (senior regional resident representative, EUR) for a
few days. Mr. Benk (OED) attended most meetings. Ms. Samuel and
Mr. Scutaru (both EUR) assisted in the preparation of the staff report.
The staff team met with State Secretaries of the Ministry for National
Economy Orban and Banai, State Secretary for Energy Affairs of the
Ministry for National Development Aradszki, Central Bank of Hungary
(MNB) Deputy Governor Balog, other senior officials, and
representatives from the private sector and think tanks. A workshop
was held in Budapest during the mission jointly with the MNB and the
Ministry for National Economy to discuss background papers
prepared by staff (included in the Selected Issues Paper (SIP)
accompanying this report) and the authorities. Hungary is an Article
VIII country (Informational Annex: Fund Relations). Data provision is
adequate for surveillance (Informational Annex: Statistical Issues).

Economic recovery has gained momentum and vulnerabilities have declined, but
underlying weaknesses continue to weigh on Hungary’s growth potential. Expansionary

continued recovery and stronger medium-term growth prospects, while reducing vulnerabilities.

2.
The role of state in the economy has been increasing. The government acquired energy
companies and foreign bank subsidiaries, increased the scope of sectoral taxes, and boosted
disposable incomes by expanding public works, cutting administered utility prices, and introducing
the Settlement Act, which required banks to compensate borrowers for deemed unfair lending
practices (Appendix I). In contrast, the government welcomes FDI in manufacturing, where it sees
significant benefits to the Hungarian economy. Recently, it committed to improve the operating
environment of banks.

Inflation continued its precipitous fall. In the face of a negative output gap, administered
price cuts, and a drop in import prices, headline and core inflation decelerated sharply, to -1 and
1 percent, respectively, in February. Inflation expectations continued to drop to 2.2 percent, below
the National Bank of Hungary’s (MNB) 3 percent inflation target.
5.
Unemployment declined sharply, but appreciable slack remains. The unemployment rate
stood at 7.2 percent in 2014:Q4, reflecting the expansion

declined moderately. Preliminary estimates suggest
that the deficit reached 2.6 percent of GDP against the 2.9 percent target, as revenues were
propelled by accelerating economic activity and tax administration improvements. However, this
performance masks a strong pro-cyclical increase in spending, especially on wages, and goods and
services, and the fiscal impulse is estimated at 1⅓ percent of GDP. The public debt-to-GDP ratio
declined moderately to just below 77 percent.

Monetary conditions remain accommodative. In the absence of inflationary pressures,
and in the face of a negative output gap and improved risk premia, MNB kept its policy rate at a
record low 2.1 percent since July 2014 and signaled its intent to maintain an accommodative
monetary stance for an extended period. Meanwhile, forward rate agreements are pricing a 30 bps
policy rate cut in the next 12 months. In October 2014, MNB also decided to double the allocation
for the second phase of the Funding for Growth Scheme (FGS) to the equivalent of 3¼ percent of
GDP and extended the program to end-2015.

Bank, and has announced the acquisition of a 15 percent stake in Erste’s subsidiary.
9.
Despite a reduction in vulnerabilities, external stability concerns remain. Large and
persistent current account surpluses, reflecting in part elevated savings to accelerate deleveraging,
together with sharp cross-border deleveraging have contributed to a significant decline in external
debt to 116 percent of GDP in 2014. However, gross external financing needs of 21 percent of GDP
in 2015, about 30 percent of GDP open FX position on private balance sheets, an international
investment position of -76 percent of GDP, and heavy reliance on non-resident funding of public
debt, raise external stability concerns. Going forward, the decision in November 2014 to convert the
FX mortgage stock (25 percent of household loans, almost all denominated in Swiss francs) to local
currency loans will result in a reduction in bank foreign liabilities and lower (but still adequate)
official reserves (Appendix I).
10.
The real exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals, but non-price indicators
suggest that Hungary faces competitiveness challenges. While the EBA methodology yields
mixed results with a negative current account norm, the need to improve Hungary’s external balance

the business and regulatory environment reducing

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
11.
Staff expects growth to decelerate to 2¾ percent in 2015, on account of a smaller
domestic-demand impetus due to less supportive fiscal stance and lower investment growth—given
the projected decline in EU funds. Private consumption is expected to continue to grow, reflecting
lower household indebtedness, accommodative monetary conditions, and higher employment. Over
the medium term, output growth is set to stabilize at around 2 percent. Domestic demand is
expected to recover only modestly, due to the ongoing deleveraging and tight credit conditions as
time will be necessary for banks to strengthen their balance sheets. Improved terms-of-trade, thanks
notably to lower oil prices, are forecast to lead to a higher current account surplus in the short run—
which, coupled with continued cross-border bank deleveraging would further improve the IIP. Over
the medium term, the current account surplus is expected to gradually decline, owing to a
6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HUNGARY

slowdown in deleveraging and aging population dynamics. Headline inflation is projected to remain
very low in the coming months on account of a still negative, albeit closing, output gap and lower
import prices. Provided monetary policy anchors inflation expectations, inflation will gradually return
to target.
12.
While there are upside risks to the baseline, the balance of risks—highlighted in the
Risk Assessment Matrix—is somewhat tilted to the downside. An abrupt change in risk
perception, e.g., from re-emergence of sovereign stress in Europe, further escalation of geopolitical
tensions in the region, or financial stress in emerging markets, could lead to capital outflows with
adverse effects on government financing and private balance sheets. A protracted period of weak
external demand, notably from the euro area, would also weigh on exports. On the domestic front,
continued state interference in the economy could have adverse confidence effects, further eroding
competitiveness, and foster sharper cross-border deleveraging. On the upside, the Settlement Act
and sustained lower oil prices could provide a higher-than-expected boost to purchasing power and
investment, while the government’s commitment to improve the operating environment of banks
could support a fast repair of financial intermediation and higher credit growth.
13.
The authorities broadly agreed on the near-term outlook and the balance of risks, but
were more optimistic about Hungary’s medium-term growth prospects. They shared staff’s
view that GDP growth would decelerate somewhat this year but were more upbeat about Hungary’s
medium-term growth potential arguing that the economy’s sustained improvement in fundamentals
has contributed to increased confidence—as evidenced by the historically low sovereign CDS
spreads. Regarding the balance of risks, they agreed that recent banking legislation and lower
import prices could boost consumption and investment more than expected, but concurred that
deterioration in the external environment represented a key downside risk. Nevertheless, they
argued that the risk of capital outflows is low given the increased share of institutional investors and
the continued shift to domestic financing of the government, while the vulnerability of balance
sheets to exchange rate risk declined significantly following the conversion of FX mortgages.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions focused on the need for a comprehensive strategy to support growth and a reduction
in vulnerabilities. On the macroeconomic front, staff advocated growth-friendly fiscal
consolidation with monetary policy continuing to support growth. Regarding structural policies,
staff argued for measures to revive financial intermediation, improve the investment climate, and
support greater labor force participation.

A. Fiscal Policy
14.
While welcoming the authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation, staff noted that
their current strategy falls short of reducing public debt significantly over the medium term.


The 2015 budget implies a broadly neutral fiscal stance. Staff projects the 2015 deficit at
2.7 percent of GDP—vis-à-vis a budget target of 2.4 percent—in light of sizeable unidentified
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

HUNGARY

revenue sources and less optimistic assumptions on expenditure restraint and gains from tax
administration improvements. This would imply only a moderate decline in public debt. The
expenditure-to-GDP ratio is expected to remain high, while large allocations to discretionary
programs compromise the quality of spending and inefficiencies are significant, particularly in
the health sector (Box 3). Moreover, the budget continues to rely on (and includes new) sectoral
taxes.1


Staff projects the public debt ratio to come down only modestly over the medium term. In
staff’s view, the authorities’ medium-term fiscal target (1.7 percent of GDP structural deficit) is
not ambitious and not backed by well-specified policies. For example, although the intention to
downsize the public sector is welcome, more concrete steps are needed to rein in spending and
add credence to such objectives. The authorities saw limited scope to reduce distortionary
sectoral taxes beyond the announced reduction in the bank levy over 2016–19. Based on staff’s
baseline macro scenario and current policies, the deficit would hover at around 2½ percent of
GDP and public debt, at around 72 percent, would remain a significant vulnerability
(Appendix II).

15.
Staff advocated a growth-friendly fiscal consolidation strategy aimed at reducing
debt. To this end, staff recommended a moderate annual structural fiscal tightening by about
½ percent of potential GDP starting in 2015 consistent
with a reduction in public debt to below 60 percent of
GDP by 2022. The adjustment should be anchored in a
medium-term budget framework that would
incorporate reforms aimed at enhancing the economy’s
human and physical capital, while also providing
necessary fiscal space and being mindful of equity
considerations. With expenditure close to 50 percent of
GDP, priority should be given to a sustainable
expenditure retrenchment and enhanced composition
of spending, which would also create room to gradually rationalize the tax system. Staff thus
recommended a menu of options for measures that could be adopted over 2015–20 (text table),

Proposed Adjustment

Steps to enhance the efficiency and progressivity of the tax system, including by reducing
exemptions and gradually eliminating distortionary sectoral taxes that undermine the simplicity
and predictability of tax policies, and reduce profitability with adverse consequences for private
investment and growth. In particular, streamlining of financial taxation should contribute to the
much-needed restoration of financial intermediation and a recovery in credit growth.

Special taxes are imposed on financial institutions, energy service providers, telecommunications, and retail and

16.
The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to fiscal consolidation. While they agreed
in principle with some of the fundamental weaknesses of the 2015 budget—for example, the
unidentified revenue sources—they underscored their strong commitment to adhering to their
national and European fiscal targets. They also saw scope to improve the efficiency of public
investment and spending on health and education, and argued that the impact of recent and ongoing reforms is yet to yield results. Over the medium term, they project a substantial reduction in
the fiscal deficit largely on the basis of past adjustments to the social transfer system and
discretionary spending freezes, supported by a stronger macroeconomic outlook than staff’s. Should
fiscal space materialize, they would reduce the corporate income tax, and cut the flat income tax to
lower the still-high tax wedge.
17.
Differences in views centered on the efficiency and desirability of select fiscal policy
instruments. The authorities strongly defended the public works program—which they plan to

expand and include all able-bodied welfare recipients—notwithstanding the recovery of private
employment and the scheme’s uncertain benefits with regard to helping participants re-enter the
primary job market. They also disagreed with the desirability to re-introduce some element of
progressivity in the tax system (to counter rising inequality and create fiscal space), and the need to
improve the targeting of the Job Protection Act.

B. Monetary Policy

inflation expectations.
19.
Further cautious monetary easing would help guard against persistent disinflationary
pressures. Staff recognized that, with the policy rate at a record-low level and increased utilization
of the FGS, monetary policy has been supportive, though, with inflation falling of late, the real policy
rate has increased. In light of persistent disinflationary pressures, staff saw scope for further easing,
particularly given the improved resilience of household balance sheets to exchange rate risk, and
potential pressure for capital inflows from easing monetary conditions in the euro area. The
recommended fiscal policy stance would provide further scope for monetary easing. Nevertheless, a
sharp deterioration in risk perception and capital outflows (perhaps triggered by a sudden jump of
the term premium on U.S. long-term interest rates) would require monetary tightening to preserve
financial stability. Effective communication about the future trajectory of the policy rate would be
critical to avoid adverse market reactions (see accompanying SIP).
20.
Reserves are projected to decline but remain within the Fund’s adequacy range. At
about €34½ billion, Hungary’s level of reserves is estimated at slightly below the upper limit of the
Fund’s adequacy range. Going forward, reserves are

still elevated financial risks, staff underscored the importance of maintaining adequate reserves for
safeguarding financial stability.
21.
The authorities stressed their intent to maintain accommodative monetary conditions
for an extended period. Central bank officials acknowledged that inflation dynamics in recent
months were weaker-than-expected, reflecting low imported inflation. They observed that the recent
steps by the ECB and the FX mortgage conversion provided greater room for maneuver, and noted
that further monetary easing would be considered if disinflationary pressures persist. In this regard,
they added that the recent changes in the modalities of the FGS, in which the MNB assumes part of
the credit risk are likely to increase its utilization. Finally, the authorities reiterated their commitment
to maintain sufficient reserves as a buffer against shocks.

C. Financial Sector

Repairing financial intermediation is critical for sustained growth. With strained balance
sheets, banks’ willingness to lend is projected to remain limited. Staff, therefore, called for improving
the operating environment for banks, including through removing impediments for portfolio
cleanup and reducing the tax burden. In this regard, staff welcomes the government’s recent
commitment to gradually reduce the bank levy and to refrain from steps that could harm bank
profitability. While the FGS has improved SME access to finance, there is still scope to modify the
scheme to better support monetary transmission and enhance its impact on growth, possibly by
linking the lending rate to the policy rate in a manner that adequately compensates banks for
lending to riskier SMEs. Staff repeated its call to keep the FGS limited, targeted, and time bound.

Absent efforts to accelerate the cleanup of bank portfolios, NPLs are projected to
remain elevated for a protracted period, undermining lending activity. Staff underscored the

operations fully independent and transparent to
avoid a potential conflict with MNB’s price and stability objectives. In line with the recommendations
of the recent MCM technical assistance mission, the MARK should be given an exclusive objective of
maximizing the value of purchased assets while ensuring that the transfer of assets be done on a
voluntary basis, based on a clear and consistent set of valuation criteria. This would help limit MNB’s
exposure and a potential build up of contingent liabilities.
25.
The authorities’ recent measures are likely to improve private sector balance sheets
and could help re-invigorate credit growth, but staff cautioned against an increasing role of
the state in the banking system. The FX mortgage conversion and MARK initiative will reduce
private sector vulnerabilities and help banks repair their balance sheets faster, thus supporting
investment and growth. However, announcements in favor of banking system consolidation,
together with state purchases of banks, have increased uncertainty regarding the future landscape
of the banking system, notwithstanding the government’s stated intention to divest bank stakes
within three years. Staff stressed that lending activity should be based on adequate riskmanagement practices, and recommended to limit the state’s role in the banking system, also
arguing that, with limited fiscal space, there is no room to build up further contingent liabilities.
26.
A strong regulatory and supervisory framework is essential for safeguarding financial
stability. The integration of the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority into the MNB in 2013
equipped it with micro-prudential instruments and re-enforced its macro-prudential tool kit. Staff
welcomed the authorities’ commitment to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory framework,
including through the recent adoption of a new macro-prudential regulation (that introduces more
stringent LTV and PTI ratios, especially for FX loans) to prevent excessive household indebtedness.
27.
The authorities were optimistic that recent policy measures will help stimulate credit.
They argued that the Settlement and Fair Banking Acts will help boost households’ demand for
credit, while the extension of the FGS will continue to support lending to SMEs. They acknowledged
that the high level of NPLs continues to weigh on banks’ balance sheets and constrains new lending,
but noted that they are working closely with the EBRD to identify ways to expedite NPL resolution.
They also argued that the MARK is likely to induce more dynamic portfolio cleaning. The authorities
12

stressed that the consolidation in the banking sector is warranted to foster competition and improve
efficiency through economies of scale. They view the government’s increased role in the banking
system as a necessary, but transitory, vehicle, to facilitate the consolidation and restructuring of
bank balance sheets.

weighs on growth (Box 5).

29.
Staff called for an ambitious structural reform agenda to remove impediments to
growth. Such an agenda should focus on:


Improving the business climate. This would entail increasing policy predictability and
transparency, strengthening anti-corruption efforts, reducing the regulatory burden, gradually
eliminating distortionary sectoral taxes, and enhancing the ease of paying taxes. Staff cautioned
against the government’s interventionist strategy, arguing that it could weigh on private
investment and growth.



Enhancing competitiveness. Given the importance of non-price factors in addressing Hungary’s
competitiveness challenges, staff underscored the need to move-up the value chain, increase
export diversification, and improve productivity in the labor and services markets. Focus should
be on strengthening R&D, alleviating SME-internationalization impediments (see accompanying
SIP), and restructuring loss-making transport SOEs.



Addressing structural weaknesses in the labor market. Measures should aim at strengthening
incentives for women to enter the labor market, including by reforming parental benefits, reshuffling spending on family benefits to also provide affordable child care, phasing out the early
retirement scheme for women, and reducing the gender wage gap (see accompanying SIP).
Equally important would be to upgrade labor skills and reduce skill mismatches to enhance
productivity, including by strengthening the training component of active labor market
programs.

30.
The authorities were optimistic that recent policy measures would help improve
Hungary’s growth prospects. They assessed medium-term potential growth at 2½ percent, owing
to higher investment—due to increased EU fund utilization, and more favorable financing conditions
for SMEs—and increased labor participation on the back of on-going labor market reforms.
Moreover, they saw scope for moving up the value chain by focusing on innovation and for better
integrating SMEs into the supply chain. On-going efforts to diversify export destinations and the
increase in the production capacity in the automobile industry would help boost Hungary’s export
performance. Nevertheless, they agreed on the need to improve the level and predictability of
taxation, insolvency procedures, and access to finance. Finally, they argued that their strategy in the
energy sector, that includes the creation of a state-owned utility company and acquisition of energy
companies, is aimed at securing and diversifying energy supply, which is critical for enhancing
Hungary’s competitiveness.

STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
The Hungarian economy is growing at a strong pace and there has been a welcome
reduction in vulnerabilities. The strong economic upturn is driven by a pickup in domestic
demand on the back of expansionary macroeconomic policies. Meanwhile, vulnerabilities continued
to decline thanks to large and persistent current account surpluses, recent policy measures, and
improved market sentiment.
32.
However, vulnerabilities are still elevated and medium-term growth prospects appear
subdued. External and public debt levels remain high and the associated financing needs together
with heavy reliance on nonresident financing, large concentration of the investor base, and the
economy’s large open FX position continue to pose risks. Hungary’s subdued medium-term growth
prospects further exacerbate these vulnerabilities. At the same time, the state’s increased role in the
economy along with sectoral taxes weaken the business environment, while state acquisitions in the
banking and energy sectors contribute to the buildup of contingent liabilities.
33.
A comprehensive strategy is needed to further reduce vulnerabilities and boost
growth. Emphasis should be given to growth-friendly fiscal consolidation, revival of financial
intermediation, and reforms aimed at addressing structural impediments to growth, strengthening
institutions, and increasing policy predictability. Implementation of such a strategy, along with
reduced state interference in the economy, would help support strong, private sector-led growth
and foster a further reduction in risk premia.
34.
A key priority is to put the public debt ratio firmly on a downward path while
supporting growth. The authorities’ commitment to fiscal discipline is welcome, but, going forward,
more ambitious efforts are needed to make a significant dent in the high public debt ratio. Such
efforts should be backed by a clear and credible strategy encompassing growth-friendly fiscal
reforms, including enhancing the efficiency of the tax system and public spending, tackling VAT
fraud, improving the targeting of social benefits, and scaling down inefficient programs. These
reforms can help enhance the economy’s human and physical capital.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HUNGARY

35.
Further cautious monetary policy easing would help guard against disinflationary
pressures. Monetary conditions have appropriately supported the recovery of domestic demand.
However, persistent disinflationary pressures and further moderation in inflation expectations call for
a further cautious easing of monetary policy. The reduced exposure of household balance sheets to
exchange rate risk and weak euro area conditions support a move in this direction. However, the
central bank should stand ready to tighten if external conditions deteriorate sharply. Maintaining an
adequate level of international reserves is necessary to mitigate excessive exchange rate volatility
and support financial stability.
36.
There is a need to repair financial intermediation. Improving the operating environment
for banks, including through removing impediments for portfolio cleanup, reducing the tax burden,
and enhancing policy predictability would support lending activity. Recent government
pronouncements in this regard are welcome and need to be followed by concrete policy actions.
Moreover, removing regulatory, legal, and tax impediments to NPL resolution, mitigating potential
institutional and financial operational risks associated with the Asset Management Company,
alongside a prompt introduction of a personal insolvency framework, are essential. At the same
time, lending activity should be based on adequate risk-management practices, and the role of the
state in the banking sector be contained. While lending under the FGS has helped improve credit
conditions for SMEs, further refinement of the scheme’s modalities would help enhance its impact
on growth, while avoiding risk to the central bank. The scheme should remain targeted, time-bound
and limited to SMEs.
37.
An ambitious reform agenda is key to lifting Hungary’s growth potential. Sustained
progress on wide-ranging structural reforms aimed at improving the business climate, enhancing
competitiveness, and reforming the labor market is essential for higher investment and strong,
private sector-led growth. Priority should be given to promoting entrepreneurship and innovation,
reducing the regulatory and tax burden, alleviating impediments to SME internationalization, and
boosting productivity in the services sectors. Reforms of the labor market should aim at increasing
labor participation, particularly among women and older workers, while greater emphasis should be
placed on mitigating skill mismatches.
38.
It is recommended to hold the next Article IV consultation on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Box 1. Response to Past Fund Policy Advice
The authorities have actively engaged in a policy dialogue with the Fund, but some policies deviated from
previous IMF advice.
Key recommendations

Implemented policies

Implement a durable, growth-friendly fiscal
adjustment to sustainably reduce the public
debt-to-GDP ratio.

The 2014 fiscal deficit came in below target, but the
budget composition remains a concern, as the scope
of sectoral taxes and allocations to discretionary
programs increased. The public debt ratio remained
unchanged.

Reduce external vulnerabilities.

The FX mortgage conversion has significantly
reduced household exposure to exchange rate risk.
Steps have been taken to reduce reliance on FXdenominated public debt.

Improve the operating environment for banks—
including by reducing the tax burden and
facilitating a faster balance sheet cleanup—to
help repair financial intermediation. Improve the
effectiveness of the FGS.

Bank portfolio cleaning remains sluggish and the tax
burden on banks is high. An asset management
company was set up to facilitate cleanup of bank
balance sheets and, government recently announced
its commitment to gradually reduce bank taxes. The
FGS was extended to end-2015, and was expanded
to include riskier companies with the MNB assuming
half of the credit risk.

Address weaknesses in the labor market,
promote competition in product markets,
restructure loss-making state-owned enterprises
(SOEs), and improve the business climate,
including by limiting the state’s role in the
economy.

Flexible child-care benefits and compulsory early
childhood education were introduced to boost
female labor participation. The role of the state in the
economy increased, including through acquisitions of
banks and energy companies, while reforms in other
areas were largely stalled.

Box 2. External Sustainability and Competitiveness
Staff’s assessment is that the real exchange rate is broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals.
EBA estimates have low explanatory power and yield mixed results for Hungary. Specifically, the Real
Effective Exchange Rate (REER) approach reveals an overvaluation of the exchange rate by 15 percent, and
the External Sustainability approach finds the REER undervalued by 12 percent. Moreover, the Current
Account Balance approach suggests that Hungary’s REER appears to be undervalued. However, in staff’s
view, although this approach is based on various fundamentals, it does not adequately capture the need for
savings to remain elevated to help reduce Hungary’s still-large external liabilities. Thus, the current-account
norm would need to be adjusted upward consistent with the need to strengthen Hungary’s balance sheet.
Other price indicators, such as unit labor costs, do not point to price pressure on exchange rates.
Non-price factors have undermined Hungary’s competitiveness. Since 2008, Hungary’s export market

Box 3. Efficiency of Public Spending on Health and Education
Hungary’s public spending on health and education is not high by international standards and related
outcomes lag behind (Figure 1). Public spending on health and education amounted to 5 percent (2012)
and 4½ percent of GDP (2011), respectively, below the OECD average. At the same time, Hungary
underperforms in terms of outcomes: life expectancy and infant mortality, while showing significant
improvement recently, remain below the OECD average, and educational outcomes—as measured by
Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) performance—are low compared to the OECD average,
and have deteriorated recently.1

Life Expectancy: Efficiency Score

In the health sector, there is scope for efficiency gains of up to 2¾ percentage points of GDP over the
medium-term. Data envelopment analysis suggests that efficiency has improved over time, but, at 0.45
(compared to 1 for an ‘efficient/frontier’ country), it is below the average OECD efficiency score (of 0.57),
including that of countries with similar level of per capita

Efficiency Scores

In the education sector, there is scope for further efficiency gains, but focus should be on improving
outcomes and access to education. Efficiency of public spending on education has improved over the past
decade, and at 0.90, Hungary’s efficiency score is above the OECD

Box 4. Gender Gaps in the Labor Market
Female labor market participation (FLMP) in
Hungary is very low. It is below EU and OECD
averages, and also lags rates in peer countries in the
region. In particular, employment of mothers with
children under 2 (at 10 percent in 2008) is the lowest in
the OECD.
Increasing FLMP is an economic imperative for
shoring up long-term growth. In many advanced and
emerging economies, population ageing and low
fertility rates are compressing the size of active labor
forces. This issue is also acute in Hungary. Taking into
account current trends, Hungary’s labor force will
shrink by around 10 percent by 2030. Increasing low
FLMP will be necessary to help offset these adverse
trends and boost long-term growth. The OECD
estimates that full convergence in participation rates
by 2030 can increase annual per capita growth rates
in Hungary by 0.6 percent, on average.

A number of factors affect FLMP in Hungary.
Parental leave policies and cultural pressures are
tilted towards mothers of young children staying at

Convergence in rates
Convergence in intencity
home. This is reinforced by a shortage of affordable
child care options. Older women are forced to care for elderly relatives in light of limited availability of longterm care; and—in contrast to efforts to roll back early retirement schemes and encourage participation—a
new early retirement program for women was established in 2011. On the labor market, the wage gap
between men and women has been growing; and tax policies result in higher marginal tax rates for second
earners.
The impact of recent activation policies has been uneven. The overall female labor force participation
rate (FLFPR) increased by 2.8 pp during 2008-13, to 50.6 percent in 2013. A decomposition of this increase
by education groups and controlling for “passive”

measures such as tightened access to benefits and

the other end of the spectrum, a much larger share of working-age women now hold tertiary degrees. While
this shift in itself is pushing up the aggregate FLFPR, controlling for its impact shows that women with
tertiary education actually decreased their participation. This calls into question the efficacy of activation
policies aimed at higher income groups, including tax incentives and attempts at making parental leave
policies more flexible.

Box 5. Internationalization of Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs)
SMEs remain an important driver for Hungary’s economic
activity and employment creation. However, since the
outset of the crisis, their performance has been particularly
weak and below that of the EU average, reflecting a host of
factors, including limited access to credit for riskier SMEs,
sharp deleveraging, and a deteriorating business
environment. The low level of Hungarian SME
internationalization, which is below the EU average, together
with the collapse of domestic demand in 2009 and the weak
recovery thereafter also played an important role.
SME internationalization in Hungary is generally low. The
EC’s 2014 Small Business Factsheet, shows that apart from the
cost required to export/import, Hungary scores well below the
EU’s average in all internationalization criteria. The share of
SMEs exporting and importing outside the EU is significantly
below the EU average, and the bureaucracy––the time and
number of documents required to export/import––is poorer
than the EU average.

larger firms with high share of fixed tangible assets are more
likely to increase internationalization, and higher labor productivity, more favorable liquidity position, and
higher leverage are associated with higher internationalization, though the positive effect of the leverage
ratio disappears when its level is “excessive”.
Policies could help alleviate barriers to internationalization. There is a need to develop stronger
infrastructure to improve SMEs’ exporting capacity, including by simplifying pertinent procedures, and help
SMEs obtain greater information about foreign markets. Additionally, promoting innovation and reducing
skill mismatches could enhance factor productivity, and facilitate faster penetration to foreign markets. Such
policies can be complemented by efforts to foster higher degree of cooperation between SMEs and large
multi-national companies so as to facilitate positive spillovers, through knowledge and technology transfer.
Greater SME access to finance is equally important. It is critical to repair financial intermediation by
creating a better operating environment for banks through a reduction in their tax burden and accelerated
portfolio cleanup. Finally, there is a need to develop an infrastructure for non-bank financing, including by
increasing the availability of venture capital.

Appendix I. Recent Legislation Affecting Household Debt
Settlement Act. This Act (adopted in September 2014), stipulates that banks and leasing companies
should compensate borrowers for past unilateral contract modification and for the use of bid-ask
spreads in calculating FX loan disbursements and repayments. It applies to all loans disbursed after
May 1, 2004 and not terminated before July 26, 2009. MNB estimates the impact of this Act at
HUF900–1000 billion (3–3¼ percent of GDP), of which HUF800 billion will be incurred by banks and
non-resident credit institutions. The net effect on banks, however, will be somewhat smaller because
of previous loan-loss provisioning. The compensation will take the form of a principle reduction of
ongoing contracts, and a cash transfer to borrowers with expired contracts.1 The compensation
deadline is end-March 2015.
Fair Banking Act. This Act (adopted in November 2014), restricts unilateral interest rate and cost
hikes by banks, regulates the information provided to borrowers, and allows borrowers to terminate
a loan contract under certain conditions. The interest rate could change only in line with the
reference rate, without any change in the interest margin for loans based on a floating rate with less
than three-year maturity. For loans with longer maturity, the Act allows hikes both in the reference
rate and the interest rate margin. Banks will, however, need to fix the margin hike at least three years
in advance.
FX mortgage conversion. In early November 2014, the MNB and the Bank Association agreed on a
fast and orderly conversion of FX mortgage loans to local currency in order to reduce the exposure
of household balance sheet to exchange rate risk. To avoid strong pressure on the exchange rate,
the MNB used its reserves to allocate to the banks about € 9 billion to help them close their open FX
position that emerged from the conversion through euro sale instruments at the spot exchange rate
at day of the agreement (November 7). The scheme has been designed to ensure it does not
jeopardize the MNB’s reserve adequacy given that the amount of foreign currency made available
will reduce short-term external debt and consequently the MNB’s foreign exchange reserve needs.
Furthermore, the amount will be provided gradually over 2015–17 according to maturity of banks’
foreign liabilities. On conversion, households had the option to transfer their HUF mortgage to
another bank. The new loans were pegged to the 3-month interbank rate, with interest rate margins
not exceeding those in the original FX loans.

__________________
1

The Settlement Act would result in a 16 percent decline, on average, in the indebtedness of FX mortgage borrowers.

Together with the Fair Banking Act, monthly installments of FX mortgages would decline by 20–25 percent.

Appendix II. Hungary: Debt Sustainability Analysis
Hungary’s high public and external debt and financing needs, together with heavy reliance on nonresident funding, remain important sources of vulnerability. Under the baseline scenario, public debt
is projected to remain at around 72percent of GDP while gross financing needs are forecast to hover
above 20 percent of GDP. This exposes Hungary’s public debt to considerable risks, particularly from
lower GDP growth. External debt is expected to continue to decline, with all sectors except for the
government continuing to make net repayments. The projected downward path is sensitive mainly
to exchange rate and current account shocks.
Under current policies, public debt is projected to diminish only marginally, to about
72 percent of GDP over the medium term. This scenario is underpinned by a net
lending/borrowing balance around 2½percent of GDP; interest rates on sovereign bonds and loans
gradually increasing in line with global WEO assumptions; and medium-term output growth of
about 2 percent. The scenario assumes that financial markets remain accessible and there are no
significant interest rate spikes, with sovereign and maturity spreads remaining at near 2014 levels.
The baseline scenario is subject to considerable risks which, if materialized, would likely set
public debt on an increasing trajectory. With public debt well above 70 percent of GDP, negative
shocks, even of a relatively small size, may trigger adverse reactions from financial markets,
especially considering that annual gross financing needs are hovering above 20 percent of GDP with
large reliance on non-resident financing (around 35 percent). Possible shocks include exchange rate
depreciation pressure, an increase in sovereign spreads through contagion effects from other
emerging economies, reduced appetite by international investors, and an increase in global interest
rates in line with U.S. monetary policy normalization. On the domestic front, possible shocks to the
primary fiscal balance include public wage pressures, large allocations to projects in the investment
fund, and pressures in sectors with increased public sector ownership. On the revenue side, risks are
driven by unidentified revenue sources and underlying vulnerabilities such as large-spread VAT
fraud and evasion of social contribution payments. Debt and gross financing needs also remain
vulnerable to a sudden realization of contingent liabilities. While contingent liabilities are not a
principal vulnerability at this stage, fiscal risks have been rising along with the expansion of quasifiscal activities.
Based on historical volatility, probabilistic analysis of debt dynamics indicates that public
debt could enter an increasing trajectory with a probability of 50 percent. Moreover, assuming
that policy rigidities do not allow improving the primary balance by more than 2 percent of GDP in a
single year, the probability that public debt enters an increasing trajectory increases to
approximately 60 percent. This constraint is driven by the already high tax burden that leaves
virtually no room for significant revenue-raising measures, and also by the fact that expenditurebased consolidations typically take more time to design and implement.
Hungary’s external debt has declined in recent years but remains high. Gross external debt has
declined from its peak of about 150 percent of GDP in 2009 to 116 percent by end-2014. The
improvement mainly reflects heavy bank deleveraging that began during the global financial crisis,
42

although this was partly offset by higher external government debt. Intra-company loans related to
FDI remain broadly stable, amounting to about 15 percent of gross debt throughout this period.
Going forward, external debt is expected to continue to decline, with all sectors except for the
government continuing to make net repayments. The FX conversion and the government’s self
financing program (to reduce purchases of HUF-denominated securities by nonresidents) are
expected to keep external debt on a declining path over the medium term.
External debt remains sustainable under a range of shocks. Staff analysis shows that external
debt is particularly vulnerable to exchange rate and current account shocks, and to a lesser extent,
to growth and interest rate shocks. A one-time real depreciation of 30 percent would add
15 percentage points of GDP to external debt. An adverse permanent growth or current account
shock of ½ standard deviation of their historical variation would add about 8 to 15 percentage
points of GDP to external debt, respectively.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes. Large residuals in 2014 and 2016 are related to Eurobond payment (2014) and the Fx conversion scheme of banks over the period 2015-17 that would have the largest impact on
reserves in 2016.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

Current Status of Safeguards Assessment:
The safeguards assessment of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) was finalized on January 28, 2009.
The assessment found that the central bank had a relatively strong safeguards framework in place.
The MNB’s control environment was well established, and the audit and financial reporting practices
adhered to international standards. The assessment recommended measures to improve the process
of program data reporting to the Fund and to strengthen audit oversight, especially over the central
bank’s basic tasks. In recent years the central bank law was subject to numerous changes. Going
forward, it is critical to avoid undue changes to the MNB’s legal framework and to ensure that the
law continues to support MNB’s operational and legal independence.

Exchange Rate Arrangements:
The Hungarian forint is classified as floating, effective November 1, 2008. Hungary has accepted the
obligations of Article VIII and maintains an exchange rate system free of restrictions on the making
of payments and transfers on current international transactions except for those maintained solely
for the preservation of national or international security and that have been notified to the Fund
pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51). Effective February 27, 2012, the MNB
discontinued the program of foreign exchange sale tenders, which involved multiple exchange rates

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance


General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.



Government Finance Statistics: Data reporting on fiscal accounting needs to be improved
further. The monthly cash-basis accounts of the central government prepared by the Ministry of
National Economy do not reflect the GFS presentation and provide no information on financing.
This complicates staff’s ability to analyze trends and to appropriately anticipate the impact on
general government accounts. Data on revenue and expenditure arrears has been readily
provided by the authorities upon request, but provision of this data on an automatic basis would
facilitate the monitoring of obligations on an accrual basis. Similarly, automatic provision of local
government revenues and expenditures, as well as of financial statements of state-owned
enterprises (an important source of contingent liabilities), would allow for closer regular
monitoring of the general government.

Data Standards and Quality


Subscriber to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since May, 1996.



Hungary published its original ROSC Data Module in 2001 and updates are available on the IMF
internet web site. The latest update is Hungary: Report on the Observance of Standards and
Codes—Data Module, 2004 Update (July 2004).

Statement by the Staff Representative on Hungary
Executive Board Meeting
March 27, 2015
1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the
issuance of the Staff Report on March 13, 2015. This information does not alter the thrust
of the staff appraisal.
2.
On March 24, the Monetary Council lowered the policy rate. On the back of
continued disinflationary pressures and as recommended by staff, the Council reduced its
policy rate by 15 basis points from 2.10 percent to 1.95 percent. This cut was slightly smaller
than market expectations for a 20 basis points cut. In its communication following the
meeting, the Council noted that cautious easing of monetary conditions may continue as long
as it supports the achievement of the medium-term inflation target.
3.
At the same time, the Monetary Council confirmed its 3 percent inflation target
and introduced a ±1 percent ex-ante band around it. The introduction of the band is a
change from the previous framework whereby the central bank adhered to a continuous
3 percent point target with a tolerance band of ±1 percent which was used to evaluate ex post
the attainment of price stability. Confirmation of the 3 percent inflation target helps reaffirm
the central bank’s (MNB) intentions at a point of deflationary risk, and the introduction of the
ex-ante band is in line with practices of other inflation targeting central banks. It will be
important for the MNB to continue anchoring inflation expectations around the mid-point of
the band.
4.
Standard and Poor’s (S&P) upgraded Hungary’s rating, but it still remains noninvestment grade. On March 20, S&P raised its long-term foreign and local currency
sovereign credit ratings to BB+ from BB and affirmed the short-term foreign and local
currency sovereign credit ratings at B. S&P noted that the upgrade mainly reflects the
improvement in Hungary’s external vulnerability and growth outlook, as well as the positive
impact of the FX mortgage conversion.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Hungary
On March 27, 2015 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Hungary.
The Hungarian economy is growing at a strong pace helped by accommodative
macroeconomic policies and improved market sentiment. Driven by strong domestic demand,
output grew by 3.6 percent in 2014. Unemployment declined sharply reflecting the expansion
of public works programs and job creation in the private sector. Headline and core inflation
decelerated sharply, and inflation expectations fell below the National Bank of Hungary’s
(MNB) inflation target. Improving terms of trade and strong export volume growth helped
maintain a sizeable current account surplus. Private sector credit continued to contract and
the banking sector remains under pressure reflecting the heavy tax burden and high nonperforming loans.
Vulnerabilities continued to decline thanks to large and persistent current account surpluses,
and recent policy measures, including the conversion of foreign exchange mortgages into
local currency loans. However, debt levels remain high and the associated financing needs
together with heavy reliance on nonresident financing, large concentration of the investor
base and the economy’s large open FX position continue to pose risks. At the same time, the
state has been increasing its role in the economy including through acquisition of stakes in
the banking and energy sectors thereby contributing to a buildup of contingent liabilities.
The 2014 fiscal deficit came in below target, as revenues were propelled by accelerating
economic activity and tax administration improvements, and were only partially offset by
higher expenditures. However, the fiscal stance eased significantly and public debt declined
only moderately to just below 77 percent of GDP. For 2015, the deficit is projected at 2.7
percent of GDP, implying a broadly neutral fiscal stance despite relatively favorable cyclical
conditions, and the debt ratio is expected to decline only modestly.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
Comforted by decelerating inflation, low risk premia, and a negative output gap, the MNB
kept its policy rate at 2.10 percent since July 2014 and cut it to 1.95 percent on March 24. It
also doubled the allocation for the second phase of the Funding for Growth Scheme (FGS)
and extended the program to end-2015.
Going forward, output growth is projected to decelerate to 2.75 percent this year, on account
of a smaller domestic-demand impetus due to less supportive fiscal stance and lower
investment growth. Private consumption is expected to continue to grow, reflecting lower
household indebtedness, accommodative monetary conditions, and higher employment.
Headline inflation is projected to remain very low in the coming months on account of a still
negative output gap and lower import prices. Over the medium-term, growth prospects
remain subdued, as private consumption is still constrained by the ongoing deleveraging;
while the difficult business environment continues to weigh on private investment. Labor
participation, while somewhat increasing, remains low, particularly among women and older
workers. These challenges are further compounded by competitiveness pressures and lack of
attractiveness for foreign direct investment.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Hungary’s strong economic rebound, which has been
underpinned by supportive policies and improved market sentiment. However, they noted
that medium-term prospects appear subdued, and the economy continues to face risks arising
from high debt levels and heavy reliance on non-resident funding. Against this background,
Directors agreed that policies in the period ahead should focus on further reducing
vulnerabilities and boosting medium-term growth, while enhancing policy predictability and
limiting the role of the state in the economy.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ continued commitment to fiscal discipline. Given the
favorable near-term outlook, most Directors encouraged more ambitious efforts to curb the
public debt ratio. They recommended pushing ahead with growth-friendly consolidation
centered on improving the efficiency and composition of public spending, and rationalizing
the tax system, including by gradually reducing sectoral taxes. Continued efforts are also
needed to tackle VAT fraud and improve the targeting of social benefits.
Directors concurred that monetary conditions have supported the recovery. They agreed that
persistent disinflation warrants further cautious easing of monetary policy, particularly in
light of the improved resilience of households’ balance sheets to exchange rate risk and the
weak external demand. Directors noted, however, that the central bank should stand ready to
tighten the policy stance if external financing conditions deteriorate sharply. They also

underscored the need to maintain adequate foreign exchange reserves to mitigate excessive
exchange rate volatility and support financial stability.
Directors emphasized the importance of improving financial intermediation to sustain the
recovery. In this regard, they welcomed the government’s commitment to gradually reduce
the tax burden on banks. Noting that the recent establishment of a national asset management
company would help clean up bank balance sheets, Directors stressed the need for
transparency and good governance and called on the authorities to mitigate financial and
operational risks that might be associated with the new institution. More broadly, Directors
cautioned against the increasing role of the state in the banking sector.
Directors stressed that sustained progress on wide-ranging structural reforms is essential to
boost Hungary’s growth potential. Noting progress in improving the labor market, Directors
saw scope for additional reforms to increase labor participation, particularly among women
and older workers, and address skill mismatches. Directors agreed that these steps, together
with measures to enhance competitiveness and strengthen the business climate, would
stimulate higher investment and strong private-sector-led growth.

Statement by Szilard Benk, Alternate Executive Director for Hungary
March 27, 2015
Since the last Article IV consultation, Hungary has continued to improve its macroeconomic
fundamentals. Economic activity remained strong while vulnerabilities declined, backed by
prudent and supportive policies. The external balance continued to strengthen, while disciplined
fiscal policy preserved a stable fiscal balance and a gradually declining public debt. On
March 20, Standard & Poor’s raised Hungary’s credit rating by one notch, citing the reduced
vulnerability to external shocks and a pickup in economic growth. The authorities expect a
further upgrade in the near future on the basis of Hungary’s strengthening macroeconomic
fundamentals.
Economic developments and outlook
The economy has continued to grow at a strong pace, reaching an annual rate of 3.6 percent in
2014 on the back of improving domestic demand. Unemployment continued to decline, reaching
its pre-crisis level, on the account of accelerating private sector job creation and persisting public
work programs. Notwithstanding the accelerating growth, the current account has remained in a
substantial surplus. Headline inflation decelerated sharply, reflecting the still negative output
gap, the decline in import prices, and one-off effects from regulated utility price cuts.
The growth momentum is expected to persist over the forecast horizon. Against the background
of the latest incoming data and supportive policies, the authorities are more optimistic than staff
about the growth prospects, expecting GDP to grow at a rate close to 3 percent in 2015, while in
the medium- and long-run, GDP is expected to remain dynamic, driven mainly by the underlying
factors which also boost potential GDP growth. The extended and prolonged Funding for Growth
Scheme (FGS) is likely to promote corporate, in particular SME, investment, while the
cyclicality of the EU funding receipts is likely to work in the opposite manner in 2016, acting as
a temporary drag on growth. Households’ investment activity is expected to rise gradually as
consumer confidence, labor conditions, and real income recover. The improving household
balance sheets resulting from the settlement and conversion of FX mortgages, and the
consequent removal of uncertainties, would further support the revival of private consumption.
The authorities assess the risks around the outlook as more balanced than in staff’s view.
External vulnerabilities, though still important, are gradually lessening as the share of the
nonresident holdings of public debt turned to a firmly declining trend during the past years; the
composition of the foreign investor base shifted towards more stable, real money players; and the
foreign liabilities of the banks have been reduced substantially by the conversion of the Swiss
franc-dominated FX loans.
Fiscal Policy and Debt
The public debt-to-GDP ratio has been on a declining path since 2011, moderating to
76.9 percent by the end of 2014, notwithstanding a weaker exchange rate. The financing strategy
allowed for the composition of the debt to shift to a more healthy structure, with a firmly
declining share of FX-denominated securities. In addition, the central bank’s self-financing

2
scheme shifted the incentive of holding government securities from the foreign banks to the
domestic banks, thus aiding the decline of nonresident holdings of public debt. Domestic
households continued to increase their bond holdings as well.
The authorities are fully committed to conducting prudent fiscal policies compatible with
sustainable debt reduction, and building buffers which allow for countercyclical policies. Fiscal
discipline and prudence helped the government to keep the deficit comfortably within EU limits,
and rigorous budget execution and corrective actions, where needed, ensured that the 2012,
2013, and also the 2014 deficits over-performed relative to the initial target. The 2014 deficit is
estimated at 2.6 percent on the background of an accelerating economy and significant
improvements in tax administration, especially in increasing VAT collection and tackling fraud.
The installation of online cash registers was especially helpful in this regard, and the recent
implementation of the Electronic Trade and Transport Control System is expected to yield
similar positive results.
The 2015 budget targets a 2.4 percent deficit, planning a broadly neutral fiscal stance for the
current and the subsequent years. This would allow a convergence to the medium-term structural
deficit target of 1.7 percent and a steadily declining public debt trajectory.
The government plans a number of changes to the fiscal framework. The intended early adoption
of the 2016 budget would enhance predictability, while harmonizing the budgeting process with
the European Semester. A new Tax Code is under preparation, with the intention to develop a
more customer-friendly system and ease the taxpayers’ administrative burden.
The authorities appreciate staff’s constructive policy recommendations on the medium-term
fiscal adjustment strategy. Some of them, where feasible, are already under implementation, or
given due consideration for the fiscal plan of the coming years. For example, some measures to
address VAT compliance and fraud are already yielding promising results (online cash registers)
or are in the early implementation phase (road control system). Spending on non-EU related
goods and services will remain under close monitoring. The government has committed to
substantially lower the bank levy starting from 2016. Nevertheless, the authorities wish to keep
the public work programs in operation as an important element for integrating inactive groups
into the active labor force.
Monetary Policy
The central bank (MNB) cut the policy rate by 15 basis points to 1.95 percent in its March
meeting, re-launching its easing cycle after an eight-month stall, and is committed to maintaining
accommodative monetary conditions for an extended period. This reflects the authorities’
assessment – in agreement with Fund staff – that inflationary pressures continue to stay moderate
in the medium term, supported by both domestic and international factors. Headline inflation
stayed in the negative territory in the past months, while households’ inflation expectations
adjusted and declined continuously during the last year. Going forward, this may help align the
price- and wage-setting decisions of economic agents with the inflation target over the medium
term, despite the pickup in domestic demand. The launch of the ECB’s asset purchase program
and the ongoing monetary easing in the region also point to easier monetary conditions.

3

The current level of international reserves is adequate by a variety of metrics, and is expected to
stay within a comfortable range even after supplying the banking sector with the necessary
foreign exchange for the conversion of mortgage loans. There is no compelling evidence
showing that the exchange rate is misaligned.
Financial System
The aggregate capital and liquidity positions of the banking system are adequate, though most
banks’ balance sheets have continued to shrink and their profitability has remained curtailed.
Nonperforming loans, although stabilized, remained high both in the corporate and in the
household segments. To repair the financial intermediation and enable the banking system to be
more supportive of economic growth, the authorities have taken a series of measures, as follows:
The MNB launched the Funding for Growth Scheme (FGS) in 2013, aiming at providing
liquidity to credit institutions at a preferential rate to alleviate disruptions in lending to SMEs and
to reverse the vicious credit squeeze/low growth cycle. The first and second phase of the
program provided financing to more than twenty-thousand SMEs, amounting to about HUF 1325
billion (over 4 percent of GDP), predominantly new investment loans. Notwithstanding the FGS’
beneficial effects, lending outside of the FGS has yet to recover, as excessive risk aversion by
banks and tight credit conditions have remained present in the riskier but viable SME segment.
As a response, the MNB just launched in March the FGS+ scheme, targeting SMEs with medium
risk spreads that exceed the FGS’ 2.5 percent cap. Under the FGS+, the MNB will assume
50 percent of the credit risk from credit institutions, but limited to only up to a five-year period,
and capped at a maximum of 2.5 percent of the outstanding FGS+ loan stock of the individual
credit institution.
To clean the nonperforming commercial real estate loan portfolio, the MNB established an asset
management company (MARK) with the aim of serving as a voluntary option for the banks for
removing distressed assets from their balance sheets, hence catalyzing the market. Following
consultations with the European Commission and the ECB, and building on the Fund’s TA
recommendations, the MNB has improved the market-based characteristics of the vehicle and
shifted to market pricing, and is examining the implementation of further safeguards to ensure
the financial independence of the central bank. The MNB pursues its macroprudential mandate
with MARK, namely, to achieve a well-functioning banking sector which sufficiently supports
economic growth. MARK is expected to begin operations in the second half of 2015. The MNB
highly appreciates the prompt technical assistance provided by the Fund in the set-up of the
MARK.
A number of decisive steps have been taken to address the longstanding issue of foreign
exchange- (mostly Swiss franc) denominated mortgages. First, the Settlement Act ensured the
settlement of the non-justified interest rate, fee increases, and exchange rate spreads, setting the
stage for the transition to a “fair banking system”. The Conversion Act stipulated the conversion
of the FX-denominated mortgage stock at the market exchange rate. Lastly, the Fair Banking Act
will ensure the transparency in pricing going forward, fostering competition. The immediate
effect of these measures will reduce the profitability of the banking sector for this year; however,

4
in the longer term, the return to fair interest margins will increase households’ repayment ability,
ease their balance sheet pressures, and increase predictability. Not least, these measures will
reduce banks’ exposure to foreign funding. The MNB is playing an active role in this process,
both in terms of macroprudential regulation and consumer protection, and in supplying the
foreign exchange for the conversion.
In order to increase the profitability and lending capacity of the banking sector, the government
signed a memorandum of understanding with the EBRD, opening a new chapter with the
banking sector, committing to: (i) create a framework that ensures the long-term sustainability of
a stable and predictable economic policy; (ii) decrease the bank tax to the EU standards by 2019,
starting in 2016; (iii) refrain from any measure that may have a negative impact on the
profitability of the banking sector; and (iv) transfer all direct and indirect majority equity stakes
it currently holds in local banks to the private sector within the next three years.
Structural Reforms
The authorities are continuing with the structural transformations and supply-side measures,
intended to address structural bottlenecks and raise Hungary’s medium-term growth prospects. A
series of regulatory and administrative changes have been implemented with an impact on the
business environment, such as: a new Labor Code facilitating the shift towards more flexible
employment types; a new Civil Code with reforms in the field of corporate law and contract law;
the implementation of the Cutting Red Tape program, aiming to reduce entrepreneurial
administrative burdens, reduce the timeframe for administrative procedures, and simplify the tax
system by abolishing several minor taxes; and the one-stop-shop government windows for
administrative matters. A new Tax Code is under preparation, intended to develop a more
customer-friendly system with less administrative burden.
Labor market reforms are aimed at creating a workfare state, a work-based social security system
where the long-term unemployed have access to public work, facilitating their return to the
primary labor market. The Job Protection Act reduced the tax wedge for disadvantaged groups
with the lowest productivity but with the highest responsiveness to incentives to join the
workforce, such as the low-skilled, young, old, long-term unemployed, returning mothers, and
career starters. Its results are already reflected in the continuously rising labor force participation
alongside the declining unemployment. Several measures aimed to transform primary and higher
education, as well as vocational training, serve the enhancement of human capital.
Efforts have been stepped up to diversify export destinations. The energy strategy is focused on
developing a non-profit energy sector to reduce high energy costs for investors to international
levels, which is key to enhancing the economy’s competitiveness.
Final Remarks
The authorities thank staff for the thorough and constructive discussions during the Article IV
mission, and for their valuable advice on macroeconomic policies. They remain committed to
prudent policies, focusing their strategy on sustainable debt reduction, increasing labor
participation, improving competitiveness, and reducing financial vulnerabilities.
