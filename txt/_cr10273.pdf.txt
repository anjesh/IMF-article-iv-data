Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation with Finland
Approved by Ajai Chopra and Jan Kees Martijn
July 29, 2010
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Despite strong fundamentals, Finland has been dealt a severe blow by the global crisis.
GDP fell almost 8 percent in 2009—the worst in the euro area—reflecting adverse trade and
financial international spillovers. Generous pay raises have supported consumption, but also
led to an erosion of external competitiveness, which however remains adequate. A subdued
resumption of activity is projected for 2010–11, with growth remaining well below potential.
There was agreement that the financial sector weathered well the global turmoil, but
continued prudence and improvements to supervision are needed. Stress tests of the
banking system are benign, but do identify credit, liquidity, and concentration as the sources
of risk. Banks should be cautious in engaging in higher risk activities—like unexpectedly
strong mortgage lending amid recently surging home prices. Officials agreed that it is crucial
to boost the effectiveness of supervision and crisis management for large cross-border
institutions as well as mitigate too-big-to-fail risks. The authorities broadly endorsed EU and
Basel initiatives to reform supervision and regulation, but are concerned about burden
sharing arrangements and the impact on bank funding and credit.
The consensus was that the fiscal position has weakened considerably and early credible
adjustment is required. The large increase of the budget deficit in 2009–10 reflects
substantial discretionary stimulus as well as the cyclical downturn. Staff views the relaxation
as appropriate, but the fiscal sustainability gap has risen substantially. The authorities
contemplate ambitious fiscal tightening in 2011—1½ percent of GDP. With negative output
gaps forecast through 2014, staff advised a more measured pace of consolidation unless clear
evidence emerges of more robust growth. Beyond 2011, the authorities broadly supported
staff’s recommended aim to close the sustainability gap by 2020, with focus on expenditure
containment and tax base broadening.
Further structural reforms would alleviate the adverse impacts of the crisis and
population aging on growth, and facilitate fiscal consolidation. Nevertheless, no major
actions are envisaged before the 2011 general election.

I. ECONOMIC SITUATION AND OUTLOOK
1.
Finland entered the crisis with robust fundamentals, a legacy of strong policies.
Growth was well above the euro area average and the external current account exhibited
sizable surpluses. Banks were generally sound, with no major bubbles in financial or real
estate markets, while the government consistently ran fiscal surpluses over the last decade
and public debt was low (negative in net terms, given large pension funds assets).
2.
Nevertheless, Finland has been hit hard by the global crisis because of
international spillovers and signs of recovery are still hazy. Exports fell dramatically

GDP collapsed nearly 8 percent in 2009,
the largest plunge in the euro area, turning the output gap from 4¼ percent above potential
in 2008 to 4¼ percent below capacity last year (Figure 1). Though private consumption and
exports rebounded in the second half of 2009, growth was mildly negative in both 2009Q4
and 2010Q1, technically putting Finland in a double dip recession.
3.
The impact on employment and
inflation was dampened. The
unemployment rate rose notably from 6½ to
8¼ percent during 2008–09, but well below
Okun’s law predictions (Figure 2). Inflation
turned down markedly in 2009 (Table 1).
However, it has outpaced the EU average
since late 2008, in part the result of generous
multi-year collective wage agreements
in 2007 that were generally in excess of
productivity gains.

Profitability and asset quality have deteriorated in the turmoil, while capital



Bank profits, though remaining positive, plunged in 2008–09, reflecting mainly rising
loan losses and declining net interest income, amid rapidly falling loan rates. The
nonperforming loan rate increased in 2009 to 0.7 percent from a comparatively low
0.5 percent in 2008 (Figure 3).



After declining slightly in 2008, the Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio (CAR) improved
in 2009, thanks to a partial portfolio reallocation toward less risky assets and
expiration of some transitional additional capital requirements, with equity and nearequity funds accounting for 92 percent of regulatory capital.

Wholesale liquidity tightened somewhat, but interbank markets were not frozen at the
crisis’ peak, and banks benefited from a shift from mutual funds into bank deposits.
Nonetheless, liquidity buffers1 are relatively low.

Box 1. Finland: Cross-Border Spillovers1
Extensive trade linkages have deepened the
severity of the global crisis in Finland.
During 2009, Finnish merchandise trade
decreased approximately by one third in relation
to the previous year (Table 6). Direction and
composition of exports have been sources of
special vulnerability to the recession, with trade
heavily concentrated in a few European partners.
At least two-thirds of its exports are highly
sensitive to the world investment collapse (like
TLC and other machinery) or in trend decline
(paper).

International financial exposures are also important, but pose manageable risks for
Finland. The Finnish banking system has a relatively high share of foreign claims,
especially in Western Europe, which makes it susceptible to deteriorating conditions
abroad. However, considerable diversification diminishes risks stemming from a localized
financial shock. Simulating the direct and indirect impact of a default in one (or more) of
the partner countries and the associated domino effects suggests that gross losses for
Finnish banks would be generally contained. A more pessimistic scenario of 10 percent
default rate across Europe, US, or Japan could reduce credit availability by approximately
one third and produce considerable losses for banks, up to 5 percent of GDP.

Foreign claims on Finnish banks are equally significant, but risks are more
concentrated. Foreign banks’ share of the Finnish banking system accounts for about twothirds of its assets and they originate in just a few European countries. To illustrate the
intensity of the linkage, given a 5 percent default in Finnish private claims, Sweden suffers
the worst (1 percent of GDP), followed by Denmark.

Household balance sheets are rallying, but risks have increased, in particular
related to the current low interest rate environment. Financial assets of households have
almost returned to pre-crisis level. However, debt, especially mortgages, has grown
stimulated by low rates, the proportion of loans with floating interest rates is very high, and
repricing maturities have shortened—all factors that have shifted significant interest rate risk
from banks to households. Household loan servicing capacity has declined, leading to
increasing problem loans.

The real estate market appears
generally steady, albeit with some concerns.
Real home prices remained stagnant in 2008–
09, having appreciated by over 30 percent
in 2000–07, but started to ascend fast again at
the end of last year. Analyses by staff and
others show that they are broadly in line with
fundamentals, but the sudden acceleration in
the last six months points to increasing hazards
if the trend were to continue. As for
commercial real estate (CRE), with office rents
falling by more than 10 percent in 2009,
Finland’s vulnerability is high compared to
Nordic peers.

balance sheets, but vulnerabilities have
risen. During the capital market turmoil of 2008, short-term loans to nonfinancial companies
have increased significantly as firms turned to banks for funding. With improving global
financial conditions in 2009, corporations were able to tap the international bond and
syndicated loan markets, and the stock of bank loans slightly decreased (Figures 5 and 6).
Medium and large firms, facing higher loan margins and shorter maturity terms, have stepped
up borrowing from employee pension funds, at relatively high cost. Small enterprises
suffered most from tighter collateral requirements, increasingly tapping public funding
sources like Finnvera. The sharp activity slowdown resulted in a steep rise of payment
defaults and bankruptcies. However, these are now decelerating and expected default
frequency indicators have also been improving lately.

Box 2. Finland: Macro-Financial Linkages
Financial conditions have tightened substantially, reducing significantly economic growth.
Banks reported tougher lending standards for corporations, residential mortgages, and consumer
lending in 2008–09. Using a Financial Conditions Index (FCI) approach, staff estimates the
cumulative negative direct contribution to 2008–09 growth of prevailing financial conditions at
1½–2 percentage points (AN1).
However, lower interest rates are increasingly
compensating for the adverse impact of other
financial variables. The substantial lowering of shortterm interbank and corporate loan interest rates since
late 2008, albeit with only small declines in longer-term
rates, is gradually offsetting the negative contribution to
growth of real exchange rate appreciation, slumping
equity prices earlier in the crisis, and banking sector
conditions (distance-to-default indicator—AN1).
Notably, the influence of the latter, while relatively
small, is approaching levels comparable to the crisis of
the early 90’s.

Finland: Financial Conditions Indices and Credit Market Imbalances

The FCI index, which captures the interrelations between economic activity and financial
variables, shows a noticeable recovery since the peak of the crisis. During 2009, the main
contribution to growth has come from the positive monetary policy impulse.

The crisis had an important effect in the disequilibrium in the credit market . After peaking in Q3 2008,
the stock of credit began to decrease amidst a noticeable credit contraction. Finally, since the second part of

competitiveness (Box 3 and Figure 8). The surplus,
having hovered around 4 percent of GDP during 2000–08, plunged to 1¼ percent of GDP
last year amid collapsing exports. It is projected to recover to the 2 percent of GDP range
during 2010–11, as accelerating exports more than offset recovering imports. In the medium
term, the CA is expected to stabilize around this level, with old-age pre-funding boosting the
savings rate and despite continuing terms-of-trade erosion.
Macro Outlook
13.
Economic activity is projected to rebound in 2010, but growth is likely to be
subdued, before consolidating in 2011. The external sector is to provide a positive, yet
restrained, contribution to growth in both years.


In 2010, growth is expected to attain 1¼ percent. Domestic demand should expand
moderately with private consumption and investment remaining frail in the near term,
as households face rising unemployment and tight credit, while firms suffer large
excess capacity, stern lending conditions, and a CRE overhang. Continuing fiscal
stimulus measures and large automatic stabilizers will reduce the downside for

14

consumption and investment. Inflation is likely to decline as a sizable output gap
strengthens resistance to price and salary increases. The labor market is anticipated to
lag the pick-up in activity, with unemployment hitting 8¾ percent.


In 2011, amid improving global conditions, firming consumer and investor
confidence, and deepening normalization of financial markets, growth is projected to
speed up to 2 percent, despite sizable fiscal tightening. The authorities’ projections
are more optimistic with real GDP expanding by 2½ percent, implying a stronger
growth momentum fueled by private demand.

14.
The supply potential of the economy has probably been severely curtailed by the
crisis. Potential growth may run considerably lower than before the downturn in the near to
medium term, owing to the large contraction in investment, likely decline in the participation
rate, and a deceleration in total factor productivity (if financing constraints and increased risk
aversion curb research and development). Potential growth is expected to stay at around
1½ percent over the medium term, somewhat below its pre-crisis trend, leaving a permanent
decline in the level of potential output—7 percent by 2015 (AN3), when the output gap is
anticipated to close.

Box 3. Finland: External Competitiveness
Standard REER measures of external competitiveness—using different cost or price indices—
are mixed, but generally point to some modest recent deterioration. From the early 2000s, on
average indicators have moved broadly sideways. Compared to 2007, though, when Finland had a
large CA surplus, economy-wide REER indicators suggest some decline in competitiveness.

Exporter profitability has also worsened. The ratio of ULC-based to price-based-REERs estimates
changes in labor shares compared to trading partners as a profitability proxy. Both economy-wide
and tradable relative labor shares have increased over the last five years.
Merchandise export market shares in both total world trade and in the EU have been trending
downward over the last twenty years. This reflects a secular decline in export prices, especially for
communications equipment and forestry/paper products, as well as outsourcing of production.

Box 3. Finland: External Competitiveness (concluded)
The multilaterally-consistent CGER methodology1 shows sizable and rising competitiveness
margins, but specificities of the Finnish economy point to over-estimation. The margin is
estimated to lie in the range of 16 to 4 percent depending on the CGER method used. In particular,
the CA norm based on the macroeconomic balance approach is estimated at -1 percent of GDP and
is mainly influenced by the dependency ratios, relative incomes, and past values of the current
account.


However, the large real undervaluation implied by the equilibrium real exchange approach
is mainly driven by a relative increase in Finland’s government consumption/GDP ratio,
itself largely determined by the massive nominal GDP decline in 2009. This factor causes
the CGER equilibrium REER to appreciate markedly, while the measured REER only
appreciates marginally as noted above, thereby boosting “artificially” the competitiveness
margin.

Moreover, two adjustments which reflect specific features of the Finnish economy reduce
the “real undervaluation” significantly. First, including the expected evolution of the
Finnish population in the CGER panel data approach increases the CA norm to a positive
¼ percent of GDP, limiting the undervaluation to 7½ percent. Second, estimating the
macroeconomic balance approach using only time series data for Finland increases further
the CA norm to ½ percent of GDP and lowers the undervaluation even more, to about
6 percent.

In the longer run, a rapidly aging
population could lower potential growth
further. Imminent population aging will
squeeze working-age cohorts, while slowing
down trend productivity. Maintaining
potential growth will therefore require
boosting labor force participation and reforms
to enhance productivity (¶35).

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
17.
Against this background, Finland needs to secure the recovery, mitigating
lingering risks, and also start addressing long-term sustainability issues.


In the near term, actions should focus on consolidating restoration of financial sector
health and economic growth. There are signs that banks may be prompted by
competition and the difficult operating environment to engage in higher risk activities
in a quest for better returns (¶25), while bank profitability and credit quality have
declined (¶s19, 20). Liquidity buffers are low, particularly in consideration of
relatively high reliance on wholesale funding (¶s20, 23). In the fiscal area, a balance
must be struck between support of economic activity and prevention of continuous
budget worsening (¶s26–30).



Longer term policies should strengthen financial stability, ensure fiscal sustainability,
and advance structural reforms to boost potential output. With most of the banking
system made of large entities in foreign hands, supervision and crisis management for
systemic cross-border institutions as well as mitigation of too-big-to-fail risks and
prompt intervention in distressed institutions are critical issues (¶s22–24). The EU
and Basel initiatives to reform supervision and regulation may have profound
implications for Finnish banks (¶23). The fiscal position having considerably
weakened, gradual and credible adjustment is required with the aim to restore
sustainability (¶s31–34). Structural reforms would alleviate the adverse impacts of the
crisis and population aging on growth, and facilitate fiscal consolidation (¶s33–35).
A. Maintaining Financial Stability

18.
In line with the FSAP update, staff observed that bank support actions have
been broadly appropriate and consistent with those of other industrialized countries
(Tables 7–8). The enlargement of deposit insurance was in accordance with EU-wide
measures. ECB liquidity extension on full allocation basis was also supportive of financial
stability. Guarantees for bank liabilities and capitalization facilities, although in practice not
used, envisaged respectively sunset provisions and consistency with a sound “fix-it-and-exit”
approach aimed at avoiding the persistence of distortions to the level playing field. These
facilities have now expired.

19

19.
Officials and the FSSA Update report2 established credit quality as a key
challenge which may hurt banks’ profits. NPLs, still lower than in most EU economies,
could increase, particularly if higher interest

service of households. In this regard, though,
80
2007

the authorities considered more important the

the need to raise household savings to service

together with low interest margins and sluggish 30

to sustain profits, though Finnish banks
compare well with peers. It was also recognized that heightened risk aversion in the wake of
the Greek crisis could push up funding costs and complicate access to bank financing.
Capital Adequacy and Stress Tests
20.
There was agreement that banks’ capital buffers are sufficient to withstand
fairly adverse shocks. Stress tests indicate that the banking system is resilient to a variety of
blows covering credit, exchange rate, and market risk. The tests determined that credit is the
main source of risk, especially for small banks, together with contagion, owing to the high
degree of concentration of the sector. Officials argued that, although the increase in
commercial property value has been one of the highest in the euro area during 2004–07, the
small proportion of lending to that sector reduces the impact on banks. On the other hand,
low liquidity buffers and reliance on wholesale funding expose banks to significant risk.
Regulatory capital adequacy of the four largest banking groups,3 however, would not be
impaired, even in a combination of severe downturns in the domestic and global economy.
21.
The FSSA Update report identified possible improvements in stress testing4 and
financial stability analysis although both are already adequate. These include enhanced
monitoring of mortgage practices and household debt service as well as compiling

information and reporting on properties’ mortgage portfolio and loan-to-value ratios. Topdown stress testing could be strengthened by modeling the impact of macro-financial
variables on a bank-by-bank basis and fostering synergies between the BoF research and
financial stability divisions and the FSA. Finally, systemic risk assessment can be
ameliorated by using more granular information and including all non-bank elements of the
financial sector and cross-border linkages.
Regulation and Supervision
22.
The authorities concurred that supervision and the crisis management
framework for systemic cross-border institutions are the key issues for Finland. With a
banking system characterized by large subsidiaries of big foreign banks, supervisors are fully
aware of the need to share responsibility for large international groups operating in Finland
with foreign counterparts, in the related dimensions of regular supervision and crisis
management.


The authorities intend to increase the effectiveness of supervision vis-à-vis foreign
banks’ branches and pursue clear agreements on specific information to be distributed
by home supervisors through efficient communication channels.



There was agreement that, with several institutions of systemic importance, it was
important to mitigate potential contagion with measures to contain the too-big-to-fail
risk—including at the regional level, should EU-wide agreements be delayed.



Also shared was the view that safety net and crisis management arrangements face
important challenges, both cross-border and domestic. Operational aspects of the
deposit insurance fund need to be enhanced.

23.
The authorities broadly endorsed EU and Basel initiatives to reform supervision
and regulation, but are concerned about the impact on burden sharing and banks.


They strongly support a model in which the European System of Financial
Supervision would be granted incisive supervisory powers, clear responsibilities, and
appropriate resources, in the context of a broader framework clarifying also the fiscal
responsibilities of member states. The authorities however are worried that, under
current EU proposals, burden-sharing may cover only very large banks (EU-systemic
institutions) based in the major member countries, and not be extended to the smaller,
but locally-systemic, Nordic institutions that are active in Finland. Thus, prior
understandings are required that burden-sharing will apply to large Nordic banks.



The authorities stressed that—because of the funding structure of Finnish banks,
which relies markedly on wholesale funding and corporate deposits—new capital,
liquidity, and leverage requirements could hit the system hard and excessively

21

constrain credit, as shown in a FSA study. Thus, they may seek to moderate the
tightening of regulatory ratios, possibly with some differentiation depending on the
funding structure of banks. In this regard, staff argued that the authorities should step
up their vigilance of liquidity risk.
24.
Improvements to domestic aspects of bank resolution were also discussed. The
FSSA Update report argued that introduction of a special resolution regime for banks and
financial groups would facilitate prompt intervention in case of rapidly deteriorating
conditions that threaten financial stability or depositors. The procedure should entail
appointment by the FSA of official administrators and be designed to allow timely adoption
of debt restructuring measures; alternatively, it could envisage the commencement of
compulsory liquidation in order to reduce the cost of the crisis and reduce possible contagion
effects. The authorities are exploring these options.
25.
Supervisors’ recent guidance to banks for dealing with possible higher interest
rate conditions is appropriate and could be strengthened. Stiff competition and a difficult
investment environment may encourage higher risk activities. For example, variable interest
rate mortgages and mortgage insurance have been unexpectedly buoyant at a time when
residential real estate prices are accelerating. Thus, banks have been invited to: (i) abstain
from granting mortgages with LTV ratios higher than 90 percent; and (ii) undertake
systematic assessments of borrower’s capacity to repay with an interest rate of at least
6 percent. Staff welcomed these steps, while indicating that the authorities could consider
further tightening of LTV ceilings, possibly making them mandatory, or introducing limits on
the mortgage share that can be borrowed at variable interest rates, particularly should the
pick-up in housing prices continue. Staff also noted that borrowing capacity might be
overestimated by tests which omit macro feedback loops through income or employment.
B. Fiscal Policy
Short-Term Fiscal Policy
26.
Amid a massive economic downturn, fiscal policy will continue to be stimulative
in 2010. The headline fiscal balance is expected to drop by 2 percentage points to a deficit of
4½ percent of GDP, breaching the SGP limits. This deterioration primarily reflects further
structural loosening of around 1¾ percent of GDP, leading to a cyclically-adjusted primary
fiscal deficit in 2010 of ½ percent of GDP. Discretionary measures envisage: (i) cuts in labor
income taxes; (ii) expansion of social benefits; (iii) investment; and (iv) transfers, subsidies,
and tax allowances for businesses. The ratio of expenditures to GDP will rise also because of
the increases allowed under spending ceilings originally calibrated for a markedly higher
nominal GDP.
27.
The authorities’ cushioning of the impact of the global crisis is appropriate. In
addition to free operation of large automatic stabilizers, the expansionary package

22

(In percent of GDP)

implemented in 2009–10 is one of the largest
in the euro area. Staff remarked that it was
broadly adequate because a stimulative fiscal
policy is both indicated from a cyclical
perspective—given negative output gaps
envisaged for 2009–14 as well as the
uncertainty still surrounding the economic
recovery in 2010—and feasible given the
comparatively favorable initial public debt
burden. Rollover risks are limited by the
relatively long average maturity of public debt.

loosening should rely on actions that can be
implemented swiftly and clawed back quickly once growth prospects improve. However, the
authorities recognized that only about one-third of the total discretionary expansion
for 2009–10 of about 3½ percent of GDP is temporary, implying that it will add about
2 percent of GDP to the structural fiscal deficit—though partly consistent with long standing
policy goals, such as reducing labor taxation.
29.
There was agreement that budget consolidation should begin in 2011. Since
front-loaded fiscal retrenchment is desirable for intergenerational equity and to contain the
size of the required tightening, while output remains below potential through 2014, the
objectives of reducing the output gap and making progress towards fiscal sustainability have
to be balanced. Staff supported a gradual structural adjustment, ¾ percent of GDP, because it
would bring the headline deficit below the SGP ceiling and not jeopardize the recovery. In
addition, absence of market pressure associated with financing requirements renders
unnecessary larger front-loading.

1/ Incorporating the authorities' planned measures, but staff's growth forecast. Under staff's
recommended structural adjustment the headline deficit for 2011 would be 2.9 percent of GDP.

30.
However, the authorities target a more ambitious deficit reduction than
recommended by staff. In 2011, the government intends to enact corrective measures of
about 1½ percent of GDP, which would reduce the GG deficit to about 2 percent of GDP,
well below the SGP limit. To this end, the authorities have signaled that energy taxes and
pension contributions will be raised in 2011. Expenditure ceilings have also been tightened
implying a moderation of current spending. The mission argued that such a budgetary
contraction might be excessive in light of the uncertainties still surrounding the recovery, as
evidenced by the disappointing growth outcome in 2010Q1, and the persistence of a sizable
output gap. It could however be appropriate, should the momentum of growth turn out to be
significantly stronger than anticipated by staff.
Medium-Term Fiscal Policy and Sustainability

31.
Officials concurred that the long-term GG
position has worsened considerably (AN5),
reflecting the impact of the crisis. Besides the
sizable structural fiscal relaxation in 2009–10, the
global crisis has led to operations in support of
corporations, which have not increased the deficit but
added to public debt, and weaker potential output.
Given also expected increases in aging-related
spending (5½ percent of GDP over 2011–60, on
account of pensions, health- and old-age care), staff
estimates that—notwithstanding comparatively low
debt and large public assets— the GG structural
primary balance after 2011 consistent with long140
term sustainability will need to be permanently
120
higher than in the no-measures path by 5½–
100
6 percent of GDP—the fiscal sustainability gap—
in line with the authorities’ own latest estimates.5 6 80

While immediate full adjustment on this scale is

implausible, delaying it requires a higher long-run
primary surplus to ensure sustainability.

The sustainability indicator used is based on the intertemporal budget constraint (see AN5), and is consistent
with the S2 measure of the EC (Sustainability Report 2009, pp148–149).

The sustainability gap—evaluated as of 2011—has increased from 1½–2½ in SR2008 to 6 percent of GDP
now, primarily reflecting a 4 percent of GDP decline in the projected structural primary balance.

32.
Thus, the authorities viewed a strong and credible commitment to fiscal
consolidation as crucial. Staff emphasized that, with parliamentary elections in 2011, clear
identification of time-bound fiscal adjustment targets for 2012–15 and supporting measures
to be enshrined in the program of the new government is essential. Based on reasonable
calibration of the tradeoff between output stabilization and fiscal sustainability, staff
indicated that an adjustment slightly higher than ½ percent of GDP per annum could be
desirable and it would close the sustainability gap by 2020. The authorities broadly endorsed
this approach, which is also consistent with their medium-term objective under the SGP of
½ percent of GDP structural surplus. It was also agreed that these fiscal objectives should be
pursued flexibly, with the option to delay somewhat the headline adjustment in exchange for
structural measures (such as increasing the retirement age), which improve significantly
fiscal sustainability, but have only a modest short-run impact on the government balance.

Measures to Achieve Sustainability
33.
The consensus was that, with an already high revenue ratio, there is only limited
scope for increases in the tax burden (Figure 9). Prevailing tax rates leave little upward
room, especially for direct taxes. Indeed, pressures from international tax competition may
even lead to cuts in corporate taxation, while labor market reform may entail a reduction of
marginal tax rates, since relatively large tax wedges on earned income discourage work. The
focus on the revenue side should therefore be on base broadening and a shift from labor to
consumption and property-based taxation, since the latter are generally less distortionary. In
this regard, recent reductions in income tax rates, the increase in VAT rates by
one percentage point in mid-2010 (the standard rate was 22 percent before the adjustment),
and plans to raise energy taxes are steps in the right direction. The authorities are also
considering the possibility of further increases in the VAT rates, partly offset by cuts in
payroll or income taxes. Staff agreed, but indicated that more should be done, including by
reducing the number of items on reduced VAT rates. In addition, property taxation is
currently relatively low, and could be increased, while the generosity of mortgage interest
deductibility could be gradually curtailed.
34.
Therefore, the authorities acknowledged that expenditure retrenchment would
need to take the brunt of adjustment. This reflects both the relatively elevated government
footprint and international evidence generally indicating that expenditure-based
consolidations have been more successful. In this context, officials concurred that the focus
should be on reducing the impact of aging on fiscal expenditures and local government (LG)
reform, including through an increase in effective retirement age and measures to restrain
growth in demand for health- and long-term care (Table 9). Higher tuition fees and a
reduction of student grants in favor of loans for tertiary education would also be helpful in
generating expenditure savings, while creating incentives for reducing time to graduation.
Efficiency enhancements could reduce government expenditure without jeopardizing public
service provision.
C. Structural Reforms
35.
The authorities confirmed that efforts underway to boost labor participation,
increase competition in services, and foster innovation should be strengthened. The
authorities are rightly focusing on these areas, as reflected in their latest Lisbon strategy
implementation report. The government has undertaken to expand labor participation through
tax incentives and intensified training. Reforms of tertiary educational financing could also
promote earlier employment among the youth. At the other end of the age spectrum, the
unemployment pipelines ought to be further restricted or eliminated. Staff noted that steps to
boost competition, especially in services (for example, liberalizing shop operating hours)
should be pursued, as should ongoing programs to improve public productivity through
mergers of municipalities and greater use of outsourcing. Actions to enhance

27

research/business cooperation, entrepreneurship, and venture capital could further strengthen
innovation from Finland’s sizable R&D investment. Renewed reform momentum is however
unlikely before the 2011 elections.
D. Exit Strategy
36.
The mission found that crisis-related measures to support the economy have
been adequately designed to facilitate exit. In the financial area, most initiatives are set to
terminate at a predefined date, with some having already expired (¶18). Furthermore,
guarantees for bank borrowing have not been issued or called so far and the likelihood of any
outflow of public funds in the future appears very low. Importantly, the exit strategy
appropriately encompasses the broader fiscal measures taken to support the economy (¶s33–
34), including the repayment of the resources received by distressed nonfinancial companies
(¶11) in line with the respective contractual agreements, while the program itself should be
wound down with the revival of financial markets. It also envisages gradual downsizing of
temporary employment support programs as economic activity strengthens.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
Finland’s economy has been dealt a severe blow by the global crisis and the
recovery is slow. Owing to the high dependence of its exports on countries and commodities
severely impacted by the downturn, Finland experienced the worst recession the euro area
in 2009. Generous pay raises have supported consumption, but also put pressure on unit labor
costs and led to an erosion of external competitiveness, which however remains adequate. A
subdued resumption of activity is projected for 2010–11, though output is anticipated to
remain well below potential and inflation to decline, while remaining at the euro area
average. Risks appear balanced, although the outlook is unusually uncertain. The crisis has
also led to a permanent loss of potential output, aggravating the problems posed by the fast
aging population, not least to longer-term fiscal sustainability.
38.
The financial sector has withstood the world economic crisis owing to a solid
capital base and vigilant supervision, but some risks linger. The FSSA Update report
found that exposure to opaque structured products or highly vulnerable countries is limited or
negligible. More generally, spillover risks are manageable, with only rather extreme
scenarios inducing sizable losses in Finland. Stress test outcomes for the Finnish banking
system are benign, identifying credit, liquidity, contagion and concentration as the largest
sources of risk. This reflects in particular adverse cyclical conditions and the associated rise
in nonperforming loans, while reliance on wholesale funding requires greater liquidity
buffers.
39.
Actions in support of the financial system have been apt, but bank cost efficiency
must be strengthened, while excessive risk-taking should be avoided. In particular,
guarantees for bank liabilities and capitalization facilities have been designed to be phased

28

out, which has occurred at end-June 2010, and minimize distortions to competition.
However, intense competition has reduced drastically banks’ net interest margins. With
prospects of higher funding costs, possibly associated with ongoing nervousness in sovereign
borrowing markets, cost reductions will be important. Banks and insurers should be cautious
in engaging in higher risk activities—like the unexpectedly sustained pace of low-interest
mortgage lending amid surging home prices—in a quest for better returns.
40.
It is crucial to boost further the effectiveness of supervisory and crisis
management frameworks for large cross-border institutions. With most of the banking
system controlled by foreign banks, detailed understandings on information to be distributed
by home supervisors, especially for branches, are needed to strengthen supervision. Also, if
implementation of an EU-wide appropriate resolution framework is postponed, mitigation of
too-big-to-fail risk should be pursued through regional agreements at the Nordic level.
41.
Other enhancements to regulation and supervision should be considered too. A
bank-specific resolution regime, including by broadening options to allocate losses to the
private sector, would render the process faster and more cost-effective. Vigilance on liquidity
risk and banks’ funding profiles and the (consolidated) risk profile of complex financial
groups active in Finland should be stepped up. There is also scope to further strengthen the
analytical frameworks for stress testing and systemic risk assessment.
42.
The large fiscal impulse in 2009–10 is adequate, but the composition of fiscal
measures raises concerns. The relaxation is both affordable, given favorable initial fiscal
position, and necessary, given the depressed economic conditions and the still quite fragile
prospects for economic recovery, particularly in light of ongoing market gyrations related to
euro area peripheral countries. However, the sizable contribution of recurrent spending and
permanent tax cuts to structural loosening will not be automatically reversed when growth
picks up, thereby worsening the medium-term deficit.
43.
At the same time, the budgetary position has weakened considerably, requiring a
strong and credible commitment to fiscal consolidation starting in 2011. The fiscal
sustainability gap is much larger than estimated in recent years owing mainly to the crisisinduced deterioration in government deficit and debt and potential output. With output
projected to remain below potential through 2014, the twin objectives of reducing the output
and fiscal sustainability gaps must be balanced. Thus, a measured budget consolidation of
¾ percent of GDP, consistent with bringing the headline deficit below the SGP ceiling should
start in 2011. Stronger consolidation, as envisaged by the authorities, could be considered if
there is clear evidence of growth resuming more robustly than envisioned by staff.
Beyond, 2011, an adjustment of about ½ percent of GDP per annum on average would be
desirable and close the sustainability gap by 2020. Accordingly, fiscal adjustment targets
for 2012–15 and supporting measures should be a key plank in the program of the
government formed after the 2011 elections. Nevertheless, these fiscal objectives should be

29

pursued flexibly, with the option to delay somewhat the headline adjustment in exchange for
structural measures.
44.
Fiscal adjustment efforts should focus on expenditure retrenchment and tax base
broadening. Aging will push up public spending, and there is only limited room to raise tax
rates given associated deadweight losses and international tax competition, with the partial
exception of the VAT and property taxation. Moreover, expenditure-based consolidations
have proven generally more durable. In this light, pension, health-and old-age care reforms,
as well as an overhaul of local government, are key to containing expenditures.
45.
Renewed momentum with structural reforms would alleviate the adverse
impacts of the crisis and population aging on growth, and facilitate fiscal consolidation.
Further efforts to limit excessive time spent in tertiary education and to restrict the
unemployment or disability pipelines to early retirement would be welcome. Steps to boost
competition, especially in services, should be pursued, along with continued programs to
raise efficiency in the public administration and local government. Overall productivity
growth could also be spurred through facilitation of closer research/business cooperation.
46.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the 24-month
cycle.

Table 8. Finland: Summary of State Interventions in Major Financial Institutions
Institution

Type of State Intervention

Conditions imposed

Background

None

The failure of the Icelandic Kaupthing Bank h.f. triggered
also the failure of its Finnish branch. Fearing a broader loss
of confidence among Finnish depositors in general, the
main Finnish banks offered to compensate depositors in
full. The three commercial banks involved and a SPV took
over the credit claims and other assets of Kaupthing Bank
h.f. and settled all the deposit claims in Finland. The state
measure aimed to help in implementing a private
arrangement to restore the confidence in the Finnish
banking sector and more generally in the Finnish economy.
In the light of planned co-operation between the Finnish and
Icelandic authorities, the EU Commission stated that risk of
recovery claims materialising appears low. This, in turn,
minimises the legal risk of claims and thus the amount of
potential indemnity payments by the state.

Nordea Bank
Finland plc

OP-Pohjola
Group Central
Cooperative

Sampo Bank plc

State guarantee provided to the
three banks in connection with a
private sector initiative to fully
indemnify the depositors of the
Finnish branch of the insolvent
Icelandic Kaupthing Bank as of
October 31 2008. The Finnish
authorities have not set an upper
limit of the indemnity, since they
deemed not possible to estimate
the amount of possible claims, if
any.

The Banks would carry the
commercial and credit risks in the
arrangement, while the State
would carry the legal risks by
accepting to indemnify the banks
(as well as the SPV and Finnish
depositors) for all losses suffered
from any recovery claim or any
other equivalent insolvency claim
relating to the arrangement.

Restructuring

Table 9. Finland: Proposed Fiscal Measures
Measure

Authorities’ view

Further pension reform:

Raising retirement age.

Lowering accrual rate for
pension benefits.

Tightening early retirement.

The average effective retirement age is
about 60, and raising it to 67 would
suffice to close the sustainability gap.
Even partial movement would greatly
facilitate adjustment efforts. Sizable
savings could be accrued by lowering the
accrual rate for pension benefits—
particularly for periods of parental leave,
unemployment, and education—and
tightening early retirement via disability or
unemployment (disability pension
recipients total about 9 percent of the
labor force).

The authorities do not dispute the need for
such measures. Steps already taken are
expected to raise the effective retirement age
by 1½ years by 2025, and working groups have
been tasked with formulating proposals to
generate a further 1½ years increase by the
same date. Also, from 2010 new pensions will
be adjusted downward if life expectancy rises.

Savings in health and long-term care:

Increase in user fees.

Tightening entitlements to long
term care.

Productivity increases

Benchmarking.

Health-care and long-term care
expenditure is projected to rise about
3¼ percent of GDP by 2060 with
population aging, due to expensive
advances in medical technology and real
income growth, given high income
elasticity of health-services demand.
Thus, an increase in user fees could
moderate demand growth, although care
should be taken to prevent overburdening
the chronically ill. Tightening entitlements
in long-term care could spawn savings in
an area where aging pressures will be
strong. Productivity increases in healthand long-term care of ½ percent a year
(which has been achieved in some OECD
countries) would lower significantly
projected rises in spending. Domestic and
international benchmarking to identify
best practices would also be beneficial.

The authorities are actively seeking to increase
productivity in this area, including through
domestic and international benchmarking. They
are also considering increases in user fees and
tighter entitlements in long term care, but
emphasize the need to keep extensive
availability of social services given societal
preferences.

38

Rationale

Table 9. Finland: Proposed Fiscal Measures (concluded)
Rationale

Authorities’ view

Reform of local government:

Reduce reliance on corporate
taxes and enhance reliance on
property taxes.

Ceiling on municipal income tax
rates.

Broader competitive bidding.

Merger of municipalities.

Spending at the municipal level has
grown faster than in the rest of the GG
and municipality productivity has declined
by about 10 percent over 2000-08.
Reliance on corporate taxes at municipal
level—which due to their high cyclicality
have funded strong expenditure increases
in good times—ought to be reduced,
offset by higher property taxation or,
possibly, central government (CG)
transfers. A ceiling on municipal income
tax rates, and restraint in the growth of
CG transfers, would strengthen incentives
for LG spending consolidation. Also,
competitive bidding in the provision of
services to LGs should be broadened to
generate cost savings. Finally, there is
scope for efficiency gains through
mergers of municipalities, as their median
population is less than 5,000.

The authorities support the measures in
principle, but stress that the Finnish
constitution gives the local authorities broad
autonomy, and thus the consensus of the local
governments must be sought prior to
introducing the reforms, which is not easy.

Improved rate of return on government
financial assets.

Gross financial assets totaled about
90 percent of GDP in 2008, and
substantial portions of these assets are
low-yielding, reflecting a cautious
investment approach. Given the large
stock, an asset management strategy that
generates a modest increase in returns
could make a significant contribution to
close the sustainability gap.

The authorities are considering options to do
so while limiting any significant increase in
risks.

ANALYTICAL NOTE 1: MACRO-FINANCIAL LINKAGES1
1.
As the worst of the global crisis unwinds, there is mounting evidence that the
Finnish financial sector has acceptably weathered the turmoil. Moreover, the data are
already showing an incipient improvement in the health of that sector.
2.
The financial system has showed its resilience during the crisis and there is no
evidence that is currently suffering major distress. We analyze the evolution of an index
of financial distress constructed using several variables related to the banking, financial and
exchange rate markets (Figure 1-1).2 After peaking during the crisis, the index decreased
rapidly, reflecting an important improvement in financial conditions. Furthermore, not only
the peak has been much lower than observed in previous crises, but the recovery has also
been much faster. Currently the index exhibits values last observed during the calmer period
of 2004–05. Additionally, the Finnish financial system has suffered less distress than the
group of advanced economies, and particularly European countries.

Prepared by Mauro Roca.

More specifically, the Financial Stress Index (FSI) is a composite of the spread between commercial paper and
sovereign bonds, the beta of the banking sector, the term structure of interest rates, and volatilities in stock
returns and the exchange rate. Larger values of this index indicate increasing distress, while a value of zero
implies neutral financial conditions. For more information about its construction and interpretation please see
Cardarelli et al. (2009) and Balakrishnan et al. (2009).

50
3.
In contrast with other advanced countries, the financial sector has not been the
cause of the slowdown but rather it has suffered from the adverse business cycle.
Nevertheless, to evaluate properly the role of the financial sector in shock transmission, and
identify the major risks to which it is exposed, it is crucial to analyze the macro-financial
linkages. We evaluate them with the help of different econometric techniques. First, we
construct a financial conditions index using a vector autoregression approach (VAR). This
analysis allows identifying the responses of economic activity to different variables related to
the financial sector. Second, we analyze the existence of potential disequilibrium in the credit
market. Finally, we test the importance of the credit channel for economic growth.3
A. Financial Conditions
4.
We rely on VAR analysis to construct and index of financial conditions (FCI)
that captures the interrelations between economic activity and some financial variables.
Among the latter we use equity returns, the short-term interest rate (HELIBOR), the real
exchange rate, and banks’ distance to default4. The index is a composite of the cumulative
impulse responses of real GDP to each of the financial variables. A positive value of the
index implies that the aggregate effect of all variables is an increment in economic growth.
Additionally, the individual impulse responses are standardized so that a change of one unit
in the index can be interpreted as an (annualized) change of 1 percent in growth.
5.
The evolution of the FCI shows a strong recovery in financial conditions since
the peak of the crisis. After reaching a negative value of -0.91 during Q4 2008, the index
has raised rapidly to reach a neutral value close to 0 during Q3 2009 (Figure 1-2). However,
the index must stay into positive territory for some periods before the negative cumulative
effects stemming from the crisis are completely compensated.
6.
During 2009, the main contribution to growth has come from the positive
impulse of monetary policy. The low level of interest rates have more than compensated the
considerable negative effects coming from the banking and external sectors, and to lesser
degree, from the stock market. It is important to notice the increase of the negative
contribution to growth coming from the banking sector during 2009. It has now approached
levels comparable to those observed in the early 90’s. This could constitute a relevant source
of downside risk for the on-going recovery as the slowdown in economic activity and low
levels of interest rates continue to adversely affect the profitability of the banking sector.

Similar analyses have previously been conducted by Jafarov (2008) for Finland, and Igan (2009) for The
Netherlands.

This measure is computed by the Bank of Finland based on share market and balance sheet data.

B. Imbalances in the Credit Market
7.
To have a better assessment of the situation faced by the banking sector, the
functioning of the credit market should be analyzed. Particularly, it is important to
evaluate if there is some disequilibrium in that market, determined by rationing either on the
supply side (credit crunch) or the demand side (credit contraction). The origin of the
rationing is relevant to guide policy. A credit crunch would indicate a bottleneck in the
origination of credit, either because or deleveraging or insufficient capital, and would require
a direct support to financial intermediaries. A credit contraction reflects insufficient appetite
for credit, possibly depending on bleak economic prospects, and as consequence policies
should be directed to improve those prospects.
We estimate a system of equations for the supply of and the demand for credit to
8.
the private sector using monthly data spanning through the last five years.5 The demand
for credit is explained by the (average) lending rate, inflation, industrial production (as a
proxy for economic activity) and (an index of) economic confidence. The supply of credit is
determined by total deposits (reflecting available resources), the lending rate (which reflects
the profitability of the banking sector), the spread between the lending rate and the short-term
funding rate (to account for cyclical risk premium), the banking sector share price relative to
the market average (as a proxy for the market assessment of the expected profitability of the
5

Our analysis is based on Pazarbasioglu (1997).

52
banking sector) and the volatility of this latter variable (to account for idiosyncratic risks
affecting the banking sector), inflation, and industrial production.

9.
The results show that the crisis had an important effect in the imbalances of the
credit market (Figure 1-3). In the two-year period that preceded the global financial crisis,
the stock of credit was growing continuously on the back of a strong demand, and the market
imbalances were relatively small (generally there was a credit crunch of less than 2 percent
of total credit). However, the financial crisis changed this dynamic. After peaking in
Q3 2008, the stock of credit entered a decreasing path that was only reverted in Q1 2010. The
change in trend was associated with a noticeable credit contraction, which confirms that the
banking sector was indirectly affected by the global financial crisis and the economic
contraction instead of being a cause of it. Finally, during the second part of 2009 the market
returned to a credit crunch situation that peaked on September 2009 but practically
disappeared by the end of last year. This could have been driven in part by the policies
adopted as a reaction to the crisis that were aimed to help the real sector economy and it is
also consistent with our findings in Section 2 about the positive effects of expansive
monetary policy on financial conditions. In fact, the excess demand could have been
explained by the contraction in credit amidst the improvement in economic confidence and
the tightening in credit standards.

53
C. Credit Channel
10.
It is important to assess the strength of the relationship between credit to the
private sector and economic growth. We perform two type of analysis to analyze this
relationship. First, we estimate a simple VAR model to account for the short run or relatively
immediate effects of credit, and second, we perform a Vector Error Correction analysis to
identify a long run relationship between economic activity and credit.
11.
The VAR estimation does not point to a significant credit channel operating in
the short run. In the VAR analysis, GDP, investment or private consumption growth are
explained by changes in credit growth and lags of those variables (all variables in real terms).
We use employment and foreign demand as controls for different effects. Using quarterly
data spanning from Q4 1998 to Q3 2009, we find that the estimated coefficients on credit are
not significant in all specifications (Table 1-1).
12.
The VEC analysis does not show an important long term relationship either.
Using the same variables, we do not identify a long-run stable relationship between
investment or GDP growth and credit. Moreover, we find that these variables are mainly
associated with the evolution of employment and foreign demand. We do detect a positive
relationship between private consumption and credit but it could be argued that it is relatively
weak (Table 1-2).6
Therefore, the empirical evidence does not support a significant relationship
13.
between credit to the private sector and economic growth. These results are consistent
with our previous analysis in which we find that the banking sector is suffering from the
indirect effects of the economic slowdown instead of being an important cause of the
economic contraction. Moreover, taking the results at face value, we can infer that the mild
credit crunch observed in the last couple of quarters should have only small effects on
economic growth.
However, these econometric results should not be interpreted as ruling out every
14.
potential credit channel effect. In fact, Freystatter (2010) estimates a theoretical general
equilibrium model of the Finnish economy and find a positive relationship between external
credit and GDP.7 Their model assumes a financial friction in terms of an external finance

6

While the estimated individual coefficient is significant and shows an elasticity close to 0.25, the cointegration
relationship is not significant at 5 percent.

7

The difference with our pure econometric analysis is that the later imposes more restrictions on the estimated
coefficients. These restrictions come from the assumed relationship between the variables of the theoretical
model. This approach increases the risk of misspecification (that the model does not depict appropriately the
economy that is trying to explain), but it could help with identification (the restrictions may help to estimate the
relevant coefficients). In other words, the restrictions could help to identify the coefficients but at the risk of
(continued)

54
premium that entrepreneurs must paid in order to fund their investments. Additionally, this
premium is determined by the amount of leverage of these entrepreneurs. As in many other
studies using this kind of assumption, they find that changes in financial asset valuation
affect entrepreneurs’ net worth, causing sizable and protracted declines in investment and
output via endogenous increases in the external premium paid by firms.
D. Conclusions
15.
The Finland financial sector has successfully endured the indirect effects
emerging from the recent global financial crisis and the decline in economic growth.
The sector does not show major signs of distress. Moreover, financial conditions overall are
now contributing to the economy recovery.
16.
The global financial crisis had important effects in the private credit market.
The contraction in economic activity resulted in an important credit contraction. But policy
measures taken to counteract the effects of the crisis and more attractive prospects had
stabilized the credit to the private sector. Moreover, the imbalances in the credit market
created by the global financial crisis have also disappeared.
The credit market does not seem to constitute an important threat to the
17.
incipient economic recovery. Not only because the announcement of policy actions
affecting the banking sector may already be helping its recovery but also because the credit
channel does not appear to be very significant. Nevertheless the health of the banking sector
should be carefully monitored given an environment of weak economic growth with high
unemployment and low interest margins.

increasing the bias in the estimation if the assumptions of the model are not completely suitable for the Finnish
economy.

ANALYTICAL NOTE 2: INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND FINANCIAL SPILLOVERS1
1.
The trade linkages have constituted one of the main channels of contagion
through which the global financial crisis has impacted the Finnish economy.
During 2009, total trade has decreased approximately by one third in comparison with the
previous year (Table 2-1). The relative openness of the Finish economy and the concentration
of trade in a few European partners make the external sector a source of vulnerability. The
halving of exports to Russia, one of the principal trading partners, is an example of these
risks. Moreover, the relatively small exposure to the main emerging market economies could
imply that the Finnish economy will benefit little from their already observed recovery.

International financial exposures are also important with respect to some
European countries but they pose negligible risks for the Finnish economy. Most of the
claims of Finnish bank are concentrated in the main Western European countries (Table 2).
However, the claims are considerably diversified, diminishing the risks stemming from a
localized financial event. In fact, the US constitutes the highest individual exposure with less
than 5 percent of total claims abroad. We conduct a network analysis to simulate the direct
and indirect effects of a financial event (default) abroad on the Finnish banking sector. In
general, we find small effects owing to defaults in any of the relevant individual countries
with the exception of the US (Table 2-3). However, even in this case the effects are not
sizable unless we assume a rather extreme scenario of a 25 percent average default rate in all

private claims. A more pessimistic, and less probable, scenario of a 10 percent default rate
across Europe, US and Japan could reduce credit availability by approximately one third and
produce losses of up to 5 percent of GDP.

We reach similar conclusions analyzing the foreign claims in Finnish banks.
However, in this case the risks are more concentrate in some financial partners. Total
foreign claims in Finnish banks are almost equally divided between purely international
claims and local currency positions of reporting banks’ foreign offices (Table 2-4). Both the
diversification and the profile of the claims do not flag to any serious vulnerability for the
Finnish banks. Half of international claims have long term maturities (greater than one year).
However, the claims originate in a few European countries (for instance, Sweden is
associated with almost 50 percent of these claims). Hence, these countries are greatly
exposed to financial events originating in Finland. Conducting a network analysis, we
simulate the direct and indirect effects in these economies of a 5 percent default in private
claims in Finland. Not surprisingly, Sweden appears as the country suffering the biggest
effects (up to 1.5 percent of GDP), followed by Denmark (with approximately 0.5 percent of
GDP), and then by United Kingdom, Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland (with less than
0.5 percent of GDP) (Figure 2-1).

ANALYTICAL NOTE 3: THE CRISIS AND POTENTIAL OUTPUT IN FINLAND

1

1.
An accurate assessment of potential output is particularly important (and
particularly difficult) under the current circumstances. In the near term it is fundamental
for monetary and fiscal policy formulation; and in the long run it is key to assessing the
sustainability of public finances and asset prices. The usual challenges to measuring
unobservable potential output are exacerbated under the current circumstances of global
recession, large output declines and higher-than-usual uncertainty about the outlook, but mismeasurement, resulting in policy mistakes, could prove very costly.
2.
The crisis could impact supply potential through declines in labor, capital and
total factor productivity (TFP).


Rising unemployment could lead to a pause or even reversal of recent trend declines
in the NAIRU, and participation rates may decline with discouraged worker effects or
use of early retirement options.



Capital accumulation will slow with the fall in investment and a higher rate of
obsolescence amid economic restructuring and firm closures. Higher uncertainty and
risk aversion in the aftermath of the global crisis could increase borrowing costs and
credit constraints for an extended period, which would also dampen investment. In
addition, higher public debt could put upward pressure on interest rates, and higher
tax burdens in the future may reduce incentives to work and invest, which would both
be a drag on growth.



TFP growth had been declining prior to the crisis, possibly reflecting declining
competitiveness as wages grew robustly in recent years. Reduced investment
(including in intangibles and R&D), possible greater obsolescence of capital, and
greater regulation following the crisis may also reduce the pace of innovation. On the
other hand, firms also have stronger incentives to restructure and enhance efficiency.

There may, however, be some offsetting effects on potential output. As a response
3.
to the crisis, fiscal stimulus will cushion the slowdown and raise expenditure on
infrastructure. Also, reduced wealth might induce greater labor market participation. In
addition, the financial crisis might facilitate political consensus for potential-outputenhancing structural reforms—as happened following the last banking crisis in Finland

63
in 1990–93, where deep structural reforms stimulated strong potential growth that allowed
some recovery of the loss in the level of potential output.2
4.
Recent studies point to a range of estimates of medium term potential output
losses from the crisis. An OECD study finds that the crisis is likely to reduce potential
output by around 2–3 percent in the OECD.

to have a severe impact on output.
5.
In our baseline for Finland, potential growth in the medium term is lower than
pre-crisis levels, but largely reflecting the unfolding adverse demographic change.
Investment and TFP growth are projected to return to close to pre-crisis levels, as
restructuring ends and risk aversion declines. However, adverse demographics are projected
to significantly constrain growth. The contribution of labor to potential growth is projected to
rise from -¾ percent in 2010 to only to just above zero over the medium term—well below
the average of ¾ percent for 2000–07—as the working age population is projected to shrink
from 2010 onwards. However, the negative impact of shrinking working age population is
assumed to be partly offset by higher participation rates as labor supply conditions tighten.
Various staff estimates for Finland suggest that the level of potential output is
6.
falling considerably, somewhat more than the euro area.


We primarily employ the standard production function approach (PF) to estimate
potential output (as favored by the US CBO, EC, and OECD), but also utilize the HP
filter—probably the most commonly used smoothing method—for comparison. To
address the well understood end-point problems associated with smoothing using the
HP filter, we extend the series using our baseline forecast through 2015. The HP filter
is sensitive to the smoothing parameter (λ) chosen, so we settle on the standard
parameter for annual data (HP-100) and an alternative suggested by Ravn and Uhlig
(HP-RU).



The PF approach—which is the baseline projection—yields estimates of pre-crisis
potential growth that are generally higher than those from the HP filter, which could

position,” chapter 4 of OECD Economic Outlook, OECD, 2009; and World Economic Outlook, IMF, October
2009.

64
be because the crisis (and low medium term growth forecast) is causing some
backward revision in the HP filter estimates. Compared to staff’s baseline, OECD
pre-crisis estimates are higher, while, on the other hand, EC and Ministry of Finance
pre-crisis estimates are lower. Estimates from the various methods and sources
diverge for the forecast period 2009–11, and notably, OECD output gaps for 2009–11
are much larger than for the other methods, reflecting the sensitivity to assumptions
on labor, capital and TFP; and differences in growth forecasts.


Recent potential growth, pre-crisis, seems to be around 2½ percent. This is down
from previous estimates of 3¼ percent (2008 Staff Report). Looking forward, our
baseline forecast is that the crisis will reduce the overall level of potential output by
around 7 percentage points (relative to what it would have been without a crisis)
by 2015, and potential growth in 2015 is projected to be about ½ percentage point
lower as a result of the crisis—though the gap is expected to close further beyond the
medium term as TFP and investment further recover. These projections however
depend critically on the assumptions about the future path of labor and capital inputs
and TFP—all particularly uncertain—and thus are only indicative. There are both
upside and downside risks to these projections. Structural unemployment could end
up being higher than assumed here if future consolidation measures result in higher
tax wedges. Deeper structural reforms could, on the other hand, stimulate more-rapid
potential growth than in our forecast.

The large shock to international trade imparted by the global recession renders
assessments of external competitive positions unusually problematic. This problem is
particularly acute for Finland, a small open economy that has greatly benefitted from
globalization in recent decades and experienced one of the worst GDP declines in the EU last
year. Moreover, the multi-year wage negotiations for 2007–10 were concluded at an
economic peak. Although they appeared to raise wage/productivity differentials
disproportionately in the nontradable sector, increased costs may have since spilled to
tradables too, an effect compounded by the subsequent collapse of external commerce, which
is likely to have reduced profitability.
2.
Various indicators suggest that a reduced competitiveness margin has been
maintained, but faces challenges going forward.
Standard REER measures of external competitiveness are mixed, but generally

point to some modest recent deterioration. From the early 2000s, on average indicators have
moved broadly sideways. Compared to 2007, though, economy-wide REER indicators
suggest some decline in competitiveness, albeit “tradable-based” indices have deteriorated
only marginally. Notably, ULC-based measures, both general and for tradables, have
increased more than price-based ones, suggesting that profit margins may be under pressure.

with caution, though, owing to the generally lagged response in the labor bill
(particularly with multi-year wage agreements) to the sharp fall in activity.


Merchandise export market shares in both total world trade and in the EU have
been trending downward over the last twenty years. This reflects in part a secular
decline in export prices, especially for communications equipment and forestry/paper
products, as well as increasing outsourcing of production to foreign markets. In
contrast, a rising share to GDP from services exports points to a shift in Finland’s
comparative advantage to higher value-added activities. These trends have continued
during the crisis.

The multilaterally-consistent CGER methodology2, based on a panel sample of
countries, show a sizable and increasing competitiveness margin for Finland, though it
raises some methodological concerns. The margin is estimated to lie in the range of 4.3 to
15.8 percent depending on which one of the three CGER methods is used. Notably, the large
real undervaluation implied by the equilibrium real exchange approach is mainly driven by a
relative increase in Finland’s government consumption/GDP ratio, itself largely determined
by the massive decline in nominal GDP in 2009. This factor causes the equilibrium REER to
appreciate markedly in the CGER model, while the measured REER only appreciates
marginally as noted above, thereby boosting the competitiveness margin. However, such a
result is rather counterintuitive and conflicts with the prevailing trend detected by simpler
indicators as noted above.

4.
The sustainable or structural CA (“norm”) is estimated at -1 percent of GDP by
the macroeconomic balance approach. This is the current account level which can be
sustained in the long run without affecting the domestic equilibrium. The result for Finland is
mainly influenced by the dependency ratios (i.e. demographics), relative income, and past
values of the CA. In contrast, the medium term CA is in surplus, exceeding somewhat the
CA norm, but is expected to fall over the long run, reflecting the aging of the population, the
associated unwinding of pension fund savings and the trend decline in the terms of trade. The
competitiveness margin (15.8 percent) is given by the necessary adjustment in the real
exchange rate to close this gap
5.
However, panel data results can be refined by including characteristics specific
to the Finnish economy which reduce the undervaluation. The panel data approach
followed in the CGER methodology tries to identify structural characteristics that are
common to the countries in the sample, giving consistency to the analysis. However, the
panel results could understate some idiosyncratic characteristics of any individual country. In
the case of Finland, the demographic aspect is an important factor affecting the CA norm and
it differs with respect to most countries in the sample. When the panel results are reestimated incorporating the demographic trends of all countries projected for additional
20 years (long-horizon dependency ratios), the CA Norm for Finland increases to a positive
0.25 percent of GDP, reducing the undervaluation to 7.5 percent.
6.
As a final robustness check, we re-estimate the CA norm consistent with the
macroeconomic balance approach but following a time series analysis. In this case, the
CA norm increases to 0.6 percent of GDP, which implies an undervaluation of 6.2 percent.
Note that this exercise, in discarding information about other countries, could be biased by
the recent history of the Finnish economy, even when controlling for easily identifiable
extraordinary events (financial crisis of early 90’s). In other words, it does not take into
account structural common characteristics which could help to better quantify the structural
adjustment needed to close the external gap on the Finnish CA. However, it provides
additional support to the conclusion that the undervaluation is smaller than envisioned by the
standard macroeconomic balance approach.

ANALYTICAL NOTE 5: LONG RUN FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY IN FINLAND1
This note provides an updated assessment of fiscal sustainability in Finland. The
1.
latest estimates of aging pressures from ECFIN are incorporated in the analysis, as well as
the implications of the recent weakening in the fiscal position. We conclude that there has
been a marked deterioration in fiscal sustainability, and the sustainability gap is much larger
than previously estimated. Measures to help erase the sustainability gap are briefly discussed,
as well as optimal fiscal consolidation paths.
A. Recent Fiscal Developments and Outlook
2.
The fiscal position deteriorated sharply in 2009, reversing years of impressive
performance. The headline balance declined from a surplus of 4 percent of GDP in 2008 to
a deficit of 2½ percent of GDP in 2009. The deterioration reflected both structural loosening
and the free operation of automatic stabilizers. Expenditure rose by 6 percent of GDP, with
broad-based increases but led by social benefits, which rose 2¾ percent of GDP. Revenues
declined modestly by ½ percent of GDP, as a decline of 1 percent of GDP in tax revenue was
mostly offset by increases in social contributions. Alongside, the structural balance is
estimated to have declined from a surplus of 1¾ percent of GDP in 2008 to near zero
in 2009. Public debt rose by 9¾ percentage points to 44 percent of GDP in 2009, after
declining continuously since 2003.
3.
Further fiscal deterioration is expected in 2010. The headline fiscal balance is
expected to decline by 1¾ percentage points to a deficit slightly above 4 percent of GDP,
breaching the SGP limits, primarily reflecting substantial discretionary stimulus. Expenditure
is expected to increase by 1¼ percent of GDP, while revenues are expected to decline by
½ percent of GDP, led by further declines in direct taxes, reflecting a modest reduction in the
income tax burden. Overall, discretionary stimulus is estimated at 1½ percent of GDP
for 2010. Together with the measures for 2009, this is one of the largest stimulus packages in
the euro area, and the estimated decline in the structural primary balance in 2010
(1½ percentage points to a deficit of ¼ percent of GDP) reflects the stimulus measures.
The authorities plan to begin consolidation in the 2011 budget, as the global
4.
recession abates. The authorities have signaled that energy taxes and employee and
employer contributions to the employment pension will be raised starting in 2011. Moreover,
the full-year effect of a one percentage point increase in VAT rates from July 1, 2010, will
also help improve revenues for 2011. Expenditure moderation is also envisaged. On this
basis, revenues are expected to rise by 1½ percent of GDP, while expenditures decline by
½ percent of GDP. Overall, the fiscal balance is expected to improve by two percentage

70
points to 2¼ percent of GDP, alongside a structural improvement of about 1¼ percent of
GDP.
5.
As a result, the starting point to assess sustainability is markedly worse than
staff and authorities had previously envisaged. In the 2008 Stability Program, the
authorities had projected a structural surplus of 2 percent of GDP in 2010, 3½ percentage
points of GDP better than staff’s latest projection.
B. Fiscal Sustainability has Deteriorated
6.
Recent ECFIN baseline estimates of aging pressures for Finland are in the midrange in comparison with other European countries. From 2007–60, aging pressures are
estimated to add 6.4 percent of GDP to fiscal expenditures in Finland, moderately above the
median of 5.3 percent of GDP across the European Union. The increase for Finland is
composed of increased pension expenditure of 3.3 percent of GDP, higher long-term care
expenditure of 2.6 percent of GDP, higher health-care expenditure of one percent of GDP,
and reduced education and unemployment-benefit expenditures of 0.3 and 0.2 percent of
GDP, respectively.

used. A variety of alternative scenarios run by ECFIN suggest that the increase in aging
related expenditures could vary between 5.8 and 7.4 percentage points of GDP, with the
worst case being one of zero immigration, while a scenario with higher employment rate is
the best case.

The sustainability indicator used is based on the general government
intertemporal budget constraint. This is the same approach as the S2 sustainability
indicator used in the EC’s sustainability reports.2 The sustainability gap is the defined as the
constant change to the primary balance (in percent of GDP), over an infinite horizon, such
that the intertemporal budget constraint is satisfied. In turn, the intertemporal budget
constraint is satisfied if the discounted sum of future primary surpluses is sufficient to offset
the initial debt stock. Assuming that GDP grows at a constant rate and given a constant
discount rate, some algebraic manipulation yields the following formula for the sustainability
gap, as calculated in period 0:

72
surplus in percent of GDP in period t , respectively. In staff’s analysis the starting year
(period 0) is taken to be 2011.
9.
Staff’s estimate of the sustainability gap has increased substantially, primarily
reflecting the ongoing deterioration in the fiscal position. Given that deterioration, the
estimate of the sustainability gap has increased substantially, from 1½–2½ percent of GDP in
the 2008 Article IV consultation to about 6 percent of GDP. While higher pension payments
would also increase tax receipts on pension income, this offers only a small offset to the
increase in the sustainability gap. However, the sustainability gap could turn out to be
somewhat smaller if the external current account surplus unwinds as a rising number of
retirees draw down their accumulated pensions, raising consumption-based tax revenues over
the long run as share of output. But the size of this effect is quite uncertain however.
10.
Staff’s estimate is somewhat higher than the authorities and ECFIN, but
significantly below that of the OECD. Staff’s estimate is ½ percentage point higher than
the authorities’ latest estimate, and about 2 percentage points higher than the European
Commission’s estimates produced in 2009. The authorities’ smaller estimate reflects in part
the fact that the starting date for their analysis is 2015, and therefore includes the impact of
some consolidation measures envisaged to take place by then. The difference with the EC
estimates arises from the fact that they assume a structural primary balance for 2010 that is
1¼ percent of GDP higher than in staff’s projections, and a debt stock in 2010 (the initial
debt stock in our projection) that is about 4¼ percent of GDP lower than in staff’s
projections. In contrast, the OECD estimates a sustainability gap of 8 percent of GDP,
significantly higher than staff, largely reflecting a much lower structural primary balance.
11.
Absent corrective measures, public debt would be projected to rise to over
400 percent of GDP by 2060 in view of the large sustainability gap. Alongside, the
structural primary deficit excluding property income is projected to increase by 5 percentage
points to 9 percent of GDP, while the overall fiscal deficit deteriorates by 22 percentage
points to 26 percent of GDP as interest payments consume an ever-increasing share of fiscal
expenditure. In contrast, immediate full adjustment implies that gross debt is driven to zero
by 2024, with a notable buildup of government assets thereafter to help defray the long-run
costs of aging.
While immediate full adjustment on the scale required is implausible, delaying
12.
adjustment requires a somewhat higher long-run primary surplus target to ensure
sustainability. Staff estimate that phasing in the adjustment over a 10 year period, with some
front-loading to entrench credibility, requires structural measures totaling 6½ percent of GDP
for sustainability. In comparison, delaying the onset of adjustment for 10 years would require
structural measures totaling 7 percent of GDP for sustainability. In general, slower
adjustment is associated with a higher path for public debt.

1/ The no measures scenario assumes that the structural position in 2011 is unchanged from 2010, and
thereafter deteriorates with aging. The plausible adjustment scenario corresponds to the variable weights
scenario in the text table on illustrative optimal annual fiscal adjustment under a quadratic loss function,
and envisages the sustainability gap being closed by 2020.

74
C. Measures to Achieve Sustainability
13.
The bulk of the fiscal stimulus measures are of a permanent nature, and explicit
measures will be needed to exit once recovery firms. Of the total stimulus for 2009–10 of
about 3¼ percent of GDP, only about one-third are temporary, implying that without explicit
corrective measures, the stimulus will add about 2 percent of GDP permanently to the
structural fiscal deficit. Thus, once the recovery has firmed measures will be needed to offset
this relaxation in a time-bound fashion.
With the revenue ratio already high, there is little scope for further increases in
14.
the tax burden. The focus on the revenue side should therefore be on base broadening and a
shift from labor taxation to consumption and property based taxation. Reduced labor taxation
would help stimulate employment and output, while consumption and property based taxes
are generally less distortionary. In this regard, recent reductions in income tax rates, the
planned increase in VAT rates by one percentage point in mid-2010, and plans to raise
energy taxes are steps in the right direction, and more should be done, including by reducing
the number of items on reduced VAT rates. In addition, property taxation is currently
relatively low, and could be increased, creating scope for reducing the reliance of
municipalities on highly cyclical corporate taxes.
15.
Expenditure measures will need to take the brunt of adjustment. This reflects
both the already high revenue ratio and the fact that international evidence generally
indicates that expenditure-based consolidations have been more successful. In this regard, the
focus will need to be on reducing the impact of aging on fiscal expenditures, and an overhaul
of local government—where expenditures have been rising fastest in recent years. Some
reduction of the generosity of the social and unemployment benefits system is likely to be
needed as part of the fiscal consolidation package. Tuition fees and a reduction of student
grants in favor of loans at the tertiary education level would also be helpful in generating
expenditure savings.
16.
Measures to directly contain the impact of aging on the public finances should be
a key plank of efforts to secure sustainability. In this regard, further pension reform is
needed. The decomposition of the projected buildup in pension pressures indicates that the
increase arises from a pronounced increase in the old-age dependency ratio, which is
projected to be partly offset by tightening of eligibility rules. However, more could be done.
The OECD notes that the average effective retirement age is about 60, and estimates that
raising it to 67 would be sufficient to close the sustainability gap. Such a large increase
would be very challenging to achieve, but clearly, movement in this direction should be a
major focus of adjustment efforts. Other areas where there is scope for savings include the
lowering the accrual rate for pension benefits—particularly for periods of parental leave,
unemployment and education—and tightening access to early retirement via disability or
unemployment. For example, the number of persons on disability pension is estimated at

75
about 9 percent of the labor force, which appears excessive. The authorities do not dispute
need for such measures. Indeed, measures already taken are expected to raise the average
effective retirement age by 1½ years by 2025, and working groups have been tasked with
formulating reforms to generate a further 1½ years increase by 2025. Also, from 2010
onward new pensions will be adjusted downward by a life expectancy coefficient, helping to
reduce the impact of aging on pension expenditure.

17.
Eligibility, entitlements, and arrangements for old-age care could also be
revisited, as this is an area where aging pressures will be significant. The projected
increase in long-term care spending for Finland is well above the median for the EU, which
suggests that reforms drawing on lessons from other EU countries could yield substantial
savings.
An overhaul of local government is also needed. Spending at the municipal level
18.
has grown faster than in other parts of general government. While some of these spending
pressures may have been inevitable given that municipalities are responsible for education,
social services, and health care, the OECD estimates that municipality productivity has
declined by about 10 percent over 2000–08. Productivity declines have been most marked in
social work and health. Alongside, municipal tax rates have increased—and several
municipalities implemented additional significant tax hikes in 2010—partially offsetting
reductions in central government taxation in recent years. Soft budget constraints have

76
helped encourage fiscal slippages, with buoyant (and highly cyclical) corporate taxation
enabling strong expenditure growth in good times.
19.
There is need to harden municipal budget constraints and reduce the cyclicality
of their revenues, thus strengthening incentives to generate expenditure savings. The
reliance on corporate taxes at municipal level should be reduced, with this offset by higher
property taxation or central government transfers. At the same time, a ceiling on municipality
income tax rates, and restraint in the growth of central government transfers would
strengthen incentives for expenditure consolidation at municipal level. Also, the scope for
competitive bidding for the provision of services to municipalities should be broadened to
generate cost savings. Finally, there is also scope for efficiency gains through mergers of
municipalities, as the median population of municipalities is less than 5,000.
20.
Improving the rate of return on public financial assets would also help in
reducing the sustainability gap. Gross financial assets totaled about 90 percent of GDP
in 2008, and substantial portions of these assets are low-yielding, reflecting a cautious
investment approach. Given the large stock of assets, an asset management strategy that
generates a modest increase in returns could make a significant contribution to closing the
sustainability gap.
21.
The pace of consolidation will reflect the balancing of the government’s twin
stated objectives of reducing both the output and the fiscal sustainability gaps. Given
the large negative output gaps projected in 2009–10, the intention to delay consolidation
until 2011 implies essentially that a zero weight is placed on the sustainability gap over the
short run. Beyond that horizon, however, different government preferences will lead to
different consolidation paths. Text Table A1 illustrates various consolidation paths assuming
the authorities’ preferences are governed by a quadratic loss function, with the different paths
reflecting different weights on the output and sustainability gaps.

A plausible adjustment path could be one where the weight placed on the
sustainability gap rises over time. This would be consistent with a pace of consolidation
where the sustainability gap is erased over a 10-year horizon, with some front loading to
strengthen credibility. The “plausible adjustment” path shown in the panel chart on fiscal
sustainability corresponds to variable weights on the sustainability and output gaps,
respectively increasing and decreasing over the 2011–20 period (see Footnote 4 of Table 51).

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Finland
August 25, 2010
1.
This statement summarizes developments in Finland since the issuance of the
staff report. The additional information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
The authorities have revised national accounts estimates for 2007–09. Real GDP
2.
is now reported to have declined by 8 percent last year, compared to the 7.8 percent
estimated previously. Revisions for 2007–08 envisage higher growth in 2007 largely
offsetting lower expansion in 2008.
3.
The authorities and staff have lowered fiscal deficit projections for 2010–12,
given the better-than-expected outturn in the first half of 2010.


Corporate tax receipts thus far in 2010 have been significantly higher than
anticipated. Social contributions have also overperformed. In addition,
unemployment-related expenditures have been lower than planned. As a result, staff
now projects the deficit for 2010 at 3.4 percent of GDP (instead of the previous
4.1 percent of GDP).



In light of the stronger 2010 position, general government deficit projections for 2011
and 2012 have been lowered by about ½ percent of GDP, to 1.8 percent of GDP and
2 percent of GDP, respectively. Accordingly, the fiscal sustainability gap should be
reduced to 5–5 ½ percent of GDP.



On July 13, ECOFIN opened an excessive deficit procedure for Finland. However,
with the revisions to fiscal prospects noted above, the headline deficit can be brought
within the 3 percent of GDP threshold of the SGP in 2011 even without additional
measures owing to more favorable cyclical conditions. This improved fiscal outlook
lends additional support to staff’s advice that the pace of budgetary consolidation
in 2011 should be moderate.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with Finland
On August, 25, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Finland.1
Background
Finland’s economy has been dealt a severe blow by the global crisis and the recovery is slow.
Owing to the high dependence of its exports on countries and commodities severely impacted
by the downturn, Finland experienced the worst recession in the euro area in 2009, with gross
domestic product (GDP) collapsing by 8 percent in 2009. Growth was mildly negative in both the
final quarter of 2009 and the first quarter of 2010, technically putting Finland in a double-dip
recession. A moderate resumption of growth is projected, with output expanding by 1¼ percent
in 2010 and around 2 percent in 2011, although the outlook is unusually uncertain.
The impact of the crisis on employment and inflation was contained. The unemployment rate
rose relatively little from 6½ to 8¼ percent during 2008–09 reflecting the absence of evident
domestic bubbles, voluntary job hoarding given early population aging, and the governmentsubsidized temporary employment-support program. The labor market is anticipated to lag the
pick-up in activity, with unemployment hitting 83 4 percent in 2010. Inflation turned down
markedly in 2009. However, it has outpaced the EU average since late 2008, in part as the
result of generous multi-year collective wage agreements in 2007 that were generally in excess
of productivity gains. As a result, external competitiveness has deteriorated but remains
adequate.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

With fiscal policy turning to support growth, the budget position worsened sharply in 2009,
reversing years of impressive performance. The general government headline balance went
abruptly from a surplus of 4 percent of GDP in 2008 to a deficit of 2½ percent of GDP in 2009.
In 2010 the headline fiscal balance is expected to drop to a deficit of 3½ percent of GDP,
breaching the Stability and Growth Pact limits. This deterioration primarily reflects further
structural relaxation of around 1 percent of GDP implying only a small structural primary fiscal
surplus in 2010.
The banking system has weathered the global turmoil well thanks to healthy capital buffers and
prudent management. Finnish banks have limited exposure to opaque structured products or
vulnerable countries, including those within Europe. The country’s stern regulatory and
supervisory environment has helped shield the financial sector from the worst of the crisis.
Profitability and asset quality have deteriorated in the turmoil, while capital coverage has
dropped, but remained well above regulatory minima. The financial condition of insurance
companies and pension funds recovered in 2009 after sharply weakening in 2008.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their continued strong policies, which
helped mitigate the impact of the global crisis. Because of their geographic distribution and
product composition, Finland’s exports have been particularly hard hit by the global downturn
in 2009, and the economy experienced a severe recession. Looking ahead, while a gradual
recovery is anticipated for 2010–11, the outlook remains highly uncertain. Directors
underscored that a possible permanent loss of output, along with rapid population aging,
would heighten challenges to growth and fiscal sustainability.
Directors agreed that the financial system had weathered the global turbulence well, thanks to
healthy capital buffers, prudent management, and vigilant supervision. They noted staff’s
assessment that direct exposure to opaque structured products or highly vulnerable countries
is limited and spillover risks are manageable. Nevertheless, they encouraged the authorities to
remain vigilant and focus their efforts on improving bank cost efficiency, preventing excessive
risk taking, and limiting liquidity and funding risks. In light of the high degree of foreign
ownership of banks, Directors agreed that it is crucial to further strengthen the effectiveness of
cross-border supervision and crisis management arrangements, and welcomed the recent
establishment of the Nordic-Baltic Stability Group.
Directors supported the ongoing stimulatory fiscal stance to confront the economic downturn,
but noted that strong and credible consolidation would be called for starting in 2011. In this
context, many Directors concurred with the authorities’ plans for a relatively large fiscal
adjustment already in 2011. Considering the large uncertainties still surrounding the extent of
the economic recovery, many other Directors, however, supported a more moderate pace of
fiscal consolidation in 2011 which, in their view, would better achieve the balance between the
twin objectives of restoring fiscal sustainability and allowing the recovery to continue.

3

Over the medium term, Directors endorsed a gradual closing of the sustainability gap by 2020.
They concurred that fiscal adjustment efforts should focus on expenditure restraint, while efforts
could also be made to broaden the tax base, including through higher property and indirect
taxes and by reducing the number of items on reduced VAT rates and other special treatments.
Directors stressed that, with growing pressures from an aging population, it is important that the
authorities take the necessary measures to increase the effective retirement age, enhance
efficiency in the provision of public services, and contain demand for these services to secure
fiscal sustainability.
Directors concurred that Finland maintains an adequate margin of external competitiveness.
They noted, however, that competitiveness has been eroded recently by large wage increases,
which would have to be commensurate with productivity growth going forward.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ continued commitment to structural reforms, particularly in
the labor market, in view of Finland’s aging population. They underscored the importance of
increasing labor utilization and productivity growth to enhance potential output and improve the
long-tem fiscal position. Directors encouraged the authorities to consider measures to further
limit the transition to early retirement via unemployment and disability, and boost employment
among the young. They also supported actions to increase competition and foster research and
entrepreneurship.

Statement by Per Callesen, Executive Director for Finland
and Kari Jukka Korhonen, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
August 25, 2010
1.

The Finnish authorities welcome the candid dialogue with staff during this year's
Article IV Consultation and the FSAP Update mission and wish to thank staff for the
comprehensive analysis and pertinent recommendations.

2.

The collapse of world trade following the global financial crisis hit Finland very hard
in 2009. Driven by the rapid decline of external demand, Finland's economy
plummeted by 8 percent in 2009. The worst is, however, over and gradual recovery is
under way. Significant stimulus measures to counter the crisis were made possible by
preceding fiscal surpluses. The measures contributed to a better than projected
employment situation in spite of the deep recession. Companies opted for temporary
lay-offs rather than permanent dismissals in order to hold on to skilled labor in
anticipation of future labor shortages based on the age profile of the population.

3.

The long-run potential output growth may have been lowered due to the deep
recession and consequently the trend level of output has most likely been reduced.
The authorities share staff’s concern about fiscal sustainability in view of the rapidly
aging population and pressures on health care, pension and old age care funding.

4.

Finland's financial system was naturally affected by the global turmoil, but financial
conditions remained stable even during the worst of the crisis. The financial sector is
well regulated and supervised and the banking sector is resilient to common adverse
shocks. There are, nevertheless, areas ̵ as pointed out by staff ̵ that should be further
strengthened. The authorities, by and large, agree with the FSSA Update assessments.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook

5.

The latest indicators on economic activity point to a return to growth during the
second quarter, fuelled mainly by recovery of exports and private consumption.
According to the authorities’ latest forecast - that is slightly more optimistic than
staff’s view - real GDP is expected to grow by 1.5 percent in 2010 and by 2.5 percent
in both 2011 and 2012. However, in the light of the recent data, there are mounting
upside risks to the authorities’ GDP forecast for 2010 and 2011. Stronger than
expected recovery of world trade and economic activity has started to feed in to the
Finnish economy. The volume of industrial output is now about 15 percent higher
than a year ago and new orders have increased rapidly during the past few months.
Consequently, the value of exports has skyrocketed in the last few months leading to
a quarterly growth of 13 percent in Q2.

6.

Also consumer confidence and employment has improved during the summer, which
points to a pick-up in private consumption. The employment situation remained better
than anticipated during the deep downturn partly because temporary lay-offs did not

86
turn into dismissals. The number of unemployed has continued to decline during the
summer. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stood at 8.2 percent in June
compared with the turn of the year level of 8.9 percent. There are signs that housing
construction is recovering rapidly and the sector's outlook is encouraging, based on a
pick-up in housing permits, but commercial real estate is yet to show robust signs of
improvement. In line with improving housing construction and low interest rates, real
house prices have rebounded on a strong note and are at record high levels that call
for monitoring. The authorities share staff’s concern that possible continuation of the
accelerated trend would point to increasing hazards.
7.

Despite the recent pick-up in industrial production and exports, external
competitiveness remains on the watch list. The authorities agree that Finland’s
external competitiveness position has deteriorated since the last Article IV
discussions, and as noted in Analytical Note 4, merchandise export market shares
have trended downwards. In 2008 and 2009, unit labor costs increased faster than in
any other Euro area country, at twice the pace of the Euro area average. This was due
both to increases in labor costs and a deterioration in productivity. The increase in
labor costs was driven by high pay rises negotiated in 2007 for a three-year period,
which were not adjusted downwards when the business cycle dramatically turned.

8.

In 2011, as the global economic activity continues to recover, the outlook for Finland
also looks brighter. Both exports and imports are forecast to grow steadily while both
trade and current accounts will remain in surplus, as also noted in the staff report.
Along with the recovery, the national consumer price inflation is forecast to
accelerate to 2.5 percent next year partly due to the rise in indirect taxes and past
hikes in import price levels.
Fiscal Policy

9.

Finland entered the recession from a strong position of public finances in 2008 (the
general government surplus was 4.2 percent of GDP), but the deterioration in public
finances at around 7 percentage points relative to GDP was exceptionally large in
2009. The deterioration in economic activity has been particularly apparent in central
government accounts, which comprise tax items that are the most sensitive to cyclical
fluctuations. In addition, automatic stabilizers have been allowed to operate freely,
and discretionary stimulus measures by bringing forward public investment, cutting
taxation and facilitating funding opportunities for businesses have adversely affected
the financial position of general government.

10.

While economic growth improves this year, according to the latest official forecast,
the authorities expect the general government deficit to deepen further to 3.2 percent
of GDP. Given the resumption of economic growth, the tightening of taxation and the
increase of social security contributions, the general government’s fiscal position will

87
start improving in 2011 though still remaining in deficit and amounting to 1.3 percent
of GDP.
11.

First steps towards consolidation of public finances are being taken. Both the general
and reduced value-added tax rates were raised by one percentage point at the
beginning of July 2010. In addition, according to the government's 2011 budget
proposal, an excise duty on sweets will be introduced and the excise duty on soft
drinks will be expanded as of 1 January 2011. Further, energy taxes will be increased
from the beginning of 2011. The government has also respected the expenditure
ceilings for the central government set in the beginning of the government term.
Despite these measures, the budget proposal ends up with a borrowing requirement of
around 8.5 billion euro.

12.

The authorities note that due to the measures included in the budget proposal, the
fiscal stance is turning from expansionary to restrictive next year. Given the
improving cyclical situation and sizable sustainability gap, the authorities see a
slightly tighter fiscal stance warranted for 2011 than what is recommended by staff.

13.

The authorities take note of staff's recommendations on broadening the tax base and
reducing the number of items on lower VAT. The government has set lower VAT
rates on selected items or services for particular reasons such as employment
promotion.

14.

The authorities agree with staff’s assessment, according to which the sustainability
gap is estimated to have increased substantially to over 5 percent of GDP.
Accordingly, the authorities share staff's concern about the long-term fiscal
sustainability and are committed to fiscal consolidation, which is reflected in the
newly published 2011 budget proposal. The authorities stress that several measures as
suggested by staff have been introduced during recent years. These include reforms
aimed at increasing effective retirement age, implementing further mergers of
municipalities, increasing the upper and lower real estate tax rates, measures aimed at
raising productivity of public services, and raising user fees on public services.

15.

The authorities concur that the continuation of consolidation measures is a challenge
for the economic policy during the next few years. In addition to policy measures
aimed at strengthening the position of general government finances, structural
reforms supporting growth and the sustainability of general government finances
should form an integral part of the consolidation strategy. The Government has set as
a target the implementation of measures aimed at extending working careers by three
years by 2025. Moreover, projects initiated earlier can be used to support the
productivity of the public administration and public service provision, which is
important in terms of sustainability. Through the structural reform of municipalities
and public services, the production practices and organisation of services offered by
municipalities will be developed, and an effort made to strengthen the financial basis

88
of the arrangement and provision of services. A productivity project will enhance
public sector activity and reallocate labour. In the future, particular attention will be
paid to developing the productivity of municipal services.
Labor and Product Market Reforms
16.

The authorities share staff's views on the need to continue reforming labor and
product markets. As for lengthening working careers, some measures have already
been taken to speed up the entry into tertiary education and to shorten the time spent
in studies. Further reforms in the field of education are in preparation in the Ministry
of Education and Culture, including reforming the financial support system so that it
gives more incentives for both the organizers of education and students to graduate.
Also, the introduction of tuition fees as well as user fees for public services have been
widely discussed but face opposition in society, and are hence unlikely to be imposed
in the near future.

17.

The increasing need to raise the effective retirement age is widely acknowledged. The
financing of the earnings-related pension system needs to be secured by an increase in
pension contributions, which is not too high so as to hamper employment and
economic growth. Working careers need to be extended sufficiently to this end. The
authorities share staff’s concern relating to the unemployment and disability
pipelines.

Some of the measures suggested by staff, such as liberalization of shop opening hours
and municipal mergers, have already been implemented. The number of
municipalities has been reduced from over 400 to some 300 over the past decade and
additional mergers are expected in the future. It is widely accepted that we need to
increase competition in services, public administration, and local governments; but
building the consensus necessary for change in these areas takes time and is an
ongoing process.
Financial Sector and Financial System Stability Assessment Update

19.

The authorities appreciate the detailed assessment and advice presented in the FSSA
Update report based on the findings of staff's FSAP Update mission in the spring. The
benefits of an independent evaluation cannot be exaggerated. The extensive
discussions and exchange of views during the staff visit were most welcome. The
authorities value and see merit in staff’s recommendations and will give them careful
consideration.

As the financial sector assessment findings suggest, the overall picture of the Finnish
financial sector is reassuring. The banks endured the financial crisis well in
international comparison mainly due to adequate capital reserves and conservative
management practices which resulted in very limited exposure to vulnerable
European countries and high-risk products. The reports raised two main concerns on

89
banks, namely profitability and liquidity and funding risks. The authorities share
staff’s concern about exceptionally low net interest margins and as a consequence a
squeeze on banks’ profitability. In fact, the authorities have repeatedly voiced their
concern to the financial community and the mortgage borrowers, and the FIN-FSA
has urged stress testing with interest rates at 6 percent on new mortgages at variable
short rates as well as limits on the LTVs used in new mortgages. Insurance companies
and pension funds suffered due to a large drop in equity prices during the financial
crisis, but the situation has improved along with the recovery of equity markets.
21.

The financial sector supervision is assessed as robust, but because the banking system
is significantly foreign-owned and concentrated, effective cross-border supervision is
of utmost importance. The authorities are in agreement with staff that there is room
for strengthening both the regulatory and supervisory frameworks. In particular,
cross-border supervision at the Nordic and EU level would benefit from closer
cooperation. In this context, supervisory colleges have been established for financial
groups operating in Nordic countries, and home and host supervisors participate in
the work of the colleges, with the focus on joint monitoring of risks, building on
systems for improved information sharing and reporting. In view of the ongoing
reform agenda at the European Union and international levels, the authorities support
harmonization of regulation, supervision, and bank resolution frameworks both at the
European and global level.

In August, the Nordic and Baltic authorities concluded a MoU to further strengthen
cross-border cooperation pertaining to financial groups and the relevant
infrastructure. The region has made almost unprecedented progress in this respect.
The MoU included in addition to conventional cooperation arrangements, a
preliminary framework for discussing eventual burden sharing agreements that could
be struck in the event of jointly agreed and implemented crisis management actions
related to a financial group with significant activities in the region.
