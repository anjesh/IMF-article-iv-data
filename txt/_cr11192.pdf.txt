PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 27, 2011

KEY POINTS
Focus. The consultation examined the macroeconomic outlook, the potential for a property
price bubble, the risks to the banking system, and the policy measures underpinning the
12th Five-Year Plan. The mission drew on the work of the FSAP—to connect financial sector
reform to macroeconomic rebalancing—and of the spillover team—to trace out the
international implications of rebalancing in China.
Macroeconomic Policies. The ongoing withdrawal of monetary stimulus is fully appropriate
but a greater weight should be given to the use of higher interest rates and nominal
appreciation in tightening monetary conditions. A continued steady decline in the fiscal
deficit is also warranted, accompanied by a reorienting of tax and expenditure policies to
support consumption.
Risks. The main near-term domestic risks to the outlook are from higher-than-expected
inflation (most likely from domestic food supply shocks), a property bubble that inflates and
then bursts, or a decline in credit quality linked to the post-crisis expansion in lending.
Rebalancing. There has been much progress on a number of fronts and the 12th Five-Year
Plan lays out a comprehensive strategy to advance the transformation of China’s growth
model. To achieve these goals, a range of measures will be needed including improvements
in the social safety net, policies to raise household income, a liberalization of the financial
system, a stronger currency, and increases in the costs of various factors of production. A
successful rebalancing, with policy changes on all these fronts, will generate positive
spillovers to the global economy.
Financial Liberalization. Financial reform holds significant promise in contributing to the
needed transformation of the Chinese economy. Over the horizon of the 12th Five-Year Plan,
reforms should seek to secure a more modern framework for monetary management,
improve supervision and regulation, deepen the channels for financial intermediation,
transition to market-determined deposit and loan rates, and open the capital account. In all
of this, a stronger renminbi will be an important complement.

backdrop that the 12th Five-Year Plan had been

Box 1. Highlights From China’s 12th Five-Year Plan
Coverage. The 12th Five-Year Plan is a high level
strategic document that outlines the directions for
policy and reform in the coming years and sets
specific targets on certain areas (such as growth,
urbanization, energy use, and others). In many
areas, though, the plan does not yet detail the
concrete steps that will be put in place to achieve
these social and economic goals.
Themes. Rebalancing growth from exports to
consumption remains a central theme of the plan
with an emphasis on “accelerating the
transformation of the pattern of economic
development”
by
enhancing
productivity,
supporting innovation, and investing in human
capital. The priority has also shifted away from the
absolute level of growth toward its quality and
impact on “people’s livelihood.”
Internal balance. The government has promised
increased support for agriculture and the service
sector as well as a more balanced regional
development by harnessing urbanization and
supporting the relocation of industries to the
interior.

4.

Household income. To boost consumption, the
plan targets a needed growth in disposable
income—for both urban and rural residents—that
outstrips that for the economy as a whole,
reversing the secular decline in household income
as a share of GDP.
Safety net. There are plans to further increase the
coverage of the health and pension systems and
provide low income housing for up to 20 percent of
urban households.
Technology and environment. The plan targets
moving up the value chain in manufacturing
through technological upgrade and promoting
investment in strategic industries. There is also a
continued emphasis on clean energy and increases
in input costs to better price pollution externalities.
Financial reform. Over the next five years, the
government intends to move toward more marketbased interest rates and capital account
convertibility.

Fiscal policy. The significant monetary

and fiscal stimulus put in place in late 2008 has
been effective in offsetting the growth impact
of the collapse in external demand. There was
broad agreement that with growth now selfsustaining, it is fully appropriate to gradually
unwind the fiscal stimulus. Staff argued that
the fiscal position should return to broad
budget balance in the next one to two years,
allowing fiscal policy to be modestly countercyclical. Should growth prospects deteriorate,
a slower or delayed path of fiscal consolidation
would be warranted. The authorities indicated
that budget decisions would be taken on an
annual basis at the time of the National
People’s Congress and would very much
depend on the prevailing economic situation.
They underlined their commitment to devote
more resources to social expenditures and
rural development and to raise the minimum
threshold of the personal income tax. Even
with a reduction in the deficit over the nearterm, staff argued that there should still be
ample scope to reallocate fiscal resources

toward tax and spending policies that promote
private consumption.

and the authorities agreed that monetary
stimulus should be withdrawn and the target
of 16 percent M2 growth by end-year (down
from 19.7 percent at end-2010) represented a
steady return to more normal monetary
conditions that was well calibrated to the
current

environment.

Achieving this goal would help mitigate the
risks to bank balance sheets posed by the very
rapid expansion of lending that had occurred
over the past two years.

Box 2. The Links Between Onshore and Offshore Renminbi Markets
The renminbi holds significant potential to become widely used internationally due to China’s large economic
size, diversified trade structure and network, and high growth rates. Yet, nonresident access to renminbidenominated assets remains limited. Despite this, in a historically unprecedented process of market
development, renminbi trade settlement with nonresidents has expanded rapidly and the issuance of renminbidenominated assets in Hong Kong SAR is growing. This could have implications for the links between offshore
and onshore markets even with binding capital controls in place.
Using a multivariate GARCH model, the links
between the offshore renminbi markets in Hong
Kong SAR (CNH) and the onshore renminbi (CNY)
spot and forward markets were examined. 1
Results
The movements in CNH and CNY are highly
correlated and the connection between the two
markets was stabilized following the activation in
October of the renminbi swap line between the
People’s Bank of China and the Hong Kong
Monetary Authority.

 Nevertheless, offshore forward markets do
seem to move ahead of onshore forwards. In
particular, today’s CNH 3-month forward rate
has a predictive impact on tomorrow’s CNY
forward rate but not vice versa. This could be
due to either price discovery being faster in
the Hong Kong markets (due to their full
integration with global markets) or, potentially,
that onshore market participants may be
looking to the CNH market for pricing signals
in setting onshore rates.

 There is also evidence of two-way volatility
spillovers between CNY and CNH, especially in
the forward markets.
The results suggest that the ongoing process of
RMB internationalization is already leading to
spillovers from offshore to onshore markets
despite the wide-ranging capital controls. These
linkages are only likely to grow as the market
develops and liquidity improves.

previous year) and gradually rise to around
8 percent of GDP by 2015.

2010 at around 5¼ percent of GDP. The evolution
of the current account surplus was dominated by
two factors (i) a deterioration in the terms of trade
and a ramp up in the volume of raw material
imports; and (ii) a revision in the accounting for
non-remitted income on FDI investments that
lowered the current account by ¾ and ½ percent
of GDP in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Despite
these countervailing forces, the 2010 outturn was
still ¼ percent of GDP higher than staff had
forecasted a year ago.
The outlook. Looking ahead, the staff’s forecast
assumes a steady fiscal consolidation at the level of
the general government, continued recovery in
external demand, and, importantly, a real effective
exchange rate that remains at current levels. In
addition, the recent changes in accounting
methodology have been incorporated into staff
forecasts.

underpinned by various modeling techniques,
including a Bayesian Vector Autoregression (BVAR)

What do market analysts expect? The median
long-range forecasts of private analysts show the
current account will fall to below 3 percent of GDP
by 2015. However, it is important to note that these
forecasts assume, on average, a real effective
appreciation of 23 percent over the next five years.

Box 5. Recent Achievements In Financial Sector Reform
Over the last decade, China has made considerable progress in moving toward a more liberal and marketbased financial system.
Bank Commercialization. Banks’ internal risk
management and accounting practices have been
strengthened, with foreign strategic partners helping
to implement international best practices. The main
banks have been listed on foreign markets, helping
to strengthen investor oversight and control and
ensure compliance with international accounting
standards. A large volume of bad loans—over
15 percent of GDP in 1999—was carved out and
placed in asset management companies while the
banks were recapitalized with government support.
Regulation and Supervision. The regulatory
infrastructure has been significantly improved with
the establishment of individual regulators for
insurance, banking and securities markets. Within
these agencies, capacities for supervision have been
strengthened, and a regulatory infrastructure that
meets international standards has been put in place.
Laws on new companies, trusts, securities and
investment funds have also been enacted, providing
a modern framework
for
capital market
development.

Fixed Income. Interest rates on a range of fixed
income instruments have been allowed to be
determined more by market forces. In addition, an
interbank bond market was established to allow
corporations to raise funds from securities markets,
reducing their dependence on the banking system
for credit.
Financial Centers. Shanghai has become a critical
part of the global financial infrastructure. Best
practices and state of the art trading platforms have
been adopted in key markets and equity market
liquidity increased by making a larger proportion of
shares tradable. Shanghai’s market capitalization
now stands at around US$3 trillion, the sixth largest
equity platform in the world. Shenzhen has also
launched the Growth Enterprise Board giving smalland medium-size companies access to equity
financing with streamlined listing procedures.
All these measures have bolstered the health and
soundness of China’s financial sector, helping it
escape the global crisis relatively unscathed and
enabling it to expand operations abroad.
Nevertheless, as acknowledged in the 12th Five-Year
Plan and outlined in the FSSA, a broad-ranging
financial reform agenda still remains.

reforms.

The

authorities emphasized their commitment to
continued financial liberalization and were in
broad agreement with the scope of the
reforms outlined by the mission. Indeed, they
noted that the 12th Five-Year Plan highlighted
many of these core areas including interest
rate reform, improving the framework and
transmission of monetary policy, strengthening
regulation

and

supervision,

developing

alternatives to bank finance, reforming the
exchange rate regime, and liberalizing the
capital account. The authorities acknowledged
the importance of sequencing and viewed the
roadmap suggested by staff as a clear and
helpful framework for organizing the wideranging reform process that China now faces.
However, they indicated that the sequencing
of reforms would follow a path determined by
circumstances and progress in many areas
could move in a complementary and parallel
way. They indicated it would be difficult to
design a definitive ordering of reforms ex ante
and emphasized that reforms would take time
and be preconditioned on a stable and
supportive macroeconomic environment. The
authorities did, however, underscore the risks
of an uncoordinated approach to financial
liberalization and were looking carefully to the

experiences of other countries for potential
lessons.
35.

Monetary

management.

The

absorption of liquidity, associated with large
balance of payments inflows, was recognized
as a key challenge to monetary management
and healthy asset market development. The
authorities agreed that revisions would be
needed to the monetary framework in order to
manage the complicated trade-offs between
growth,

inflation,

financial

stability

and

structural changes in the economy. Indeed,
these trade-offs were likely to become more
complex in the coming years. Over time,
greater emphasis would be given to inflation
as an end-goal and to short-term interest rates
as a means to achieve that target. Macroprudential tools would also be drawn upon, as
needed, to manage financial risks.



Establish a Financial Stability Committee to
help coordinate across agencies on systemic

agencies with greater operational autonomy,
improved accountability, adequate resources in
terms of skilled staff and funding, and effective
enforcement and resolution powers.

Box 7. Key Reforms to Deepen Financial Intermediation
The principal areas identified by the FSSA to develop and deepen intermediation include:







30

Bonds. The government should adapt its bond
issuance strategy so as to help improve the
existing market making activities across all
maturities of the yield curve. Reforms should
aim to increase the connectivity between the
exchange-traded and interbank markets and
ensure a coordinated regulatory approach
between the two markets. The government
could also consider permanently authorizing
bank trading of bonds on the stock exchanges
and allowing corporate bond issuers that meet
the appropriate (disclosure-based) listing
standards to decide whether to list on the
interbank or exchange-traded bond market.
Finally, creditworthy sub-national entities should
be allowed to issue bonds to raise financing.
Money markets. The PBC should further
upgrade the operational framework for the repo
market to increase market liquidity. Operational
restrictions that make instruments less efficient
(such as not being able to automatically rollover
open repo positions) should be re-considered.
Leverage risk should be controlled through
prudential regulations. Addressing tax and
regulatory hurdles that limit the size of the
outright repo market would also be important.
The availability of suitable hedging tools should
be encouraged to help market liquidity
providers manage risk, with interest rate
derivatives particularly important in the nearterm.
Equities. The nature and scope of investable
instruments should be broadened to create a
more balanced institutional and retail investor
base, improve liquidity, and strengthen price
discovery. Residual legacy constraints and
anomalies relating to nontradable, “A” and “B”
shares should be addressed and the current

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

expanded. Building a smooth conduit between
the private and public offer segments will be
critical to sustainable funding for SMEs.



Insurance. The insurance sector is still a
relatively small part of the financial system but is
growing rapidly and most of the insurers
licensed in the past decade continue to lose
money. This growth, combined with the low
returns available on insurance company assets,
is putting strains on the sector’s capital
adequacy and solvency. Consolidation of the
sector is needed with stronger solvency
requirements, more comprehensive risk-based
capital requirements, and clearer voluntary
wind-up and exit rules. Insurers should be
allowed to hedge asset-based market and credit
risks, including through asset management
companies.
Subject
to

risk
management, quantitative limits on pension
fund allocations could be relaxed to allow for a
greater diversification away from bank deposits
and toward bonds and equities. Stronger
actuarial
oversight

provisioning is also needed.



Mutual funds. The scope of fixed-income
instruments available to mutual funds could be
broadened to include lower-rated issues (within
prescribed parameters) and medium-term notes.
This would broaden their appeal and enhance
their competitiveness while supporting access of
private companies to direct funding. There is
also a need for an assessment of whether
development of the mutual funds sector is being
prejudiced by a more conservative regulatory
approach than applied to the wealth
management industry.

Box 8. Financial Liberalization and Reform: Lessons From International Experience
Experiences. Many countries have reformed their
financial sectors in recent decades. While financial
liberalization has generally helped spur long-term
growth, inappropriate design of reforms has also
resulted in disruption or even crises. There is no
unique blue-print, but international experience
suggests the need for a carefully-calibrated
approach.1

 Regulatory and supervisory frameworks need to
be upgraded early and continuously. Virtually all
post-liberalization crises can be traced to
inadequate supervision or regulations not
keeping up with changing financial landscapes.
 Liquidity must be absorbed, relative prices
adjusted, and reliance on indirect monetary tools
increased before interest rates are liberalized and
quantitative lending restrictions are lifted.
 Monetary policy needs to guard against an excess
supply of credit as interest rate constraints are
removed. In successful cases of liberalization,
credit expansion was mitigated by a deliberate
containment of liquidity and increases in real
interest rates.
 Interest rate liberalization is a key catalyst in
achieving broader reform goals. Market based
interest rates enhance competition, efficiency,
and risk management. At the same time, implicit
guarantees of financial institutions and borrowers
should be withdrawn to prevent moral hazard.

 Strict regulation and proactive supervision is also
needed to prevent banks from excessively
focusing on building market share to the extent
that it undermines their financial rates of return.
 Broader financial development must not run too
far ahead of financial reform. This could serve to
precipitate an erosion in monetary control and
increased pressure on banks. That said, capital
market development should not be left too late,
as it serves to enhance competition, increase the
efficiency of capital allocation, and promote
longer-term capital flows.

Box 9. Interest Rate Liberalization and Household Saving Behavior
Context. China’s urban household saving rate has
been rising steadily from around 19 percent of
disposable income in 1996 to close to 30 percent in
recent years. To rebalance China’s economy, it will
be essential to arrest this upward trend and create
incentives for households to save less. Financial
reform and interest rate liberalization offer the
potential to contribute to this effort.

Results. Key results from the analysis include:
 The figure shows the annual deviation of urban
saving rates and real interest rates from their
province-specific averages during 2003-2009.
Urban saving rates tend to fall when real interest
rates rise. A one percentage point increase in the
real rate of return on bank deposits would lower

Methodology. To examine the potential impact that
financial reform and a higher cost of capital could
have on saving behavior, research was undertaken
using data from 31 Chinese provinces over the
period 1996-2009 to examine the impact of interest
rate liberalization on urban household saving rates. 1

variables that proxy for other influences on

Real Interest Rate

Conclusions. China’s households save to meet a
multiplicity of needs—pensions, health expenditures,
purchase of durables and real estate, and to insure
against income volatility. Research would suggest
that individuals may well behave as if they are
targeting a particular absolute level of savings. A rise
in real interest rates increases the return on bank
deposits and makes it easier for households to
achieve this targeted level of savings accumulation.
This leads higher deposit rates to reduce the share
of disposable income that is saved. If an increase in
real deposit rates is combined with other measures
to raise household income and change incentives to
save, the impact could be even larger.

Box 10. Corporate Investment, Savings, and Financial Reform
Using firm-level data for a panel of over 50 countries the impact of financial sector reform on corporate investment and
savings was examined.1 The results from the panel, cross-country, firm-level data were cross-checked using a similar
model estimation but using a panel of cross-country macroeconomic data.
Corporate Investment

 Real appreciation tends to lower corporate savings in

 Real interest rates have a negative impact on
investment. At the aggregate level, a 100 basis points
increase in real interest rates reduces corporate
investment in China by about 0.4 percent of GDP. The
effect for China is much larger than the average of
the other 52 countries in the panel. The estimated
impact of interest rates changes on corporate
investment is about half as big when estimated using
firm-level data. This could possibly reflect the smaller
reliance of this sample (which are large, listed
enterprises) on bank-intermediated financing.

 Exchange rate appreciation also lowers investment.
A 10 percent appreciation would reduce total
investment by around 1 percent of GDP. The large
concentration of manufacturing companies in the
firm-level sample means that the estimated impact of
exchange rate appreciation from the firm-level data is
much larger.

 Indicators of capital market development suggest

more developed financial systems tend to promote
higher investment, largely by easing the financing
constraints faced by firms.

Net Corporate Savings

 Overall, the empirical results suggest that financial

sector reform, including raising interest rates,
appreciating the real effective exchange rate, and
developing the domestic capital market, would lower
both investment and corporate savings. An exercise
looking at the net savings, though, would suggest that
higher interest rates and currency appreciation would
tend to reduce the imbalance between corporate
savings and investment.

market development appears to raise
corporate savings for the listed firms perhaps because
it increases profits due to a more efficient allocation of
capital. This effect may, however, mask a negative
impact that financial development can have on savings
of companies that have little access to financing. For
smaller firms, with little access to capital markets,
financial development could reduce the need for
precautionary savings and cash hoarding to finance
investment, ultimately lowering savings.

1/ Coverage of public sector refers to gross debt of the budgetary central government.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of
foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Coverage of public sector refers to gross debt of the budgetary central government and contingent liabilities. The latter includes estimated current and future losses related to NPLs,
unfunded pension liabilities, and AMC losses. All outstanding and future contingent liabilities are assumed to be recognized in 2011 (the NPV of this contingent debt is added to the 2011
debt stock as a one-time adjustment; no additional losses are built into the forecast horizon).
9/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

Supplementary Information
Approved By

Prepared by

Anoop Singh and
Tamim Bayoumi

Asia and Pacific Department

The following information has become
available since the preparation of the staff
report. This does not alter the thrust of the
staff appraisal.
1.
Inflation. Consumer prices rose in
June largely owing to higher food prices, in
particular pork. The June outturn is in line with
staff forecasts. However, if this strong
momentum in pork prices is sustained,
inflation could end the year modestly above
staff forecasts.

2.
Trade. The trade surplus rebounded in
June to a seven-month high (US$22 billion).
Both exports and imports were below staff’s
June forecast although the trade surplus was
modestly higher.
3.
Monetary Policy. The People’s Bank
of China increased loan and deposit rates by
25 basis points effective July 7, the third such
increase this year.
4.
Tax Reform. In an effort to raise
household income, the government increased
the personal income tax threshold to

RMB 3,500 (up from RMB 2,000) effective
September 1. The tax rate for those with
incomes between RMB 3,500 to RMB 4,500 will
decline to 3 percent (compared with 5 percent
previously). This new threshold will reduce the
number of households paying income tax by
60 million (to 24 million).
5.
Local Government Debt. The National
Audit Office published data showing at end2010
local
government
debts
were
RMB 10.7 trillion (or 27 percent of 2010 GDP).
Around one-half of these debts were incurred
by local government financing vehicles (LGFVs)
and used to finance activities in the
construction and transportation sectors and
acquire land.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
People’s Republic of China
On July 15, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with China. 1
Background
China’s economy remains on a solid footing, propelled by vigorous domestic and external
demand. Wage and employment increases have fueled consumption, the expansion in
infrastructure and real estate construction has driven investment upward, and net exports are
once again contributing positively to economic growth. Consumer price inflation has been a
pressing social and economic issue, rising to 5½ percent by end-May. However, barring further
food price shocks, and assuming the ongoing tightening of monetary policy is continued,
inflation should soon peak and begin to decline in the second half of this year.
The improving cyclical outlook for the economy, price pressures, and the potential for a
worsening of bank credit quality in the coming years, has led to a withdrawal of monetary
stimulus (with a target of 16 percent M2 growth by end-year). The fiscal stimulus has also
begun to be unwound with a 1 percent of GDP decline in the general government deficit
targeted for this year. In addition, fiscal resources are being reoriented toward supporting social
expenditures, rural development and policies that promote private consumption. Over the past
year the currency has appreciated by 5½ percent against the U.S. dollar but has depreciated in
both nominal and real effective terms. International reserves now stand at over US$3 trillion.
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

The policy measures outlined in the Twelfth Five-Year Plan are directed at shifting toward a
consumer-based growth model through a range of reforms that will strengthen the social safety
net, raise household income, enhance productivity, and invest in human capital. Financial
reform is highlighted as an important element of this reform package. A successful
implementation of such reforms, and the accompanying transformation of China’s economic
growth model, would have significant positive spillovers to the global economy.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that China’s near-term growth prospects continue to be vigorous and
are increasingly self-sustained, underpinned by structural adjustment. While inflation is
expected to subside reflecting ongoing monetary policy tightening, upside risks remain, in
particular from higher food and commodity prices. Asset price developments and continued
rapid credit growth, coupled with global liquidity conditions, pose policy challenges. Directors
agreed that the current environment calls for a further tightening of macroeconomic policies.
The acceleration of China’s economic transformation toward a more inclusive and balanced
growth model as envisaged under the Twelfth Five-Year Plan will improve the welfare of the
Chinese people and contribute to sustained and balanced global growth.
Directors welcomed steps to cool down property price inflation. They emphasized that any
durable solution to property bubbles would need to involve a significantly higher cost of capital,
financial development, and higher real estate taxation.
Directors noted heightened risks to credit quality associated with lending to the real estate
sector and local government financing vehicles, with the potential for contingent fiscal liabilities.
They welcomed steps to improve public disclosure of the scale and nature of these liabilities,
and encouraged continued efforts to ensure that banks fully account for the underlying risks with
appropriate provisioning, capital requirements, and risk weighting.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to move gradually to more price-based tools of
monetary policy, and to continue to improve the monetary policy framework and the interest rate
structure. They saw room for a further tightening of monetary conditions through greater
reliance on interest rates and nominal exchange rate appreciation, while taking care to
safeguard financial system stability.
Directors generally agreed that, over the medium term, a stronger renminbi would be an
important component in rebalancing the economy toward domestic demand, and a number of
them saw this as a prerequisite for reforms to strengthen the macroeconomic policy framework
and promote financial liberalization. Directors stressed that the appreciation of the exchange
rate would need to be supported by wide-ranging reforms to bring about a transformation of
China’s economic growth model.

3

Directors supported the policy directions laid out in the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, which, if fully
implemented, would lay a strong foundation for a new growth model. They welcomed in
particular the focus on further improvements in the social safety net, measures to raise
household income, and the role of market forces in resource allocation. Directors encouraged
the government to flesh out detailed steps for the expeditious initiation of the various reform
measures.
Directors welcomed China’s participation in the Financial Sector Assessment Program, and
underlined the importance of well-sequenced financial liberalization and reform as an integral
part of China’s rebalancing strategy. They commended the authorities for the considerable
progress in moving toward a more market-based financial system and improving the regulatory
and supervisory framework. Directors encouraged further efforts to absorb the liquidity
overhang currently resident in the financial system, deepen the channels for financial
intermediation, enhance supervision and regulation, establish a deposit insurance scheme, and
strengthen the framework for resolution and crisis management. They looked forward to
meaningful progress in these areas to help pave the way for full liberalization of deposit and
loan rates, an opening of the capital account, and a convertible renminbi.
Directors welcomed the spillover analysis for providing a useful multilateral perspective to the
Fund’s policy advice to China, and encouraged further refinement of such analysis. They
agreed that expansionary policies in China during the crisis had played an important role in
bolstering global stability and growth, and expected China’s positive externalities to continue,
especially for regional economies. Directors generally noted that a major disruption in China’s
so-far-steady growth would have material adverse consequences for the rest of the world. They
emphasized that a combination of currency appreciation and reforms to rebalance the growth
model, together, would yield substantial benefits for both China and other countries. Several
Directors also noted the potential effects of China’s reserve accumulation and capital account
policies on capital flows and global asset prices, although a few others saw no clear evidence
that these policies have significant effects on emerging market capital flows.
Directors welcomed China’s generous contributions to low-income countries in both financial
and technical assistance.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat

Statement by Jianxiong He, Executive Director for People’s Republic of China
and Zhengxin Zhang, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
July 15, 2011
The Chinese economy has continued to show resilience, reflecting strong consumption and
investment, and further progress in structural adjustment. The key challenge is to balance the
need for containing inflation, sustaining strong growth, and accelerating the transformation
of the growth model. The task is complicated by the difficult external environment, which
acutely constrains macroeconomic policy options and rebalancing efforts.

risks in the developed economies, the growth in China has remained strong and continued to
rebalance in favor of domestic demand, thanks to the package of comprehensive reform
measures. Retail sales grew by 18.4 percent in 2010 and 16.6 percent in the first five months
of 2011, driven by the household income growth (urban household per capita disposable
income rose 11.3 percent in 2010, and rural household net per capita income by
14.9 percent), while fixed asset investment growth moderated to a more sustainable rate of
23.8 percent. With import growth outpacing that of export growth by 3.6 percentage points,
the trade balance further narrowed from 4 percent of GDP in 2009 to 3.1 percent in 2010,
followed by another 18.2 percent reduction in the first half of 2011. Current account surplus
as a share of GDP continued to decline from the precrisis double digits to 5.2 percent in 2010
and 2.04 percent in the first quarter of 2011.
Inflation pressure has intensified, reflecting the sharp food price increase and the abundant
domestic and global liquidity, and the associated surge in global commodity prices. It also
reflects longer-term changes, such as the structural increase in labor, land, as well as
environmental protection costs. Last year saw an average minimum wage increase of
22.8 percent across the country.
As the staff rightly noted, our authorities began to withdraw the monetary stimulus as soon as
the recovery took hold. Since early 2010, the People’s Bank of China (PBC) has raised
reserve requirements on 12 occasions and policy rates on 5 occasions. Surprisingly, the staff
reports have missed the significant constraint of the external environment on the monetary
policy options. For example, the frequent tightening steps were interrupted for about two
quarters of the year by the heightened sovereign risks in Europe. And more importantly, the
near-zero policy rates in major advanced economies have limited the room for the PBC to
rely on interest rate adjustments, as the higher domestic rate, combined with appreciation
expectations, would not only fuel speculative flows but also fail to address the challenges
arising from the sectoral differences and the fast-evolving financial system. The monetary
policy mix may be better assessed in such a setting. In addition to the reserve requirement
and policy rate adjustments, as well as the flexible use of open market operations, the PBC

2
has adopted “aggregate financing” as a key indicator for gauging monetary and financial
conditions. It has also introduced transparent and rules-based dynamically differentiated
reserve requirement ratios to provide incentives for the individual institutions to respond to
the need for capital buffer as it fluctuates with business cycles. They believe that the
configuration of the price-based instruments with macroprudential tools suits the present
external and domestic context.
Given the strong economic growth and revenue performance, the fiscal policy will focus on
improving expenditure composition, particularly increasing social spending to encourage
consumption while ensuring fiscal sustainability. The government will continue tax reform
and structural tax reduction to facilitate rebalancing. The recent amendment to the income tax
law simplified the tax structure, raised the exemption threshold by 75 percent, and revised the
tax rate for the lowest bracket from 5 percent to 3 percent. Our authorities are well aware of
the risks associated with the accumulation of local government debt—a legacy associated
with the crisis response measures. Although such debt is small relative to GDP, and has been
largely used to finance fixed asset investment and expected to generate cash flows, our
authorities have taken preemptive actions, including introducing an effective monitoring and
risk warning system, and standardizing local government debt management.
To address the risk of potential property bubbles, both demand and supply side actions were
taken, including differentiated lending standards, larger supply of land, and affordable
housing. The stress tests by commercial banks indicate that the real estate sector credit risks
remain manageable.
II. Transformation of the growth model
China’s far-reaching rebalancing efforts have yielded remarkable results. The multi-prong
measures have resulted in an average 9.7 percent real annual increase in urban household per
capita disposable income in the last five years, and 8.9 percent real increase in rural
household net per capita income. During the same period, retail sales grew at an average
annual rate of 18.1 percent, while the weight of the service sector edged up 2.7 percentage
points. There has been a leap forward in strengthening the social safety net. The health
insurance has covered 1.26 billion participants. The rural participation rate has reached
96 percent, with 836 million covered by the new rural medical insurance introduced in 2009.
The government contribution to the health insurance increased 66.7 percent in 2010 on top of
the 50 percent rise in 2009. The reimbursement ratio has reached 60 percent. The new rural
pension scheme introduced in 2009 has already attracted 190 million participants. More than
50 million have begun to benefit from the scheme. The energy saving and environmental
protection measures, which resulted in a 19.1 percent reduction in energy consumption per
unit of GDP in the last five years, are also conducive to rebalancing. To encourage import,
tariffs were significantly reduced on 33 tariff items covering energy, raw materials, and
consumer products effective July 1, following the application of lower duties on over
600 items early this year. As a result, the contribution of domestic demand to GDP growth
increased from 81.9 percent in 2007 to 91 percent in 2008 and 139 percent in 2009, before
stabilizing at 92.1 percent in 2010. Since 2005, the domestic share of aggregate demand has
also edged up by 2.9 percentage points to 97.4 percent.

Our authorities are fully aware of the enormous challenges to their rebalancing efforts,
including the need for creating 25 million jobs for the new urban labor force each year in the
Plan period. As the population begins to age, the demand for social protection will be more
acute. The “Twelfth Five-Year Plan” on economic and social development illustrates our
authorities’ determination to transform the growth model by accelerating structural reforms
with a strategic focus on expanding consumer demand. It sets out policy guidance in
10 areas, including accelerating growth in household income, providing lasting incentives to
expand consumption, and allowing market forces to play a key role in resource allocation.
The Plan has been the most comprehensive and elaborate policy framework to rebalance
demand that G20 members have ever put forward. It is legally binding and embodies a
monitoring and evaluation mechanism. We wish to highlight a few relevant elements.
1. Expanding employment and improving income distribution to increase
consumption
While increasing public service for employment, expanding training, and encouraging
entrepreneurship, measures will be taken to accelerate income distribution reforms to
raise the labor share of national income. The Plan envisages a real annual growth of over
7 percent in per capita household disposable income (faster than the projected real GDP
growth), and an annual minimum wage growth over 13 percent. This will also reinforce
the relative factor cost changes under way. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics, during 2002–2008, manufacturing sector real wages doubled in China,
compared to 20 percent in the United States.
2. Strengthening the social safety net to reduce precautionary saving
Over the Plan period, out-of-pocket expenses will be further reduced for health insurance
participants. The pension insurance system is expected to have all the urban and rural
population covered by end-2012. About 36 million units of affordable housing will be
provided.
3. Allowing market forces to play a basic role in resource allocation and
strengthening environmental protection
The Plan envisages 30 percent reduction in water consumption per unit of industrial value
added, a further 16 percent reduction in energy consumption per unit of GDP, and other
targets for emission reduction of major pollutants. The price reforms involving natural
resources, including refined oil, natural gas, water, and electricity will be front-loaded as
priority agenda for 2011.

4. Promoting the development of service and nontrade sectors
The Plan aims at a 4 percentage-point increase in the service sector share of GDP,
particularly by promoting financial, logistics, and tourism services.
The structural measures, especially those aimed at promoting consumption and nontradable
sectors, together with the relatively faster increase in factor costs, are expected to help
narrow the current account surplus and bring the RMB exchange rate even closer to its
equilibrium. We disagree with staff assessment that the RMB remains substantially below the
level consistent with medium-term fundamentals, which is based on reserve changes, the
most recent REER movement, and the shaky medium-term current account projections.
First, under the current international monetary system, the exceptionally loose monetary
policy in major reserve-issuing economies had important implications for reserve changes in
other countries. The factors underlying changes in reserves and key assumptions for staff
medium-term current account projections, which have shown persistently large errors,
certainly deserve further examination. Second, the REER-related assessment should be based
on longer-term trend than what the staff paper seems to focus on. The movement in the past
year has been complicated by the large fluctuations among the major currencies. Since 1994,
the year the RMB exchange rates were unified, both the BIS and IMF have recorded RMB
REER appreciation of over 50 percent, with 21 percent appreciation since mid-2005.
Furthermore, structural changes, such as the increasing cost of labor and capital and the
convergence of domestic and international metropolitan property prices, will fundamentally
affect China’s competitiveness.
Staff’s exchange rate assessment, which is derived from medium-term current account
projections based on the assumption of unchanged policies and constant exchange rate,
ignores the trend exchange rate movement and the far-reaching legally-binding rebalancing
measures that will be implemented in the medium term.
III. Financial reform and FSAP
China’s precrisis financial reforms have been an important buffer against the global crisis.
With a combination of quantitative and price instruments, the monetary policy framework,
which aims at maintaining not only price stability, but also sustaining growth, has enabled
the economy to weather multiple shocks including food price fueled inflation, domestic
natural disasters, and the constraints by zero-rate policies in the advanced economies to the
withdrawal of stimulus. The strengthened financial regulation and supervision, as well as the
corporate governance, risk controls, and strong capital buffer of the financial institutions put
in place before the global crisis have also enabled the financial system to respond effectively
to the shocks.
The banking sector is generally healthy, with the completion of restructuring and public
offering of all major commercial banks. Banks are profitable and well-capitalized, with NPLs

5
at historical low levels. Hard financial constraints are being put in place. The rapid
development of financial markets has facilitated the diversification of financing. The
nonfinancial corporate sector saw a 122.9 percent increase in its funding from the equity
market in 2010. The bond market has become the sixth largest in the world. The development
of the financial markets has also improved conditions for interest rate marketization, better
resource allocations, and financial innovation.
The new Five-Year Plan calls for deepening financial reforms, including further reforming
financial institutions, accelerating the development of a multi-layer financial market, and
strengthening financial regulation and supervision. Among many detailed actions, it
envisages the establishment of a deposit insurance system, a countercyclical macroprudential
framework, and a resolution mechanism for systemic financial risks; further interest rate
marketization; further improving the exchange rate regime; phasing out restriction on the
cross-border use of the renminbi; and progress toward capital account convertibility.
Our authorities attach great importance to the FSAP exercise as a comprehensive health
check for the financial system. As for the four near-term risks mentioned in the FSSA, we
would like to emphasize that both the NPL level and volume have been dropping steadily.
The off-balance sheet exposures are small relative to bank balance sheets.
As the FSAP results confirm the general health of China’s financial system, the exercise
focused on further financial sector reform. We note that the FSAP recommendations were
largely consistent with what has been laid out in the Plan. Some recommended actions are
already being put in place. A subtle difference was that staff preferred a clear reform
sequence and road map, while our authorities believe that, although it is important to have a
clear direction and an integrated and coordinated approach to reform design, predetermined
timing, sequencing, and pace could complicate and even slow down implementation.
Flexibility for responding to unforeseen shocks is critical. For example, the progress in
promoting capital account convertibility and exchange rate regime reform was interrupted
twice by external financial crises. Each time, renewed efforts were needed to rebuild
consensus.
IV. Spillover effect
The current spillover analyses were largely a summary and attempted verification of some
third-party concerns. We would have benefited from an independent analytical framework by
staff.
On the inward spillover, the reports fail to capture the significant shocks to the authorities’
decision-making, firm and household behavior, and the progress in rebalancing. First, the
prolonged massive unconventional easing by the major central banks not only fueled
inflation pressures but also constrained the options regarding policy mix, as well as the
timing, path, and pace of the monetary policy normalization in emerging market economies.
Even those with floating regimes were also forced to resort to capital controls. Without the
external shocks, China’s monetary stimulus withdrawal would have experienced a different
pace and would have relied more on price instruments. Second, the global crisis and

6
recession negatively affected the fiscal performance and expenditure composition of the
emerging market economies. Third, more profoundly, the external shocks caused major
interruptions to reforms in China, particularly the exchange rate reform. Fourth, the spillover
slowed the progress of rebalancing. As noted in the FSSA, the Lehman collapse marked a
sudden surge in China’s household and corporate savings, undoing much of the rebalancing
efforts in China. The household deposits growth jumped from 1 trillion yuan in 2007 to an
average of more than 4.3 trillion yuan in the three years after the subprime shock, while
corporate deposit growth surged from 2 trillion yuan in 2008 to 6 trillion yuan in the
following year. We find the real shock from the U.S. subprime crisis much stronger than
suggested in the staff spillover reports. It caused China’s exports to plunge for
13 consecutive months, with a 52 percentage-point drop in export growth and a sharp decline
in FDI inflow. It has significant impact on business activity, employment, and fiscal
performance.
On the outward spillover, we would like to highlight a few points. First, the report fails to
mention China’s role as an important source of global stability and growth. China has
resisted the pressure for depreciation during the recent major episodes of large downward
exchange rate movement in many other emerging market economies. While focusing on the
rising export share (which is, as a matter of fact, not out of line with its share in global GDP),
staff ignores the sharp rise in China’s import share (from 6.1 percent in 2005 to 9.1 percent in
2010). Second, contrary to the view that China’s capital controls diverted flows to other
EMEs, since the outbreak of the crisis, China has been easing rather than tightening its
restrictions and remains one of largest net capital recipient. Third, as a large and diversified
importer and exporter as well as FDI destination, by facilitating the completion of the
production chain, it helps the economies at the higher end of the value chain to relocate
uncompetitive operations to China, and LICs to participate in the global division of labor.
Fourth, as China raises its living standard, it frees up development financing for other lowincome countries and contributes to the global efforts to achieve the millennium goal.
