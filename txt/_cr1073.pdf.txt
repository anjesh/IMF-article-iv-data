I. STAFF APPRAISAL AND SUMMARY
1.
India’s economy is rebounding strongly ahead of most countries in the world, bringing
policy trade-offs to a head earlier than in other countries. Growth is approaching pre-crisis levels
and leading indicators bode well for continued recovery. Capital inflows are rising and financial
markets have regained most of the lost ground. But inflation pressure are intensifying and the fiscal
position is one of the weakest among major emerging markets.
2.

The exit from the accommodative policies of the crisis should start with:



a normalization of the monetary stance. Conditions are now ripe for a gradual withdrawal
of monetary accommodation to anchor inflation expectations. More extended guidance from
the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on future inflation should also help. Rupee appreciation
should be the first response to capital inflows. Other policy options, especially prudential
measures, may be appropriate if asset price bubbles are a threat, while tightening capital
controls should be a last resort given the need to deepen domestic capital markets.



a reduction in the 2010/11 budget deficit. With the recovery becoming entrenched and
India’s high debt, the risk of premature withdrawal of fiscal stimulus is low. Introducing
reforms to underpin lasting consolidation will be of paramount importance.

3.
The medium-term outlook is bright provided reform efforts are accelerated and
sustained. As India was not at the center of the crisis and its growth is mainly reliant on domestic
drivers, the global crisis is not expected to have dented India’s medium-term growth potential: real
GDP growth is projected to return to 8 percent in 2010/11 with near-term risks broadly balanced.
Nevertheless, to sustain rapid growth over the longer term, the authorities have rightly emphasized
addressing structural bottlenecks—notably infrastructure. The government is also addressing other
structural issues, such as land acquisition, and education and judicial reforms.
4.
The main economic reform objectives should be: (i) enabling the financial system to
intermediate domestic savings effectively; and (ii) reducing fiscal dominance.


a more growth-oriented financial system. The financial system has weathered the global
crisis well and appears sound, despite deteriorating asset quality, which would benefit from
strengthening mechanisms to deal with distressed assets. Nevertheless, as investment
recovers and infrastructure takes off, the limitations of the domestic financial system may
come to the fore. Deepening the domestic corporate bond market is key, as well as the
availability of instruments that help manage risks, and greater participation of domestic
institutional investors in the funding of infrastructure.



reducing the public sector’s claim on resources. A framework anchored in a debt target,
in the order of 60-65 percent of GDP by 2015, accompanied by expenditure ceilings would
stand a better chance of achieving fiscal discipline while allowing countercyclical policy. A
durable consolidation hinges on a reform to remove regressive subsidies and the introduction
of the planned GST and the new Direct Tax Code. Ensuring high value for money of social
programs will be important to achieve significant poverty reduction. Privatization would also
help consolidation.

II.

CONTEXT: ON TRACK TO RETURN TO RAPID GROWTH

5.
India’s economy is among the first in the world to recover after the global crisis (see
Appendix 1). Prompt fiscal and monetary easing, combined with the fiscal stimulus already in the
pipeline and the return of risk appetite in financial markets have brought growth close to pre-crisis
levels. Leading indicators suggest the output gap will continue to close. Capital inflows are on the
rise, and financial markets have regained most of the lost ground.

6.
Growth is projected to rise from 6¾ percent in 2009/10 to 8 percent the following year
(see Appendix 2). Agriculture is likely to contract by about 1 percent in 2009/10 due to the drought,
but nonagricultural GDP growth is expected to gather momentum. Private consumption would benefit
from better employment prospects in industry and services and less uncertainty, and investment
would be boosted by robust corporate profits, rising business confidence, and favorable financing
conditions (see Appendix 3). With India’s long-term prospects remaining strong and private sector
balance sheets sound, we expect growth to be back at potential in 2010/11 even if advanced
economies grow below trend. The current account deficit will stay relatively stable over the medium
term, with export and import growth gathering pace.

7.
Near-term risks are broadly balanced. On the upside, an acceleration of reforms and
capital inflows could spur investment. On the downside, the main risks are elevated inflation and
financing constraints arising, inter alia, from the fiscal deficit, which could stall the recovery. Tail risks
include asset price bubbles and a sudden stop in capital inflows caused by turmoil in global financial
markets.

5
8.
India’s medium-term growth prospects remain bright. India was not at the center of the
global crisis and growth is well balanced and mainly reliant on domestic drivers. Risks to this
favorable outlook stem primarily from difficulties in implementing productivity-enhancing reforms and
continued supply bottlenecks.
Authorities’ Views
9.
The authorities see India’s recovery well underway and their growth projections are
higher than those of staff. They attribute this to a combination of decisive policy measures and the
fact that India has only been indirectly affected by the crisis. The authorities project 2009/10 growth at
7-7.75 percent. In a recent speech, the PM noting that “there are clear signs of an upturn in the
economy,” anticipated growth at over 7 percent for 2010/11.1
10.
The authorities are concerned about rising inflation in the food sector, although the
RBI expects year-end inflation to be lower than staff’s 8 percent projection. The RBI estimates
that WPI inflation will be 6.5 percent with an upward bias by March 2010, but they note that it is
mainly a supply-side phenomenon linked to food prices. They are aware of the risks of the spillover of
persistently high food prices, which have been rising for over a year, into nonfood prices via their
effect on expectations—demand side factors are also at play.
11.
Weakness in advanced economies’ activity, the rise in commodity prices, and the
likelihood of large capital inflows are viewed as the main risks to the near-term outlook. The
recovery is still driven by government spending (with signs of pickup in private final consumption
demand in the second quarter) and the recovery in IT and BPO sectors, which have large spillover
effects on the rest of the economy, hinges on growth in advanced economies. So far the levels of
government borrowing have been managed without any adverse impact in terms of crowding out the
resources for the private sector. Going forward, the proposed resumption of the fiscal consolidation
process presently envisaged by the Medium Term Fiscal Policy Statement would minimize the risks
of crowding out in the event of a pickup in credit growth.

III. POLICIES: THE EXIT STRATEGY AND KEY REFORMS
12.
Emerging inflation pressures and a weak fiscal position are bringing policy trade-offs
to a head earlier than in other countries. Headline (WPI) inflation, running at 10 percent
sequentially, is fuelling debate on when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) should tighten monetary
policy. The double–digit fiscal deficit and high public debt call for fiscal consolidation, but there is a
risk that private demand may not broaden enough to carry the growth momentum. Capital inflows
help fund investment, but could complicate monetary management.

13.
The 2009 Article IV consultation focused on these immediate challenges and the
transition to the longer-term economic reform agenda. India, with its twin-engined growth (from
domestic demand and exports), is well-positioned to grow faster than comparators for whom external
demand weakness will be a drag and the process of rebalancing growth slow. To capitalize on this
opportunity, India needs to address structural weaknesses. The government aims at rapid and
inclusive growth and has identified infrastructure bottlenecks as the main supply constraint. As the
Prime Minister stated, the country is better placed than at any time in the recent past to push reforms.
We see two priorities: (i) financial reform to facilitate infrastructure and investment; and (ii) fiscal
reforms to free resources for public and private investment and increase the efficiency of public
spending. Besides these, the government is also working on addressing other structural issues, such
as land acquisition, and education and judicial reforms.
A. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy: A Balancing Act
14.
The RBI has begun the first phase of exit. It eliminated some unconventional financing
facilities introduced but little used during the crisis, re-introduced caps on the cost of external
borrowing, and signaled its intention to return to a neutral monetary stance. It also reversed the cut in
the statutory liquidity ratio, and raised provisioning requirements on commercial real estate.
15.

Conditions are ripe for a normalization of the monetary stance.



Inflation (see Appendix 4). CPI inflation has been in the low double digits for over a year and
WPI has risen fast. Though food accounts for a significant part of the increase in inflation, the
output gap is estimated to be small and

from low levels, as asset prices have rallied. Credit growth is weak, but past episodes of
slowdowns in several countries suggest that credit growth lags the recovery (see Appendix 5).
16.
The withdrawal of monetary stimulus should be gradual, but should start soon. The
uncertainty about the durability of the recovery calls for reducing the degree of monetary
accommodation in small steps. But, monetary policy transmission lags and the fact that the policy rate
is substantially below the neutral rate (estimated using a simple Taylor rule) argue for timely action.
Moving early would also mitigate the risk of inflation expectations becoming unmoored, and thus
would require a smaller overall adjustment. Initial steps could be to sequester most of the excess
liquidity (which averaged Rs1.1 trillion in April-December 2009) through increases in the cash reserve
ratio—this could strengthen monetary transmission. The RBI could also provide its one-year ahead
inflation projection in every quarterly review to guide inflation expectations.

measures, which the RBI employs, could be used
to dampen incipient asset price bubbles. And finally, given the need to develop India’s financial
markets and finance investment, we would advise using capital controls only as a last resort.
18.
Staff studies suggest that the weight on exchange rate changes in the setting of
monetary policy could be lowered (see Appendix 6). A Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium
(DSGE) model estimated for India indicates that macroeconomic volatility would be reduced by
responding more to inflation relative to the exchange rate.
2

From a longer-term perspective, the Consultative Group on Exchange Rate (CGER) estimates that the rupee is
broadly in line with its value based on fundamentals (0 to 10 percent below equilibrium). Exports shares of foods
and services have steadily increased since the early 1990s and external debt remains low.

8
Authorities’ Views
19.
The RBI has already started exiting from crisis measures and is shifting towards a
more neutral monetary stance. Monetary policy is unlikely to be able to affect food prices. Hence,
monetary settings should continue to support the economic recovery and “it may be appropriate to
sequence the exit in a calibrated way so that while the recovery process is not hampered, inflation
expectations remain anchored.”3
20.
The authorities underscore that the exchange rate is largely market determined and
they intervene only to reduce excessive volatility of the exchange rate rather than managing
the level of the exchange rate. They also pointed out that appreciation would not help too much in
controlling food prices because of limited tradability of key items.
21.
The RBI will continue to adopt a range of measures to manage capital inflows as
needed. While inflows are currently in line with the economy’s absorptive capacity and are not posing
problems for monetary management, the authorities remain cognizant of their impact on liquidity and
the exchange rate. Given their experience during the surge in capital inflows in 2007, the authorities
are confident they would effectively manage the expected inflows. The policy options on debt flows
remain a tool to be used. Asset prices are not considered frothy, but their role in policy formulation is
likely to be more prominent, with macro-prudential measures seen as the right instrument to address
incipient asset price bubbles.
B. Financial Policies: A More Growth-Oriented Financial System
22.
Based on the authorities’ self assessment,4 India’s financial system appears sound,
despite some recent deterioration in asset quality (see Appendix 7). Financial soundness
indicators compare well internationally, except for provision coverage (the RBI recently raised the
requirement), although the comparison of nonperforming assets (NPAs) is complicated by
forbearance.5 Staff’s analysis indicates that the capital of the top 30 banks would remain above the
regulatory minimum in a scenario in which NPAs double to 5 percent, and only some smaller banks
would need more capital in a more extreme scenario in which NPAs triple. Credit remains the key
risk, but the authorities have started to strengthen public banks’ capital and financial regulation
following the Financial Stability Board (FSB) guidelines (liquidity risk monitoring and disclosure of offbalance sheet exposures). Given the global experience, multi-factor stress tests and an independent
evaluation of compliance with international standards would be advisable. The RBI’s new Financial
Stability Unit should also help achieve a better integration of micro- and macro-prudential
surveillance.

and mechanisms typically used in infrastructure
funding—such as long-term bonds, takeout financing, securitization, and credit enhancements—are
limited.

24.
Steps taken by the authorities to address these constraints are welcome. The planned
introduction of a takeout financing scheme by the India Infrastructure Finance Corporation Limited
(IIFCL) and the reduction in capital requirements for this instrument, the measures recently taken to
give greater flexibility to certain pension funds in their investments, as well the recent RBI guidelines
on CDS and repos with corporate bonds will help promote long-term debt financing. Similarly, the
introduction of interest rate and currency futures provides additional instruments to manage market
risk.

Domestic institutional investors hold the key to the development of the corporate bond
market. India’s corporate bond market is small compared to other EMs due to a limited investor base
and investment restrictions, the absence of a benchmark yield curve, and inadequate credit
enhancement and hedging tools. International experience suggests that institutional investors have
been instrumental to the growth of the corporate bond market, and, in turn, to the provision of
development finance. Pension funds’ assets

including via suitable credit enhancements.
26.
Foreign participation is vital to enhance liquidity, the sine qua non of a vibrant bond
market. Domestic institutional investors, as in most countries, will tend to be buy-and-hold investors.
Hence, opening the debt market to foreign investors could enhance liquidity—a staff study shows that
greater foreign participation lowers yields, but there is no clear evidence that volatility increases (see
Appendix 9). Merging FII limits for the corporate and government bonds and liberalizing the allocation
mechanisms could help in this regard. Even if initially investors are likely to prefer government bonds,
foreign participation should develop the sovereign yield curve facilitating the pricing of corporate debt.

Further, consideration could also be given to liberalizing external borrowing for refinancing of
infrastructure loans, as this would be more likely to attract foreign capital in infrastructure and free
domestic resources for other uses.
27.
Public institutions have an important role to play in establishing the overall framework
and in filling market gaps in the provision of infrastructure financing.




Institutional framework to drive the implementation of infrastructure investment. The
secretariat to the cabinet committee on infrastructure chaired by the Prime Minister could be
assisted by a multi-disciplinary team, empowered to address infrastructure financing
challenges. This team would identify bottlenecks and coordinate the relevant policy makers to
create a modern framework for infrastructure financing, being mindful of financial stability.
Filling market gaps. Given the large infrastructure needs, the role of public institutions
should be mainly catalytic of private financing, in order to leverage their resources. In this
regard, the fact that the IIFCL is planning to provide takeout finance and credit
enhancements, whose supply by other players is likely to be limited, is an encouraging
development. The same could be done with other specialized public institutions. The risks
incurred by the public sector would have to be carefully monitored and managed.

28.
Improving mechanisms to deal with distressed assets and insolvency proceedings
remain important. The market for distressed assets could be boosted by further improving the
insolvency framework for non-bank finance companies and easing restrictions on investment in asset
reconstruction companies. Passage of the new Companies Bill would strengthen the insolvency
framework.
Authorities’ Views
29.
As concluded by the Report of the Committee on Financial Sector Assessment (CFSA),
the authorities consider that India’s financial system is sound and resilient. The authorities
deem that there are no significant vulnerabilities in the system and that the situation has further
improved since the CFSA Report. Though NPAs may increase as a result of the slowdown, the rise is
unlikely to pose systemic risks given the strength of banks’ balance sheets. To further strengthen
financial stability, the RBI will issue guidelines to banks on enhanced stress testing by end-January
2010 and enhance management of liquidity and interest rate risks.
30.
India continues to strengthen prudential regulation and supervision of banks. In the
October policy review, the RBI raised the provisioning requirement for advances to the commercial
real estate sector given the high credit growth and the extent of restructured loans in this sector. The
RBI also advised banks to raise their total provisioning ratio, including floating provisions, to a
minimum of 70 per cent by September 2010 with a view to improving the provisioning cover and
enhancing the soundness of individual banks. To ensure that the originators do not compromise on
due diligence of assets generated for the purpose of securitization, it has been proposed to stipulate
a minimum lock-in period of one year and a minimum retention of 10 percent for bank loans that are
securitized.
31.
A number of steps have been taken to introduce new financial products and improve
the efficiency of the banking system. Stock exchanges are now permitted to offer currency futures
contracts in currency pairs of Rupee-Euro, Rupee-Pound Sterling and Rupee-Japanese Yen, in
addition to the existing Rupee-US dollar contracts. In addition, the authorities have re-launched
interest rate futures (IRFs) on 10-year government bonds with improved features in August 2009. The
RBI is also planning to introduce plain vanilla over-the-counter (OTC) single-name CDS for corporate
bonds subject to appropriate safeguards and repos of corporate bonds. An RBI Working Group has

11
been established to examine the issues involved in the introduction of priority sector lending
certificates, while a committee has recommended a new formula to replace the system of benchmark
prime lending rate and use the cost of one-year retail deposits as the benchmark for calculating the
proposed benchmark lending rate. The authorities are also working on several measures that would
enhance financial inclusion.
32.
The authorities maintain that the country’s infrastructure financing needs are currently
being met, but they concur that there is need for improvement. At present, there is no shortage
of infrastructure financing and domestic banks—together with the specialized financial institutions set
up by the government—are able to bring projects to financial closure without undue delays. Additional
instruments are being introduced on an as needed basis: for example, IIFCL is working on providing
takeout financing and credit enhancements. The authorities agree that developing a corporate bond
market continues to be key to creating sources of long-term debt financing, but do not see merging
the FII limits between the corporate and government bond markets as helpful. The Government of
India has set up a High Level Standing Committee on Infrastructure Finance to oversee the
recommendations on infrastructure financing and to act as the coordinating institutional mechanism to
review the bottlenecks and the resource availability in the infrastructure sector. Finally, a Cabinet
Committee on Infrastructure has also been constituted underscoring that the government is according
top priority to infrastructure investment and a number of measures (including those related to
financing issues) are being taken to expedite projects.
C. Fiscal Policy: “Fiscal Consolidation Is Imperative”6
33.
The 2009/10 budget extended the expansionary stance to support the recovery.
Following an estimated deficit of 11 percent of GDP in 2008/09, the general government is likely to
end the current fiscal year with a broadly unchanged balance (see Appendix 10). At the central level,
savings from the lower subsidy bill (about 2 percent of GDP) have been reoriented towards social
programs and infrastructure. Tax revenue is expected to remain subdued reflecting indirect tax cuts
introduced during the crisis. States’ deficits are also likely to widen.
34.
The Finance Minister’s announced intention to lower the central government’s deficit
in the next two budgets is welcome, but is likely to require discretionary measures. While the
exact path of fiscal consolidation will be informed by the recommendations of the 13th Finance
Commission, the authorities’ current goal is to reduce the center’s deficit from a projected 7 percent of
GDP in 2009/10 to 5.5 percent of GDP in 2010/11 and further to 4 percent of GDP in 2011/12. This
will be helped by the falling away of one-off expenditure items and revenue buoyancy, but additional
discretionary measures will likely be needed. States will also need to curb current spending.
35.
A concrete strategy for reducing debt and the public sector’s claim on the economy’s
resources—consistent with the G20 principles7 —will go a long way to boost credibility.8 In
India’s case, the risks of a premature withdrawal of fiscal stimulus need to be balanced against the
possibility that fiscal consolidation—based on durable reforms—could actually be expansionary. A
medium-term fiscal framework anchored in an explicit debt target complemented by expenditure rules

While a gradual decline in India’s public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected under various shocks, a no-policy
change scenario would result in an unsustainable debt path (see Informational Annex No.1).

12
stands a better chance of achieving fiscal discipline.9 Expenditure ceilings, derived from an over-thecycle deficit consistent with the debt target, would introduce a countercyclical element to fiscal policy.
Although determining an appropriate debt target is challenging, cross-country analysis using a range
of approaches suggests that a target of 60-65 percent of GDP by 2015/16 from 78 percent in 2008/09
might be suitable for India (see Appendix 11). This ceiling would be above the average debt of EMs,
but would provide room for countercyclical fiscal policy and for contingent liabilities. It would also send
a strong signal by making a clear break with the past.
36.
A durable reduction in the fiscal deficit hinges on subsidy reform, although the
planned revenue reforms will also contribute. The draft Direct Tax Code would broaden the tax
base, while lowering rates. The Goods and Services Tax will streamline indirect taxes. Both reforms
should bolster revenue via efficiency gains and improved compliance. The missing element is a
reform of the subsidy system, which should phase-out regressive subsidies and introduce a marketbased pricing mechanism for petroleum products in line with G-20 principles.7 Over time, the
subsidies on products consumed predominantly by the poor could be replaced by targeted support
which will be facilitated by the Unique Identification Number. The government’s focus on raising the
quality of public spending (through consolidation, monitoring, and evaluation of centrally sponsored
schemes) should improve service delivery, critical for inclusive growth and poverty alleviation. A
faster pace of privatization would also support fiscal consolidation by contributing a one-off increase
in resources, but cannot take the place of adjustment.
Authorities’ Views
37.
The authorities highlight that fiscal policy has played a major role in cushioning the
impact of the crisis and supporting the economic recovery. The fiscal consolidation in the five
years leading to the crisis had created the space for the continued expansionary fiscal stance in the
2009/10 budget. The central government 2009/10 fiscal deficit is expected to remain within the 6.8
percent of GDP target. Stronger divestment receipts and direct tax revenue could make up for the
shortfall, if any, in 3G auction proceeds and indirect tax collections, while higher than budgeted
spending on pensions and food and fertilizer subsidies can be accommodated through savings on
other accounts. The record market borrowing program has proceeded in a non-disruptive manner,
with limited impact on bond yields. Most of the required resources were raised in the first half of the
fiscal year to ensure adequate space for the private sector when private demand rebounds.
38.
However, the authorities uphold that fiscal consolidation is imperative. Given the risks
associated with a premature exit, a decision regarding the withdrawal of the stimulus measures will
be taken without putting at risk the revival process, incorporating the 13th Finance Commission’s
recommendations on India’s medium-term path of fiscal consolidation and discussing expenditure
management measures and initiatives to boost revenue.
39.
Current plans envisage a reduction in the central government deficit to 5.5 percent of
GDP in 2010/11 and 4 percent in 2011/12, as noted in the Medium-Term Fiscal Policy
Statement. Relative to 2009/10, spending will be contained as the arrears related to the Pay
commission award will be paid off, while the frontloading of the 11th Five Year Plan Programs will
result in lower expenditure growth. The pick-up in economic activity will also buoy tax collections. In
addition, the government’s new divestment policy should raise substantial amount of resources that
would help limit the public borrowing requirement.

40.
The authorities concur that medium-term fiscal policy should be enshrined in a fiscal
rules framework to ensure a lasting fiscal consolidation. They reiterate the important role that the
FRBMA has played in reducing the fiscal deficit prior to the crisis. The exact contour of the mediumterm fiscal framework will be traced in the 13th Finance Commission report (expected to be publicly
released in February 2010). However, the authorities are receptive to staff’s recommendation to
anchor the fiscal framework to a medium-term debt target of about 65 percent of GDP and bring all
spending above the line.
41.
The authorities view the introduction of the GST and Draft Direct Tax Code as having
an enormous potential to raise economic efficiency and thus contribute to fiscal consolidation
in the medium term. Despite considerable progress, the GST will unlikely be introduced by April
2010, as its exact design—including the number and level of rates, and tax base—is still being
worked out between the center and the states. The draft Direct Tax Code is currently being revised to
incorporate comments from stakeholders. Both reforms will broaden the tax base, while lowering tax
rates, which will improve compliance, reduce administrative costs, and enhance efficiency.
42.
The authorities agree that a durable fiscal consolidation would focus not only on
revenue improvement but also on expenditure management. The government remains committed
to reducing the subsidy bill. Reform options are being explored, as evidenced by the setting up of an
expert group to examine fuel pricing and the proposed adoption of a nutrient-based fertilizer subsidy
regime with the goal of moving to a system of direct transfers to the farmers. With regards to plan
spending, there is a renewed focus on expenditure management in order to further improve the
quality of spending.

Sources: Data provided by the Indian authorities; state level data from the RBI Study on State Finances; and Fund staff amalgamate and prepare projections.
1/ The consolidated general government comprises the central government (CG) and state governments. Data for April - March fiscal years.
2/ Based on RBI's estimate of provisional outturn for state finances.
3/ Based on RBI's revised estimates of state finances.
4/ Tax revenue equals tax revenue of central government (CG), including NCCF and states' share, plus state tax revenue.
5/ Nontax revenue equals nontax revenue of CG, less interest payments by states on CG loans, plus nontax revenue of states.
6/ In 2007/08, includes a special dividend payment from the RBI amounting to roughly 0.7 percent of GDP. The authorities include this item under "other capital receipts."
7/ Expenditure and net lending equals total expenditure and net lending of CG (authorities' definition excluding subsidy-related bonds), less net loans and grants to states
and union territories, plus total expenditure of states (excluding interest payments on CG loans).
8/ In 2007/08, includes 0.7 percent of GDP for the government's purchase of SBI shares from the RBI.
9/ The authorities treat states' divestment proceeds, including land sales, above-the-line as miscellaneous capital receipts. Staff's definition treats divestment receipts
as a below-the-line financing item.
10/ Above-the-line items in the CGA, which cancel out in the consolidation (e.g., loans to states).
11/ Includes combined domestic liabilities of CG and states governments, inclusive of MSS bonds, and sovereign external debt at year-end exchange rates.

Appendix 1. India’s Recovery in Perspective
India’s economy has rebounded strongly and the recovery is well-entrenched. According to a
“heat map” of key economic indicators, India’s momentum is among the strongest in the world. Unlike
other major economies where indicators have moved sideways in the past couple of months, in India
the heat map shows a sustained pickup in activity since June 2009. Industrial production has
gathered pace rapidly since the beginning of 2009/10. Cement production and consumer durables
sales have increased substantially, pointing to a recovery of private domestic demand. Exports, which
remain below last year’s levels, have also rebounded strongly: in sequential terms (3-month moving
average saar), exports grew by 97 percent in September. Equity portfolio inflows have also increased
markedly and the stock market index has soared by 80 percent since March, with the rupee
appreciating by nearly 10 percent against the U.S. dollar. Along with China and Indonesia, Indian
equity prices have outperformed other major Asian economies. In India, valuation ratios have
rebounded, including for cyclical stocks, pointing to a domestic demand driven recovery.

Forward looking indicators point to a continuation of these trends. The OECD’s leading
indicator (LI) index for India has continued to rise, approaching pre-crisis levels in September. The

24
level of the index is 7 percent higher than the trough recorded in January 2009, as the decline in the
LI was shallower than in other major emerging market economies (notably Russia and Brazil). India’s
overall PMI has stabilized at a level above the expansionary threshold since May. Although the
rebound does not seem as strong as in some other emerging markets, such as Russia, where the
PMI increases have continued through September, India’s decline in 2008 was smaller. Further, the
business expectations component of the services PMI has improved considerably since June. The
export orders PMI indicates that the export growth momentum is likely to persist. The employment
PMI for both manufacturing and services, also in expansionary territory, point to a strengthening of
private consumption. Based on historical correlations, the manufacturing and services PMI indicate
that the industry and services sectors are on track to return to close to pre-crisis growth rates in
2009Q4.

Appendix 2. Economic Outlook
Growth is projected to rise from 6¾ percent in 2009/10 to 8 percent the following year. While
the initial impact of the global crisis on goods exports—which account for 15 percent of GDP—was
significant, the main effect of the crisis was through the financial and confidence channels.1 A marked
slowdown in domestic demand in late 2008-early 2009 resulted from heightened uncertainty and
higher borrowing costs. But the rapid normalization of financial conditions, both globally and
domestically, and improved business and consumer sentiment have led to a rebound in domestic
demand since April 2009. While agricultural output is likely to contract by about 1 percent y/y in
2009/10 owing to deficient rainfalls, non-agricultural GDP growth is expected to gather momentum in
the second half of the fiscal year, rapidly approaching potential growth. Private consumption would
benefit from robust growth in disposable income and employment while investment would be boosted
by rising business confidence, robust corporate profitability, and favorable financing conditions. As
uncertainty about the sustainability of the recovery continues to recede, investment would accelerate
significantly following a couple of quarters of strong domestic growth and stable global and domestic
financing conditions. This scenario is consistent with below-trend growth in advanced economies as
domestic demand would remain India’s principal growth driver, but assumes low international
financial market volatility and a positive outlook for corporate funding and capital flows. Preliminary
evidence from fiscal multipliers also suggests that GDP growth would benefit from the direct impact of
government spending (e.g., the implementation of the 6th Pay commission by the states and other
public sector entities) and the delayed impact of tax cuts on investment.

Growth is projected to revert to its potential trend in 2010/11. By then, exports should return to
positive growth, although the net export contribution is expected to be small as the pick up in
investment will boost imports. As a result of the recovery in both exports and imports, the current
account deficit is projected to widen slightly to 2.1 percent of GDP in 2010/11 from 1.9 percent of
GDP in 2009/10. From a saving-investment perspective, gross national savings are expected to
continue to increase, as fiscal consolidation takes hold and firms’ profits boost corporate savings.
Private investment would also continue to rise as infrastructure spending takes off.

1

In the three-year period prior to the crisis, annual export growth averaged 25 percent, but the contribution of net
exports to GDP growth was less than one percentage point.

Appendix 3. Outlook for Capital Inflows
After large outflows in the wake of the Lehman demise, capital flows to emerging markets
(EMs) have rebounded strongly. Portfolio flows and cross-border syndicated loans explain the
volatility observed. Likewise, India has seen an inflow in equity portfolio (FII) flows of $ 15 billion in
the year since April against an outflow of $5 billion in the previous two quarters. External commercial
borrowing (ECB) by Indian corporates has also resumed, though it has not reached pre-crisis levels.

An empirical analysis of capital flows to India captures their determinants and dynamics fairly
well. Using a time series model, we investigate the determinants of FII and ECB flows. The results
suggest that:



A decline in global risk aversion (proxied by
the U.S. VIX) increases FII flows to India,
while the coefficients on the lagged stock
market index imply that investors seek
markets showing positive momentum but
withdraw as valuations rise;
ECBs are also influenced by the VIX, but are
more sensitive to market capitalization and
growth differentials;

The outlook for capital flows to EMs and to India is positive. Historically, a low interest rate

capital flows to EMs. Market surveys show that

Appendix 4. Inflation: Developments and Outlook

Inflation expectations have also increased and
the output gap is estimated to be small. The
RBI’s inflation expectations survey shows that
households expect inflation to increase over the
next three-month as well as one-year horizons.
The distribution of expected WPI inflation (for
2010/11) from Consensus Forecast has also
moved, with market participants expecting higher
and more volatile inflation for 2010/11. Firms are
regaining pricing power as evidenced by the rising
ratio of output to input prices in PMI surveys. The
output gap is estimated to be less than one
percent, and is expected to close at the end of
2010/11.

WPI inflation is projected to reach 8 percent y/y by March 2010, and decline gradually to 5–6 percent

Food prices in India rose less than international food prices in 2007-08 given price controls and other
government interventions. However, in 2009 while global food prices declined, domestic prices have been
catching up, and were later affected by the drought.

Appendix 5. Monetary Conditions, Corporate Funding, and Asset Prices
In its October Review, the RBI kept policy rates unchanged but began the first phase of exit.
The special refinancing facilities for banks and for on-lending to mutual funds and non-bank finance
companies (NBFCs) were revoked with immediate effect and the statutory liquidity requirement (SLR)
was restored to its pre-crisis level of 25 percent (from 24 percent). The RBI stressed that the “current
monetary stance is not the steady state and we need to reverse the expansionary stance,” a clear
signal that the tightening cycle has begun. The RBI also increased provisioning requirements on
commercial real estate and total provisions to 70 percent of nonperforming assets (NPAs) by
September 2010.

The rupee remains below its pre-crisis
peak. The exchange rate appreciation
since October has tightened monetary
conditions slightly. In real effective terms,
the rupee is broadly in line with
fundamentals.1 While this suggests that
there might be limited scope for further
real appreciation, the impact of a stronger

a reduction in the inflation differential. A

Short-term interest rates are low. After
cutting the reverse repo rate by 275 basis points (bps) and the repo rate by 425 bps, the RBI
has kept them unchanged at 3.25 percent and 4.75 percent, respectively, since April 2009.
The call money rate has been hovering at the bottom of the policy corridor. Interest rates on
bank deposits and loans, which rose in the initial phase of the crisis, have declined since the
beginning of 2009. Given projected inflation, deposit rates are negative in real terms. The
market is anticipating a significant tightening in policy rates and the yield curve has
steepened since January.

Monetary transmission lags are relatively long. The peak effect of interest rates on output is
estimated at 4-6 quarters, though likely shorter in a tightening cycle.3 Currently, the policy rate is
some 200 bps below the neutral rate (estimated using a simple Taylor rule). Given the monetary

2

In fact, a simple econometric test for India based on quarterly data for 1996-2009 indicates the real GDP
growth precedes credit growth. Shocks to activity only have a significant impact on credit after 4 quarters. This
finding of a “creditless” recovery is broadly consistent with the cross-country evidence reviewed in the April 2009
WEO (Box 3.2).
3

Loan repricing is faster as loans are mostly linked to the benchmark prime lending rate, while deposits are fixed
term, with the typical maturity being 1 year. Also in an easing cycle, the transmission mechanism is impaired by
the small savings schemes, whose interest rates are administratively set at around 8 percent.

31
transmission lags and inertial behavior in short term interest rates, a timely and gradual normalization
of the monetary stance could ensure that inflation expectations remain well anchored.
International spillovers of monetary tightening in India will likely be small. The direct spillovers
should affect only countries in the region, particularly those pegged to the rupee. Indirect spillovers
via growth are expected to be negligible because the RBI would only tighten once the recovery is
entrenched and the monetary policy stance would return to neutral only gradually.

Appendix 6. Technical Note on DSGE Model1
Staff have developed a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with
macrofinancial linkages for India. The model—estimated on ten key macroeconomic variables from
1996 to 2008 using Bayesian estimation techniques—incorporates the financial accelerator
mechanism in a setting where firms can borrow in domestic and foreign currency. The increased
reliance of Indian corporates on financing external to the firm suggests that the financial accelerator
might play an important role in the propagation of shocks.
The model yields plausible estimates for the parameters of interest. The estimated elasticity of
corporates’ external finance premium is in line with studies for other EMs. Tests of the model suggest
that it provides a good fit, especially with the inclusion of a financial accelerator. The model also
outperforms empirical Bayesian VARs, providing further support for its use for policy analysis.
Estimates of the monetary policy reaction function suggest that the RBI places a relatively
high weight on stabilizing the rate of depreciation of the nominal exchange rate and inflation.
The results suggest that a 1 percent depreciation of the nominal exchange rate causes short-term
interest rates to rise by 100 bps, while a 1 percentage point increase in inflation leads to a 90 bps
increase in rates.
Impulse response functions confirm the importance of the financial accelerator. In addition to
the decline in domestic demand and appreciating exchange rate following a contractionary monetary
policy shock, high interest rates and low inflation increase the real borrowing cost for corporates,
decreasing investment and capital. As the price of capital falls, corporates’ net worth—the value of
their collateral—declines, raising the cost of borrowing further, and putting additional pressure on
output. Similarly, a shock to corporates’ risk premia reduces investment and capital, which via the
financial accelerator increases the cost of borrowing even further.

The model suggests that financial shocks are nearly as important as either demand or supply
shocks. Domestic demand and supply shocks account for about 30 percent of output volatility each,
compared to 25 percent for financial shocks, and 14 percent for foreign demand shocks.

Appendix 7. Financial Stability of the Indian Banking System
India’s financial soundness indicators (FSI) compare well internationally, although asset
quality is deteriorating.
The authorities’ assessment. The authorities’ Report of the Committee on Financial Sector
Assessment (CFSA, March 2009) concluded that India’s financial system was sound. Though nonperforming assets (NPAs) could increase during the slowdown, the rise was not likely to pose
systemic risks. India was also found compliant with most standards and codes, with gaps noted in the
implementation of bankruptcy proceedings.

percent. At 2.3 percent of total assets, NPAs compare well internationally, but this comparison is
complicated by the restructuring allowed in October 2008-June 2009, under which 2.9 percent of
loans were rescheduled. Moody’s and Crisil anticipate that gross NPAs will rise to around 5 percent
by March 2011, similar to the staff’s baseline. Provision coverage is low, but the RBI has recently
instructed banks to raise it to 70 percent by September 2010. Profitability is broadly in line with other
EM and is holding up well. Market indicators of financial stability also paint a relatively healthy picture
of Indian banks.

Nonbank institutions. After facing significant redemptions during the crisis, mutual funds have since
witnessed large inflows especially from commercial banks. The inflows from banks have been to fixed
maturity plans seeking yield and tax arbitrage opportunities given the high level of excess reserves,
raising some concerns of liquidity risk if banks were to withdraw their deposits abruptly. NBFCs,
which remain reliant on wholesale funding, are again expanding their assets, albeit at much reduced
rates compared to the pre-crisis pace.
Staff broadly shares the authorities’ assessment of India’s financial stability, although more
severe stress tests would be advisable. Credit remains the main risk to financial stability. The
RBI’s increase in provisioning coverage is welcome given India’s low level. In line with the authorities’
approach in previous cyclical upswings, higher provisioning on all real estate and equity exposures
could also be considered, were signs of asset bubbles emerge. To deepen the financial stability
assessment, more extreme stress tests for combined shocks should be carried out based on a more
integrated approach to macro-financial risks: this could be incorporated in the guidelines on stress
testing scheduled to be issued in January 2010.
The RBI’s continued efforts to strengthen financial stability are welcome. The new Financial
Stability Unity could help achieve a more integrated view of financial stability. The Financial Stability
Report will provide more high frequency information on the financial sector, and could also fill
information gaps regarding financial institutions’ FX and derivatives exposures, and real estate
indicators.

The impact of higher default rates on CAR is estimated by assuming that impaired loans are provisioned up to
70 percent, and reducing risk-weighted assets and capital at a rate equivalent to the increase of the NPA ratio.

Reforms to the institutional framework for infrastructure financing will be critical to the
achievement of the authorities’ growth targets over the medium to long term. According to the
Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007-12), sustaining a growth rate of 9 percent requires a substantial
increase in infrastructure investment from around

savings into infrastructure investment will be
critical. Infrastructure financing has specific requirements such as the provision of long-term funds,
varied risk-return characteristics, and a large and lumpy disbursement profile. India’s financial
system, which remains dominated by banks, is not particularly well suited for this kind of financing,
while debt markets better able to finance infrastructure—especially the corporate bond market—
remain relatively underdeveloped. Attempts to increase bank, pension, and insurance penetration will
help mobilize long-term savings in the long run, but access to external finance—both in the form of
foreign equity capital and long-term debt finance—is likely to be necessary in the short run (GOI
2007).
Improving the Ability of Banks to Finance Infrastructure
Banks have limited ability to finance infrastructure. A significant share of banks’ assets, roughly
corresponding to the size of their long-term liabilities, is reportedly already invested in infrastructure.
Thus, banks would

Development of the Corporate Bond Market
Further development of the corporate bond market is crucial to increase the availability of
financing for infrastructure.2 India’s corporate bond market remains small compared to other EMs,
despite an increase in issuance in recent months and measures to promote its development.3 To
2

Raising adequate equity finance tends to be one of the most challenging aspects of infrastructure project
financing but India’s relatively sophisticated and deep stock market makes it less of a binding constraint. Thus,
we focus more on the debt capital angle of infrastructure financing. See World Bank (2006) for constraints on the
equity-side.

The authorities have streamlined primary issuance guidelines and disclosure and listing requirements for
private placements, improved credit information, and strengthened clearing and settlement mechanisms.

ensure that the recent burst in issuance does not prove ephemeral, long-term impediments—
including a lack of liquidity in the government bond market and the absence of a benchmark yield
curve, limited third-party credit enhancement and hedging tools for investors and traders to mitigate
credit risk and interest rate risk, poor and lengthy enforcement laws relating to default proceedings,
and limited participation by domestic institutional investors—should be removed.4 In particular, the
following issues need to be addressed:

Credit enhancements. The issuance and trading of corporate bonds in India is dominated by
bonds with a rating of AA or above with little or no appetite for bonds rated at A or below
where most private infrastructure projects would fall. Third party credit enhancements or the
provision of credit guarantees (also known as bond insurance) for issues could provide an
impetus for lower rated issues to tap the market. While consideration is being given to the
IIFCL providing such instruments, given the substantial infrastructure needs, it is unlikely that
one institution would be able to meet the country’s requirements.6 Other specialized public
institutions might consider offering similar financial products, given that provision by private
institutions is likely to be very limited and commercial banks are not permitted.

Government securities (G-Secs). A liquid G-Sec market is necessary to develop a
benchmark yield curve for the pricing of corporate bonds. Despite the sizeable G-Sec market
in India, liquidity remains low due to the lack of benchmark issues and the prevalence of buyand-hold investors. With regards to the former, the size of each benchmark security needs to
be sufficiently large (usually a

Starting in 2003, the RBI has made efforts to consolidate issuances with the aim of concentrating liquidity in a
small number of benchmark issues but trading activity remains limited a few bonds and benchmark bonds often

40
allowed. The authorities have also put forward draft guidelines on repos in corporate bonds
that may enhance liquidity of the underlying asset. However, they have suggested that they
would allow this only once fair pricing is available, although the two may be quite
interconnected.


Interest rate risks. The authorities re-launched interest rate futures (IRFs) on a 10-year Gsec in August 2009 following a failed attempt in 2001. The current guidelines allow authorized
institutions to trade IRFs for both hedging purposes and on their own account which should
enhance liquidity.7 However, the incentives to hedge interest rate risk remain limited by
banks’ ability to hold government securities up to the SLR limit in the banking book without
applying mark-to-market accounting rules, while the limited liquidity of the underlying G-Secs
hinders trading activity in IRFs.8



Securitization. The RBIs proposed lock-in and minimum retention criteria for securitization
exposures should help resolve concerns over the “Originate to Distribute” model viewed by
many to be a contributor to the problems that arose in other structured finance markets
during the global crisis. However, the retention requirements need not be imposed uniformly
across the board, but tailored to the type of securitization and underlying assets to ensure
that those forms of securitization that already benefit from “skin in the game” and operate well
are not weakened (IMF 2009). The effects of other regulations such as revisions to the Basel
II framework will also require careful consideration.



Reducing costs of dealing with distressed assets. The market for distressed assets could
be boosted by: (i) giving NBFCs the same rights as banks under the Securitization and
Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act; (ii) easing
restrictions on a single investor having a controlling stake in asset reconstruction companies
(ARCs) and on FDI in ARCs and; (iii) creating a central registry of security interests. Passage
of the new Companies Bill would consolidate the fora for dealing with the rehabilitation and
liquidation of companies and bring the insolvency framework closer to international best
practices. Further improvements—including mechanisms to deal with cross-border
insolvency, a greater role to unsecured creditors, and allowing for debtor-in-possession
financing—could be considered. In addition, ways to make the out of court corporate debt
restructuring mechanism result in more operational restructuring could be explored and the
personal insolvency framework modernized.



Development of the corporate bond market would benefit from increasing the role of
foreign investors in the local debt market. Domestic institutional investors are typically
buy-and-hold investors, while foreign participation are more likely to trade and could therefore
contribute to a more liquid market. Although the authorities have increased the limit on
foreign participation in the corporate bond market from $3 to $15 billion, these limits have not
been fully utilized. The reasons mentioned by investors include the fact that the market is too
small and illiquid, the lack of a benchmark yield curve in the government bond market as
referred to above, as well as a lack of transparency surrounding the allocation mechanism for
FII limits. For this reason, the authorities could consider merging the existing limits with those
for the government bond market (currently $5 billion). The authorities remain concerned that
this will increase volatility in the market. However, a staff study of 10 major EMs revealed that
while greater foreign participation lowers yields, the effect on the volatility of yields cannot be
clearly discerned: greater foreign participation reduced volatility in Mexico, Malaysia, Turkey

Trading in IRFs was only allowed on a client’s account when IRFs were launched in 2001.

There are also issues concerning the physical settlement of the IRF contract that may constrain its
development.

but increased it in Korea and no relationship between the two was detected in several other
countries.9
The Role of Institutional Investors
International experience suggests that domestic institutional investors play a key role in the
development of the corporate bond market. In several Latin American countries (e.g. Chile and
Mexico), growth in the amount of corporate bonds outstanding was closely tied to the growth of
pension fund assets under management (AUM). Insurance companies have also been a significant
source of demand for corporate bonds in Asia—including in Malaysia where an easing of regulations
on portfolio composition played an important role. Mutual funds have also become a more important
player in the fixed income markets globally.

Expansion of the NPS—together with the
proposed Pension Fund Regulatory and
Development Authority (PFRDA) bill—should lead to greater demand for corporate bonds as
NPS investment options and guidelines are less restrictive than the Employees’ Provident
Fund Organization (EPFO) investment regulations.11 However, for the time being most of the
AUM of pension and provident funds are under EPFO, which does not invest in corporate
bonds.12

The NPS is still in its infancy and currently covers only about 600,000 government employees and 3,000 nonpublic sector workers with total NPS assets at about Rs 33 billion. See Poirson (2007) for an overview of pension
reforms and its financial implications in India.
11

The PFRDA Bill proposes that the main mandate of PFRDA is to regulate the NPS. Pension schemes already
covered under the Employees’ Provident Fund & Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 and other enactments
would be specifically excluded from the architecture of the NPS. Further, the Bill provides that PFRDA will
stipulate investment guidelines for pension funds.

12

A survey of pension fund investment guidelines in other EMs suggests that while significant exposure to
government debt is stipulated, there is considerable freedom for these funds to invest in a mix of financial
instruments with varying risk-return profiles more akin to the investment option under the NPS.

However, investment guidelines would

companies’ role as captive sources for government financing remains a key obstacle to their
investments in other fixed-income products. The Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC),
which has over 70 percent of market share, holds 22 percent of the stock of government
securities.



The sharp increase in AUMs of fixed maturity plan mutual funds (MFs) in India could
provide an important source of demand for corporate paper. Overall, there is a need for
an analysis of scope for tax and regulatory arbitrage among the pension, insurance and MF
sectors to support their sound growth given the nascent state of institutional development.

13

Non-life insurance companies have shown a tremendous growth in recent years largely driven by unit linked
insurance policies (ULIPs) that invest predominantly in equities rather than fixed-income instruments.

14

The investment guidelines revised by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) in 2008
require insurance companies to invest not less than 15 percent of their investments in infrastructure and social
sectors. However, the guidelines also lay down a minimum tenor of 10 years and a credit rating of ‘AA’ for
investments in debt paper which would exclude most infrastructure SPVs’ debt paper. Investment guidelines for
life and non-life insurance companies also specify that not less than 50 percent of assets should be in
government or approved securities, which effectively renders nearly 50 percent of assets to be invested in public
sector debt due to restrictions on approved securities.

Appendix 9. Foreign Participation in Emerging Markets Local Currency Bond Markets1
Foreign investors can be an important source of demand for domestic government paper,
thus lowering bond yields and improving market liquidity. On one hand, foreign investors could
help develop domestic bond markets in Emerging Markets (EMs) as their higher propensity to trade
complements the buy-and-hold strategy of most domestic institutional investors, which contributes to
a more liquid market. On the other hand, increased foreign presence could also imply greater volatility
in local bond markets as highlighted by the literature on “sudden-stops” of capital flows and evidence
of contagion in EMs.
This paper sheds light on the impact of foreign participation on long-term government bond
yields and their volatility in a group of EMs. To our knowledge, there has been little empirical
analysis of the determinants of local currency bond market yields in EMs, in general, and even less
on the role of foreign investors.2 For this study, we compile a unique time-series database of foreign
participation in domestic government bond markets from the Asiabondonline database and IMF
country desk data.
Panel data estimates indicate that foreign participation
reduces long-term local currency bond yields in EMs.
The econometric analysis is based on a standard reducedform specification for a panel of 10 EMs using a
comprehensive set of macro-financial determinants
identified in the literature and country fixed effects.
Importantly, the results suggest that foreign participation
has a statistically significant impact on yields controlling for
other determinants. A 1 percent increase in the share of
foreign investors in the government bond market is
associated with 6 bps lower yields, on average.
However, there is no clear evidence that foreign
investors increase interest rate volatility. We use a
time series approach to estimate the impact of the share of
foreign investors in government bond markets on the
volatility of long-term yields in EMs. Using a Generalized
Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH)
econometric model for monthly data from 2000, we show
that greater foreign participation significantly increases
yield volatility in one country (Korea) and decreases it in a
few others (Hungary, Malaysia, Mexico, Turkey), while
being an insignificant explanatory variable in most other
cases.

India’s public finances continue to be under
strain. The fiscal deficit has deteriorated
significantly since 2008/09, when a combination of
spending measures introduced prior to the global
crisis, a soaring subsidy bill, fiscal stimulus
packages in response to the crisis, and a cyclical
downturn in tax revenue, reversed the process of
fiscal consolidation underway since 2003/04. The
2008/09 general government fiscal deficit, inclusive
of subsidy-related bond issuance, widened to 11
percent of GDP, one of the highest among EM,
from 4.7 percent of GDP in 2007/08.

Source: IMF WEO Database; IMF APD Regional Outlook October 2009; and
staff calculations.

The general government deficit will likely remain unchanged at about 11 percent of GDP in
2009/10


Central government. The 2009/10 budget, with a deficit target of 6.8 percent of GDP,
extends the expansionary fiscal stance to help support economic recovery. The high level of
public spending is maintained with savings from the lower subsidy bill reoriented towards
social programs and infrastructure. Tax revenue is expected to remain subdued reflecting the
6 percentage points cut in excise and 2 percentage points cut in service tax rates. Staff
estimates that the central government’s deficit target for this year may exceed the budget
target marginally (by 0.2 percent of GDP), as indirect tax revenue may underperform given
collections so far. The robust economic recovery underway may boost direct tax collections
and close the gap on the revenue side, but spending pressures constitute the main downside
risk. Subsidy-related bond issuance is projected at 0.3 percent of GDP.



States. The combined states’ deficit is projected to widen to 3.7 percent of GDP in 2009/10,
from an estimate of 3.1 percent of GDP in 2008/09. States are implementing the
recommendations of the 6th Pay Commission and are taking advantage of the higher
borrowing limit to raise capital spending, while growth in own revenue and resources
transferred from the center remains lackluster.

The targeted reduction in the central government’s budget deficit in the next two years is
feasible, but requires measures. The goal to reduce the deficit to 5.5 percent of GDP in 2010/11
from a projected 7 percent in the current year will be helped by: (i) the falling out of some
expenditure—the Sixth Pay Commission arrears and lower outlays for the agricultural loan waiver
(about 0.5 percent of GDP); and (ii) revenue buoyancy (0.4 percent of GDP). But some additional
discretionary measures, such as the rolling back of the tax cuts implemented during the crisis, are
likely to be needed. The reduction in the deficit to 4 percent of GDP announced for 2011/12 will
unlikely be achieved without expenditure measures and the implementation of the planned tax
reforms.
International spillovers of India’s fiscal consolidation are likely small. In India’s case, lowering
the deficit could actually be expansionary. Further, the international impact may be positive because
investment is more import-intensive than government consumption.

India: Tax Revenue in International Perspective

Tax Revenue (In percent of GDP)

Revenue reform has the potential to
contribute to fiscal consolidation over the
medium-term. Two major tax reforms are on the
anvil that aim to broaden the tax base, while
lowering rates. As India’s tax revenues are high
relative to peers, both reforms will be designed to
be revenue neutral. Nevertheless, they are
anticipated to yield substantial efficiency gains
and improve compliance which would bolster
economic performance.1



The authorities have issued a draft Direct
Tax Code, which would bring simplicity and transparency, and minimize distortions. The draft
Direct Tax Code broadens the tax base by removing most exemptions, and proposes
reducing corporate tax rates from 33 to 25 percent.2 The Direct Tax Code, which is currently
being revised to incorporate comments from stakeholders, is expected to be adopted in
2011/12.



The authorities are also planning to introduce a Goods and Services Tax (GST), whose exact
parameters are currently being decided. The GST will have a federal and state component
and will subsume various indirect central and state taxes. By reducing the cascading of
indirect taxes, harmonizing tax rates and exemptions across states, and establishing a
comprehensive and transparent chain of set-offs, the GST will widen the tax base and
improve compliance, eventually leading to lower tax burden, which would in turn feed into
higher direct tax collections. 3

The missing element to the authorities’ plans is expenditure reform. To ensure a lasting fiscal
consolidation, subsidy reform remains the topmost priority.4 The reform of the subsidy system should
eliminate regressive subsidies (such as on gas, diesel and LPG) and introduce a market-based
pricing mechanism for petroleum products. Over time, the subsidies on products consumed
predominantly by the poor, e.g. kerosene, food, fertilizer, could be replaced by targeted support,
which should be facilitated by the planned introduction of a unique identification number. These
measures would go a long way in lowering the subsidy bill without unduly affecting the poor.5
1

The introduction of a ‘flawless’ GST is estimated to boost GDP growth by 0.9-1.7 percent (Report of the
th
Taskforce on Goods & Services Tax, 13 Finance Commission, December 15, 2009).

2

In 2008/09, revenue foregone by the central government from existing exemptions amounted to 8 percent of
GDP and close to 70 percent of actual tax collection.

3

If successful, the reform will not only significantly improve the country’s tax system but will also pave the way
forward for other countries by resolving a longstanding dilemma for VAT administrators—how to best implement
a multijurisdictional VAT system.

4

See Selected Issues Paper, Chapter 7, India 2007 Article IV Consultation and Selected Issues Paper, Chapter
1, India 2005 Article IV Consultation.

5

The Central Government Subsidies Report (2004) estimates that eliminating non-essential subsidies, and
better targeting food, oil and fertilizer subsidies could save up to 2.3 percent of GDP.

47
Continued monitoring and evaluation of centrally sponsored schemes and rationalization, when
needed, should enhance the quality of public spending and improve service delivery, critical for
sustaining inclusive economic growth and alleviating poverty.
A faster pace of privatization of public sector companies could also support fiscal
consolidation, but cannot replace adjustment. The government recent announcement that all
listed public sector undertakings (PSU) have to meet a minimum 10 percent public holding
requirement and all profitable PSU must be listed is a step in the right direction. But for a significant
contribution to debt reduction, the government would have to divest some of the companies it now
judges strategic and lower the minimum government holdings in the financial sector.

Appendix 11. Public Debt Target1
Determining the appropriate level for a public debt target
is challenging. With economic theory providing little
guidance on the optimal level of debt, various approaches
were used to examine what would be a prudent and feasible
debt ratio for India.

Examples of Debt Ceilings

Cross-country studies have identified a wide range of
‘optimal’ levels of public debt and most countries have
opted for simple rules of thumb in selecting their target.
Depending on countries’ circumstances and policy priorities,
debt targets range from as low as 25 percent to as high as
60-70 percent of GDP. Most countries appear to have
followed convergence criteria of regional economic
agreements and peers’ debt ratios. Debt ceilings cluster
around 60 percent and 40 percent of GDP.

Following Reinhart and others (2003),2 the
-10
public debt thresholds of debt intolerance for
India range from 40 to 75 percent of GDP. This
-20
methodology relates a country’s sovereign rating
-30
(proxied by the Institutional Investor Rating) and
its public debt-to-GDP ratio, controlling for
-40
inflation and default history, to determine the level
of debt at which the country will be deemed more
credit-worthy. In the full sample of countries,
India’s threshold for debt intolerance is estimated to be as
high as 75 percent. Once the sample is restricted to
countries with market access, the threshold declines to
40-45 percent of GDP.

interest growth differentials preclude the use of this methodology in India’s case. Nevertheless,
sensitivity analysis reveals that a 60 percent debt-to-GDP ratio can be sustained under reasonable
assumptions for India’s long-run primary balance and discount factor.
India’s public debt could follow an array of paths depending on the fiscal reforms that the
government implements. By 2015/16, public debt could decline only marginally under a no-reform
scenario, while a combination of a fuel subsidy reform, enhanced revenue performance, and partial
privatization of public enterprises could bring its level to about 62 percent of GDP.

Staff projections
While none of the approaches yields conclusive results individually, taken together, they
suggest that a reasonable and feasible public debt ceiling for India by 2015/16 could be in the
order of 60-65 percent of GDP. Such a debt ceiling, while still above the average for EMs, would
allow for a countercyclical fiscal policy and provide some headroom for large contingent liabilities. It is
also a level of debt that could be sustainable given reasonable assumptions about the future interestgrowth differentials and primary balances. This debt target, lower than India’s lowest debt ratio over
20 years, would also be a clear break from the past and would, thus, bolster the credibility of India’s
fiscal framework.

ANNEX I: INDIA—MEDIUM-TERM PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Staff assumptions. After a dip in 2009/10, economic growth is forecast to quickly recover to its
potential (8 percent) driven by strong domestic investment and private consumption. Inflation is
projected to gradually decline to 5-6 percent by end-2010/11 and remain contained thereafter. The
general government deficit is projected to steadily decline, as the effect of the Sixth Pay Commission
wage hike, agricultural relief and fiscal stimulus wears off. Even without assuming a roll back of the
indirect tax cuts during the crisis, tax revenue is expected to recover gradually to its pre-crisis level as
a share of GDP, as the implementation of the goods and services tax in 2011/12 raises the buoyancy
of tax collections. Other working assumptions include:


Oil bonds. After 2009/10, the government is assumed to issue oil bonds to the state-owned
petroleum companies only to cover the subsidy cost of kerosene.



Other subsidy-related bond issuance. After 2009/10, the government is assumed not to issue
further bonds to the Food Corporation of India or the fertilizer companies as these expenses
are brought on-budget. Given the projected improvements in targeting and the move towards
nutrient-based fertilizer regime, the non-oil subsidy bill is assumed to decline marginally as a
share of GDP.

Debt path. Under the baseline scenario, the general government deficit would fall to 5.1 percent of
GDP by 2014/15 from roughly 11 percent of GDP in 2009/10. However, even at the end of the period,
the current balance of the general government continues to be in deficit. Over the same period, gross
public debt would decline to 72.3 percent of GDP from 78.2 percent of GDP in 2008/09, although it is
projected to peak at 81.7 percent of GDP reflecting the double-digit deficit of 2009/10.
A. Sensitivity Analysis
After an initial rise, a gradual decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio would occur under various shocks,
including in a scenario where the growth-interest rate differential rises above its historical average or
the currency experiences a sharp depreciation (Figure I.1 and Table I.1).
However, these favorable debt dynamics are contingent on a concerted effort by the government to
reduce the fiscal deficit. A no-policy change scenario, in which the primary deficit is held equal to its
2009/10 value, would lead to an unsustainable debt path. The debt-to-GDP dynamics are also highly
sensitive to the growth assumptions. In the case of a protracted slowdown, with real GDP growth
averaging 5 percent, the ratio of debt to GDP would rise over the medium term.

1/ General government debt covers central and state governments, inclusive of MSS bonds.
2/ Derived as [(r - (1+g - g + (1+r]/(1+g++g)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate;  = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;  = share of
foreign-currency denominated debt; and  = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as (1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms, g = real GDP growth
rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based
on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period. Short-term debt includes all the outstanding non-resident deposit accounts.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last
projection year.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

Since March 1, 1993, the Indian rupee has floated against other currencies, although the Reserve
Bank of India intervenes in the market periodically. As per the Annual Report on Exchange
Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER), the exchange rate in India is classified as
floating with no pre-announced path for the exchange rate. On August 20, 1994, India accepted the
obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF Articles of Agreement. India maintains the
following restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions,
which are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a): restrictions related to the
nontransferability of balances under the India-Russia debt agreement; restrictions arising from
unsettled balances under inoperative bilateral payments arrangements with two Eastern European
countries; and a restriction on the transfer of amortization payments on loans by non-resident
relatives. These restrictions have not been approved by the Executive Board.
VIII.

Article IV Consultation:

The previous Article IV consultation discussions were held in December 2008. The staff report (IMF
Country Report No. 09/187) was discussed by the Executive Board on February 6, 2009.

ANNEX IV: INDIA—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
In Bank FY2009 (July 1-June 30), IBRD/IDA lending totaled $2.24 billion, slightly above the $2.15
billion in FY2008. IFC committed $947 million in FY2009, down slightly from $1.05 billion in FY2008.
The World Bank Group’s (WBG) Country Strategy (CAS) for India for 2009-2012 focuses on helping
India to fast-track the development of much-needed infrastructure and to support the seven poorest
states in achieving higher standards of living for their people. The strategy envisages a total proposed
lending program of US$14.4 billion for the next three years, of which US$9.6 billion is from the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and US$5 billion equivalent (SDRs
3.15 billion at the current exchange rate) from the International Development Association (IDA). The
projected total lending for FY2009-2012 includes approximately $3 billion additional IBRD financing in
response to the financial crisis.
The overarching objective of the CAS is to scale up the development impact of Bank Group
assistance to help India achieve rapid, inclusive growth and sustainable development, and improving
service delivery. It aims to do all this while strengthening weaknesses in project implementation,
improving the effectiveness of public spending, and achieving demonstrable results to scale up the
impact of World Bank assistance.
The diversity of India calls for a differentiated, tailored approach. In India’s low-income states and
lagging regions in more advanced states, the focus is on achieving the MDGs, relying primarily on
IDA resources and non-lending technical assistance (TA). In more advanced states and at the
central level, the focus is on strengthening institutions so that they can deal with emerging middleincome challenges, relying on IBRD lending and cutting-edge analytical work. IFC’s strategy
supports inclusive growth by increasing access to infrastructure and finance, focusing on low-income,
rural, and fragile regions and making climate change central to its work.
Implementation of the current CAS has focused on consolidating the program, moving away from
many small and fragmented projects towards large-scale programs. The shift to a more substantial
engagement has raised the visibility and influence of the Bank Group, while creating opportunities for
greater focus on public policy and institutional reform. Progress in implementing this approach is
evidenced by the new multi-billion dollar requests from the Government to support projects in key
sectors, such as highways, urban development, Ganga River clean-up, rural roads and livelihoods
programs.
Going forward, the Bank Group’s country strategy will have to adjust further to leverage other
financing sources as a result of the limits on Bank Group financing in India. IFC is close to meeting
its exposure limit and the Bank is quickly approaching the IBRD single borrower limit.

AsDB's India Country Partnership Strategy (2009-2012) (CPS) is based on four strategic pillars: (i)
Support for the process of inclusive and environmentally sustainable growth; (ii) Catalyzing
investment through the use of innovative business and financing modalities; (iii) Strengthening the
results orientation of project design and implementation and emphasizing knowledge solutions; and
(iv) Support for regional cooperation. The CPS has been designed to support Government of India's
efforts in facilitating inclusive growth and speeding up the pace of poverty reduction and social
development as emphasized in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2007-2012). It has been prepared within
a results-based framework, and aims at significantly strengthening AsDB support for infrastructure
development in the relatively poorer states of India, promoting public private partnerships in
infrastructure, supporting climate change adaptation and mitigation, and encouraging the use of
innovative financing modalities (non-sovereign loans and cofinancing) to enhance the leverage of
AsDB operations.

12
ANNEX VI: INDIA––STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Macroeconomic statistics are adequate for surveillance, but weaknesses remain in the
timeliness and coverage of certain statistical series. India has an elaborate system for compiling
economic and financial statistics and produces a vast quantity of data covering most sectors of the
economy. India subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) on
December 27, 1996 and started posting its metadata on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
on October 30, 1997. It is currently in observance of the SDDS, although it uses flexibility options for
timeliness of data on general government operations and on the periodicity and timeliness of labor
market data.
2.
The data module of the Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC, IMF Country
Report No. 04/96) was published in April 2004. It assesses India’s data dissemination practices
against the SDDS requirements and assesses the quality of six datasets based on the Data Quality
Assessment Framework (DQAF) developed by STA.
3.
National accounts and employment statistics: The Central Statistical Organization (CSO)
has recently reduced the dissemination lag for quarterly releases from three to two months and
released a new series of national accounts, with base year 1999–2000 in February 2006. Estimates
of value added in constant prices for public administration and defense may be biased upwards, as
they are based on the government’s wage bill (with arrears counted in the year that they are
paid) deflated by the Wholesale Price Index (WPI). Comprehensive data on employment are only
available on an annual basis and with a substantial lag. Also, employment data are only produced for
the formal sector, which accounts for a small segment of the labor market.
4.
Price statistics: The consumer price indices (CPIs) are based on weights that are over ten
years old and do not fully capture price developments in the economy. However, since January 2006,
the Labour Bureau has published a revised CPI for industrial workers with a 2001 base year and a
Working Group is engaged in the revision of the current producer price index to a new base.
Presently, there are four CPIs, each based on the consumption basket of a narrow category of
consumers (namely industrial workers, urban and nonmanual employees, agricultural laborers, and
rural laborers). The CPIs are published with a lag of about one month. A WPI (1993/94=100) is
published weekly with a lag of two weeks and is subject to large revisions, especially in periods of
rising inflation. In addition, the representativeness of the index may be undermined by the collection
of prices from a relatively small sample of products and the infrequent updating of weights. Real
estate and housing price data are not available on a timely basis and the geographic coverage is
limited.
5.
External sector statistics: While the concepts and definitions used to compile balance of
payments statistics are broadly in line with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual
(BPM5), the RBI presentation does not strictly follow the BPM5. Furthermore, trade data have quality,
valuation, timing, and coverage problems, and data on trade prices, volumes, and composition are
not regularly available on a timely basis. Only trade credit extended for more than 180 days is
included in the balance of payments (and the IIP and external debt data); trade credit is often less
than 180 days in most countries. Bilateral data on services exports to the United States and other
developed countries are manifold higher than counterpart services imports published by these same
countries. External debt statistics are available on a quarterly basis with a one quarter lag. Estimates
of short-term external debt are presented in the debt statistics on an original maturity basis. The
short-term maturity attribution on a residual maturity basis is only available annually (and excludes
residual maturity of medium- and long-term nonresident Indian accounts). The international
investment position (IIP) statistics cover the sectors prescribed in the BPM5 and these data are

13
disseminated within six months of the reference period in respect of annual data. Coverage of direct
investment positions data is hampered by the absence of appropriate legal or institutional authority.
India began disseminating the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency
Liquidity as prescribed under the SDDS in December 2001. The more up-to-date information on
certain variables, such as total foreign reserves, foreign currency assets, gold, and SDRs, are
available on a weekly basis and are disseminated as part of a weekly statistical supplement on the
RBI web site.
6.
Monetary and financial statistics: The RBI web site and the RBI Bulletin publish a wide
array of monetary and financial statistics, including reserve money and its components, RBI’s survey,
monetary survey, liquidity aggregates (outstanding amounts), interest rates, exchange rates, foreign
reserves, and results of government securities auctions. The frequency and quality of data
dissemination have improved substantially in recent years.
7.
Concepts and definitions used by the RBI to compile monetary statistics are in broad
conformity with the guidelines provided in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM).
Nevertheless, the following concepts and principles deviate from the MFSM. First, the resident sector
data do not provide sufficient information on the sectoral distribution of domestic credit. Specifically,
under their present sectorization scheme, the authorities subdivide the resident nonbank sector data
by (i) central government; (ii) state government; and (iii) the commercial sector (including other
financial corporations, public and other nonfinancial corporations, and other resident sectors).
Second, commercial banks add accrued interest to credit and deposit positions on a quarterly basis
only (instead of the prescribed monthly basis).
8.
The RBI reports monetary data for IFS on a regular basis. Since October 2006, the RBI has
initiated the electronic reporting of monetary data, which is a major improvement from the previous
paper-based reporting which was prone to errors and delays. India has also submitted to STA test
data (starting from December 2001 data) on the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) that have been
developed to implement the methodology outlined in the MFSM. STA is working with the authorities in
resolving the outstanding data issues on the development of the SRFs.
9.
Fiscal operations: The Ministry of Finance (MoF) posts selected central government
monthly fiscal data and quarterly debt data on its web site. However, no monthly data on fiscal
performance at the state level are available, and annual data are available only with an 8-month to
10-month lag. Consolidated information is unavailable on local government operations. In addition,
data on the functional and economic classification of expenditures are available with considerable lag.
There is also scope to improve the analytical usefulness of the presentation of the fiscal accounts.
For example, classification of government expenditure between developmental/nondevelopmental
and plan/nonplan obscures the economic nature and impact of fiscal actions. The MoF reports central
government data (on a cash basis) for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook
(latest reported data correspond to 2006). Some limited general government data has been reported
for 2002.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on India
January 25, 2010
1.
This statement contains information that has become available since the staff report
was circulated to the Executive Board. This information does not alter the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
Economic and financial developments
2.
Activity indicators have gathered further momentum. Industrial production
growth rose to 11.7 percent y/y in November, with both consumer durables and capital goods
picking up steam. Export growth also rose sharply, reaching 15 percent y/y in December. The
new orders and new export orders components of the manufacturing PMI (both of which are
above the expansionary threshold) have risen substantially in December, pointing to a
continuation of robust growth in domestic demand and exports.
3.
Inflation pressures have intensified. Headline WPI inflation rose to 7⅓ percent y/y
in December (12 percent in sequential terms, using the 3-month moving average saar), in part
because of large food price gains. CPI inflation measures are in the 13½–17¼ percent range,
given the higher weight of food in the consumption basket. But core inflation—excluding
food and energy—has also continued to accelerate, reaching 5⅔ percent in sequential terms.
4.
Financial conditions have continued to improve. Net portfolio inflows have surged,
reaching US$3.2 billion so far in January (compared to a monthly average of US$2 billion in
March–December 2009). Credit growth, which had dipped below 10 percent y/y in October,
reached 14⅓ percent y/y in December 2009.
Policy developments
5.
On January 14, the government announced several measures to tackle rising
food prices by improving the availability of major agricultural products. The
government will release 2–3 million tons of wheat and rice in the open market above the
allocation made under the public distribution system and has advised states to remove the
VAT on imported sugar and to enforce anti-hoarding measures.
6.
In January, the Reserve Bank of India has allowed repos in corporate debt
securities and exchange trading of major currencies futures against the rupee.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 4, 2010

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with India
On January 25, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with India.1
Background
India’s economy is one of the first in the world to recover after the global crisis. Prompt fiscal
and monetary easing, combined with the fiscal stimulus already in the pipeline and the return of
risk appetite in financial markets, have brought growth close to pre-crisis levels. Leading
indicators suggest the output gap will continue to close. Capital inflows are back on the rise, and
financial markets have regained most of the lost ground.
Growth is projected to rise from 6¾ percent in 2009/10 (April-March) to 8 percent the following
year. Agriculture is likely to contract by about 1 percent in 2009/10 due to the drought, but
nonagricultural GDP growth is expected to gather momentum. Private consumption would
benefit from better employment prospects and less uncertainty, and investment would be
boosted by robust corporate profits, rising business confidence, and favorable financing
conditions. With India’s long-term prospects remaining strong and private sector balance sheets
sound, we expect growth to be back at potential in 2010/11 even if advanced economies grow
below trend.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

Near-term risks are broadly balanced. On the upside, an acceleration of reforms and capital
inflows could spur investment. On the downside, the main risks are elevated inflation and
financing constraints arising from—among other things—the fiscal deficit, which could put
breaks on the recovery. Tail risks include asset price bubbles and a sudden stop in capital
inflows caused by turmoil in global financial markets.
India’s medium-term growth prospects remain bright. India was not at the center of the global
crisis and growth is well balanced and mainly reliant on domestic drivers. Risks to this favorable
outlook stem primarily from difficulties in implementing productivity-enhancing reforms and
continued supply bottlenecks.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors congratulated the authorities on their strong record of sound
macroeconomic policies and decisive actions leading to India’s early and vigorous recovery
from the global crisis. Directors noted that India’s rapid recovery has brought fiscal and
monetary policy trade-offs to a head earlier than in other countries. Longer-term priorities are
financial sector reforms to facilitate infrastructure investment, and fiscal consolidation. Directors
were reassured by the authorities’ vigilant monitoring and action plans to address the
challenges ahead.
Directors commended the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for starting the first phase of exit from
monetary accommodation and generally considered that conditions are ripe for a progressive
normalization of the monetary stance. They noted that this will require fine judgments by the
RBI, and favored a gradual approach to ensure the recovery reaches its full potential. Given
long transmission lags and the low policy rates, most Directors advised a timely start of the
withdrawal of monetary stimulus, which would help anchor inflation expectations and soften the
impact on long-term interest rates. More extended guidance from the RBI on future inflation may
also help in this regard.
Directors recognized the challenges the authorities face in managing capital inflows, and
welcomed their intention to continue to employ a range of measures. Most Directors considered
that rupee appreciation would help contain inflation and manage capital inflows, although a few
Directors argued for caution in this area. Sterilized intervention could help reduce excessive
exchange rate volatility, provided it does not generate further inflows. Directors also supported
the RBI’s approach to use prudential measures in case asset bubbles were to develop. Given
the need to develop India’s financial markets, several Directors advised a tightening of capital
controls only as a last resort.

3

Directors noted that India’s financial system has weathered the global crisis well. They
supported the initiatives to further strengthen the capital of public banks and financial regulation,
and the higher provisioning requirements recently introduced. While appreciating India’s selfassessment of the financial sector, they noted that the assessment of financial stability could be
further strengthened via multifactor stress tests and an independent evaluation of compliance
with international standards. Directors also encouraged the authorities to improve mechanisms
for dealing with distressed assets and the insolvency framework.
Directors concurred that infrastructure investment is a priority and encouraged the authorities to
maintain the momentum of reforms to ensure that the financial system will provide adequate
funding. They stressed the importance of developing a vibrant corporate bond market and
reforms that would foster greater participation by pension funds and the insurance sector in
funding infrastructure. Several Directors also considered that further opening the local debt
market to foreign investors could help in enhancing liquidity. A few other Directors advised a
more cautious approach in view of the volatility and vulnerabilities associated with capital flows.
Directors considered that public institutions have an important role to play in establishing the
overall framework for infrastructure financing and in filling market gaps, while carefully
managing risks to the public sector.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ announcement to lower the deficit starting from the next
budget. With the recovery becoming entrenched and given India’s high debt, they encouraged
the authorities to lay out a concrete strategy for reducing debt through durable reforms, which
would boost credibility and foster growth. Most Directors considered that anchoring India’s
medium-term fiscal framework with a debt target would be helpful.
Directors looked forward to the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax and the new Direct
Tax Code. They encouraged the authorities to phase out regressive subsidies and introduce
market-based pricing for petroleum products. Over time, the subsidies on products consumed
predominantly by the poor should be replaced with targeted support. Directors welcomed the
government’s focus on raising the quality of public spending and service delivery, and the
announcements regarding privatization.

Statement by Arvind Virmani, Executive Director for India
and Parthay Ray, Advisor to Executive Director
January 25, 2010
1.
Our Indian Authorities appreciate the value of the open and constructive policy
dialogue with the Fund. There has been convergence of views between the staff and the
Authorities on many issues, and the Authorities’ stance on specific aspects of the assessment
already finds a place in the staff report. For the sake of emphasis, completeness and clarity
comments on some key issues are detailed below.
2.
The Indian economy is among the first in the world to recover from the global crisis.
While the current GDP growth is still lower than the average annual growth rate of 8.8 per
cent during the five-year period from 2003-04 (i.e., April 2003 to March 2004) to 2007-08,
challenges remain in respect of a broad-based recovery. While food prices have experienced
a spurt, increases in prices of manufactured products (as reflected in the movements of the
wholesale price index of manufactured products, year-on-year) have been benign. The
recovery has been induced by conventional and unconventional fiscal and monetary-banking
policy responses. With the gradual return of normalcy to the global economy, the unwinding
of monetary and fiscal measures and their timing remains a challenge. The management of
the spurt in portfolio flows, which is now being increasingly recognized for its negative
externalities, is a renewed challenge. Financing infrastructure is another area that has drawn
attention of Indian policy makers.
Recent Turnaround and Future Expectations
3.
It may be pertinent to note that the Economic Survey, 2008-09 of the Government of
India (released in July 2009) stated categorically,
“If the US economy bottoms out by September 2009, there could be good possibility
for the Indian economy repeating its 2008-09 performance, i.e. around 7.0 ±0.75 per
cent in the fiscal 2009-10 (assuming a normal monsoon). The pattern of fiscal 200809 may be repeated in that case, though in an inverse sequence, with two not so good
quarters followed by two good quarters making a ‘U’-shaped revival of the growth
path” (page 27).
4.
In line with these expectations, during the second quarter of 2009-10 (i.e., July –
September, 2009), the economy rebounded with a real GDP growth of 7.9 percent. In fact,
continuation of these trends could make it possible for the economy to grow at 7 – 7.75
percent in 2009-10. For the more recent period, industrial production grew by 11.7 percent in
November 2009 on a year-on-year basis. Almost all segments of the financial markets
continued to remain stable and there has also been a pickup in net capital inflows,
particularly from the foreign institutional investors. All these bear testimony to the inherent
strength of the economy, experiencing a rapid and strong recovery from the knock-on effects
of the global crisis.

2
5.
Interestingly, the staff projections indicate a deceleration in the growth rate during
2011 - 2013 (Table in page 3). However, our expectation is that in the medium-term, India
should be back on the new (post 2003-04) trend growth path of 8.5 to 9 percent per annum,
with efforts being geared towards removal of critical policy and institutional bottlenecks.
Return to the Path of Fiscal Consolidation
6.
Welcoming the Authorities’ intention to lower the Central Government’s deficit, the
staff has emphasized discretionary measures. In this context, it may be noted that the path of
fiscal consolidation in India has been governed by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget
Management Act (FRBMA), 2003. Since then, India has made impressive reductions in
deficits both at the Central Government and the State Government levels. However, as a fallout of the global crisis, and despite some automatic stabilizers, fiscal policy in India, as
elsewhere in the world, has played the main role of boosting demand. Consequently, there
were a number of fiscal stimulus packages. The fiscal stimulus included both tax relief to
boost demand and increased expenditure on public projects to create employment and public
assets. These unusual developments during 2008-09 necessitated deviation from the
FRBMA. The Budget for 2009-10 has carried forward this policy through a fiscal expansion
of 4.1 per cent of GDP (over 2007-08 levels).
7.
While such fiscal expansion as a crisis management measure is in line with
internationally adopted policies at that juncture, going forward, a strategy of fiscal
consolidation will be of paramount importance. The Medium Term Fiscal Policy Statement,
2009-10 has provided the roadmap with the fiscal deficit declining to 5.5 per cent of GDP in
2010-11 and further to 4.0 per cent of GDP in 2011-12. In this process, both revenue
augmentation as well as rationalization of expenditure are important. In particular, the reform
of the subsidy regime, as envisaged in the Budget for 2009-10, could provide a more
sustainable base for fiscal consolidation.
8.
In order to further the process of fiscal consolidation initiated through the FRBMA,
one of the terms of reference of the Thirteenth Finance Commission (TFC), whose report is
expected to be released shortly, has been to assess the impact of various obligations of the
Central Government on the deficit targets, and to suggest, “ … a suitably revised roadmap
with a view to maintaining the gains of fiscal consolidation through 2010 to 2015.” Going
forward, the Report of the TFC and the proposed goods and services tax coupled with the
initiative on Direct Taxes Code would provide the impetus to a rule-based fiscal
consolidation process.
Balance of Payments and Capital Inflows
9.
As per the latest data on India’s balance of payments (BoP) for the second quarter
(July-September 2009) of 2009-10, while growth in exports and imports continued their
declining trend, trade deficit was lower reflecting larger fall in imports, especially oil
imports, on account of lower oil prices. Despite lower trade deficit, current account deficit at
US$ 12.6 billion in Q2 of 2009-10 was almost at the same level as last year, mainly on
account of lower net invisibles surplus.

3
10.
As far as capital inflows are concerned, more recent data are available and during the
financial year 2009-10 so far, accruals on account of foreign direct investment, deposits of
non-resident Indians and portfolio investment were significantly higher as compared to those
of the previous year. In particular, investments of Foreign Institutional Investors went up by
as much as US $ 22.8 billion during April 1, 2009 – January 8, 2010, as against a net
withdrawal of US $ 11.9 billion during the corresponding period of the previous financial
year. The Indian rupee appreciated by 11.24 percent against the US dollar as on January 8,
2010 over end-March 2009.
11.
The volatility of capital flows and the exchange rate has its attendant implications for
the monetary policy. Though the consequences of capital inflows during 2009-10 are
manageable, macro management could become more challenging as the growth expectations
approach the trend (8.5 – 9 percent) levels leading to more capital inflows. The negative
externalities arising from volatility in capital flows will need to be thought through and
appropriately addressed.
Monetary Policy Challenges
12.
An important challenge facing India at the current juncture is the build-up of
inflationary pressures, particularly in respect of food prices. In this context, the nature of
monetary policy response has generated considerable debate in India. First, it is generally
agreed that monetary policy is not an efficient instrument for reining in sectoral inflation. In
India, prices of primary articles have risen by 14.9 percent, prices of fuel and manufactures
rose by 4.3 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively in December 2009 (year-on-year).
Accordingly, the overall rate of inflation, which was in negative territory during June-August
2009 and around 1 percent in September-October 2009, has edged above the threshold of 5
percent which is monitored for monetary policy purposes. Second, India like many other
EMEs suffered the knock-on effects of the global crisis and in response, monetary and fiscal
policies had to switch to an unusually high accommodative stance, including through
unconventional modes. Overall GDP growth remains well below the pre-crisis average of 8.8
percent and bank credit growth has decelerated to around 14 percent as against around 24
percent a year ago. Consequently, the trade-off facing monetary policy is sharp – too early an
exit from accommodation risks jeopardizing the recovery; too delayed an exit may allow
current inflationary pressures to get embedded in inflation expectations. Obviously, a
judgment call has to be made, but fully sensitive that either side is weighed down by large
risks. So far, on a careful balancing of the trade-off and the existing slack in resource
utilization in the economy, the conduct of monetary policy has been supporting the recovery
while allowing supply-side management measures to work through and correct shortages in
specific commodities.
13.
In the face of incipient signs of generalized inflation, it would be an error to assume
that monetary policy in India will continue to remain accommodative. Indeed, against the
backdrop of developments in sectoral inflation conditions, the October 2009 review of
monetary policy affirmed its resolve to “keep a vigil on the trends in inflation and be
prepared to respond swiftly and effectively through policy adjustments to stabilise inflation
expectations”. It further stated: “….it bears emphasis that the Reserve Bank is mindful of its
fundamental commitment to price stability. It will continue to monitor the price situation in

4
its entirety and will take measures as warranted by the evolving macroeconomic conditions
swiftly and effectively.” Furthermore, it is important to note that a calibrated withdrawal of
accommodation has already commenced in the form of restoring of secondary reserve
requirements (the Statutory Liquidity Ratio) to 25 percent (after a temporary lowering of 1
percent during the crisis), closure of special liquidity facilities for non-bank finance
companies and mutual funds, increasing provisioning requirements on commercial real estate
and generally, raising all provisioning cushions consisting of specific provisions against
NPAs as well as floating provisions.
Financial Sector
14.
The Indian banking sector turned out to be resilient in the backdrop of the global
financial crisis. Apart from minimal exposure to toxic assets, the Indian banking sector has
greatly benefited from the initiatives relating to adoption of counter-cyclical prudential
regulations framework. Net non-performing assets (NPA) as a ratio to net advances of
commercial banks as at end March 2009 remained at last year’s level of 1.1 per cent. While
it is not unusual to expect NPAs to increase in a downturn, Indian banks are well capitalized
to cushion the impact of any possible increase in NPAs. Given the increase in banks’ net
worth over the past ten years and steady reduction in their NPAs, capital coverage for NPAs
is at a prudent level. Furthermore, to arrest any possible increase in non-performing loans,
the RBI has recently decided to increase the provisioning requirement for advances to the
commercial real estate sector classified as ‘standard assets’ from the present level of 0.40 per
cent to 1 per cent.
15.
As far as long-term funding for growth is concerned, financing for infrastructure has
attracted attention of the policy makers in India. The staff report has mentioned a number of
new initiatives, such as, take-out financing and credit enhancements being worked on by the
India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL). Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan
Singh has aptly identified the course of reforms as,
“We need to develop long-term debt markets and to deepen corporate bond markets.
This in turn calls for a strong insurance and pension sub-sectors. Some of the
reforms needed, especially in insurance, involve legislative changes. We have taken
initiatives in this area and will strive to build the political consensus needed for these
legislative actions to be completed. We need to improve futures markets for better
price discovery and regulation. We also need to remove institutional hurdles to
facilitate better intermediation” (Indian Prime Minister’s address at the
Inauguration of India Economic Summit on November 8, 2009; available at
http://pmindia.nic.in/speeches.htm).
