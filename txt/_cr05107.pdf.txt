Cyprus has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4,
and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions (Appendix I).

Data

The data in this paper refer only to the government-controlled areas in the
south (the GC areas), except where otherwise noted. Statistics for the GC
areas are generally of good quality and are adequate for surveillance,
though some improvements are needed and subscription to the SDDS
would be welcome (Appendix II): www.mof.gov.cy/mof/CyStat,

under the control of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus (the NGC
areas) are thought to be very weak: www.devplan.org.

Outreach and
publication

The mission met with members of parliament, trade unions, industry and
banks, as well as the academic community. The authorities released the
mission’s concluding statement and, while a final decision is pending, they
intend to consent to publication of the staff report.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Joining the European Union in May 2004 was a signal event for the Cypriot economy, with
adaptation to EU institutions and regulations bringing forward many important reforms. Though
these changes have posed significant challenges for the authorities and the private sector, they
have also set the stage for enhanced economic growth.
After a period of relatively weak growth, the economy began to rebound in 2004, with real
GDP growth now expected at 3.5 percent for 2004 and 3.8 percent for this year. Unemployment
remains low and—despite some recent pressures stemming from oil prices—inflation is subdued.
Fiscal consolidation is the key macroeconomic challenge currently facing Cyprus, given
slippages in recent years and the authorities’ ERM2 ambitions. Demographic pressures over the
medium term also underscore the importance of bringing down the debt ratio. If assiduously
implemented, the consolidation strategy laid out in the Convergence Program, which contains
several politically difficult but essential measures, would put Cyprus back on the road to fiscal
sustainability. Over the medium term, policy credibility would be buttressed by establishing an
explicit multi-year fiscal framework. The authorities’ interest in a fiscal ROSC is welcome.
Cyprus appears well-placed to join ERM2 in 2005 as intended, provided that the fiscal
adjustment effort is resolutely maintained and structural reforms continue to advance. The longstanding use of an ERM2-type exchange rate regime provides continuity, and the current parity
seems broadly in line with fundamentals, given continued full employment and the rebound in
tourism.
More remains to be done on the structural reform agenda, despite the fact that Cyprus has
made significant strides to meet the requirements of the EU. In particular, there is a need to foster
competition and promote efficiency, including in the public enterprise sector. In labor markets, the
centralized wage bargaining system needs to be reformed to enhance competitiveness. Although
financial sector regulation is generally strong, supervision of the cooperative sector should be
strengthened. The authorities are encouraged to undertake a Financial Sector Assessment (FSAP).
IMF activities, including technical assistance, could help support reunification and contribute
to improving the living standards of all Cypriots. The authorities’ consent to provide IMF
technical assistance to the Turkish Cypriot community in northern Cyprus could help establish a
baseline for advancing all of Cyprus toward best practices in a number of areas.

I. BACKGROUND TO THE DISCUSSIONS
1.
For the past few years, Cypriot politics have been dominated by EU accession
and attempts to reunify the country, issues that are linked in complex ways. A divided
Cyprus joined the EU on May 1, just a week after the rejection of a UN-sponsored referendum
on the “Annan Plan” for reunification. Although Turkish Cypriots (T/C) approved the plan by
a margin of 2:1, Greek Cypriots (G/C) opposed it by 3:1, citing concerns over proposed
security arrangements, potentially large fiscal costs, and the perceived hasty preparation of
some aspects of the plan. (Issues related to the T/C community are taken up in section IV.)
2.
The Cypriot authorities need to deliver a strong fiscal adjustment if they are to
succeed in their objective of early euro adoption. The Minister of Finance has shown
particular determination in this regard, despite pressures on the center-left governing coalition
from traditionally strong trade unions. President Papadopoulos of the centrist DIKO party was
elected in February 2003 and rules in coalition with the socialist AKEL, the largest party in
Cyprus.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Growth has begun to rebound following the relatively weak performance
of 2002–03, recovering in real terms to about 3½ percent in 2004 (Figure 1). The recovery has
been led by consumption, fed by fiscal easing (particularly in late 2003) as well as a possible
confidence effect from EU accession, but with a drag from net exports. Driven by a stronger
European economy, tourism has picked up, though per-tourist spending appears to have
remained sluggish (Figure 2 and Table 1). Unemployment remains very low by European
standards, while inflation has crept up modestly on rising energy prices. The current account
deficit has oscillated between 3½ and 4½ percent of GDP for several years, and is likely to
have remained on that order in 2004 (Table 2).
4.
Reversing considerable fiscal slippage is the main challenge to the authorities’
objective of early euro adoption. The general government deficit deteriorated from

Monetary policy has remained vigilant in the face of continued fiscal laxity and
completion of capital account liberalization on May 1. Modest but persistent outflows in
the weeks leading up to EU accession—exacerbated by the uncertainty attending the UN
referendum—led the Central Bank of Cyprus (CBC) to act decisively on April 30, 2004
(Figure 4 and Table 4). It successfully calmed the market when it hiked policy rates by
100 b.p. – bringing them to 250 b.p. above the corresponding euro area policy rates. Although
this monetary tightening came on top of the Cypriot pound’s appreciation in 2003 (versus the
U.K. pound and the U.S. dollar), market participants in Cyprus were almost unanimous in
praising the move. Given that inflation has crept upward on higher oil prices, the CBC has left
rates high since April, despite some appreciation and capital inflows, as well as an increase in
borrowing abroad.
III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
7.
The need for credible fiscal adjustment and the strategy for adopting the euro
were recognized to be the key challenges facing the government. The widening fiscal
deficit of recent years triggered an EU excessive deficit procedure shortly after accession.
Cyprus aspired to be part of the first wave of new members to adopt the euro, but was not
among the group that joined ERM2 in June 2004, and is now looking to join in the first part
of 2005. In this context, the discussions also emphasized external competitiveness, mediumterm external and fiscal sustainability, and the structural reforms required for strong
performance in a monetary union.
1

The government was required to set aside money to repay the bonds in the future, which it would
acomplish mainly by borrowing from the central bank, thus increasing the gross (but not the net) debt.
The Central Bank become independent in July 2001, after which the government borrowed from
commercial banks. The sinking funds will be extinguished by 2008, but will contribute to the stockflow adjustment until then.

Box 1. Response to Previous Fund Advice
The authorities have generally concurred with the thrust of IMF policy advice, including the
need for fiscal consolidation, structural reforms, and improvements in financial sector
supervision. Nevertheless, implementation of this advice has been appreciably better when
reinforced by EU directives.
Fiscal policy: Apart from 2004, slippage in achieving fiscal adjustment targets has occurred in
each of the past several years, due mainly to the growth in current spending, despite Fund calls
to tighten the fiscal stance. Staff suggestions to establish a medium-term fiscal framework have
also not yet been taken up, owing partly to limited capacity, as institutions strived to comply
with the requirements of EU accession.
Financial sector: Compliance with EU directives has induced interest rate liberalization and
some financial sector reforms in line with IMF advice. For example, coordination among
different supervisory bodies has been stepped up, though there is still room for improvement in
this area (including the need to align prudential regulations for the cooperative sector with
those faced by the banks).
Structural policies: Backward-looking wage indexation remains a fixture of Cypriot labor
relations, notwithstanding IMF concerns that it builds in significant rigidities. At the same
time, there has been significant progress with liberalization of air travel, electricity and the
telecommunications sector.

A. Macroeconomic Outlook
8.
Near-term growth prospects were jointly viewed as broadly positive. Real GDP
growth in 2004 is estimated at about 3½ percent, and staff projects growth of 3.8 percent
for 2005, close to the authorities’ forecast of 4 percent. The authorities saw more robust
growth being driven by an improved external environment, as well as confidence effects
following EU accession. At the same time, they also recognized several downside risks to the
forecast. If sustained, higher oil prices could slow growth in Europe and drive up air travel
costs, thereby dampening tourism demand. Moreover, geopolitical uncertainties in the region
could divert some travelers to other destinations. Despite pressures coming from higher
energy prices (which could be exacerbated via pass-through to wages given widespread
indexation), inflation was expected to remain in the neighborhood of 2½ percent as a result of
the continued restrained stance of monetary policy. Unemployment was jointly seen as
holding steady at around 3½ percent, with foreign workers (about 13 percent of the labor
force) acting as a buffer.

B. Fiscal Policy
10.
In May 2004, the authorities adopted an ambitious and detailed Convergence
Program (CP) aimed at redressing the fiscal slippage of recent years (Box 2 and Table 5).
The CP targeted a significant adjustment (to a deficit of 5.2 percent of GDP) in 2004 and an
even more substantial retrenchment (to 2.9 percent of GDP) in 2005, with further tightening
to take place in the out-years. Staff welcomed a number of politically difficult measures in the
program, including a significant increase in public sector retirement ages and a freeze on new
government positions. At the same time, the authorities were keenly aware that their fiscal
performance would be judged against the backdrop of recent failures to deliver fiscal
adjustment under successive Pre-Accession Economic Programs, and recognized that they
could not afford another episode of slippage.

Box 2. Convergence Program
According to the revised Convergence Program of December 2004, expenditure measures dominate
the first year while revenue measures are more prominent in 2005. Although the new CP is more
ambitious than the May version, it is less specific about the expected yield of measures in 2006 and
beyond. Policies that are expected to have an impact over the medium term include: the tax amnesty
and its expected widening of the tax base; regularization of the dividend policy for semi-government
organizations; and collecting fees for issuance of title deeds for buildings with minor irregularities.
The CP is characterized by a large number of, in many cases, relatively small measures. This may be
viewed as a form of “diversification,” ensuring the headline outcome is delivered in the event some
measures do not pass. However, there is also a risk in reliance on a large number of small measures—
both in terms of administrative complexity and because of the cumulative effect of even a little
optimism in the calculation of the yield from each one.

The authorities cited preliminary data for 2004 as evidence that the need for
fiscal prudence is taking hold. After 10 months, the central government posted a deficit of
about 3 percent of GDP, and the authorities were confident they would overperform relative
to the deficit target in the May CP (achieving a deficit for the year of about 4¾ percent of
GDP). As a result, in December they approved an update to the CP that is more ambitious
than the May program. Most of the budgetary improvement in 2004 stemmed from better
revenue performance—especially VAT and excises—though delayed public investment also
played a role.3 In each of the

since then. With the support of the president, he has continued to press for public sector wage
restraint, arguing that to do otherwise would undermine chances of adopting the euro. At the
same time, the trade unions, while professing only lukewarm support for early euro adoption,
complained to the mission that the CP had been approved without consultation, and that labor
was meant to shoulder a disproportionate share of the adjustment burden.
12.
Looking forward, staff found that the CP measures—if fully implemented—
should yield the authorities’ targeted improvement in public finances. The 2005 deficit,
in particular, would fall to about 3 percent of GDP, assuming all of the CP measures are
passed and scrupulously implemented. The authorities recognized the existence of downside
risks, including the fiscal impact of higher oil prices and a conceivable slowdown in tourism
in the event of further geopolitical tensions in the region.6 In this regard, they agreed to take
additional measures if the CP seems unlikely to yield the programmed adjustment profile. For
3

Preliminary data suggest that some of the CP measures are having a greater effect than originally
expected; the tax amnesty, for instance, had yielded £C60 million (0.8 percent of GDP) by early
December—well beyond the original projection.

4

For example, the figure above shows that the 2003 budget initially passed by parliament and signed
into law was amended twelve times during the year. In 2004, it was amended only three times.

5

Only one significant supplementary budget has passed in 2004. Consistent with the new deficit
target, a C£60 million appropriation for agricultural subsidies (among other things) was approved in
November.
6

The authorities estimate that sustained high oil prices could worsen public finances by about
0.2 percentage points of GDP relative to the baseline deficit path.

- 11 -

its part, the mission proposed: better targeting of social benefits; more aggressive collection of
tax arrears; widening the tax base to ensure full coverage of sectors currently subject to
preferential treatment (such as commercial businesses owned by the church or the
cooperatives); further broadening and revision of fees for government services; and if
necessary, a further increase in the VAT rate from the current EU-minimum of 15 percent
(relative to an EU-average standard rate of 19.4 percent). The authorities indicated that they
would be prepared to consider most of these measures. (For example, the December CP
proposes tighter eligibility criteria for social benefits.)
13.
Medium-term fiscal sustainability depends strongly on the implementation of the
convergence program. Under the CP, public debt is set to decline rapidly toward 60 percent
of GDP from 2005 onward (Annex I), while without the CP measures the authorities
recognize that the debt might quickly achieve unsustainable levels. Projected health and
pension outlays underscore the urgency of implementing the CP, which proposes significant
(but politically difficult) parametric reforms to both the public and general pension systems.7
14.
The authorities seem willing to consider a medium-term fiscal framework. They
recognize that the Cypriot budget system—including the practice of frequent revisions to
spending ceilings in the form of supplementary budgets—is outmoded, and they are likely to
request a fiscal ROSC during 2005.
C. Monetary Policy and the Financial Sector
15.
The authorities confirmed their intention to maintain a cautious stance of
monetary policy. Credit growth slowed in 2002–03 (falling to 5–6 percent per annum from
an average of over 13 percent during 1999–2001), and is expected to rebound slightly
in 2004–05. The authorities noted that inflationary pressures had crept up during the summer
on higher oil prices, and that ongoing uncertainty in this regard made it inappropriate to relax
policies at this time. Staff agreed with this approach, particularly in view of the authorities’
plans to participate in ERM2 in the course of 2005.
16.
The authorities have adopted a number of measures to bring financial sector
regulations in line with EU norms, and prudential regulation seems solid. Securities
market supervision has been strengthened following the stock market crash of 2000, as
disclosure rules and listing requirements were made more stringent. Similarly, the insurance
sector has witnessed some consolidation following introduction of new EU-compliant
legislation in January 2003.8 In the financial sector, minimum reserve requirements on foreign
currency deposits have been raised, while the need for provisioning has increased, as the
7

Without measures, health and pension spending could rise by 4–5 percent of GDP over the medium
term. (See IMF Country Report No. 03/31, Chapter II.)

Tougher supervision and higher minimum capital requirements have led some insurance companies
to close, while licenses have been withdrawn from four others over the last two years.

months in 2003, 6 months in 2004, and to 3 months in 2006). As a result, NPL ratios—
already high because of weak recovery rules—have risen modestly (Tables 6 and 7).9
Nevertheless, prudential oversight seems strong, and the ratings of key Cypriot banks remain
above investment grade.
17.
Staff viewed bifurcated supervision of the financial sector as source of
vulnerability. Despite holding a quarter of the financial system’s deposit base, the
cooperative and credit societies (CCSs) continue to fall outside the CBC’s supervisory remit
and they face a tax and regulatory regime that is very lenient compared with that of banks.
The CCSs specialize in mortgage lending and small retail loans—all of which are said to be
collateralized.10 Many of the CCSs are undercapitalized, though they are to be brought into
alignment with the relevant EU directives by the end of a 5-year transitional period. They are
supervised by a special institution (the Cooperative Societies Supervisory and Development
Authority) that must liaise with the CBC, but the locus of lender-of-last-resort responsibilities
remains unclear. The CBC—and private banks—concurred with staff that supervision of
financial institutions should be consolidated in one institution, though the cooperative sector
itself disagreed, arguing that coordination among supervisory bodies was already adequate.
18.
Other potential vulnerabilities for the financial sector include interactions with
the offshore sector and a run-up in real estate prices. Tax preferences for offshore
institutions were phased out on January 1, 2003,11 and the reputation of the sector has
improved since the 2001 OFC assessment.12 Staff expressed some concern about the fact that
real estate prices have strengthened (rising by about 7 percent in 2004) and related lending has
been robust.13 As of end-August 2004, 17 percent of outstanding credit pertained to the
construction sector and another 44 percent to the household sector, most of which is for
mortgages.14 Nevertheless, the mission welcomed the CBC’s issuance of a circular in
late 2003 tightening collateral requirements for real estate lending, as well as the fact that they
9

The authorities reported that recovery of a nonperforming asset takes about 10 years on average, as
against 6-9 months in many other EU members.

10

The availability of prudential data on the CCSs is limited, even to the authorities. Thus, there is no
reliable data on their NPL or recovery ratios, and a uniform provisioning policy is not possible at
present.

had sounded a similar note of caution in the statement following the September Monetary
Policy Committee meeting.
D. External Sector and the Euro Adoption Strategy
19.
The authorities reiterated their intention of adopting the euro as soon as possible,
including by joining ERM2 in the first part of 2005.15 While mindful of the concern that a
prolonged stay in ERM2 could pose risks, the authorities emphasized that Cyprus has long
employed an exchange regime similar to ERM2 (i.e., a formal ±15 percent corridor, but with
movements that for years have stayed within

there would also be a need for strengthened structural reform efforts (Section E).

20.
The authorities viewed the current
exchange rate parity as appropriate. They
acknowledged that there had been modest
competitiveness losses over the past two years,
and that Cyprus had lost some market share to
cheaper tourism destinations in the Mediterranean
(Figure 5).16 At the same time, they emphasized
that, viewed over a longer horizon, the real
effective exchange rate remains near its historic
equilibrium level. While exports of goods have
continued a secular decline over many years (and
now comprise less than a quarter of total exports),
exports of services—particularly nontourism (e.g.,

ERM2 procedures are well-advanced in European institutions, but it is unlikely that Cyprus will join
before the spring of 2005 (possibly with Latvia).

- 14 –
financial and legal) services—have held up well.17 While yielding ground on price to lowercost destinations such as Egypt and Tunisia, Cyprus remains relatively competitive regarding
various other aspects of tourism quality (Table 8). Staff noted that—although the 2002–03
decline in tourism arrivals was reversed in 2004 (rising by 3 percent year-on-year to endOctober)—tourism spending has been sluggish. In response, the authorities pointed to a
possible measurement problem with the data on spending, as there are also indications of very
robust spending by individuals holding foreign credit cards.
21.
Staff agreed that the parity appeared to be broadly in line with fundamentals,
given that the economy is near full employment and the reserve position remains strong.
Over the past decade, the real exchange rate has appreciated against the euro, but average real
growth rates in Cyprus have far outstripped those of the euro area, suggesting real
convergence effects have been significant.18 In this context, staff noted that the Cypriot
growth differential versus the euro zone had fallen in 2002–03, while inflation had exceeded
that of the euro area. However, staff agreed with the authorities that exchange rate passthrough effects would quickly erase any competitive gains from a change in the parity, and
that fiscal adjustment and deeper structural reforms were more appropriate ways to enhance
competitiveness.
22.
Medium-term external sustainability scenarios indicate that shocks of plausible
magnitudes would leave Cyprus in a relatively comfortable position. While staff sounded
a note of caution regarding the growing burden of external liabilities, the authorities noted that
for now Cyprus can clearly finance modest current account deficits, given its strong growth
record and EU membership (Annex I). At the same time, they recognized the need over the
medium term to reduce the external imbalance. They also pointed to a sovereign Eurobond
placement of €500 million during the summer—priced at 23 b.p. over the comparable German
bund benchmark—that was significantly oversubscribed.
23.
Cypriot trade policy has been gradually brought in line with EU requirements,
and the impact of adopting the EU common trade policy is likely to be limited. The
effects of removing tariffs on imports resulted in moderate revenue loss, while the application
of EU tariffs on imports originating from outside the EU had only a marginal impact on
revenues, given that average tariffs in Cyprus were already close to those applied in the EU.
However, the agricultural sector that has been previously protected by high tariffs will need to
adjust to the new environment governed by the Common Agricultural Policy. To ease this
adjustment, Cyprus was granted a transitional period to provide certain supplementary state
aid to farmers until 2010. The forthcoming elimination of Multi-Fiber Agreement quotas is
expected to have only a modest impact on Cypriot exports, as the share of textiles and

clothing in total exports has already declined considerably (from over 20 percent in 1998 to
less than 10 percent in 2003), with the remaining exports typically concentrated in certain
niche markets.
E. Structural Policies
24.
The need to be in compliance with the EU’s acquis communautaire has prompted
the authorities to undertake a number of important structural reforms. For example, air
transport was liberalized on May 1, 2004, while liberalization of the electricity sector was
advanced through the establishment in April 2004 of an independent Transmission System
Operator (to ensure nondiscriminatory access to the network). As a result, the number of
airlines flying to Greece and the UK has increased and airfares have fallen, while electricity
cross-subsidization (of households by industry) has been reduced. A few remaining price
controls (cement and petroleum products) were abolished in May 2004, while water
management is being enhanced through higher prices to encourage conservation and cost
recovery.
25.
The authorities were not prepared to push ahead with comprehensive public
enterprise reform. About 8 percent of GDP is produced in the public enterprise (PE) sector,
with the main PEs being the Electricity Authority, Cyprus Telecom, and Cyprus Airways, of
which only the latter is incorporated.19 The authorities reported that they were considering
options to restructure the airline, which now faces heightened competition from other
European carriers, including the possible privatization of one of its subsidiaries. However, the
authorities did not agree with staff on the need to modernize corporate governance of the PEs
through corporatization (much less privatization, which is firmly opposed by the trade
unions).
26.
The authorities considered that the present wage bargaining framework had
worked well and ensured harmonious labor relations. Consequently, they were not ready
to consider staff proposals to revise the automatic backward-looking wage indexation
(COLA) system. Staff noted that—with ERM2 and (potentially) euro adoption in the offing—
medium-term prospects for low inflation were excellent. As a result, the present juncture may
afford a window of opportunity to eliminate this structural rigidity (if only partially by
removing energy costs and changes in the VAT from the COLA calculations).20 While
unpersuaded by these arguments, the authorities were cognizant of the tendency of real wage
growth to outstrip gains in productivity, and generally agreed with staff advice to limit
increases beyond the COLA. However, politically-powerful social partners—including in
particular the left-of-center trade union PEO (aligned with ruling coalition member AKEL)—

As of end-2003, the government had guaranteed about 3½ percent of GDP in PE debt, mostly for the
electricity authority (out of total government guaranteed debt of about 10 percent of GDP).

20

- 16 -

saw neither the need for increased labor market flexibility nor even for real wage growth to
match productivity gains.
27.
A key labor market issue is the impact of opening the “green” line separating
northern and southern Cyprus. At present, estimates of the number of Turkish Cypriots
traveling to work in the south daily through the three crossing points range from 2,300-10,000
(with the correct figure probably in the middle). But proposals to expand the number of
crossing points substantially raise the prospect that T/C workers could eventually compete
with their G/C counterparts in significant numbers. The authorities felt that further expansion
of T/C employment in the government-controlled areas would be possible without
dislocations, given very low levels of unemployment and the possibility of scaling back the
present guest-worker program.
IV. ISSUES RELATED TO THE REUNIFICATION OF CYPRUS
28.
There continues to be international interest in finding a solution to the thirtyyear old “Cyprus problem.” Since the partition of the island in 1974, IMF Article IV
consultations have been conducted with the government of the Republic of Cyprus, the
recognized government of the member. They have thus not covered the areas in the north not
under government control (NGC).21 However, in early 2004, under UN auspices, IMF staff
participated in background work for the negotiations leading to the “Annan Plan” (see Box 3),
providing technical advice on a macroeconomic framework for the unified country, as well as
on fiscal management and banking system reform. In this, staff collaborated with officials of
the UN, other IFIs, bilaterals, and the G/C and T/C sides, visiting both parts of Cyprus. After
rejection of the “Annan Plan” by Greek Cypriot voters in the referendum of April 2004, the
international community has sought to reduce the isolation of Turkish Cypriots, including
through provision of aid and technical assistance. The EU is in the process of approving an
aid package of €259 million for 2005–07 that would emphasize infrastructure and technical
assistance in support of compliance with the acquis, while the United States has appropriated
$31 million for energy, banking sector reform, and small and medium-size enterprise
development. Absorption is an issue, however, as these two aid packages sum to about 1/4 of
estimated 2003 GNP in the NGC areas.
29.
During the UN negotiations, it became clear that the paucity of authoritative
macroeconomic data on the NGC areas has complicated prospects for reunification.
During the mission staff was unable to collect data and hold discussions on the economy of
the north. The authorities were concerned that such contacts might be seen as a first step
toward a separate consultation, and might be construed as a form of recognition of the NGC
areas. The issue of staff conducting analytical macroeconomic work on the economy of the
NGC areas was also raised in the context of discussions on possible provision of IMF TA to
the T/C community (Box 4).
21

On this occasion, summary information on the economy of the NGC areas, based on publicly
available sources, is included in Annex II.

- 17 -

Box 3. The “Annan Plan” to Reunify Cyprus
Cyprus has been divided since 1974, with Greek Cypriots (G/C) in the south and Turkish
Cypriots (T/C) in the north, separated by a ½ mile-wide buffer zone. Over a number of years,
the UN has sponsored a series of reunification talks under the good offices of the Secretary
General, leading to the opening of border crossings in 2003 and partial agreement on aspects of
a settlement—the Annan Plan—that envisaged a “bicommunal, bizonal federation” entitled the
United Cyprus Republic (UCR). The UCR would be comprised of two constituent states with a
federal structure.
Motivated by a desire to see a united Cyprus join the EU on May 1, all parties agreed in
February 2004 to a timetable envisaging completion of the talks by end-March. In the event, a
comprehensive solution was not achieved, but the February agreement included a provision
according to which the Secretary-General would fill in the missing elements of the
“Foundation Agreement,” which would then be put to simultaneous referenda on April 24.*
The proposed agreement attempted to address harmonization of policies and institutions with
the EU, restitution of property and population relocation, and security concerns on both sides.
A new central bank was to be created and a budget systems law enacted. Under the plan, up
to 20 percent of the G/C population would have the right—over 18 years—to return to their
pre-1974 communities in the north, and a number of people now living in the NGC areas
would need to be compensated for the loss of their homes.
During the Article IV mission, the authorities explained that they did not view the Annan Plan
as economically and financially viable and pointed to a number of institutional arrangements
proposed under the plan that they viewed as being detrimental to macroeconomic stability,
including:
• Insufficient fiscal capacity of the federal government, which might be called upon to
guarantee the debt of the two constituent states (despite the absence of an internal “stability
pact” to limit the size of budget deficits);
• Ambiguity regarding the framework for monetary policy—including political appointees to
the monetary policy committee, the role of the T/C branch of the new central bank, and
whether or not the Cypriot pound would be replaced by a new currency; and
• Large uncertainty about the need for fiscal transfers to the north—including the possible
need to recapitalize T/C banks—as well as uncertain prospects for international donors to help
finance the process.**
While recognizing the existence of some risks, the staff’s view—as set out in a statement to a
donors’ meeting prior to the referendum—was that, with firm implementation and goodwill on
both sides, the plan was economically and financially viable.

The authorities estimate the cost of rebuilding infrastructure in the north at £C5 billion (69 percent
of 2004 GDP in the G/C areas).

Box 4. Prospects for IMF TA to the T/C Community
Following rejection of the Annan Plan in April, representatives of the T/C community inquired about
the possibility of IMF technical assistance (TA) in the Fund’s areas of competence. They were
informed that—consistent with the Articles of Agreement—staff could only do so with the consent of
the government of the Republic of Cyprus, the recognized government of the member.
Prior to and during the mission, staff sought this approval, positing that IMF TA to the T/C
community would be in the best interest of all Cypriots, and aiming to reach an understanding that
would reassure the G/C side on the sovereignty question while also being sensitive to T/C concerns
about confidentiality of data provided to TA missions. The G/C authorities agreed with staff on the
need to improve economic management in the NGC areas, and discussions with them are continuing
on a framework under which IMF TA could be brought to bear on these problems.

V. STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
Joining the EU in May 2004 was a signal event for the Cypriot economy.
Adaptation to European Union institutions and harmonization with the acquis communautaire
have brought forward many welcome—and in some cases long-overdue—reforms. For
example, the capital account has been liberalized in line with EU directives, while financial
sector legislation has been strengthened. Though these changes have posed significant
challenges for the authorities and for the private sector, they have also laid a foundation for
enhanced economic growth in Cyprus.
31.
After a period of relatively weak growth, the Cypriot economy began to rebound
in 2004. While sluggish European growth and geopolitical concerns in the Middle East
contributed to subdued growth in 2002–03, particularly in the tourism sector, tourist arrivals
and output growth recovered gradually in 2004. Unemployment remains low, and, despite
some recent pressures stemming from oil prices, inflation is subdued.
32.
Fiscal consolidation needs to be the first order of business, in light of slippages in
recent years and the authorities’ ERM2 ambitions. Striving to contain the deficit and
reduce public debt is clearly important to the euro adoption strategy. But more fundamentally,
the economic situation of Cyprus would call for fiscal retrenchment quite apart from the
requirements for euro adoption. Demographic pressures over the medium term, in particular
as regards projected pension and health care costs, underscore the importance of bringing
down the debt ratio. Previous efforts to contain the fiscal deficit have been disappointing, and
by overperforming on their deficit objective for 2004, the authorities have shown the needed
determination to establish policy credibility, which will now need to be maintained.
33.
If assiduously implemented, the consolidation strategy laid out in the authorities’
Convergence Program would put Cyprus back on the road to fiscal sustainability.
Several of the CP measures are politically difficult but extremely important—such as the
significant increase in public sector retirement ages, moderation in public sector wage growth,
and the freeze on new government positions. These steps will help limit the deficit and are
needed to

- 19 -

pave the way for euro adoption. In light of the disappointing performance of previous
adjustment efforts, follow-up on the authorities’ stated readiness to take further measures if
needed to achieve their fiscal adjustment targets will be essential.
34.
Over the medium term, credibility and policy formulation would be buttressed
by establishing an explicit multi-year fiscal framework. Such a framework—based on
realistic economic assumptions, clear fiscal objectives, and specific measures to achieve
them—would provide the basis for choosing among competing spending priorities in a
transparent and efficient manner. The authorities’ interest in a fiscal ROSC, undertaken by
most other new EU members, is welcome.
35.
Cyprus appears well-placed to join ERM2 at an early stage, subject to the
condition that the fiscal adjustment effort is resolutely maintained. The long-standing use
of an exchange regime similar to ERM2 provides the advantage of continuity, while the
current parity seems broadly in line with fundamentals, given continued near-full employment
and the strong reserve position. Nonetheless, aggressive pursuit of structural reforms—
particularly in the labor market—is needed to enhance competitiveness.
36.
Although financial sector regulation is generally strong, supervision of the
cooperative sector should be strengthened. Supervision of the cooperative credit and saving
institutions should be brought under the same roof as that of the banks, and their capital base
should be strengthened; in general, consolidation in the sector should be encouraged. Bringing
loan classification definitions in line with European best practices is welcome, but the legal
framework must be revised to ensure more timely recovery of collateral on bad loans. The
authorities are encouraged to undertake an early FSAP in order to advance these reforms.
37.
Despite making major strides to meet the requirements of the acquis, Cyprus
faces a challenging structural reform agenda. In particular, more remains to be done to
foster competition and promote efficiency, including in the public enterprise sector. The
electricity authority and the telecommunications company should be corporatized at an early
stage, and—over time—the authorities should consider their privatization.
38.
With near full employment conditions, labor markets have performed well, but
there is still scope for policies to improve their performance. In particular, the centralized
wage bargaining system is in need of reform. As currently constituted, the COLA system—
especially when coupled with seniority-based rules governing salary increases in the public
sector—builds in a structural upward drift in the real wage bill, thereby leading to a loss of
competitiveness on external markets. Moreover, this system affords employers little scope for
providing performance-related compensation increases. As a first step, the COLA system
could be redesigned to exclude changes in the VAT and energy prices.
39.
IMF activities, including technical assistance, could support reunification and
contribute to improving the living standards of all Cypriots. The authorities’ consent to
provide technical assistance to the T/C community in the Fund’s areas of specialization (and
also to carry out macroeconomic analytical work) could help establish a baseline for
advancing all of Cyprus toward best practices in a number of areas.

- 20 -

40.
While Cypriot statistics are generally of good quality (with the exception of the
NGC areas), improvements are possible in a few areas regarding the timeliness,
consistency and definitions used by the authorities. Moving promptly toward subscription
to the SDDS could facilitate improvements in this area.
41.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the current 24-month
cycle.

1/ Data for domestically-controlled and foreign-controlled banks on a cross-border and cross-sector consolidation
basis; does not include credit cooperative sector or international banking units. The compiled FSIs are consistent with
the definitions and specifications provided in the IMF's "Compilation Guide on Financial Soundness Indicators",
2/ Data for 2004 as of end-June.
3/ In 2004, deposit takers were required to suspend interest on all loans which were in arrears for more than 6 months
and were not 100 percent secured (in 2003 the threshold was 9 months and prior to this 12 months). These loans are
classified as "Non-Performing Loans." As from 2006, the CBC will reduce the time period beyond which interest will
be suspended to 3 months. Furthermore, the CBC has given advance warning to deposit-takers that, in order to fully
harmonize the existing regulations with the provisions of the the European Union Capital Requirements Directive, the
relevant regulations will be amended so that the existence of adequate security will not be taken into account.

ANNEX I

MEDIUM-TERM SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. Fiscal Sustainability
1.
Assuming implementation of the CP, the staff’s baseline scenario predicts a decline in
the public debt-to-GDP ratio from 72 percent in 2004 to 61 percent in 2009, suggesting that
risks to medium-term debt sustainability would be addressed by the CP (Annex I Table 1).
When the historical average values of the real interest rate, real GDP growth, and primary
balance are used throughout the projection period (scenario A1), the debt ratio falls only to
66 percent by 2009. Keeping the primary balance unchanged over the projection period (A2)
raises the debt ratio to 71 percent by 2009. The most significant “bounds test” is the shock to
real GDP growth (B2), while the shocks to the real interest rates and to the primary balance
lead to a somewhat smaller deterioration in the debt dynamics. A one-time 30 percent real
depreciation in 2006 (B5) increases the debt ratio the most, raising it to 80 percent in 2009.
B. External Sustainability
2.
Under the baseline scenario the external debt-to-GDP ratio falls from 57 percent to
51 percent by 2009, achieved mainly through automatic debt dynamics reflecting robust GDP
growth and a residual that includes the effect of the slight appreciation of the Cyprus pound
against the U.S. dollar over the projection period. Overall, sustainability does not appear to be
at serious risk under shocks of plausible magnitudes (Annex I Tables 2 and 3). Under scenario
A1 (interest rate, GDP growth, U.S. dollar deflator, non-interest current account, and non-debt
creating flows as percentage of GDP are at historical averages), the debt-to-GDP ratio falls to
50 percent by 2009. The external position is not seriously affected by shocks to interest and
GDP growth rates (tests B1 and B2). However, the shock to the U.S. dollar GDP deflator (B3)
increases the debt by about 29 percentage points. A one-time 30 percent depreciation (bound
test B6) also has a significant impact on the debt ratio in 2005, but the ratio gradually declines
as the impact of the shock fades.

ANNEX II

ECONOMY OF THE AREAS NOT UNDER GOVERNMENT CONTROL (NGC)22
1.
The NGC areas comprise 1/3 of the land area of Cyprus and about 22 percent of the
population of the island, a large fraction of which the G/C authorities do not consider to be
legal inhabitants of Cyprus. The NGC areas produce less than 10 percent of the combined
GDP of Cyprus, with output concentrated in the public sector, tourism, agriculture, and
commerce (Annex II Table). During the 1980s, growth averaged about 5 percent p.a., with
some slowing in the 1990s. Volatility in Turkey led to a sharp contraction in 2000–01,
followed by fairly robust growth in 2002-03. Most external trade—including for tourism—
takes place with Turkey, which is the only country to recognize the NGC areas as a separate
state. (Tourism arrivals typically number over 400,000 per year, of which three fourths come
from Turkey.)

2.
Public finances in the NGC areas are heavily dependent on transfers and loans from
Turkey. Indeed, expenditures of just under half of GDP—1/3 of which go to civil service
wages—are covered in roughly equal measure by domestic revenue and foreign grants and
loans.
3.
The Turkish lira circulates in the NGC areas, meaning that the most important
monetary task consists of supervision of the financial sector, including offshore institutions.
The economic slowdown after 1999 led to some financial sector consolidation, but there
remains a need for significant banking sector restructuring.

Cyprus joined the EU on May 1, 2004, but with a derogation allowing non-application
of the acquis in the NGC areas.

APPENDIX II

CYPRUS: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Cyprus has an open publication policy and its statistical data are generally of a high quality and
adequate frequency. However, weaknesses remain with respect to the requirements of the
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) such as for the international investment position,
and some data series are only available with long time lags. The authorities intend to subscribe
to the SDDS in the near future.
National accounts time series (1995–2003) are available online. Quarterly GDP growth rates
are published with a delay of one quarter; annual national accounts are published with a delay
of up to half a year. Monthly indicators of economic activity exist, notably on trade flows,
tourism arrivals, and industrial production, but with a lag of several months for most
indicators. Since January 1999, the CPI is compiled following the EU methodology for the
Harmonized CPI. The national accounts data were recently revised to comply with the 1995
European System of Accounts.
Balance of payments accounts are presented in the format specified by EuroStat in Balance
of Payments Vade Mecum, which is based on the IMF Balance of Payments Manual, fifth
edition (BPM5). From 1995 onwards, the BOP statistics have been compiled using the BPM5
definition of residency. Trade statistics are available on a monthly basis with a lag of about
three months; current account statistics are available on a quarterly basis, with a lag of about
four months. Direct investment statistics are available on an annual basis. While the data are
generally of good quality, some concerns remain regarding coverage and classification
(especially on sectoral breakdown of portfolio investment) as well as timeliness and
transparency of revisions.
Fiscal data for the central government are of good quality and coverage. Monthly fiscal
central government data are generally of high quality but are not published on a timely basis.
General government accounts exist from 1998 and are published on the internet on an annual
and quarterly basis, although with a lag of a few months. Cyprus last reported data for
publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook in 1998. No data are currently
reported for publication in International Financial Statistics.
Financial sector data are timely and are disseminated efficiently. Electronic tables with
monetary authority and commercial bank balance sheets, together with interest rate and other
relevant information, are available with a lag of about one month.
Publication is generally open. A large amount of information is available through the
internet, including press statements as well as data files from the Statistical Service, the
Ministry of Finance, and the Central Bank of Cyprus.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
February 18, 2005
1.
This statement provides an update on economic and policy developments since the
staff report was issued. The new information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Recent data for 2004 suggest that real GDP grew by 3.5 percent, in line with
projections, while average CPI inflation was 2.3 percent, slightly lower than projected. At the
same time, performance of the tourism sector was slightly weaker than expected, suggesting
the projected 2004 current account imbalance will widen modestly.
3.
The 2004 general government deficit is now estimated by the authorities to have been
reduced to about 4.3 percent of GDP, well below the 4.8 percent target presented in the
revised Convergence Program. This better-than-expected performance stems both from
expenditure constraint (lower-than-budgeted defense and capital expenditures) and improved
revenue performance, including the tax amnesty. Based on the revised Convergence Program
and the 2005 budget, the Ecofin Council concluded on January 18, 2005, that Cyprus has
taken effective action to correct and contain its fiscal imbalances, and that no further steps
are necessary at this point under the excessive deficit procedure.
4.
Looking ahead, the 2004 preliminary fiscal outturn and the ongoing implementation
of the measures outlined in the Convergence Program bode well for achieving the 2005
general government deficit target of no more than 3 percent of GDP. According to the
authorities, even conservative estimates suggest that the tax amnesty will yield more than 1
percent of GDP compared with a previous estimate of 0.6 percent. Furthermore, agreement
has been reached on the regularization of the dividend policy of public enterprises, which
should result in another 0.6 percent of GDP. Also, preliminary agreements have been reached
with the relevant trade unions on the increase of the retirement age for employees in the
public sector. Lastly, although the authorities feel there is a safety margin to ensure
compliance with the deficit target of 3 percent of GDP, they have reiterated their readiness to
take additional steps should the remaining measures outlined in the Convergence Program
yield less than expected.
5.
The authorities have formally requested a fiscal ROSC assessment, the timing for
which is being discussed at present.
6.
Discussions are ongoing between staff and the authorities on a framework under
which the Fund could provide technical assistance in its areas of competence to the Turkish
community in northern Cyprus.

Statement by Jeroen J.M. Kremers, Executive Director for Cyprus
and Lucian Croitoru, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
February 18, 2005
The broad picture
The Cypriot authorities appreciate the staff report, which accurately assesses the
country’s performance and provides a realistic view of the policy challenges. The
authorities agree that the key macroeconomic challenges are a credible fiscal consolidation
and the strategy for adopting the euro. The authorities also broadly agree with staff
recommendations.
Macroeconomic developments are encouraging, supported by sound
macroeconomic policies. Growth has begun to rebound following two years of relatively
weak performance, recovering to about 3½ percent in 2004, and the authorities expect a
growth of 4 percent in 2005. Consumption was the main engine of growth, fed by fiscal
easing in 2003 and a possible confidence effect from the EU accession. Reforms that will be
brought forward in the process of adaptation to EU institutions and regulations are expected
to set the stage for enhanced economic growth. Tourism has picked up, unemployment
remains very low even by European standards, and the current account deficit has not
exceeded 4½ percent of GDP for several years. A moderate increase in the current account
deficit is expected for 2004, in part due to one-off items, such as the higher than expected
increase in the imports of cars due to the significant reduction of excise duties in November
2003. Inflation has crept upward on rising energy prices, but is expected to remain in the
vicinity of 2½ percent as a result of the continued restrained stance of monetary policy. The
central bank has left the interest rates high since April, when it raised them in response to
modest outflows in the weeks preceding the EU accession, outflows that are now reversed.
As a start of fiscal consolidation that the authorities are committed to implement over the
medium term, the 2004 budget deficit was brought to 4.3 percent of GDP, well below the 4.8
percent target, and down from 6.3 percent of GDP in 2003. It is budgeted to be below the
Maastricht threshold of 3 percent of GDP as of 2005. The increase of debt-to-GDP ratio
beyond the Maastricht threshold was led mainly by technical reasons rather than above the
line deficit-inducing transactions, and a downward trend is foreseen as of 2005.
Looking forward, the authorities remain committed to implementation of the
adjustments needed for an early accession in the monetary union. Although it was not
among the group that joined ERM2 in June 2004, Cyprus intends to be one of the first new
members to adopt the euro. The authorities acknowledge that delivering a strong fiscal
adjustment is a prerequisite for joining ERM2 in the first part of 2005 and for an early euro
adoption. In addition, to support competitiveness and have a strong performance in the
monetary union, the authorities will strengthen structural reforms.
Fiscal policy
Acknowledging that medium-term fiscal sustainability depends on further fiscal
consolidation, the authorities adopted an ambitious Convergence Program (CP) in May
2004. The main features of the CP consist of targeting a significant adjustment (from a deficit

-2estimated at that time at 5.2 percent of GDP in 2004 to 2.9 percent of GDP in 2005 and 0.9
percent of GDP in 2008), and implementing a number of politically difficult measures,
including parametric reforms to both the public and general pension systems (there already
are preliminary agreements with the relevant trade unions on the increase of the retirement
age for employees in the public sector). Under the CP, public debt is expected to decline
rapidly to 60 percent of GDP by 2009.
The authorities have begun restoring credibility in implementing fiscal
adjustment after the fiscal slippages of the past. Their fiscal prudence was reflected in a
lower than envisaged deficit for the first 10 months of 2004, and in December the authorities
approved an update to the CP that is more ambitious than the May program. As noted above,
they overperformed relative to the revised program by 0.5 percent of GDP. Based on the
revised CP and on the 2005 budget, the Ecofin Council concluded on January that Cyprus has
taken effective action to correct its fiscal imbalances, and no other steps are necessary under
the excessive deficit procedures. Even more, recognizing the existence of downside risks to
growth and their potential fiscal impact, the authorities are ready to consider additional
measures if the CP may fall short to deliver the envisaged fiscal adjustment, and indicated
that they would be prepared to consider most of the measures proposed by staff.
To consolidate policy credibility over the medium term, the authorities are
willing to consider a medium-term fiscal framework. As a preparatory step, they have
already limited the practice of approving many supplementary budgets to revise upward the
spending ceilings during the year, and requested a fiscal ROSC for 2005.
Monetary policy
The Central Bank of Cyprus (CBC) will continue to maintain a cautious stance
of monetary policy. There are a few reasons that would, at this stage, make a relaxation
inappropriate. First, a vigilant monetary policy serves better the authorities’ plans to
participate in ERM2 as early as possible in the course of 2005. Secondly, although credit
growth slowed from 8 percent in 2002 to 5 percent in 2003, as compared to an annual
average of 13 percent during 1999-2001, it rebounded to 6.5 percent in 2004 and is expected
to continue increasing slightly in 2005. Thirdly, inflationary pressures have crept up fueled
by higher oil prices, and uncertainty regarding oil prices still persists. The authorities’ policy
is to keep the monetary stance consistent with other policies. Some monetary policy easing
might become possible as the implementation of the fiscal consolidation program progresses
and changes in oil prices will have tamed.
The financial sector is sound, with banks being rated beyond the investing grade.
Enhanced disclosure rules and listing requirements have been introduced to strengthen the
securities market in the wake of the stock market crash of 2000. Progress has been made in
strengthening the insurance sector by bringing specific legislation in line with EU
requirements in 2003. The same year, capital adequacy requirements and minimum reserve
requirements on foreign currency have been raised. The CBC also issued a circular in late
2003 to tighten collateral requirements for real estate lending. Moreover, to have a more
realistic view on the magnitude of nonperforming loans (NPL), the authorities have gradually
reduced the time threshold for declaring an overdue loan to be nonperforming from 12
percent in 2003 to 3 percent in 2005. This, together with still weak recovery rules kept NPL

-3ratios high, but prudential oversight continues to be strong. Although the CBC and private
banks agreed that supervision of financial institutions should be consolidated in one
institution, the cooperative and credit societies, which hold a quarter of the financial system’s
deposit base, disagree. The offshore sector’s reputation has improved, as ensured by staff,
and the authorities plan to request a FSAP after MFD will have updated its 2001 OFC
assessment in early 2005.
ERM2 and Cyprus’s competitiveness
Cyprus’s long employed exchange rate regime mirroring ERM2 provides a good
basis for joining ERM2 in the first part of 2005 and for adopting the euro as soon as
possible. The exchange rate movements have stayed for years within a de facto narrow band
around the central parity, which means that ERM2 is, effectively, already there. By setting a
near-term target for ERM2, the authorities aim at benefiting from the existing favorable
political economy setting for reforms, and also at giving strong support for politically
difficult fiscal measures already envisaged in the CP.
The authorities view the actual exchange rate parity as appropriate and it should
not be changed for competitiveness purposes. As rightly stressed by staff, the convergence
effect has explained most of the pound appreciation over the last decade. It is also worth
mentioning that real appreciation has taken place in part due to the rise of inflation owing to
the increase in the VAT rate by 5 percent since 2002 an in the rise of other EU
harmonization-induced excise taxes. Even with a lower growth differential and a higher
inflation differential versus the euro zone in 2002-03, other competitiveness indicators do not
suggest that the exchange rate is out of line with fundamentals. Moreover, as stressed by the
authorities and agreed by staff, given the openness of the Cypriot economy, any gain in
competitiveness from a change in the pound’s parity would be eroded by the pass-through
effect. The authorities will protect competitiveness by implementing the envisaged fiscal
adjustments and the needed measures in area of structural reforms.
Structural reforms
Although privatization of the remaining public enterprises was not on the
agenda, structural reforms have progressed. The authorities were focused on complying
with the EU’s acquis communautair, and services and utilities markets have opened up.
Looking forward, in view of heightened competition from other carriers, the authorities are
considering options to restructure the airline, including by disposing one of its subsidiaries.
While the authorities do not see the immediate need to modernize corporate governance of
public enterprises through corporatization, fostering competition and promoting efficiency
remain among their objectives in area of public enterprise reform.
The authorities consider that the automatic backward-looking wage indexation
(COLA) system had worked well, but acknowledge the tendency of real wage growth to
outstrip productivity gains, and will limit increases beyond the COLA in the public
sector. The authorities also note that the staff assesses the COLA system as a structural
rigidity, but they believe that the system has benefits in terms of harmonious labor relations
and is not a source of inflationary pressures.

-4The reunification of Cyprus
The Cyprus authorities do not share the assessment of the staff conveyed in the
last sentence of Box 3 (page 17) of the draft report that the Annan Plan was
economically and financially viable. They point out that the assessment of the viability of
the Annan Plan was not a task of the staff during the 2004 Article IV Consultation with
Cyprus and therefore the assessment was not discussed with the Cypriot authorities.
Accordingly, the staff views do not represent a recent assessment of the viability of the
Annan Plan.
The staff has been informed of the Cyprus authorities’ areas of concern
regarding the Annan Plan and detailed papers on this subject have been sent to the
staff. Looking forward, the authorities are committed to continued cooperation in finding a
solution towards an acceptable and viable reunification plan.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 22, 2005

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with
Cyprus
On February 18, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Cyprus.1
Background
The Cypriot economy has seen substantial changes since the last IMF Article IV
consultation in 2002. Chief among these is accession to the European Union, the full
impact of which is only gradually making itself felt. In a sense, Cyprus ceased to be an
island on May 1, 2004. While these changes pose significant challenges for the
authorities and for the private sector, they also offer substantial opportunities to enhance
economic growth in Cyprus.
Economic growth has begun to rebound following a more modest performance
in 2002-03, recovering in real terms to about 3½ percent in 2004 mainly driven by an
increase in domestic demand. Real per capita income has continued to rise,
now reaching above 80 percent of the average EU 25 income level when adjusted for
purchasing power, unemployment remains low by European standards, and inflation has
been kept at bay, although rising energy prices have exercised some upward pressures
in 2004. Looking ahead, growth is estimated at close to 4 percent in 2005 reflecting an
improved external environment. Over the medium term, growth prospects are subject to
a significant degree of uncertainty given oil price volatility and a lack of clarity on
reunification, as well as the ultimate impact of EU accession.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

-2Following a significant fiscal slippage in 2003, with the general government deficit rising to
6.3 percent of GDP amid expenditure overruns, the authorities have recently adopted an
ambitious and detailed Convergence Program aimed at consolidating the fiscal accounts
and bringing the deficit and debt levels down to levels compatible with the Maastricht
criteria. The authorities have also stated their readiness to take additional measures in case
the program does not yield the expected impact. The general government deficit is now
targeted at 4.8 percent of GDP in 2004 and at 2.9 percent in 2005; meanwhile, public debt
is expected to peak at 72 percent of GDP in 2004 before starting to decline, reaching close
to 60 percent of GDP by 2009.
Substantial progress with structural reforms has been achieved in a number of areas,
mainly in response to efforts to conform with the acquis communautaire. In particular,
indirect taxation has been aligned more closely with EU standards, direct taxes have been
lowered, the capital account has been liberalized, and financial sector legislation has been
strengthened in line with EU directives.
The fiscal consolidation envisaged in the Convergence Program will enable the authorities
to achieve their strategy of adopting the euro as soon as possible, including by joining the
ERMII in the first half of 2005. The current parity is deemed appropriate. Further fiscal
consolidation and deeper structural reforms, in particular labor market reforms, would be
appropriate ways to prevent further erosion of competitiveness.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed the Cypriot authorities’ long record of good policy performance, which
has led to low inflation, near full employment and, in 2004, a rebound in growth.
They observed that accession to the EU has prompted many important structural reforms,
helping to lay the foundation for sustained economic growth into the future. Directors noted
the authorities’ plans to join the ERMII in 2005 and adopt the euro thereafter, and cautioned
that this will require determined and sustained fiscal adjustment and structural reform.
In this regard, they welcomed the authorities’ ambitious and updated Convergence Program
and urged its full implementation. They commended the authorities’ efforts to build national
support for the Program.
Directors noted the significant fiscal slippage in 2002-03, and stressed that fiscal adjustment
is now the key economic priority for Cyprus. They welcomed the appreciable progress made
in this regard during 2004, and considered the 2005 overall deficit target of 3 percent of
GDP to be achievable with continued scrupulous implementation of the Convergence
Program measures. Directors welcomed the better-than-expected revenue yield of some
measures, but stressed that key expenditure containment measures—including raising the
retirement age in the public sector and limiting public sector wage increases—remain
necessary. They also encouraged the authorities to follow up, if needed, on their stated
readiness to take further measures to ensure the fiscal targets are achieved.
Directors noted that mounting demographic pressures reinforce the need for fiscal restraint
and a reduction of the public debt over the medium term. In that light, Directors welcomed
plans to target primary fiscal surpluses beginning in 2005, in part through caps on current
and capital spending. Of particular importance will be reforms to the health care and
pensions systems and the freeze on new government positions. Directors urged the

-3authorities to adopt an explicit medium-term fiscal framework, which would bolster policy
formulation and credibility. Such a framework should also eliminate the need for
supplementary budgets during the year. In this context, they welcomed the authorities’
recent request for a fiscal Reports on the Observance of Standards and Codes assessment.
Directors supported the central bank’s cautious monetary policy stance, stressing the need
for vigilance in the face of possible inflationary pressures in the run-up to euro adoption.
They agreed that the current exchange rate parity remains appropriate. However, a number
of Directors urged reform of the wage-setting mechanism. While acknowledging that
automatic, backward-looking wage indexation has contributed to harmonious labour
relations in Cyprus, these Directors also noted that it has increased the pass-through of
inflationary shocks, limited the ability of employers to provide performance-based merit pay
increases, and reduced external competitiveness.
Directors stressed the importance of a strong structural reform effort to enhance
competitiveness. They welcomed the reforms in electricity distribution, air transport and
water management, and encouraged the authorities to modernize corporate governance in
the public enterprises and consider eventual privatization of these enterprises where
appropriate.
Directors welcomed the strengthening of financial sector regulations in recent years with a
view to aligning them to EU norms. At the same time, they called for vigilance over the
financial system’s growing exposure to the real estate market and its interaction with the
offshore sector. Directors also stressed the importance of effective supervision of the
cooperative sector, and encouraged consolidation of their supervision under one institution.
Directors looked forward to the Offshore Financial Center assessment update later this
year, and encouraged the authorities to seek an evaluation under the IMF’s Financial Sector
Assessment Program.
Directors hoped that an agreement could be reached that would allow Fund staff to provide
technical assistance, in the IMF’s areas of expertise, to the Turkish Cypriot community in
northern Cyprus.
Cyprus’s macroeconomic statistics remain adequate for IMF surveillance purposes,
but Directors noted that further improvements would be facilitated by the process of
subscription to the Special Data Dissemination Standard.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
