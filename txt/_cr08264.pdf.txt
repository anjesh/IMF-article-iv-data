EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Ethiopia’s pro-growth development policies have helped sustain average growth of 11
percent since 2003/04, consistent with the goal of reducing poverty. In recent years,
however, it has become clear that demand is running ahead of the expansion in the
capacity of the economy. Inflation increased to almost 40 percent on a 12-month basis
in May 2008. International reserves have fallen to about 1.5 months of imports.

•

Inflation is being led by rapidly rising food prices. Rising global prices are playing a
role. However, because the amount of non-aid food imports is relatively small, the
mechanism is not clear and other domestic factors also lie behind Ethiopia’s inflation.

•

The surge in world oil prices is placing further strain on Ethiopia’s balance of
payments. On a full-year basis, the rise in oil prices will increase the imported oil bill
by about US$1 billion (3 percent of GDP).

•

The authorities are aiming to address the macroeconomic imbalances as well as to
absorb the severe world oil price shock, in a manner that will least affect the
momentum for growth and poverty reduction. They plan to reduce broad money
growth to under 20 percent and support lower monetary growth by implementing a
cautious fiscal policy that keeps domestic borrowing well within the budget ceiling.

•

Staff urges forceful measures to prevent inflation expectations from becoming
ingrained and to strengthen the balance of payments. It supports the proposed
tightening of monetary policy and recommends a halving of public sector borrowing
to 2-3 percent of GDP in 2008/09, including through closer control over the activities
of public enterprises. Overall public sector borrowing has risen to about 5 percent of
GDP in the last two years, in part because of high expenditure by public enterprises.
Further tightening measures will be required if inflation does not begin to turn down.

•

Policies to facilitate necessary adjustment to the oil price shock and to lower inflation
are likely to reduce economic growth, at least in the short term. Additional donor
financial support would help lessen the adverse impact on poverty reduction.

•

The real exchange rate has appreciated significantly in recent years. Thus, although
exports have been growing strongly, competitiveness will need to be kept under
review and more nominal exchange rate flexibility considered.

•

Financial sector development will be important to maintain strong economic growth.
Measures to promote competition in the banking sector will need to be explored. The
soundness of the banking system will require careful monitoring as any slowdown in
the economy could expose credit quality problems.

4
I. BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
The Ethiopian economy has grown rapidly in the last four years, despite
continuing regional political tensions.1 Favorable weather conditions and pro-growth
development policies—with an emphasis on public investment, commercialization of
agriculture, and nonfarm private sector developments—have helped sustain recovery from
the sharp drought-related contraction in 2002/03 (Table 1).2 Growth has averaged 11 percent
since 2003/04, far exceeding the minimum growth target of 7 percent in the Program for
Accelerated and Sustainable Development (PASDEP), that is estimated to be consistent with
keeping the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) within reach.3
2.
Over this period, Ethiopia has continued its transition to a market economy,
although some sectors have yet to be fully liberalized.4 Public enterprises still play a major
role in many areas, including the financial, energy, and communication sectors. Market
pricing is not fully functioning in the financial sector where interest rates are not responsive
to changes in demand and supply conditions.
3.
In recent years, it has become clear that demand is running ahead of efforts to
expand the capacity of the economy through public investment in physical and social
infrastructure investment and through private entrepreneurship. Inflation rose to 39
percent in the twelve months to May 2008 with food price inflation reaching 54 percent (Box
1). International reserves fell to 1.5 months of imports at end-April 2008.

1

Ethiopian troops remain engaged in Somalia and tensions with Eritrea remain high following the expiration of
the border agreement in November 2007.

2

The fiscal year runs from July 8 to July 7.

3

Up-to-date information on poverty is sparse. According to the authorities’ estimates, the total poverty head
count fell to 34.6 percent of population by end-2006/07 from 39 percent in 2004/05.

4.
Economic growth may be slowing but remains high. The authorities consider
that agricultural production is continuing to expand rapidly, notwithstanding the poor
performance of the short rainy season in some regions, and expect broad-based growth of 11
percent in 2007/08, with significant contributions from manufacturing, construction, and
services. However, tempered by estimates that export and import growth has slowed to 4–9
percent in real terms, staff projects real GDP growth is closer to 8½ percent.
Box 1: Causes of Recent Inflation
Both domestic and external factors account for the recent increase in inflation. Estimating the
impact of each factor is difficult, given continuing structural changes, but higher inflation than
in neighboring countries points to some Ethiopia-specific factors and imbalances, including
from demand pressures and increasing inflation expectations. The direct impact through global
food price hikes has been limited in light of the small import share of non-aid food.

Some supply-side factors probably explain part of the rise in food prices: (i) farmers have
recently been equipped with better access to credit, storage facilities, marketing information
and income, leading to better negotiation powers for higher prices, (ii) the total supply of
cereals has fallen as some donors have switched from food to cash aid; and (iii) local food
prices may be converging to high (and rising) world grain prices. However, the mechanism of
the last of these factors is unclear. One possibility is that convergence to world prices is being
driven by unofficial food exports attracted by high food prices in neighboring countries.

6
5.
The rise in world oil prices is hitting Ethiopia’s economy hard. Although
surging coffee prices have helped limit the impact on the terms of trade, and private
remittances have risen sharply, the higher oil and fertilizer import bill is placing considerable
pressures on international reserves (Table 5). The inflationary impact of high oil prices has so
far been relatively contained as they have only been partially passed through to consumers.
This has resulted in sizable government subsidies (estimated at about 1 percent of GDP),
which are being provided off-budget through the Oil Stabilization Fund.5
6.
Overall public sector borrowing has remained high in part because of heavy
public enterprise expenditures. In 2006/07, the general government fiscal balance
(including grants) improved because of cuts in spending and increases in grants (Tables 2 and
3). For 2007/08, helped by some revenue measures (notably, the introduction of an import
surcharge on consumer goods) and increased external financing and privatization revenues,
domestic financing of the general government is being contained below the 2.5 percent of
GDP budget target. In this context, measures to alleviate the impact of high food price
inflation—the lifting of VAT, turnover tax, and surtaxes on some food items—have been
limited. But with significant borrowing by public enterprises, staff estimates that overall
domestic public sector borrowing would reach 5 percent of GDP for 2007/08 compared with
4.8 percent in 2006/07 (Box 2).

5

For some petroleum products (gasoline, kerosene and diesel), staff estimates that as of May 2008 further
upward price adjustments by about 25-50 percent would be needed to fully recover costs.

7

Box 2. Public Enterprise Investment
A key element of Ethiopia’s growth strategy is to rapidly scale up infrastructure investment
in power, telecommunication and transport. The power company is in the process of building
five new hydro-power plants and one wind-power plant with an installed capacity of over
3,000 MW by 2012, compared with Ethiopia’s current installed capacity of 663 MW. The
telecommunications company is expanding the mobile phone coverage with plans for
coverage of 6 percent of population by 2009/10. The national airline has put in a request for
up to 10 Dreamliner planes for delivery between 2009 and 2012. Future financing for these
projects is mostly confined to external funds (partly on nonconcessional terms), but some
domestic financing from commercial banks has recently been used.

7.
Credit expansion to the public sector has to a large extent also driven relatively
rapid broad money growth (Table 4 and figures below). The National Bank of Ethiopia
(NBE) raised minimum reserve requirements on commercial bank deposits from 5 to 10
percent (July 2007), and to 15 percent (April 2008), and raised the minimum time and saving
deposit rate from 3 to 4 percent (July 2007). This has helped reduce banks’ excess reserves
and slow private sector credit growth somewhat. But broad money growth has been propelled
by credit to the public sector, particularly to public enterprises, while the NBE resumed the
provision of direct advances to the government in late 2007 in response to commercial banks’
request to rediscount treasury bills.

The real effective exchange rate has continued to appreciate. The official
exchange rate for the Birr against the U.S. dollar, and in nominal effective terms has steadily
depreciated since end-2007. In parallel markets, the Birr weakened significantly, and the
premium widened to 10 percent by mid-March 2008, prompting the authorities to close the
markets at the end-March.6 Nonetheless, the real effective exchange rate has appreciated due
to Ethiopia’s much faster inflation rate than in its trading partners.

growth and poverty reduction. There was full agreement that the authorities’ targets of
reducing inflation to single digits and raising international reserve coverage, over time, to 1012 weeks of imports are consistent with sustaining development over the medium-term. At
the same time, policies to achieve a soft landing will have to judiciously balance the risks to
growth, inflation, and the balance of payments. The consultation explored these risks and
their implications for policies in the period ahead.
Twin challenges
10.
The authorities recognized that the twin challenges of high inflation and low
international reserves considerably limited their policy options. On inflation, the
authorities placed somewhat more emphasis on the role of structural factors driving an
increase in the relative price of food, but agreed that policies to dampen demand were called
for. The authorities in this regard viewed rapidly rising agricultural prices as a mixed
blessing: they were expected to encourage a strong supply response, but in the short term had
an adverse impact on many vulnerable groups, including the urban poor, and reduced the real
value of food aid.7 On the oil price

11.
The authorities were hopeful that adjustment to low inflation and high oil
prices could be achieved without a significant slowdown in economic growth. They
agreed that monetary and fiscal tightening was a necessary response, but felt that the
potential growth of the economy had been raised as a result of past infrastructure investment
and reforms, with the export sector in particular likely to make a rising contribution to
growth and the balance of payments in the years ahead.
7

Launched in 2005, the Productive Safety Net Program is providing labor-intensive public works and direct
financial support for about 7.4 million beneficiaries. In addition, food subsidies are being provided with an
estimated cost of 0.1 percent of GDP in 2007/08.

10
12.
By contrast, the staff’s analysis, summarized in an illustrative baseline
medium-term adjustment scenario, suggested that sustainable medium-term growth
would be significantly below rates achieved in recent years. With front-loaded tightening
of monetary and fiscal policies, inflation could be brought down to single digits over the
course of the next two years. Full pass through of fuel prices would help adjustment to the oil
price shock, but given the need to build foreign reserves to 10-12 weeks of imports and pay
for higher oil imports, the scope for domestic demand and import growth would be
circumscribed in the medium term, notwithstanding strong concessional and
nonconcessionsal official inflows. Export growth might be buoyant as the authorities
expected—although there were questions about competitiveness (see below)—but given the
small size of the export base, staff estimated that average GDP growth would be around 7
percent (the PASDEP floor) in the medium term and lower than this in the near term.
13.
Moreover, staff pointed to considerable downside risks to growth. There was a
risk that inflation expectations were becoming ingrained and more aggressive policy
tightening might be required. The external environment might deteriorate or oil prices could
rise further.8 And the scenario abstracts from potential adverse weather effects on
agriculture—Ethiopia’s growth has benefited in recent years from the absence of severe
droughts, which in the past have occurred every 5–6 years. Notwithstanding the authorities
efforts to encourage the development and resilience of the agricultural sector, the recurrence
of droughts would lead to both high variability of output and inflation as well as lower
average growth.

14.
Necessary adjustment therefore posed a serious threat to Ethiopia’s efforts to
reduce poverty. Even if the more worrisome downside risks do not materialize, the
projected growth slowdown is substantial and budget resources for development and propoor spending will be squeezed because of slower growth of tax revenue and the need for
tight fiscal policy. Staff argued that policy tightening could not be avoided if high inflation
was to be curtailed and demand adjusted over the medium term to accommodate the oil bill:
failure to do so could lead to more costly and disorderly adjustment later.
15.
The impact on development and pro-poor spending could, however, be
alleviated by additional donor financing as illustrated in staff’s alternative scenario. The
scenario assumes just over 1 billion U.S. dollar of additional grants—on top of the already
identified financing—concentrated in the next two fiscal years. This would create room for

12
additional public spending with some finance assumed to be allocated for capital projects that
have high import content and raise longer-term growth. Short-term growth is also higher than
in the baseline because finance for imports helps alleviate shortages of key commodities.

Adjustment, the real exchange rate and external debt sustainability
16.
An appreciating real exchange rate is beginning to raise questions about
competitiveness, although the authorities were confident that exports would remain
strong. Ethiopia’s export market shares, for example, have increased in recent years,
pointing to productivity advances and broader improvements in supply and business
conditions that are not reflected in CPI-based measures of the real effective exchange rate
(REER). However, with Ethiopian inflation continuing to run ahead of that in competitor
countries, the REER has moved above historical levels.
17.
Staff analysis points to some potential overvaluation of the REER, although
there are several qualifications. Forward-looking analysis of the sustainable current

13
account deficit, for example, suggests that some real depreciation of the exchange rate might
be necessary to support balance of payments adjustment. However, estimates are highly
sensitive to assumptions about what is a reasonable medium-term pace of reserves
accumulation to underpin external stability, the availability of external financing, and the
degree of domestic imbalance in the economy.9 Likewise, estimates of the fundamental
equilibrium REER are sensitive to specification uncertainties with some evidence that earlier
debt relief has until recently compensated for the adverse impact on the equilibrium REER of
the terms of trade decline, and the actual REER has closely followed its equilibrium level.
18.
The authorities agreed that an active structural reform program is needed to
improve productivity and efficiency so as to strengthen external competitiveness. The
PASDEP calls for a range of public investment and services to (i) expand investments in
farm-to-market roads; (ii) encourage private sector involvement; (iii) build agricultural credit
markets; and (iv) enhance the security of land tenure. Staff pointed to the importance of
stimulating private sector development (with special attention to the investment climate) and
building the financial sector in light of recent declines in the private investment rate.
19.
The updated debt sustainability analysis incorporating borrowing by some of
the major public enterprises shows a moderate risk of debt distress. Under the baseline
scenario, the risk of debt distress is low, but stress tests point to breeches of the threshold on
the NPV of debt to exports if new public sector loans are negotiated on less favorable terms,
export growth is lower than the historical average, and simultaneous adverse shocks apply to
growth, exports and grants. To limit these risks, staff stressed that securing grant and
concessional financing and containing domestic borrowing remained vital and urged the
authorities to draw up a comprehensive public debt strategy that specifically includes public
enterprise debt and contingent liabilities, and to strengthen debt management capacity.
Monetary policy tightening
20.
In view of the still high growth of broad money after the initial monetary
tightening, the authorities were stepping up their tightening efforts. The initial measures
had helped to significantly reduce excess reserves of commercial banks, and improve the
efficacy of monetary policy instruments, with better control over liquidity developments.
However, money growth remained buoyant in the first half of 2008 with the surge in credit to
public enterprises and the temporary resumption of NBE direct advances to the government
(which replaced treasury bills held by commercial banks). The authorities concurred with
staff that central bank advances to the government would need to be contained, and the sale
of treasury bills facilitated by attracting more market participants possibly through higher
Treasury bill interest rates.

See Chapter III of the SIP for more details. The range of estimates runs from undervaluation of 8 percent to
overvaluation of 25 percent.

21.
The money growth target for 2008/09 is relatively conservative, but needs to be
kept under close review especially if high inflation persists. The authorities’ broad money
target of under 20 percent appropriately factors in a rise in money velocity (Box 3).
However, setting the money target was further complicated by the uncertainties surrounding
the inflation process. Staff agreed that underlying inflation was likely significantly below the
headline rate because food price inflation was partly driven by convergence to world prices, a
process that had finite (albeit uncertain) limits. Nevertheless, there remained a significant risk
that excess demand and inflation expectations were driving inflation, in which case the
authorities needed to stand ready to tighten monetary policy further.
Box 3. Ethiopia: Rising Income Velocity of Money
Broad money velocity typically trends
downward in low income countries (LICs),
reflecting monetization and financial
deepening. Against this backdrop, the NBE
has set monetary targets under the
assumption that velocity declines by about
2 percent each year.

However, in recent years, double-digit
inflation, substantially above the LIC
average, has eroded the birr’s purchasing
power as well as its credibility as a store of
value. With interest rates also highly
negative in real terms, there has been a shift
from deposits to cash and from saving to
consumption. This has caused monetary
deepening to stall, with broad money
velocity in 2006/07 increasing by 8 percent.

Fiscal support for adjustment
22.
The authorities recognized the need to support monetary tightening with a
reduction in public sector domestic borrowing. With some rebuilding of net foreign assets,
the money supply target would imply a sharp decline in private sector credit in 2008/09 if
public borrowing were not curtailed. This would lead to imbalanced development and slower
output growth. In this context, staff recommended roughly halving domestic public sector
borrowing to 2–3 percent of GDP in 2008/09, a level that was also historically consistent
with single-digit inflation (Box 4). To the extent that this might require lowering the budget
domestic borrowing ceiling to 1½ percent of GDP, real government expenditure growth
would be negligible in 2008/09 absent measures to strengthen tax revenue. This would place
additional emphasis on the need for careful project selection that emphasizes productivity
and contribution to growth as well as prioritization to preserve pro-poor spending.
Box 4: Inflation and Role of Public Sector
Public sector borrowing (defined to include the borrowing by public enterprises from the banking system)
is highly correlated with inflation, reflecting the dominant role of the sector in the economy. During
previous disinflation periods (late-1980s and mid-1990s), inflation was lowered by 8–18 percentage
points, following the reduction of public sector borrowing by 1½–4½ percent of GDP. This is broadly in
line with the empirical results of cross-country analysis.10 Based on this experience, borrowing would
need to be reduced by 2–3 percent of GDP to help achieve single-digit inflation.

23.
While the authorities expressed their intention to limit overall public
borrowing, they were concerned that going as low as 1½ percent of GDP for domestic
10

Fischer et al. (2002), using a panel data of 94 developing countries, estimate that, for high inflation countries,
a 1 percentage point improvement in the ratio of the fiscal balance-to-GDP typically leads to a 4.2 percent
decline in inflation, all else constant.

16
budget borrowing would imply too large a squeeze on government spending and the
investment budget. Nevertheless, until there were clear signs that inflation was turning, they
intended to keep domestic borrowing well below the 2007/08 budget ceiling of 2½ percent of
GDP and implement import-intensive capital spending cautiously to mitigate the impact on
the external position. At the same time, the top economic policy makers, who now meet
regularly to coordinate the macroeconomic policy strategy, would keep a close eye on the
activities of public enterprises.
24.
Staff reiterated that, if strong control over the activities of public enterprises is
not feasible, budget policy would have to react to pressures on domestic borrowing.
Effective controlling measures—including the introduction of performance contracts and/or
approval of their budgets and borrowing plans—should be explored. It also stressed that
allowing full pass through of oil prices should be part of the strategy in order to reduce the
growing quasi-fiscal liability of the Oil Stabilization Fund. The authorities noted their
intention to raise fuel prices further.
25.
The need to keep fiscal policy tight in the medium term to help the economy
absorb the oil price shock puts the spotlight on the poor performance of revenues. The
tax-to-GDP ratio has been on a downward trend in recent years because the rebounding
agricultural sector is lightly taxed and newly emerging sectors in services and industry
benefit from tax breaks. Unless the trend is reversed, the budget arithmetic would become
increasingly difficult going forward. Therefore, the authorities were undertaking a
comprehensive study of tax reforms, based on earlier technical assistance recommendations.
26.
Improved public financial management would also ensure greater value for
money in public expenditure. Staff welcomed progress in performance budgeting and also
encouraged the authorities to seek help from development partners to strengthen the vetting
and selection of capital projects.
Exchange rate policy
27.
The staff argued that greater exchange rate flexibility is needed to better
reflect demand for and supply of foreign exchange. Absent effective competition in the
interbank foreign exchange market, and with the central bank the major supplier of foreign
exchange, exchange rate movements have been highly circumscribed.11 However, in light of
potential strains on competitiveness and the need to adapt to higher oil prices, staff stressed it
was important to avoid overvaluation. Moreover, the wide spread that had opened up in the
parallel market suggested supply and demand imbalances, and the closure of the market
could push some transactions further underground, possibly resulting in a wider exchange
rate premium. The authorities agreed that more flexibility could in principle be beneficial,
11

17
but were anxious to avoid sharp corrections of the exchange rate—not least, because they
could fan inflation expectations. They agreed to consider measures to foster a more liquid
and flexible interbank foreign exchange market, such as allowing banks to bid for foreign
exchange more freely.
Financial sector soundness and development
28.
Staff reiterated that increasing competition in the banking sector is central to
improving the environment for implementing monetary policy and encouraging private
sector development. Private

29.
The authorities remain reluctant to open the banking system to foreign
competition and to privatize the CBE. However, they took note of staff suggestions to
allow banks to explore commercial links with foreign partners, which might lead to the
development of new financial products and cost savings that would reduce high spreads
between lending and deposit rates and fees/charges for financial services.
30.
Financial sector soundness indicators are not signaling problems, but because
this is probably the high point of the economic cycle, continued close scrutiny by
supervisors will be important (Table 7). A slowdown of economic growth and unwinding
of high inflation could expose credit risks, particularly as interest rates have been highly
negative in real terms. The implications of quasi-fiscal liabilities in the banking system
should also be carefully examined in any process of normalizing interest rates.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
Ethiopia’s growth performance has been impressive, but macroeconomic
imbalances are intensifying. Double-digit growth has enabled Ethiopia to keep achievement
of the MDGs within reach. High growth, however, has led to increasing pressures on prices
and international reserves, which if not firmly addressed will threaten the sustainability of
development.

18
32.
The surge in oil prices also threatens Ethiopia’s ability to sustain poverty
reduction. The size of the shock is very large and comes at a time when international
reserves are already low. Assuming that oil prices will not come down significantly from
their record levels, Ethiopia has no choice but to adjust demand to accommodate the increase
in the oil bill. Continued efforts to strengthen the supply side of the economy and encourage
exports will help, but full pass through to domestic fuel prices will also be needed as well as
tight monetary and fiscal policies in the period ahead. Absent additional donor assistance to
help ease adjustment costs, there is thus a strong likelihood of a significant setback to
Ethiopia’s progress in reducing poverty.
33.
After a tentative start to addressing imbalances, the recent strengthening of
policy coordination at the top and articulation of a consistent macroeconomic policy
framework are thus welcome. It will be particularly important to implement a balanced mix
of fiscal and monetary policies. This will require implementing all necessary measures to
achieve the appropriately tight monetary target and supporting it with a significant reduction
of public sector borrowing to 2–3 percent of GDP. Careful monitoring and controlling of the
activities of the public enterprises will in this context be essential.
34.
With the risk of inflation expectations becoming ingrained and foreign
reserves at a low level, policy tightening will need to be forcefully implemented. The
authorities should implement their budget cautiously in the first half of 2008/09 and ensure
that domestic borrowing is kept well below 2½ percent of GDP. Direct advances by the NBE
to the government, which automatically create liquidity, should be avoided and Treasury bill
rates should be allowed to rise if heavy liquidity mopping up needs arise. The authorities
should stand ready to tighten policies further if inflation does not begin to subside quickly
and international reserves do not begin to recover.
35.
Tax and expenditure reforms will be needed to alleviate pressures on the
budget over the medium term and ensure value for money in public spending. To
reverse the declining tax-to-GDP ratio, the current study on tax reform should be swiftly
completed, and reforms implemented without delay. The authorities are also encouraged to
strengthen expenditure controls in order to cut low-priority outlays, while safeguarding
poverty-reducing expenditures.
36.
Careful attention will need to be paid to external competitiveness in light of the
fragility of the balance of payments. While it is not clear that the exchange rate is
overvalued, the risks lie in this direction. The authorities are thus encouraged to permit more
exchange rate flexibility, including by fostering a deeper and more competitive foreign
exchange market. Longer term, competitiveness will need to be supported by ongoing
structural reforms that improve productivity and efficiency in the export sector. While the
debt sustainability analyses show a moderate risk of debt distress, securing grant and
concessional financing and containing domestic borrowing are vital in order to stay
sustainable over the medium to long term.

19
37.
The financial system will require careful monitoring. If, as is likely, this is the
high point of the current economic cycle, a slowdown in growth and inflation could expose
credit risks. Development of the banking system is in any case a structural policy priority in
order to provide more access to financing for the private sector. In this regard, more
competition among banks is needed, including through further diminishing the market share
of the CBE and exploring partnerships with foreign financial institutions.
38.
The data provided to the Fund are adequate for surveillance purposes, but
further steps should be taken to address shortcomings in real, fiscal, and balance of
payments statistics. Stepped-up efforts, with technical assistance from various sources
(including the Fund), are called for. In the meantime, the authorities should be commended
for preparing the statistical appendix for Article IV consultations.
39.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 2008
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by Martin Fetherston and Saul Lizondo (IMF) and
Sudhir Shetty and Carlos Braga (IDA)
July 1, 2008
This note assesses the sustainability of Ethiopia’s external public debt and total public debt
based on the joint World Bank-IMF debt sustainability framework for low-income countries.1
While external debt ratios have improved considerably with debt relief and public domestic
debt in terms of GDP continues to decline, Ethiopia remains at moderate risk of debt
distress.
I.

BACKGROUND

1.
The last DSA undertaken in May 2007 concluded that Ethiopia was at moderate
risk of debt distress.2 Ethiopia reached its HIPC Initiative completion point in 2004 and
benefited from debt relief under the MDRI in 2006. The debt relief provided under both
initiatives helped to lower the debt ratio to less than 10 percent of GDP at end 2006/07.3
4
While the debt burden indicators were projected to remain below the policy dependentthresholds for the whole projection period in the last DSA, it was projected that the indicative
threshold for the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio would be breached under one stress test,
leading to the assessment of moderate risk.

Considerations,” IDA/R2005-0056 and http://www.imf.org/External/np/pp/eng/2005/032805.htm,
3/28/05.

The Ethiopian fiscal year runs from July 8 to July 7.

4

While Ethiopia has received debt relief from most of its creditors, it has not been able to reach agreement with
Algeria, Libya, and FR Yugoslavia which account for over 17 percent of the debt stock in 2007/08.

2
2.
Despite continued strong export growth and an improved current account
position, the revised DSA concludes that Ethiopia risk of debt distress remains
moderate because of the large financing needs of the public enterprises over the next
ten years. Although the debt burden indicators remain below the policy dependent-thresholds
for the whole projection period as in the last DSA, three stress tests breach the threshold for
the NPV of debt to exports ratio when the debt stock is measured inclusive of public
enterprises (public sector).5
II.

MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK

3.
Except for growth prospects, the macroeconomic framework is slightly more
favorable than the one presented in the last DSA. Export growth in volume and value
terms is stronger by 1 percentage point, but the trade balance is projected to deteriorate
significantly on account of the rising oil import bill. Net FDI is comparable with the
projection made a year ago while loan financing is projected to be higher by ½ percentage
point of GDP per annum relative to the projection made a year ago.

5

The World Bank Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) classifies Ethiopia as a medium
performer. The thresholds for the debt burden for medium performers are 150, 40 and 250 for the NPV of debt
to exports, GDP and revenue respectively. Under the same classification, thresholds for debt service are 20 and
30 percent of exports and revenue, respectively.

3

Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions for the Baseline Scenario
Real GDP grows annually at about 7 percent until 2010/11, rising to 7½ percent thereafter.
This assessment assumes continued good harvests supporting agriculture and increased
activity in services and industry. The inflation rate is projected to decline to single digits
within three years in response to tighter monetary and fiscal policies combined with the
assumption that convergence of Ethiopia’s commodity price index to the world price index is
almost complete.
The fiscal deficit (including grants) is projected to decline to 2.5 percent of GDP in
2008/09 from 4.4 percent in 2007/08 in order to address the current macroeconomic
imbalances and gradually increase toward 3.5 percent by 2014/15.
The current account deficit (before official transfers) is projected to remain fairly flat at
about 10½ percent of GDP through 2012/13 with exports growing slightly faster than imports
before improving to average out at 7 percent of GDP over the long term.
Exports of goods are projected to grow in volume at an annual rate of about 10½ percent
between 2008/09 and 2012/13, led by pulses, leather products and flowers, with export prices
projected to rise at an annual rate of ¾ percent. Over the long run export volume growth is
projected to level out at 11½ percent per annum with export prices rising by 1 percent per
annum.
Private transfers are assumed to dip slightly over the next few years and level out at 8 ¼
percent of GDP.
Foreign direct investment is envisaged to rise gradually over time from the current level of
2 ½ percent of GDP to slightly above 3 percent of GDP.
Official transfers are projected to average 5½ percent of GDP annually over the next five
years, falling to 4½ percent in the long run. Loan financing on concessional terms is
projected to average about 2 ¾ percent of GDP annually over the next five years but then
decline sharply to about 1½ percent of GDP by 2026/27 because of the diminished need for
external financing over the longer term. Loan financing for public enterprises at nonconcessional rates is projected to average over 2 percent of GDP per annum over the same
time period.

III.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

A. Baseline
4.
In the baseline scenario, public and publicly guaranteed external debt remains
under the various thresholds. In particular, the NPV of debt to exports is projected to peak
at 119 percent in 2013/14 as investments in the electricity and telecommunication sector
reach their peak. This is an improvement over last year’s profile for two reasons. First, the

4
lending profile for the public enterprises has shifted to the future in light of the difficulties of
accessing large amounts of concessional financing quickly; this change lowers the NPV of
debt. Second, export growth is now projected to be stronger, in light of improvements in
export prices. The debt-to-GDP ratio has a similar hump-shaped profile, rising initially but
falling over time to about 10 percent of GDP. Although the debt service ratio remains below
the threshold of 20 percent of exports, it is projected to more than double over the next few
years as a large fraction of new borrowing is for public enterprises on non-concessional
terms.
5.
Under the historical scenario, the debt burden indicators are projected to reach
higher levels than under the baseline scenario, but they do not breach the thresholds.
The NPV of debt to exports peaks at 124 percent in 2013/14 before dipping and settling at
about 50 percentage points higher than in the baseline at the end of the forecast period. The
profile of the NPV of debt to GDP ratio also deteriorates considerably over time to level out
at 17 percent of GDP in 2026/27. The reason for the continued deterioration in the debt to
GDP ratio using historical parameters is that the historical growth rate is slightly below the
projection (about ½ percent per annum) and the historical borrowing needs are considerably
higher than the projected needs over the 2016/17-2026/27 period.
B. Sensitivity Tests
6.
Three of the stress tests breach the indicative threshold for the NPV of debt to
exports over the forecast horizon. If new public sector loans are negotiated on less
favorable terms (200 basis point higher interest rate during the forecast horizon), the debt
ratio peaks at 166 percent in 2012/13, 16 percentage points above the debt sustainability
threshold (Table 2, Figure 1).Also, if export growth is lower than the historical average by 1
standard deviation, the debt ratio breaches the threshold very soon and peaks at almost 216
percent in 2012/13. The scenario that applies one half standard deviation shocks to growth,
exports and grants has similar features.
7.
The debt profile is highly sensitive to assumptions made about export growth in
the long run although less sensitive to output growth prospects. The baseline long-run
forecast assumes that export growth of goods levels out at about 11 ½ percent per annum,
with slightly higher growth for service exports on account of the expected foreign exchange
proceeds from large infrastructure investments in the electricity, telecommunication, and
transportation sectors. In a scenario with lower export growth (8 percent per annum over the
forecast horizon) and lower output growth (5 percent per annum over the next five years
compared to an average of 7 percent per annum in the baseline) the profile of the NPV of
debt to exports would almost breach the indicative threshold in 2013/14. The debt profile in
relation to output would not change much since the reduction in growth only lasts for five
years and lower imports are reflected in higher reserve coverage rather than lower external
borrowing (Figure 2). In an alternative scenario with export growth at 15 percent per annum,

5
closer to the growth rate projected by the authorities, the debt trajectory in terms of exports
would be much more sustainable.
8.
Increased financing to ease the balance of payments constraint would only have
a significant effect on debt sustainability if it were on nonconcessional terms. As
indicated in the 2008 IMF Article IV staff report, the petroleum bill for 2008/09 is about
US$1 billion higher than in 2006/07 on account of the sharp rise in oil prices and the fastgrowing economy. If additional financing of about US$1 billion were obtained on market
terms to ease the balance of payments constraint, partly resulting from higher oil prices, it
would raise the ratio of the NPV of debt to exports to considerably to 142 percent at its peak ,
compared with 119 percent under the baseline scenario. By contrast, if the financing were
obtained on IDA terms, the ratio of the NPV of debt to exports is expected to reach 127
percent at its peak.

IV.

FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

9.
Public domestic debt in terms of GDP continues to decline. Despite significant
borrowing by some public enterprises in 2007/08, domestic financing of the general
government has been broadly in line with a relatively tight budget. Moreover, negative real
interest rates on public debt resulting from rising inflation have also helped reduce the real
debt burden. Consequently, domestic debt is projected to decline to 25 percent of GDP by
end 2007/08, down by about 3 percentage points from a year ago.
10.
With the prospective increase in external debt, Ethiopia’s public debt burden
(including domestic debt) is expected to display a hump-shaped profile over the
projected period. The domestic debt profile is based on two assumptions: (i) domestic
financing will gradually increase to 2½ percent of GDP per annum, and (ii) real domestic
interest rates will gradually become positive. While rising in the short-run, the NPV of debt
to GDP ratio is projected to decline from about 33 percent in 2013/14 to 28 percent over the
long term (Figure 3). The NPV of debt to revenue ratio is projected to reach 185 percent by
2014/15 but to fall below 170 percent over the long term. Domestic financing of 3 percent of
GDP, comparable to the outturn of 2006/07 would result in less favorable debt dynamics. The
NPV of debt to GDP ratio would be close to 40 percent in 2013/14, before trending down.
Moreover, if real interest rates became positive from 2008/09, without further fiscal
tightening, the fiscal deficit would increase by 1–2 percentage points for the next few years
and raise the NPV of debt to GDP ratio to 38 percent and the NPV of debt to revenue ratio to
over 250 percent by 2013/14, before trending down to 220 percent in the long-term.
11.
Debt indicators would worsen under the lower growth scenario described above.
With real GDP growth assumed at 5 percent per annum for the next five years, the NPV of

6
debt-to-GDP ratio would climb up to 40 percent by 2013/14 and beyond, and the NPV of
debt-to-revenue ratio would follow the similar path reaching 250 percent in 2026/27. This
scenario highlights the importance of maintaining the growth momentum while continuing
with adjustment efforts to correct the macroeconomic imbalances and avoid the debt stock
following an unsustainable path. Delaying fiscal consolidation would significantly increase
debt risks, as illustrated in the historical and bound tests.
V.

CONCLUSION

12.
While external debt ratios have improved considerably with debt relief, and
some of the debt indicators in the DSA have improved relative to last year on account of
more rapid export growth, Ethiopia remains at moderate risk of debt distress. This
assessment illustrates the importance for Ethiopia to address its current macroeconomic
imbalances so that it can maintain strong export and output growth. On the issue of debt,
Ethiopia should secure grant and concessional financing, strengthen its debt management
capacity, and develop a comprehensive debt strategy that includes public enterprises and
contingent liabilities.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in
U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution
from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments devided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

Source: Staff projections and simulations.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming an
offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point. Hence, these two amounts cannot be added.

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed in the interim.

3

The MDRI provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries. Grant assistance from the MDRI
Trust and HIPC resources provide debt relief to cover all debt owed to the Fund as of the end of 2004 that is
still outstanding when the member qualifies for debt relief.

IX.
Safeguards Assessment
According to Fund policy, an assessment of the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) was
completed on September 12, 2001, with respect to the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility arrangement approved on March 22, 2001. The NBE has made progress in
implementing the recommendations of the safeguards assessment.
X.
Exchange Rate Arrangement
The de facto exchange rate regime is classified as a crawling peg, in light of the recent
market developments. The authorities describe the de jure exchange rate regime as a
managed float with no predetermined path for the exchange rate, and the Birr has steadily
depreciated against the U.S. dollar. The pace of the depreciation, however, has been stable.
Furthermore, the NBE supplies foreign exchange to the market based on plans established at
the beginning of each fiscal year that took into account estimates of likely supply and
demand. The transaction-weighted average interbank market exchange rate on May 30, 2008,
was Br 9.5697 = US$1.
Ethiopia currently maintains four restrictions on the payments and transfers for current
international transactions, which relate to (a) the tax certification requirement for repatriation
of dividend and other investment income; (b) restrictions on repayment of legal external
loans and supplies and foreign partner credits; (c) rules for issuance of import permits by
commercial banks; and (d) the requirement to provide a clearance certificate from NBE to
obtain import permits. These restrictions are inconsistent with Article VIII, Section 2(a), of
the IMF’s Articles of Agreement and remain unapproved.
XI. Article IV Consultation
Ethiopia is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The Executive Board concluded the
last Article IV consultation on June 2, 2007 (IMF Country Report No.06/159, May 2006;
www.imf.org).

ANNEX III. Ethiopia: Statistical Issues
General
1.
Data provided to the Fund are adequate for surveillance purposes, but there are
shortcomings in real, fiscal, and balance of payments statistics. Ethiopia participates in the
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and metadata were partially updated in early
2008. Ethiopia participates in the GDDS project for capacity building in statistics in
Anglophone Africa (2006—2009) including macro-economic and financial statistics and
socio-demographic statistics
2.
The authorities have prepared and will soon publish the Statistical Appendix for the
2008 Article IV Consultations, as part of the pilot project launched by the African
Department of the IMF. The 2007 Statistical Appendix is posted on the National Bank of
Ethiopia (NBE) website (http://www.nbe.gov.et/).
Real sector
3.
A new series of GDP estimates (1995/96–2005/06) updated the base year
from 1980/81 to 1999/2000. However, there is scope for improving the quality of source data
because some internal consistency issues remain. First, the quality of GDP estimates by
industry is affected by the poor coverage of construction activities. Second, while some
progress has been made in making GDP estimates by final expenditure consistent with
output-based measures, there remain substantial shortcomings, particularly in the estimation
of private consumption and fixed capital formation. The statistical discrepancy in GDP
estimates by expenditure categories has increased in recent years. The authorities, with
technical assistance from the Africa Regional Technical Assistance Center (AFRITAC East),
are working to address these discrepancies by preparing supply and use tables. Follow-up
technical assistance from AFRITAC East on the CPI is planned.
Public finances
4.
Despite progress in 2003 in eliminating discrepancies between data on the domestic
and foreign financing of the budget deficit and the monetary accounts, significant
discrepancies in subsequent years continue to complicate assessment of fiscal developments.
Progress has been made in improving the quality and coverage of reporting on the
consolidated general government and consolidating federal and regional budgets—inclusive
of all extrabudgetary funds and accounts—within the decentralization of fiscal powers to
woredas (districts). Ensuring the integrity of consolidated budget reporting will be a
continuing task. Comprehensive information on the operations and financial position of
public enterprises is not available. Fiscal data for the central government for 2002 were
reported for the 2005 Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY). The authorities
recently submitted 2003 data, albeit with several problems. No fiscal data is provided to the
Statistics Department (STA) of the IMF for publication in the International Finance
Statistics. In the context of the Anglophone Africa project, the authorities have made a
commitment to compile and disseminate data on the consolidated central government

8

(annual) as well as the budgetary central government (monthly) on a cash basis in conformity
with the methodology of the GFSM 2001 by April 2009.
Monetary accounts
5.
Two STA technical assistance missions in 2004 found that the quality of monetary
and financial statistics was compromised by methodological problems. The missions
recommended correcting certain misclassifications of accounting data, helped the central
bank compile standardized report forms (SRFs) for reporting monetary statistics to STA, and
worked with the authorities and AFR to establish an integrated monetary database (IMD).
The follow-up mission in September 2004 finalized the IMD. The authorities then provided
SRF-based data for the NBE and other depository corporations to STA until December 2004.
At present, there is a need for the NBE to resume data submissions based on the SRF and
IMD framework. A technical assistance mission in FY2009 will assist the NBE to resume
reporting SRF-based monetary data to the IMF.
Balance of payments
6.
Balance of payments data still require improvements on coverage, valuation, timing,
and classification of transactions. From 2004 to 2006, four balance of payments statistics
missions werefielded as part of the GDDS project for Anglophone Africa. With assistance
from experts, the authorities drew up plans to publish data consistent with the fifth edition of
the Balance of Payments Manual. Questionnaire design and data collection procedures have
since improved, and new methods were introduced for c.i.f./f.o.b. valuation adjustments for
imports, external aid, trade credit, and bank financial account transactions.
Social indicators
7.
Data on poverty are derived from household surveys regularly conducted by the
Central Statistical Authority.1 The government, with assistance from the World Bank, has
constructed indicators for measuring poverty reduction, including income and expenditure
per capita, income inequality, literacy, malnutrition, and infant/child mortality.
During 2004/05 the authorities conducted a number of surveys to measure household
welfare, including (i) a participatory poverty assessment; (ii) the Household Income,
Consumption and Expenditure Survey (HICES); and (iii) a welfare monitoring survey. The
data are currently being processed. There is no adequate data on prevalence rates of
HIV/AIDS, especially among the rural population, and it is not clear whether food
consumption among people living in drought-prone areas is properly monitored. The welfare
monitoring survey conducted in 2004/05 is expected to produce indicators relating to
HIV/AIDS.
1

Examples of regular surveys are the Household Income, Consumption, and Expenditure Survey (every five
years) and the Welfare Monitoring Survey (every three years). Other household and consumption surveys have
been carried out by the University of Addis Ababa in collaboration with Oxford University.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 21, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with The Federal Democratic Republic of
Ethiopia
On July 14, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
1
Article IV consultation with The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.

Background
The Ethiopian economy has been growing rapidly in the last four years. Favorable weather
conditions and pro-growth policies have helped sustain recovery from a sharp drought-related
contraction in 2002/03 (fiscal year begins July 8). Growth has averaged 11 percent since 2003/04,
far exceeding the minimum growth target of 7 percent in the Program for Accelerated and
Sustainable Development (PASDEP) that is estimated to be consistent with keeping the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) within reach. In recent years, however, it has become clear that
demand is running ahead of the expansion in the capacity of the economy. Inflation was almost 40
percent on a 12-month basis in May 2008, and international reserves have fallen to 1.5 months of
imports. Inflation is being driven largely by rapidly rising domestic food prices.
Domestic public sector borrowing has been at a high level in the last two years in part because of
heavy public enterprise expenditure. Helped by some revenue measures and increased external
financing and privatization revenues, domestic financing of the general government is being
contained below the 2.5 percent of GDP budget target in 2007/08. But with significant borrowing by
public enterprises, IMF staff estimate that the overall domestic public sector borrowing will remain at
about 5 percent of GDP.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
Broad money growth remains high. The National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) raised minimum reserve
requirements on commercial bank deposits and the minimum interest rates on time and saving
deposits in July 2007 and April 2008. This has helped reduce banks’ excess reserves. But broad
money growth has stayed high due to credit expansion to public enterprises and the financing of the
general government deficit.
The rise in world oil prices has significantly added to pressures on international reserves. Surging
coffee prices have helped to limit the impact on the terms of trade, and private remittances have
risen sharply. However, IMF staff estimate that a full-year impact of higher oil prices will raise
Ethiopia’s oil import bill by about $1 billion (over 3 percent of GDP) over its 2006/07 level. High oil
prices were only partially passed through to consumers, with higher costs being absorbed by the Oil
Stabilization Fund. The official exchange rate for the Birr against the U.S. dollar (the intervention
currency) has continued to depreciate and reached Birr 9.6 per U.S. dollar at end-May 2008.
IMF staff project that real GDP growth will slow to 8.4 percent in 2007/08. Inflation is projected to be
about 30 percent at the end of 2007/08 on a 12-month basis.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Ethiopia’s stronger and more diversified economic growth of recent
years, which has enabled the country to keep the Millennium Development Goals within reach.
Directors cautioned, however, that the recent signs of growing macroeconomic imbalances
manifested as higher inflation and a weakening of the balance of payments suggest that demand is
running ahead of capacity expansion. They noted that some supply-side factors may also have
driven up food prices and thereby contributed to inflationary pressures. At the same time, the surge
in world oil prices is placing a large strain on the balance of payments.
Against this background, Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to address the
macroeconomic imbalances and to absorb the world oil price shock in a manner that least affects
the momentum for growth and poverty reduction. They commended the authorities’ recent
strengthening of policy coordination and their objective of slowing monetary growth and reducing
public sector borrowing. Directors emphasized that the authorities’ efforts should be supported by
continued structural reforms to encourage private sector development and make the economy more
resilient to shocks.
Directors stressed that forceful policy tightening will be needed in the period ahead to reduce
inflation and ensure that inflation expectations do not become ingrained. The measures introduced
to date to mop up excess reserves in the banking system will need to be complemented by strict
limits on central bank advances to the government. Directors therefore welcomed the authorities’
readiness to monitor developments closely and to tighten monetary policy further as needed.
Directors underscored that determined fiscal restraint, anchored in a significant reduction in public
sector domestic borrowing, will be crucial to the authorities’ adjustment efforts. They accordingly
considered appropriate the authorities’ intention to contain the government’s domestic borrowing
well below last year’s level. Given the importance of public infrastructure investment, a tighter fiscal
stance will require capital expenditure to be aimed at projects that enhance productivity and

3
contribute most to economic growth. Restraint on domestic borrowing by public enterprises will be
essential.
Directors stressed that continuing pass through of world oil prices to consumers will be needed to
facilitate an adjustment to the oil price shock and to alleviate growing strains on the Oil Stabilization
Fund. However, they acknowledged that determining the appropriate pace and timing of pass
through will be challenging in the context of the current high inflation, the impact on specific sectors,
and social and political feasibility.
Directors recognized the risk that the necessary policy tightening could slow growth and set back
efforts to reduce poverty. They accordingly urged the authorities to carefully prioritize budget
spending to protect the most vulnerable members of society. Directors also encouraged the
authorities to seek additional foreign assistance to support their adjustment efforts and complement
their plans to protect pro-poor spending and investment in capital projects. Grants or highly
concessional financing should be sought to preserve external debt sustainability. In this context,
Directors recommended that a comprehensive public debt strategy should be prepared,
incorporating public enterprise debt and contingent liabilities.
In light of the fragility of the balance of payments, Directors welcomed the recent increase in
exchange rate flexibility, and encouraged the authorities to foster a deeper and more competitive
foreign exchange market. While noting staff’s assessment that there is no clear evidence of
exchange rate overvaluation, Directors nevertheless welcomed the authorities’ intention to keep
external competitiveness under review. Over time, sustained robust export growth will require the
authorities to carry forward vigorously their structural reform agenda aimed at raising productivity
and improving business conditions. Directors welcomed the authorities’ intentions in this area.
Directors stressed that increasing competition in the banking sector is central to improving the
environment for implementing monetary policy and encouraging private sector development. This
could be facilitated by exploring partnerships with foreign financial institutions. More generally,
Directors encouraged the authorities to step up banking reforms and to strengthen banking
supervision.
Directors underscored the importance of reforms that ensure that the public sector contributes
effectively to the development of the Ethiopian economy. They encouraged the authorities to
complete their consideration of tax reforms and to implement measures rapidly to reverse the
declining tax-to-GDP ratio. Measures to further strengthen public expenditure management,
including through the introduction of performance budgeting, will be needed to improve the quality
and efficiency of public spending.
Directors considered that the data provided to the Fund are adequate for surveillance purposes, but
further steps should be taken to address shortcomings in several areas.

Statement by Mr. Peter Gakunu, Executive Director
for The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia
and Mr. Ebson Uanguta, Advisor to Executive Director
July 14, 2008
1.
The Ethiopian authorities appreciate the candid and open discussion with staff during
the recent 2008 Article IV consultation. They value the timely and useful contributions of the
mission team to key policy issues aimed at supporting the implementation of the Plan for
Accelerated and Sustainable Development to End Poverty (PASDEP), while addressing the
current imbalances. They find the staff assessment of the country’s economic policies,
challenges and prospects as informative, fair and well balanced.
Recent economic developments
2.
The authorities’ pro-growth policies have been highly successful in recent years. Real
GDP growth has averaged 11.8 percent annually over the last four years, which has been the
highest among all non-oil producing countries in Africa. This period has also witnessed the
beginnings of two peculiar changes in the economic landscape of Ethiopia: a shift to higher
growth path and more diversified sources of growth. The strong growth has enabled Ethiopia
to make significant strides in reducing poverty, and thus has kept the achievement of some of
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) within reach. The country’s growth has been
sustained largely and complemented by strong investment in the construction, manufacturing,
power, tourism, banking and insurance, and real estate sub-sectors. Significant investment in
agriculture, including in the irrigation schemes, has modernized the sector and insulated it
from recurring drought shocks.
3.
Notwithstanding these efforts, inflation has recently started edging up mainly due to
increases in food prices. Structural factors have partly been responsible for rapid increases in
food prices in Ethiopia in recent years. Among the factors is the rise in rural incomes
recorded over the past four years, which has contributed to changes in the food consumption
patterns of the rural population and aligned it to that of urban population. This development
created excess demand for grains which in the past were not generally consumed by the rural
population. At the same time, the pattern of agricultural cultivation has not yet shifted
sufficiently towards the relevant grains to enhance supply. Consequently, there has been a
significant rise in prices, in spite of an overall increase in the domestic food production.
4.
In the midst of these challenges, the Ethiopian authorities have remained committed
to pursuing prudent macroeconomic policies. The government fiscal balance for 2006/07
improved mainly because of cuts in spending, whilst increases in grants have also contributed
positively. Monetary policy has also been tightened to significantly reduce excess reserves of
commercial banks, and improve the efficacy of monetary policy, with better control over
liquidity developments.

2
Current challenges: shocks and imbalances
5.
Notwithstanding these positive developments, the Ethiopian economy is confronted
with twin challenges: (i) continuing inflationary pressures; and (ii) low international reserves,
which considerably limit its policy options.
6.
The authorities recognize that rising inflation, exacerbated by international food and
oil prices, poses a significant challenge to their plan to sustain the current real growth
momentum. In particular, they are aware of the challenges posed by the surge in world oil
prices, which have pushed up the oil import bill. Though inflation is expected to start
subsiding in response to the earlier tightening of monetary policy, the authorities are
determined to take additional measures to counter excess demand pressures that are
contributing to high inflation including further adjustments to fiscal and monetary policies.
The authorities are also aware that measures to scale down import growth in order to stay
within the confines of the available foreign reserves remain a priority. It is against this
background that the authorities expressed their plan to cut public spending and limit overall
public borrowing, in order to limit import demand.
7.
The authorities remain committed and have demonstrated this commitment to their
development partners as to how they intend to address the current economic shocks. In turn,
they expect development partners to assist by frontloading donor assistance to ease the
adjustment burden and facilitate a smoother transition in the economy.
Adjustment measures to the shocks and domestic imbalances
Fiscal policy
8.
Strategy of adjustment measures to the shocks and imbalances that have emerged
include an important role of fiscal policy to support monetary tightening. The authorities
intend to limit overall public sector domestic borrowing--including public enterprises--well
below the 2007/08 budget ceiling of 2.5 percent of GDP. However, they are concerned that
going as low as 1.5 percent of GDP for domestic borrowing would further squeeze the
already tight government spending and the investment program. This may be
counterproductive for a country with a huge development deficit and widespread poverty.
Nevertheless, public domestic debt would be reduced to 25 percent of GDP by end 2007/08
from 28 percent in 2006/07. After implementation of the MDRI, all debt burden indicator
ratios are now well below their respective sustainability thresholds. With a view to
maintaining sustainable debt and avoiding recurrence of new debt stress, the authorities are
committed to continue seeking more grants and contract loans only on concessional terms.
Monetary policy
9.
The broad objectives of monetary policy will continue to maintain core inflation at a
single-digit level and international reserves at 8-10 weeks of import cover. This would be

3
achieved by keeping broad money supply at less than 20 percent. However, the authorities
also acknowledge the significant risk posed by excess demand and inflation expectations
which has been partly driving inflation and may continue to do so. In this respect, the
authorities are ready to further tighten monetary policy.
Exchange rate policy
10.
The authorities have described Ethiopia’s exchange rate regime as managed float with
no pre-determined path for the movement of the exchange rate. The official exchange rate is
freely determined in the daily inter-bank exchange rate market, with no explicit exchange
rate target set by the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE). The authorities have noted that the
real exchange rate appreciation in recent times is largely attributable to inflation running
ahead of that in competitor countries. However, they are confident that the determination to
rein in inflationary pressures and to continue implementing structural reforms aimed at
improving productivity and efficiency in key sectors of the economy would help stem and
reverse the REER appreciation over the medium term.
Structural reforms
11.
The Ethiopian authorities are aware of the key reforms necessary to strengthen the
medium-term growth prospect. These include, creating a more dynamic and productive
agricultural sector, strengthening the power sector to increase access and reliability of
electricity supply, and improving the business environment. Efforts to improve productivity
and efficiency in these key sectors are already underway. In agriculture, the reforms include
investment in farm-to-market roads; encouraging private sector involvement; building
agricultural credit markets; and enhancing the security of land tenure, which would help to
boost agricultural productivity. Also, promoting tourism as part of its export diversification
strategy is a priority. To this end, construction of a number of hotels and other infrastructure
facilities are ongoing to make Ethiopia one of the top ten tourist destination in Africa by the
year 2020.
12.
The authorities are also committed to the development of the banking system, and
efforts to introduce more competition and financial deepening are underway. It should be
inspiring to note that the country that was served by one national bank is currently boasting
the operation of 10 commercial banks across the country. Efforts are aimed at encouraging a
diversified array of financial products and services, and extend them to the rural areas. It is
important to underscore that the authorities are not against foreign banks entry but believe
that the gradual and systematic process in banking reform is necessary and, therefore,
measures already taken should be given sufficient time to take effect.
13.
The authorities recognize the important role of private sector development to
complement public investment as a way to expand the capacity of the economy. In this
regard, efforts to speed up private sector development in general and private investment in
particular are underway. To this end, a number of incentive packages have been implemented

4
under Regulation No. 84/2003 to encourage and promote both domestic and foreign
investors. These incentives include income tax holidays, exemption from taxes on remittance
of capital, loss carry forward, and customs duty exemptions.
Conclusion
14.
The authorities recognize the challenges of macroeconomic management, and remain
committed to taking appropriate measures to address the current imbalances. In this regard,
they will remain engaged with the Fund, and would appreciate the Fund’s catalytic role in
providing the needed signals for development partners’ support of their efforts to achieve
macroeconomic stability, sustain growth, reduce poverty, and achieve the Millennium
Development Goals
