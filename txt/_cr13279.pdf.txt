STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 12, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context: Cameroon’s macroeconomic performance, outlook, and risks have not
changed fundamentally since the Article IV consultation in 2012. Economic activity has
continued to recover gradually from the 2009 slump, and inflation has remained
subdued. However, fiscal policy buffers have shrunk, as reflected by moderately rising
public debt and depleted government deposits. Further accumulation of domestic
arrears, stemming from sizable fuel subsidies, and weak public financial management are
risks for medium-term macroeconomic stability. Absent a protracted global slowdown,
economic growth is projected to increase progressively to 5½ percent a year in 2018.
However, growth would need to be sustained at a much higher pace for Cameroon to
achieve its ambition of becoming an emerging market economy by 2035.
Focus of the consultation and risks: The overarching policy issue is how to spur
reform momentum to set Cameroon on a higher growth path, while mitigating low but
growing risks to macroeconomic stability. The main exogenous risk is a protracted slump
in the euro area, whose impact would be low, with temporary effects. Endogenous risks
dominate and stem from rising fuel subsidies, contingent liabilities arising from
distressed banks and public enterprises, slow progress in raising non-oil revenue,
escalating nonconcessional financing, and widespread unemployment.”
Key policy recommendations: In light of growing vulnerabilities, there is urgency in
implementing the following policies:
 Reprioritize public spending to help close the financing gap in 2013, and adopt a
path for the non-oil primary deficit to rebuild fiscal space, preserve medium-term
macroeconomic stability, and support external adjustment.
 Adopt a plan to reduce fuel subsidies gradually, accompanied by targeted social
programs for the neediest, to free up resources for public investment.
 Strengthen public financial management through improved cash management and
expenditure commitment control to prevent further accumulation of arrears.
 Promote higher and more inclusive growth through a better business climate and
strengthened capacity to manage a large public investment program.
 Accelerate resolution of distressed banks and enhance the regulatory framework to
promote lending.

ECONOMIC STASIS
Macroeconomic performance improved in 2012, but it masks persistent vulnerabilities. Growth was
again robust, yet insufficient to improve per capita income significantly. The enabling environment for
private sector-led growth is slow to materialize, and growth dividends and productivity gains expected
from large infrastructure projects are delayed. The recorded lower fiscal deficit is a step in the right
direction, but fiscal reserves have been depleted. Untargeted fuel subsidies undermine pro-poor
spending, and domestic arrears accumulation and an increase in nonconcessional external financing
may compromise desirable fiscal space going forward.

arrangement is classified as
conventional peg; Figure 1). However, per capita real GDP and most social indicators have
stagnated, despite an abundant and diversified natural resource base (Text Table 1; Figure 2). Private
sector development has been constrained by insufficient electricity supply, inadequate public
infrastructure, an unpropitious business climate, poor public financial management (PFM), a shallow
financial sector, and weak regional economic integration, even within the Central African Economic
and Monetary Community (CEMAC). High subsidies, arrears accumulation, and increasingly
nonconcessional financing fuel macroeconomic vulnerabilities.
2.
Policy inertia has continued in a context of multiple elections. A first-time Senate was
inaugurated in May 2013, but a date has yet to be set for legislative and municipal elections, which
have been postponed since mid-2012. This environment has resulted in policy inertia,
notwithstanding major challenges confronting the country, e.g., widespread poverty, youth
unemployment, and disparities in wealth distribution. Policy inertia is contributing to vulnerabilities
and is a source of potential macroeconomic instability. Past IMF advice has had mixed traction
because of the political sensitivities involved in the implementation of some recommendations and
the authorities’ inclination for a slower pace of reforms (Box 1).

IMF Advice

Response

Address the risks to the 2012
budget through tight cash
management, reduction of fuel
subsidies, and expenditure
reprioritization.

Cash management was constrained
by past payment obligations, fuel
subsidies increased, and no notable
reprioritization of public expenditure
was undertaken.

Improve non-oil revenue by
broadening the tax base,
streamlining exemptions, and
increasing the efficiency of tax
and customs administrations.

Measures to strengthen tax and
customs administrations are being
implemented, taking into account
recommendations from IMF technical
assistance.

Implement measures to prevent
new domestic arrears.

Progress has been made in reducing
the stock of audited arrears, and the
2013 budget includes an allocation
for further reduction. However, new
arrears were accumulated.

Rebuild fiscal buffers, strengthen
the budget execution process,
and accelerate efforts to
operationalize the medium-term
expenditure framework.

Usable deposits were depleted, and
capital budget execution was
constrained by the transition to new
procurement processes. Conversely,
budget programming was launched, a
first in CEMAC.

Financial sector

Monitor banking sector
soundness, in collaboration with
the regional bank supervisor,
press ahead with bank
restructuring plans, and
promote the reform of the bank
resolution framework.

Restructuring plans for four small
distressed banks have progressed,
but no significant advance has been
made in the reform of the regional
supervisory, regulatory, and bank
resolution frameworks.

Structural reforms

Improve the business climate by
tackling governance issues,
deepening dialogue with the
private sector, and increasing
financial intermediation.

A law providing generous tax
incentives for a potentially large array
of investments was adopted in 2013,
without consulting the IMF or the
World Bank. The central bank will
soon launch three databases to
facilitate credit extension.

Economic recovery consolidated in 2012. Growth picked up marginally in 2012, helped by
a turnaround in oil production (Tables 1–5 and 8–9). Real GDP is estimated to have grown by
4.4 percent (up from 4.1 percent in 2011; Figure 3). The rise in oil production was partially offset by
stagnating electricity supply and a slowdown in the construction and public work sector, in part
owing to the transition to new public procurement processes (Text Table 2). Average inflation
moderated to 2.4 percent (from 2.9 percent in 2011), notwithstanding a 3.1 percent effective
depreciation of the CFA franc, pegged to the euro.

The overall fiscal deficit, on a cash basis, contracted. Revenue exceeded budget
projections by 1.2 percentage points of GDP, mainly because of higher-than-budgeted oil revenue,
while expenditure was broadly in line with budget appropriations. An overrun of 0.5 percentage
point of GDP on subsidies and transfers was offset with lower-than-budgeted capital execution. The
recorded budget deficit amounted to 2.0 percent of GDP (3.6 percent in 2011). It was financed by
external borrowing (half of which came from emerging creditors) and a further drawdown of
government deposits at the regional central bank (BEAC) that fell to the equivalent of 0.2 month of
expenditure.
5.
However, the stock of government arrears and other payment obligations further
increased, mainly on account of rising fuel subsidies. The government did settle all outstanding
arrears at end-2011 toward the national refinery (SONARA) in 2012 through cash payments,
cancellation of taxes owed, and securitization. However, the continued freeze of retail fuel prices at
their 2008 level resulted in new, accrued fuel subsidies, representing 3.4 percent of GDP in 2012.
Because of insufficient budget appropriations, these subsidies could be settled only partly. Part of
the balance was settled through securitization and tax cancellation, and the rest constituted new
arrears. The government also settled a large amount of previous years’ unsettled payment orders,
but also accumulated new ones. As a result, the total stock of the government’s arrears and other
payment obligations increased from 3.9 percent of GDP at end-2011 to 4.7 percent of GDP at
end-2012 (Tables 6 and 7, Figure 4, Appendix I).

Growth in recent years has had no significant impact on poverty, but it has been
relatively inclusive. Overall income poverty has remained virtually unchanged (40.2 percent in 2001
and 39.9 percent in 2007), but its composition has changed—it has decreased by 5.7 percent in
urban areas, but increased by 2.9 percent in rural ones. During this period of low per capita growth
(0.6 percent per annum), per capita consumption (a proxy for income) has increased by 0.8 percent
per annum for all Cameroonians, and by 1 percent for the poorest quartile, thus pointing to
somewhat increased inclusiveness. However, inequality remains high: the country-wide Gini
coefficient is 0.39. Past policies have had a limited pro-poor focus. A Public Expenditure Review1 by
the World Bank indicated that allocations to social sectors had been losing ground to general state
functions since 2005. Reforms of the business environment have not caused enterprises to leave the
informal sector, which accounts for 90 percent of economic activity, but does not contribute to tax
revenue, escapes regulatory requirements, and does not provide social protection to its workers.
7.
The public enterprise sector has had a lackluster performance. It comprises about
125 enterprises (21 wholly publicly owned, 46 partially publicly owned, and 58 government
administrative agencies in education, health, etc.) The authorities have been carrying out public
enterprise reform to reduce the burden on the budget and improve performance, but progress has
been slow.
8.
Data provision to the IMF is broadly adequate for surveillance, but important gaps
remain in fiscal, external, and financial sector information because of lack of capacity.
Government financial operations on a commitment basis are not available. The quality and
timeliness of balance of payments statistics, particularly the capital and financial accounts, need to
be improved. Monetary data availability is untimely, and information on bank lending and deposit

rates is lacking. The authorities’ strategy for improving statistics with donor assistance led to the
publication of the first quarterly national accounts in 2012.

BALANCED OUTLOOK WITH MODERATE RISKS
The medium-term outlook for Cameroon is predicated on a continuation of the authorities’ current
policies, focusing on the implementation of a number of large public investment projects, pursuing a
fiscal path with large financing gaps, and proceeding with ongoing administrative reforms. These
policies are expected to deliver somewhat higher real GDP growth, but do not address, as forcefully as
needed, still low but growing risks to macroeconomic stability. A possible reform scenario was discussed
with the authorities (see below).

9.
Economic growth is projected to increase gradually over the medium term under
current policies (Figure 5). Staff projects real GDP growth to increase from 4.4 percent in 2012 to
5.5 percent in 2018. These projections are predicated on cautious expectations about the pace of
execution of large infrastructure and power supply projects (Figure 6) and the associated private
sector response. The hydrocarbon sector is expected to boost growth, because ongoing investments
in oil and natural gas production by the National Hydrocarbons Company (SNH) and private
companies are coming onstream. Growth is to be also supported by ongoing efforts to boost
agricultural productivity and measures to improve the business environment. The authorities are
expecting higher medium-term growth—over 6 percent on average.
10.
Inflation is projected to remain below the 3 percent regional convergence criterion. It
is dependent on the prices of foodstuffs, which tend to exhibit larger upward adjustments because
the shallowness of markets. Inflation is projected to exceed inflation in the main trading partners
(e.g., the euro area) slightly. This should not hamper external competitiveness much in the near
term, but may have policy implications over time. This projection is also based on a continued freeze
in fuel prices.
11.
The external current account deficit is projected to stabilize at around 4 percent of
GDP in the medium term. The continued rebound in oil exports is projected to be accompanied by
higher non-oil exports, whose competitiveness should benefit gradually from the forthcoming
alleviation of the infrastructure and energy gaps. The stronger export performance is expected to
offset the projected increase in imports. The external current account deficit is expected be financed
mainly by new external borrowing, as well as by foreign direct investment.
12.
The medium-term fiscal outlook is turning negative. The overall fiscal deficit in terms of
GDP is expected to widen in 2014–18 because of declining revenue, owing to softer international oil
prices, and higher capital expenditure, associated with large infrastructure projects. Although non-oil
revenue to non-oil GDP is projected to rise by about a ½ percentage point, as a result of ongoing
improvement efforts in tax and customs administrations, this increase will not be sufficient to offset
the decline in oil revenue. The implementation of the large infrastructure projects will require a
further increase in capital expenditure, which is projected to reach 7¼ percent of GDP by 2018.

13.
Medium-term macroeconomic stability could be threatened by still low but growing
risks (Risk Matrix). Cameroon’s outlook could be adversely affected by exogenous risks, of which the
most important is a protracted global slump, especially in the euro area. Endogenous risks include
(i) rising fuel subsidies; (ii) contingent liabilities arising from distressed banks and public enterprises;
(iii) slow progress in raising non-oil revenue; (iv) escalating nonconcessional financing, (v) excessive
credit concentration jeopardizing the banking system and the real sector; (vi) delays in the
implementation of the public investment program; and (vii) widespread unemployment.
14.
The risk of debt distress remains low, despite a steady rise in the debt burden. The joint
World Bank-IMF debt sustainability analysis (DSA; companion paper) suggests that all external debt
ratios would remain below their respective policy-dependent thresholds, including under standard
stress tests, provided the prevalence of nonconcessional debt observed during the last few years is
reined in, and borrowed resources are used to finance projects with a sufficient growth payoff.2
However, the debt burden is likely to rise significantly—taking into account borrowing needed to
finance projected budget deficits and the recent trend toward nonconcessional borrowing.

POLICY DISCUSSION: UNLEASHING HIGH GROWTH
POTENTIAL
The overarching economic challenge is to set Cameroon on a higher, sustainable, and more
inclusive growth path within a stable macroeconomic environment. Cameroon’s ambition to
become an emerging market economy by 2035 is unlikely to be achieved without an acceleration

of growth, which requires addressing risks, increasing the efficiency of public spending, and
suppressing bottlenecks to boost private sector response.

A. Containing Risks to the 2013 Budget
15.
The authorities’ 2013 budget is set to expand. It is predicated on an annual growth rate
of 6 percent and projects a slightly larger deficit than in the previous year’s budget. Revenue is
projected to increase by about ½ percentage point of GDP on account of tax and customs
administrations reforms. This is to be offset by a larger increase in capital expenditure. The overall
budget deficit (2½ percent of GDP) is expected to be fully financed by net external borrowing and a
net security issue on the regional market in comparable proportions.
16.
The budget is likely to come under stress. Staff projects a deficit twice as large as
projected in the budget, resulting in a financing gap of 3¾ percent of GDP because of recurrent
stress factors:


In the absence of significant policy change, revenue is projected more conservatively by staff to
remain broadly stable relative to the 2012 outturn.3



As in previous years, the budget incorporates only about half of the expected cost of fuel
subsidies, as estimated by the Hydrocarbon Price Stabilization Fund (CSPH).



There is no provision in the budget for the payment of outstanding obligations to SONARA and
other fuel importers at end-2012 (2 percent of 2013 GDP).



Staff thinks that the likely amount of the security issue will be only 40 percent of the amount
targeted in the budget.

17.
The staff encouraged the authorities to contain the 2013 budget deficit and close the
projected financing gap. To reduce the financing need and prevent further accumulation of
domestic arrears, staff advised to take the following short-term measures (i) reduce excessive tax
exemptions; (ii) reprioritize public expenditure and eliminate non-essential expenditure
(e.g., subsidies); (iii) start phasing out fuel subsidies; and (iv) start preparing a contingency plan in
case the security issue proves unlikely to be completed. Staff encouraged the authorities to
transcribe these changes into a revised budget law to be submitted to parliament as soon as
possible.

3

Tables 2 and 3 report revenue for 2011–12 on a net basis (i.e., after cancellation of mutual claims between the
government and SONARA), but they show revenue projected from 2013 onward on a gross basis (i.e., without
cancellation), consistent with IMF recommendations. In 2012, the cross-cancellation amounted to about 1 percentage
point of GDP.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CAMEROON

Authorities’ views
18.
The authorities downplayed staff’s concerns about budget risks. They conceded that
fuel subsidies were likely to exceed their appropriation again this year. They thought, however, that
the shortfall would be addressed by the usual mix of cross-cancellation of mutual debts,
securitization, and payment deferrals. They also did not share staff’s concerns about the possibility
of lower-than-planned security issue. They noted that the issue was meant to finance infrastructure
projects and therefore a lower issue would be compensated by lower capital expenditure.

B. Mitigating Risks to Medium-Term Fiscal Sustainability
19.
Under the baseline scenario, further financing gaps could threaten medium-term fiscal
sustainability. The medium-term baseline projections assume a small improvement in non-oil
revenue mobilization, a continued freeze in retail fuel prices, and execution of the government’s
growing investment program. On this basis, the non-oil primary deficit (NOPD) is projected to
remain at about 9 percent of non-oil GDP in the medium term, and annual financing gaps of about
2¾ percent of GDP would persist, leading to a significant increase in the public-debt-to-GDP ratio,
which would rise from 16 percent at end-2012 to 34 percent at end-2018.
20.
Staff made the following recommendations on structural measures to buttress
medium-term fiscal sustainability:


Strengthen revenue mobilization through improved tax collection capacity and a widening of
the tax base, because marginal tax rates are already high. To increase non-oil revenue, reforms
need to be accelerated to simplify and modernize complex tax procedures,4 strengthen human
resources of tax and customs administrations, improve tax centers’ information technology
systems, and widen the list of tax payers, through the creation of additional tax centers and
regional surveys.



Gradually phase out fuel subsidies and eliminate arrears to SONARA through a combination of
cash transfers and securitization. As a first step, streamline the fuel price formula and replace
SONARA’s markup in the price structure with direct budget transfers to improve budget
transparency, as recommended by FAD technical assistance. These changes may be done
without affecting pump prices. A gradual pump price adjustment mechanism, including some
smoothing feature to dampen volatility, should then be adopted as soon as possible, to ensure
full cost recovery over time. The price of kerosene, mostly used by the most vulnerable
segments of the population, would not need to be adjusted initially. These measures would
need to be accompanied by appropriate communication and the development of well-targeted
programs to limit their impact on the neediest groups.

The 2013 World Bank Doing Business Indicators ranked Cameroon among the worst 10 performers of 185 countries
in terms of the processes related to “paying taxes.”

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

CAMEROON



Curb transfers to public enterprises while improving their supervision and fostering greater
efficiency. The authorities should complete pending reforms, in particular for
telecommunications, postal service, and air transport, to reduce subsidies and to improve the
quality of service. Staff recommended strengthening the monitoring of public enterprises’
contingent liabilities through a comprehensive database on public enterprise debt.



Adopt a path for the NOPD as a fiscal anchor to preserve fiscal sustainability, taking public
investment needs for infrastructure into account. Staff analysis indicates that an NOPD below
6 percent of non-oil GDP would be consistent with maintaining a low risk of debt distress.5



Issue regional securities in amounts and at a pace consistent with market absorptive capacity
and regional financial sector stability. Such issues will need to be restricted to projects with a
high growth payoff.



Rebuild the government’s cash deposits to at least the equivalent of one month of public
expenditure to be able to respond to spending contingencies.



Avoid the reemergence of debt vulnerabilities by (i) contracting new external loans on as
concessional terms as possible, including through open competition among potential creditors;
(ii) limiting nonconcessional external financing to worthy projects; (iii) enhancing the oversight
power and capacity of the national public debt committee; (iv) entrusting the power to contract
public debt only to the Minister of Finance; (v) evaluating and monitoring contingent liabilities
of public enterprises; and (vi) conducting periodic audits of all outstanding payment obligations.

Authorities’ views
21.
The authorities acknowledged the need to rebuild fiscal buffers and ensure fiscal
sustainability over the medium term. They reiterated their commitment to improve
non-oil revenue mobilization, as reflected in the revisions made to their reform plans for tax and
customs administrations, in line with the recommendations of recent FAD technical assistance. The
authorities, however, did not see merit in following a tighter NOPD rule given the large public
infrastructure gap. They recognized that rising fuel subsidies were unsustainable, and should be
reined in through efficiency gains at SONARA and gradual adjustments in pump prices. They agreed
that these reforms needed to be well prepared and accompanied by appropriate mitigating
measures to build consensus, limit inflationary impact, and preserve social peace. They would not
specify a timeline for these reforms though, especially in the run-up to elections.

5

The NOPD is an indicator of fiscal sustainability when applying the Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH) fiscal rule,
which stipulates that earnings from oil are saved during the years of high production, and drawn down as oil
production falters in the outer years, to smooth public spending. For further discussion of the NOPD as a fiscal
anchor, see Appendix III on public investment and fiscal sustainability in the 2012 Article IV Consultation staff report
(IMF Country Report No.12/237).

C. Strengthening Public Financial Management
22.

The authorities have embarked upon an ambitious PFM modernization plan.



They identified the main reforms needed for the gradual introduction of the six PFM directives
adopted by the CEMAC in December 2011 into Cameroon’s legal framework.6 Among the plan’s
priorities are the adoption of GFSM2001 standards and the strengthening of external controls
and parliamentary oversight.



The authorities have initiated program budgeting with the 2013 budget. However, some
transitional technical difficulties arose in adapting budget and accounting information systems
to programmatic classifications and multiyear spending authorizations.

23.
The government’s development strategy critically hinges on the efficiency and
effectiveness of the public investment program. This program requires a strengthened PFM
framework to avoid misuse of, and improve returns on, investment spending. Some progress was
made in recent years in increasing the transparency of procurement, but significant governance
concerns remain. To address this issue, a ministry of public procurement was established last year,
but it is too early to determine whether it has improved the governance of procurement. In addition,
the quality of capital expenditure remains impaired by weak project appraisal and evaluation
capacity, and accumulation of payment obligations to private contractors.
24.

Staff recommended the following measures to strengthen PFM over the medium term:



Address the issue of domestic arrears by (i) clearing all arrears to SONARA to avoid serious
implications for the banking system; (ii) completing a comprehensive audit of government
payment obligations; (iii) updating a multiyear plan to settle validated arrears; (iv) limiting the
level of unsettled payment orders (UPOs) by strengthening forecasting and cash management;
and (v) budgeting the full cost of fuel subsidies in future budgets.



Improve fiscal reporting and budget transparency by (i) moving toward a single treasury account
rule and avoiding spending commitments outside normal budget procedures; (ii) projecting and
reporting taxes and subsidies on a gross basis, instead of relying on ad hoc cross-cancellations;
(iii) preparing monthly fiscal data on a commitment basis along with improving the financial
information management system to track the flow of funds through the four stages of the
expenditure chain; and (iv) reconciling differences in reporting oil sector revenue between the
budget and the SNH.



Build capacity for investment planning, evaluation, and execution, because adequate appraisal
and management capacity are a prerequisite for efficient infrastructure investment.

6

The CEMAC directives focus on the budget law and the medium-term fiscal framework: government accounting;
payroll management; implementation of GFSM2001; metadata related to the budget system; value-added tax law;
and transparency and governance code.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

CAMEROON

Authorities’ views
25.
The authorities noted that improving PFM was a complex reform process that would
have to be sustained over several years. They indicated that the technical difficulties encountered
when initiating budget programming were being worked out, and emphasized that this important
reform was all the more challenging because it required a fundamental change in administrative
culture. They were hopeful that this reform would lead to stronger PFM in the years to come.

D. Promoting Sound Financial Intermediation
26.
Conditions in the banking sector have somewhat improved, but the situation varies
across banks (Appendix II). Capital adequacy has improved somewhat across the banking system,
but remains weak in problem banks. Aggregate numbers hide a wide disparity in prudential ratios.7
Prudential indicators are improving, albeit slowly, at a larger troubled bank and a long-overdue
restructuring plan for a medium-size regional bank is coming closer to implementation. However,
three other small banks still show negative equity. The rest of the banking system is sound, but
vulnerable to a concentration on a few sectors and corporations. In addition, persistent government
arrears to SONARA translate into a substantial credit risk for the banking sector. In parallel, the
authorities are in the process of creating a new specialized bank to assist small and medium-size
enterprises.
27.
The staff urged the authorities to take swift action to resolve financial problems at the
troubled banks. In one case, this involves a recapitalization from public funds and the creation of a
separate entity that would take on impaired assets. Going forward, staff recommended that the
government recover as much as possible of the bad assets and seek private investors for taking over
the recapitalized bank. The other three non-systemic banks require prompt resolution or liquidation
to protect depositors. The government should avoid increasing public deposits at troubled banks.
The staff agreed with the regional bank regulator (COBAC) that it will be of paramount importance
to provide close supervision (i) to the newly created public bank to avoid possible contingent
liabilities, as has been the case in the past; and (ii) to large microfinance institutions, whose activities
are expanding.
28.
Further institutional reforms are necessary to improve the legal framework of credit.
The launching in June 2013 of three databases on payment incidents, and financial statements from
non-financial enterprises and microfinance institutions will help assess the creditworthiness of
potential creditors and encourage lending. Nonetheless, further reforms are needed, including
(i) improving procedures for recording and enforcing guarantees; (ii) improving the operations of
land and commercial registries; and (iii) strengthening creditor rights enforcement by enhancing the
effectiveness of the courts.

7

Four banks presented negative equity at end-March 2013. Their combined assets represented about 8 percent of
the assets of the banking system.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CAMEROON

29.
Staff encouraged the authorities to engage other CEMAC member states in
strengthening the regional bank crisis prevention and resolution framework. Staff stressed the
need for a new regional regulation on crisis resolution, whose preparation could benefit from IMF
technical assistance. This regulation should (i) allow the authorities to intervene early in bank
resolution; (ii) define clearly the responsibilities of regional and national bodies and the scope of
judicial review; and (iii) prevent shareholders of insolvent banks from participating in restructurings.
The recruitment underway at COBAC needs to be completed to allow COBAC to monitor the
increasing number of financial institutions and to boost the frequency and intensity of its
inspections.
Authorities’ views
30.
The authorities recognized that the concentration of bank credit was a source of
vulnerability. Liquidity problems at large common borrowers—typically SONARA and other stateowned enterprises—partly because of delays in the government settling its obligations, could
jeopardize the health of the banking system. In their view, a solution to this issue resides in better
PFM.
31.
The authorities committed to limiting the risks linked to the new bank. They opined
that the bank aimed at helping fill a void in financing worthwhile small and medium-size enterprises.
The bank would rely on long-term resources, including its paid-in capital of US$20 million, to grant
guarantees to bank credit, purchase equity participation, and provide direct loans.

E. Fostering Higher Growth
32.
Estimates do not point to a substantial real effective exchange rate (REER)
overvaluation (Appendix III). The REER depreciated by 3.7 percent in 2010–12, in line with the
depreciation of the euro. This depreciation did not, however, offset the cumulative appreciation of
the REER in 1994–2009 (24 percent). Model-based estimates suggest a possible overvaluation of
Cameroon’s REER between 5½ percent and 16 percent at end-2012. This estimate is consistent with
the finding of the last Article IV consultation with the CEMAC, which suggests an overvaluation of
about 11 percent.
33.
The evolution of non-price indicators of external competitiveness has been mixed.
Cameroon’s ranking under the Global Competitiveness Index improved, but its ranking under the
World Bank’s “Doing Business” indicators deteriorated, with the most ground lost in access to credit,
investor protection, property registration, and tax payment procedures. Not surprisingly, foreign
direct investment has remained relatively low in non-oil sectors.
34.
The staff warned the authorities about the potential pitfalls of a new law aimed at
providing tax incentives to new investments. Provisions for tax incentives under this law are
general and discretionary, thereby creating a presumption that tax packages will be negotiated on a
case-by-case basis. Such practices could result in significant losses of tax revenue and undermine

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

CAMEROON

ongoing efforts to improve governance, while providing only limited results in terms of increased
investment.
35.
The staff encouraged the authorities to help foster greater regional economic
integration, especially among CEMAC member countries. In particular, harmonizing the rules of
products’ country of origin, and removing non-tariff barriers and administrative hurdles to travel
among CEMAC countries could contribute to developing intraregional trade.8
Authorities’ views
36.
The authorities felt confident that Cameroon’s competitiveness would greatly benefit
from the completion of large public investment projects. They stressed that financing for most
of these projects has already been mobilized or was under negotiation with external creditors. The
planned security issue in 2013 and beyond was also intended to finance these and future
infrastructure projects, which would then contribute to higher growth.
37.
The authorities concurred with the need to strengthen Cameroon’s external
competitiveness and remove obstacles to trade. They took note of the reservations expressed by
staff about the new investment incentive law, and welcomed comments on the law.9 However, they
noted that the private sector was keen on enacting the law to spur investment. The authorities
expressed their strong determination to meet the mid-August 2013 deadline for Cameroon to be
declared conforming by the Board of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Although
they saw greater regional integration as a desirable objective, the authorities noted the generally
difficult process of coming to agreements with other CEMAC partners.

F. Reform Scenario
38.

A moderate reform scenario was discussed with the authorities, building on the policy

advice reported above (Text Table 3, and Tables 10–12).10 The scenario’s main tenets are (i) an
acceleration of private sector-led growth through faster improvements in the business environment
and alleviation of infrastructure and energy bottlenecks; (ii) the creation of fiscal space through a
gradual fuel subsidy reform11 and a redirection of unproductive resources (e.g., subsidies to public
enterprises) toward investment; (iii) acceleration of PFM reforms, and improved tax and customs
administrations and project appraisal and execution; and (iv) improved financial sector
8

A planned reduction in the common external tariff is awaiting an economic impact study.

9

Comments were sent by FAD shortly after the mission. The thrust of FAD’s comments was to suggest limiting the

application of the law both in terms of the sectors it covers, and the tax incentives it provides.
10

No significant reform is likely before parliamentary elections due in 2013; it is thus assumed that reforms will start

in 2014.
11
The moderate reform scenario contemplates a price increase for gasoline of 20 percent and 10 percent over 2014
and 2015, respectively; and a price increase for diesel of 15 percent and 5 percent over 2014 and 2015, respectively.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

intermediation and access to credit. The scenario assumes gradual adjustment of gasoline and diesel
pump prices to international oil prices (as illustrated in Scenario A, Appendix I), the intensification of
public enterprise reform to improve efficiency, and the acceleration of tax reforms to modernize
complex procedures and reduce the burden on small and medium-size enterprises.

Relative to the baseline, this scenario would lead to an increase in sustainable growth
by close to 1 percentage point at the end of the projection period. The resulting budget savings
and improvement in the business environment would help redirect spending toward investment and
generate higher growth over the medium term, notably, because of the private sector’s response to
the coming onstream of infrastructure projects in a more conducive environment. This better
outcome is consistent with macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability. Inflation would be
somewhat higher, reflecting the gradual upward adjustment of domestic fuel prices. Fiscal balances
would be preserved: non-oil revenue could be expected to increase by about ½ percentage point
during the projection period, supported by accelerated implementation of tax administration
reforms aimed at widening the tax base and streamlining tax payments. These reforms would also
be expected to produce improvements in the business climate. The tighter fiscal path and structural
reforms to boost competitiveness will help underpin external sustainability. Finally, financial sector
intermediation would be spurred by a rapid and orderly resolution of distressed banks and more
effective bank supervision.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

CAMEROON

Authorities’ views
40.
The authorities endorsed the higher growth objective and indicated that, in their view, their
current policy mix would yield those results. In particular, they thought that the large infrastructure
projects’ contribution to growth would materialize earlier than envisaged by staff.

STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
Moving toward emerging market economy status by 2035 will require a substantial
increase in trend growth. The authorities’ higher growth strategy rightly focuses on addressing
Cameroon’s substantial infrastructure gap, but its success will hinge on the efficiency of public
investment and the strength of the private sector’s response. Staff therefore urges the authorities to
intensify their efforts to address weaknesses in project selection and execution, and to allocate
appropriate resources for infrastructure maintenance. Single-source procurement for large projects
will need to be curtailed or given special scrutiny.
42.
Greater improvements in the business environment will be essential to boost the
private sector’s response. The payment of taxes and the granting of permits should therefore be
made less burdensome, and ongoing anti-corruption efforts should be strengthened. The
authorities should also strive to foster financial intermediation and facilitate cross-border trade.
Cameroon may want to take the lead in reviving stalled regional integration talks within CEMAC,
which would support diversification and productivity growth in Cameroon’s non-oil sector. A recent
law aimed at fostering private investment, through the provision of overly generous tax incentives,
may well fall short of its objectives, while potentially undermining revenue collection.
43.
Substantial risks to the 2013 budget need to be addressed without delay to avoid a
further accumulation of domestic arrears that undermine fiscal sustainability. The fiscal
outcome stabilized in 2012, but masked growing vulnerabilities. Fuel subsidies remained high, as
international prices and domestic demand remained buoyant. The underbudgeting of fuel subsidies
in the 2013 budget continues to threaten orderly budget execution and fiscal stability, as do overly
ambitious plans for a regional securities issue. Contingent liabilities, arising from distressed banks
and public enterprises, pose an additional risk.
44.
Increasing fiscal space over the medium term will require a combination of improved
revenue collection, expenditure reallocations, and judicious financing choices. To limit revenue
volatility, non-oil revenue will need to grow, aided by the large taxpayer unit and a broadening of
the tax base. Resource availability for the scaling up of public investment will also require
eliminating fuel subsidies through a gradual relaxation of price controls and curbing subsidies and
transfers to public enterprises.
45.
PFM needs strengthening to become the backbone of effective and efficient public
spending. The authorities are encouraged to validate arrears and adopt a plan for settling them.
The shift toward program budgeting is a promising step for strengthening PFM, but initial

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CAMEROON

information technology issues need to be addressed. The authorities’ modernization plan for PFM is
welcome, and should go hand in hand with the adoption of CEMAC PFM directives.
46.
Cameroon’s risk of debt distress remains low, but debt indicators have deteriorated
since last year. The deterioration resulted from the impact of domestic arrears on domestic debt,
and the ramping up of external borrowing at nonconcessional terms. Going forward, the baseline
scenario projects a doubling of the debt-to-GDP ratio within the next five years. This warrants close
scrutiny and changes in external debt policy. In particular, external financing choices will need to
reflect a judicious strategy predicated on medium-term debt sustainability.
47.
Effective financial intermediation is necessary to buttress the authorities’ growth
vision. Risks to financial sector stability have abated, but need to be addressed conclusively. The
number of distressed banks has been reduced from five to four, and none appears to pose a
systemic risk. Nonetheless, their situations need to be resolved decisively without overly
compromising public resources. Decisive action on this front will also contribute to allaying
persistent governance concerns. The authorities and the regional bank regulator will need to focus
on the concentration of bank credit to SONARA, and the launch of a new public bank for small and
medium-size enterprises, to avoid the emergence of contingent liabilities. Other reforms will have to
include more frequent supervision, tighter lending standards, and seamless cooperation between
national and supranational regulatory bodies.
48.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation take place on the 12-month
consultation cycle.

1

Figures for 2011 and 2012 exclude customs and VAT taxes due by SONARA that were the objects of cross-cancellations against fuel subsidies due
to SONARA (i.e., the revenue is presented on a net basis). From 2013 onward, projections for these taxes are made on a gross basis. Taxes owed by
SONARA are projected at CFAF 145 billion in 2013.
2

Figures for 2011 and 2012 include securitization of fuel subsidies due to SONARA.

3

The figure for 2012 includes securitization of arrears owed to SONARA. The figure for 2013 includes CFAF 120.3 billion owed to private companies
who imported fuel products for the government in 2012. It is assumed that CFAF 56 billion of the CFAF 120.3 billion was paid in 2012.

Figures for 2011 and 2012 exclude customs and VAT taxes due by SONARA that were the objects of cross-cancellations against fuel subsidies due to
SONARA (i.e., the revenue is presented on a net basis). From 2013 onward, projections for these taxes are made on a gross basis. Taxes owed by
SONARA are projected at CFAF 145 billion in 2013.
2

Figures for 2011 and 2012 include securitization of fuel subsidies due to SONARA.

3

The figure for 2012 includes securitization of arrears owed to SONARA. The figure for 2013 includes CFAF 120.3 billion owed to private companies
who imported fuel products for the government in 2012. It is assumed that CFAF 56 billion of the CFAF 120.3 billion was paid in 2012.

Appendix I. Cameroon: Fuel Subsidies
A. Introduction
1.

Fuel subsidy reform has been a long-standing policy issue for advanced and

developing countries.1 Although the importance of the policy issue is acknowledged by
governments, progress in implementing reform has been hesitant. The difficulty lies mainly in
removing a visible and tangible benefit that is accessible to all purchasers of fuel without affecting
social stability.
2.

The sustained increase in the international price of crude oil and its distillates

since 2008 has revived discussions and analysis about fuel subsidy reform, with particular
emphasis on the lessons from reform implementation. The IMF Country Reports for the previous
two Article IV consultations with Cameroon already included sections devoted to the management
of fuel subsidies. In the past year, the IMF has expressed its views of principle on this issue in a
chapter in the Spring 2013 Regional Economic Outlook for Sub-Saharan Africa, and the 2013 paper
titled “Energy Subsidy Reform: Lessons and Implications.”
3.

The purpose of this note is to bring these lessons to bear on Cameroon’s situation, by:

(i) updating and expanding existing knowledge of fuel marketing arrangements in Cameroon;
(ii) analyzing the subsidy systems’ fiscal and macroeconomic implications in light of new
developments; and (iii) generating ideas to achieve full cost recovery for the marketing of fuel and
to spur momentum for reform of the pricing mechanism.

B. Overview of the Current System
4.

The structure of Cameroon’s petroleum distillates production, storage, and

distribution revolves around two independent entities: the National Refinery (SONARA), and
the Cameroon Petroleum Depot Company (SCDP). SONARA, which is more than 80 percent
state-owned, is the country's sole refinery, based in Limbé, and refines imported light crude oil from
Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea, and Angola. SCDP is a 51 percent state-owned firm, tasked with securing
the supply of petroleum products to Cameroon’s end-users. SCDP handles petroleum product
2

storage and distribution throughout the country, to and from its 12 depots, which together can

store 268,000 cubic meters of liquid fuels. SCDP purchases most of SONARA’s output, which is
3

shipped by the main domestic shipping company (Camship) to its main depot in Douala. SCDP also
4

procures additional refined products abroad to meet domestic demand. Distributers and retailers,

which together own the remaining 49 percent in SCDP, market the petroleum products secured by
SCDP. Distribution is done by trucks, except for the North, Extreme North, and Adamoua regions,
which are serviced by the main railways operator (Camrail).5

subsidizes transport to remote regions. It underwrites the losses of the operators in the sector,
which are in turn taken over by the state.
6.

The markups of operators in the sector are derived from a formula setting a notional

retail price that would reflect a full pass-through of costs to the end-consumer. The petroleum
product pricing formula comprises four components: (i) the international price for refined fuel
products; (ii) taxes; (iii) markups for domestic refining, transport, storage, distribution, and retail; and
(iv) in the event that actual retail prices are less than the sum of the first three components, a posttax subsidy (Table I.1). 6

Cameroon exports the bulk of its domestic heavy crude oil production, while SONARA exported only about

37 percent of its refined products in 2009.

The “post-tax subsidy” is defined as the difference between the international price adjusted for transport and

distribution margins and taxes on the one hand, and the price paid by consumers on the other hand.

7.

The design of the pricing formula raises several issues. Among them are (i) the existence

of the SONARA markup, above and beyond the international price for refined products, that already
includes a profit margin for cost-effective refineries; (ii) the “cost plus” principle for calculating the
SONARA markup, which does not provide incentives for efficiency gains; and (iii) the relatively large
share of ad valorem taxes (including the SONARA markup), which exacerbates the volatility of the
national pump price and thus of the subsidies.

A positive sign implies a net subsidy from the state; a negative sign implies a profit for the fuel refinery.

8.

The inconsistent implementation of the pricing formula has compounded its design

issues. The state has delayed paying compensation to SONARA because of the magnitude of the
subsidy, compounded by the “cost plus” design of the formula.

C. Fiscal and Macroeconomic Implications of the Current System
9.

The fiscal implications of the current price controls are significant. Pre-tax subsidies

(i.e., the difference between post-tax subsidy and the overall tax take) turned positive in 2011. The
existence of pre-tax subsidies means that the state has become a net contributor to, rather than a
net beneficiary of, the fuel distribution sector. In effect, unlike in most countries, fuel distribution is a
net fiscal drain on public resources. Post-tax subsidies are significantly higher and have increased
from 0.2 percent of GDP in 2009 to 3.4 percent of GDP in 2012, as oil prices nearly doubled over that
period. They are expected to near 3.1 percent in 2013, mostly on account of the consumer subsidy
(86 percent of the total; Figures I.2 and I.3).

price is significantly lower. However, it is lower than in other countries in the subregion. Countries
that have made pump price adjustments, such as Burkina Faso, Guinea-Bissau, and Senegal, have
been better able to contain the level of the subsidy. In addition, more than in any other country in
the region, except Guinea Bissau, the increase in Cameroon’s post-tax fuel subsidies has been
exacerbated by the relative importance of procyclical ad valorem taxes (including the SONARA
markup), which, unlike the excise tax, increase with the price of oil. At end January 2011, ad valorem
taxes accounted for 21.9 percent of the notional pump price in Cameroon, versus 16.1 percent in
Senegal.7
11.

Cameroon’s fuel price structure points to hidden inefficiencies in its marketing

arrangements. Although Cameroon’s reference cost-insurance-freight (CIF) import price is among
the more competitive ones, “other costs” to market gasoline are high for a country that is not
landlocked (Table I.2.). In general, Cameroon’s CIF price compares unfavorably with that of other
countries in the region—in terms of cost recovery and containment of notional pump price volatility.

By comparison, in the European Union, the bulk of the tax levy on fuel price at the outset of the fuel increase in 2008

value-added tax (20 percent).

the policy of subsidizing fuel consumption has additional pernicious and profound effects on
economic development. Firms do not adjust their production processes to reflect the true cost of
energy, thus exacerbating the potential impact of a fuel price shock. Furthermore, in Cameroon,
SONARA’s financial difficulties affect the banking system, which may need to curtail credit to the
economy, thus directly undermining growth. Other negative externalities, such as environmental
degradation and climate change, are also significant. Figure I.5 shows the energy efficiency of
economic activity in various countries. Sub-Saharan African countries, which all have retail price
controls on fuel except South Africa, are intensive users of energy. Finally, fuel subsidies are also
impeding the government in carrying out its redistributive function: analyses have repeatedly shown
that energy subsidies benefit mostly the richer segments of the population.

High retail fuel price differentials with neighboring countries pose governance

difficulties for the region, as well as increased corruption and crime (Table I.3). Small-scale
contraband can soon give way to organized networks of smugglers, causing the state to subsidize
the consumption of foreigners on a large scale, while jeopardizing law and order in their own
country and in neighboring countries. This is particularly well illustrated in Benin, where it is
estimated that over 90 percent of gasoline is smuggled from Nigeria and sold illegally. For
Cameroon, the most significant risk stems from its proximity to Nigeria, with which it shares its
longest border, and where retail prices are less than half the price in Cameroon and where supply is
abundant.

D. Reform Options for Cameroon
14.

Attempts at reform in Cameroon and elsewhere point to the need for a comprehensive

reform strategy. The introduction of fuel pricing reforms involves large trade-offs between
different social and macroeconomic objectives. Recent work has highlighted key elements of a
successful reform strategy based on international experience.9


Undertake comprehensive research to assess the costs and benefits of the subsidy system to the
various stakeholders, and the macroeconomic impact of possible reforms.



Consult widely with society stakeholders; in Cameroon’s case, consultations should include
engagement with SONARA to assess its ability to achieve scale savings and commercial
sustainability in the international marketplace—and discuss the withdrawal of industry
protections.



Communicate clearly: reinitiate a wide program to broaden the policy debate on fuel
pricing—by mobilizing thought leaders (industry experts, journalists, policy advocates, etc.,) and
using far-reaching media (radio, TV, print press).

9

See “Energy Subsidy Reform: Lessons and Implications.”

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

43

CAMEROON



Decide early on important parameters of the reform initiative, such as the pace of price
adjustment; experience has shown that gradual reforms tend to be more successful as long as
the reform commitment is seen as irreversible.



Roll out accompanying mitigating measures to provide offsets to stakeholders who are
adversely affected by the reforms, with particular emphasis on vulnerable households.



Focus equally on efficiency improvements and price-setting reforms.



Map out the important steps and various aspects of the reforms: institutional arrangements,
legal requirements, etc.

15.

Reforms with an immediate impact should focus on efficiency gains rather than pump

prices. Preparatory work on reforms to allow for removal of the pre-tax subsidy, for prevention of
smuggling from neighboring countries, and for synchronization of energy policy within the region,
should be pursued nonetheless without delay. Near-term reform options to the pricing formula and
market structure to generate immediate efficiency gains need to focus on the following:


Simplify and make the price formula more transparent because it is too complex (e.g., fewer
components, simpler markups).



Remove the SONARA markup from the pump price structure (without adjusting retail prices
downward) and finance legitimate SONARA losses through direct budget transfers to ensure
budget transparency, as recommended in FAD technical assistance advice.



Determine a level of compensation for SONARA, if any, by specifying compensation based on
volume of throughput rather than its value; the level of compensation should decrease over
time, consistent with progressive efficiency gains and increasing scale.



Clear government arrears to SONARA with a mix of debt reduction, cash, and securitized
debt—to alleviate the risk posed by SONARA to the banking system.



Reassess/renegotiate cost and margin items in the price structure to increase efficiency in the
sector, based on international benchmarking and objective cost considerations specific to
Cameroon. For example, the cost of transport by truck can be benchmarked internationally,
whereas trucker’s margins should reflect the actual cost of fuel. Storage fees should reflect
economies of scale and Cameroon’s amortization rules.

44

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CAMEROON



Liberalize the market for refined fuel imports into Cameroon by introducing competitive tenders
for SCDP’s procurement of refined products. Remove barriers to imports of refined fuels, if any,
and review applicable import tariffs for refined fuels to limit market protection.

16.

Over the medium term, the magnitude and volatility of subsidies underpin the case for

price adjustments. The following reform options would increase the pass-through of the true costs
of fuel to the end-consumers, and dampen retail price volatility:


Reinitiate pump price adjustments on a regular basis, aiming at narrowing the gap between
current prices and notional pump prices. Although inflation will increase initially, international
experience points to temporary effects.10



Adopt a price-smoothing component to complement the existing price adjustment mechanism.
Smoothing could take the form of a moving average of the notional prices for a given number
of past review periods; bands defining a maximum percentage adjustment during any given
period; or a combination thereof (e.g., a moving average within bands).



Prepare policies explicitly designed to mitigate losses of end-consumers. Such policies are
crucial to entrenching the fuel pricing reform. They should include policies that over time
increase social transfers to the poor (e.g., school lunches, improved primary education,
appropriate social safety nets), taking into account the need to develop the capacity of line
ministries to design and implement well-targeted programs. The government should also
envisage launching policies that can be calibrated to provide a direct, tangible offset with the
additional cost of fuel—such as a cash transfers, or new electricity distribution (access to, and
quality of, electricity) in the most populous areas.



Consider increasing taxes, levies, and fees that discourage fuel consumption: road usage fees
(e.g., tolls), vehicle licensing fees in proportion to the size of the engine or the weight of the
vehicle, yearly registration fees, etc.

17.

In addition, the government would gain from considering broader structural reform

options:

10

The direct and indirect effects on inflation of the increase of all retail fuel prices in Burkina Faso by about 8 percent
in late March 2012 lasted for about three months, and contributed to less than 1 percentage point of inflation by the
end of the year. This finding is consistent with the low inflation rates in European countries with full international
price pass-through to end-consumers.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

45

CAMEROON



Seek out additional structural efficiency gains: review the logistics of fuel marketing (inland and
coastal depots capacity and costs, port capacity, processing efficiency, fees), rail transport (rail
network, rolling stock, fees), road transport (rolling stock and fees), technical standards (fuel
octane, safety rules, etc.)—seek recommendations for efficiency improvements in distribution
and storage, and security of supply (e.g., storage capacity in number of days of consumption).



Define an exit strategy from subsidizing SONARA. The strategy should include (i) an invitation to
SONARA’s private financial sponsors to consider plans to expand its production capacity and
make it competitive in the world market; and (ii) a divestiture by the state from its direct and
indirect stakes in SONARA to help remove the perceived implicit state guarantee on its debt.



Approach neighboring states to harmonize tax policy and price setting methods—discuss with
them the creation of an intergovernmental task force to track international commodity price
developments, harmonize taxes on fuel, and set domestic prices. Such an international
coordination mechanism would be useful to help stop cross-border contraband and achieve
genuine independence in determining prices from any one national political authority.

E. Price Adjustment Scenarios for Cameroon
18.

To illustrate fuel subsidy reform options and cost implications, three price scenarios

were estimated (Text Table I. 4). The scenarios are (i) a baseline scenario, corresponding to the
authorities’ current policy, under which fuel prices remain frozen; (ii) a moderate scenario
corresponding to the IMF staff report’s reform scenario, under which gasoline and diesel prices are
adjusted in 2014 and 2015, but do not reach full cost-recovery levels over the medium term; and (iii)
an “aggressive” scenario, under which gasoline and diesel prices reach cost-recovery levels by end2015 and end-2016, respectively—at which point the corresponding subsidies would be fully
eliminated. Under all three scenarios, kerosene and liquefied propane gas (LPG) bottle prices remain
fixed at their current levels—those are most consumed by the neediest segments of the
population—while gasoline and diesel prices are gradually adjusted from January 1, 2014, onward.
19.

Fuel subsidies under the two reform scenarios are estimated based on existing price

structures. They are estimated according to a partial equilibrium analysis based on (i) the latest
World Economic Outlook (WEO) Brent futures contract prices; (ii) unchanged price structure
components (such as the refinery margin); (iii) pump prices, which follow each scenario’s assumed

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CAMEROON

price increases; and iv) the assumption that fuel products’ consumption reacts to domestic price
increases according to respective price demand elasticities.11

The "Baseline Scenario" is equivalent to the staff report's baseline scenario, while "Scenario A" is equivalent to the staff report's
reform scenario.

A negative sign implies that domestic prices have already reached their cost-recovery levels, such that they start falling in
parallel with international prices.

20.

The reform scenarios illustrate different approaches to price adjustment. It is assumed

that price increases are initially larger for gasoline, which is consumed mostly by private vehicles
typically belonging to people in higher-income groups. Price increases for diesel are initially smaller,
and as noted, there is no price increase for kerosene. Compensatory measures, such as targeted
transfers to the most vulnerable segments of the population, could be funded from the associated
budgetary savings. Although the reform scenarios show an average annual fuel price increase for
illustrative purposes, monthly price adjustments could be envisaged using price smoothing rules to
avoid sharp increases in domestic prices, while generating the same average budget savings.
21.

The choice of a reform scenario depends on the trade-off between desired budgetary

savings and lesser impact on households. For example, while the fuel subsidy cost is at
2.6 percent of GDP in 2017 under the baseline (no reform) scenario, it sharply declines to 0.4 percent
of GDP under the aggressive scenario (Scenario B), with only subsidies on kerosene and LPG
remaining in place. The
11

Dahl (2012) estimates a range of values for price elasticities for diesel and gasoline between -0.11 and -0.38 based
on a review of 124 countries. An elasticity of -0.2 for diesel and gasoline is assumed for this estimation.

pace of price increases depends on the reform’s medium-term objectives. In general, it is best to
avoid sharp increases in pump prices to allow households and enterprises time to adjust.
22.

The impact on inflation of either reform scenario would be limited. Preliminary

calculations indicate that if gasoline and diesel prices are increased on a monthly basis by an equal
number of CFA francs, the impact on inflation of the more moderate “Scenario A” would be around
1.4 percentage points in 2014, and an additional 0.6 percentage point in 2015. In the more
aggressive “Scenario B,” the impact on inflation would be 2 percentage points and 0.8 percentage
point in 2014 and 2015, respectively. While these inflationary impacts may nudge the overall
inflation rate beyond the regional convergence criterion of 3 percent, they do not pose, by
themselves, a significant risk to macroeconomic stability.

Appendix II. Cameroon: Financial Sector Review
A. Profile of the Financial Sector
The Cameroonian financial system is dominated by foreign-owned commercial banks. The
banking system has grown, but remains small relative to GDP. By regional standards, the
microfinance sector is relatively large; microfinance institutions improve access to finance by
lower-income households and small and medium-size enterprises, but rapid growth has brought
governance and stability issues. The bond and stock markets remain a marginal source of
funding, even for the government.

The Banking Sector
1.

The Cameroonian financial system is dominated by foreign-owned commercial banks.1

Banks accounts for about 70 percent of total assets of the financial system. Of the 13 banks
operating in Cameroon, 10 are foreign-owned and accounted for 76 percent of total deposits at
end-2012 (Text Table II.1). French banks dominate with about 40 percent of total bank assets
(Figure II.1). The banking system is heterogeneous, segmented, and significantly concentrated.
Despite overall excess reserves, there is virtually no interbank market. In the absence of
collateralized instruments, banks generally refrain from lending to other banks in order to avoid
counterparty risk.

2.

The banking sector is geared toward large enterprises. It can be broadly characterized as

a lopsided business model, where 80 percent of bank credit goes to large enterprises and the
remaining 20 percent is allocated mostly to small and medium-size enterprises. Retail credit is
growing, but still marginal. Banks offers loans exclusively to retail clients who work in the formal
sector, domicile their wages with the bank, and whose employer is already a customer.2
3.

Mobile banking has started but is still embryonic (Box II.1). Money transfers through

mobile phones are limited. The cost of services is relatively competitive compared to some countries
in West Africa, but still significantly higher than in East Africa.

Microfinance Institutions
4.

The microfinance sector is large by regional standards. More than 450 microfinance

institutions (MFIs) were registered at end-2012. Cameroonian MFIs constitute about two-thirds of all
MFIs in CEMAC. The sector includes three types of MFIs: (i) quasi banks; (ii) saving clubs; and
(iii) microfinance nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). MFIs in the first category are the most
common ones; they are deposit takers and operate in bank-like fashion. MFIs are significantly
smaller than commercial banks; together their assets amount to about 15 percent of total banking
sector assets. MFIs are significant for providing access to financial services to the lower-income

The strategy is aimed at limiting credit risk in the absence of adequate information on retail borrowers.

50

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CAMEROON

segments of the population. Loans by MFIs amount to about 15 percent of total bank loan volume,
but reach about 50 percent of all financial services customers.
Box II.1. Cameroon: Mobile Banking
Mobile banking in Cameroon is still nascent. Given the
large size of the country, the dispersion of the population,
and the low penetration of formal banking services,
Cameroon would appear to be a good candidate for
widespread mobile banking—defined as banking
transactions carried out through mobile devices. This
industry, however, has not taken off yet in Cameroon. While
the number of mobile phone subscriptions is rising, it lags
the numbers found in comparable African countries, such as
Senegal or Kenya.

Mobile banking costs are more competitive than in West
Africa, but significantly more expensive than in East
Africa. The small number of customers explains, in part, the
overpricing compared to East Africa. At the low end of the
spectrum, for transfer amounts below US$5, Cameroonian
customers pay almost four times more than in Kenya; for
transfer amounts between US$5 and US$50, they still pay
1.5 times more; at the upper end, for transfers above
US$100, the cost in Cameroon rises steeply above the
comparable cost in Kenya. Competition within countries also
differs from region to region. While the fee structure of
Orange Kenya matches that of its competitor M-Pesa Kenya,
Orange Cameroon follows the Ivoirian business model,
rather than that of the other local operator, MTN Cameroon.

The microfinance sector is insufficiently supervised. The large number of MFIs raises

governance and profitability concerns, because the regional supervisor (COBAC) is not appropriately
staffed to monitor such a large number of institutions effectively. The situation of individual MFIs
varies greatly, in size and access to refinancing. A few of the larger MFIs are able to get refinancing
from commercial banks, but for most MFIs access to refinancing remains a major issue. The COBAC
has initiated electronic reporting from MFIs since 2010 and developed accounting norms to be
implemented by them. The National Directorate of the regional central bank (BEAC) is also
preparing to launch an on-line database of financial statements of MFIs in June 2013 that will help
improve transparency in the sector.

Libreville, Gabon.

B. Banking Sector Performance—An International Comparison
This section assesses the performance of the Cameroonian financial sector by benchmarking its
depth, breadth, and inclusiveness against peer countries in the region, in Africa, and within the
same income group.
The banking sector is highly concentrated and shallower than the expected benchmark.
Profitability meets the expected structural benchmark and the sector outperforms its peers in
terms of liquidity. The picture is mixed in terms of inclusiveness, where Cameroon underperforms
in terms of access to banking services. Retail and small and medium-size enterprise banking is
limited. Small-scale saving and borrowing needs are met by microfinance institutions and the
informal sector.

Methodology
7.

Benchmarking provides an assessment of Cameroon’s banking sector performance

with respect to depth, breadth, access, and efficiency. For each country and each key financial
sector indicator, the World Bank’s Finstat database provides a structural benchmark based on the

52

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CAMEROON

country’s economic and structural characteristics.3 Given the structural characteristic of the country
under review, regressions compute an expected median level that the country could achieve. The
difference between the observed value and the benchmark then needs to be interpreted. A negative
difference suggests scope for policy action, while a positive difference could reflect overperformance compared to the peer group and the impact of successful reforms. The analysis was
carried out using data from 2000 onward, where available.
8.

Data availability permitting, Cameroon’s financial sector indicators are also compared

to those from peer countries. These are defined as other CEMAC countries, Ghana, Kenya, and
Senegal. Comparisons are also made with the average for Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), excluding
South Africa, and the average of the lower-middle-income countries group (LMC). Ghana is an
interesting example of a change in regulation (the “Borrowers and Lenders Act,” 2008) leading to a
breakthrough in access to finance. Kenya is an example of an SSA economy with a rapidly
developing financial sector. Senegal provides an example from a similar institutional setting (the
West African Economic Monetary Union, WAEMU). The SSA average (excluding South Africa) reflects
the development of the rest of the subcontinent, while the LMC group average provides a
comparison with countries at a similar level of development.

Depth
9.

The banking system has grown in recent years but remains shallow. Private sector credit

has expanded rapidly since the mid-2000s, although rising from a low base of 8 percent of GDP to
15 percent in 2012. Nevertheless the benchmarking shows that the sector remains relatively shallow
(Figure II.3). Cameroon underperforms the benchmarks for private sector credit and deposits to
GDP. It reaches the expected 25th percentile rather than the median. Country comparisons confirm
that although the banking sector is larger than in neighboring CEMAC countries, it remains much
shallower than for the average of SSA countries, even when excluding South Africa. The ratio of
broad money to GDP gained 10 percentage points in the past decade, but remains much lower than
in Ghana or Senegal.

Breadth and Efficiency
10.

The banking sector is heavily concentrated. Competition in the banking system, proxied

The structural benchmarks are calculated based on FinStats from the World Bank. Using a large dataset of countries,

each financial indicator was regressed on a set of structural characteristics, such as GDP per capita and its square;
population size and density; the age dependency ratio; and country-specific factors. For more methodological
information, see Čihák and others (2012).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

by the asset concentration of the three largest banks, appears relatively low. Figure II.4 shows that
the three largest banks own more than 70 percent of total assets of all commercial banks, a ratio
that has remained stable, notwithstanding new entries from regional or international groups. Small
and medium-size banks have not significantly increased their market share over the past five years.
Although such a concentration level is not uncommon in SSA, it is much lower among LMCs.
Non-interest income represents about 35 percent of total income, a ratio that is below the SSA
average, but 6 percentage points above that in Ghana and Senegal, and in line with the structural
benchmark.
11.

Profitability is in line with that of the region. Both return on assets (ROA) and return on

equity (ROE) show comfortable rates of return over the past decade, despite a fall in net income at
the system-wide level since 2009, reflecting difficulties experienced in the four problems banks
(Figure II.5).
12.

Banks are highly liquid. With the exception of a small dip during the 2009 global financial

crisis, bank liquidity has steadily increased and is above the Senegal, SSA, and LMC averages. Given
limited sources of funding to domestic deposits, credit-to-deposit ratios underperform the expected
median—this has implications for the limited financing of the economy.

Inclusiveness
13.

The sector presents a mixed picture of inclusiveness. The banking sector has grown in

terms of number of banks and number of branches. The number of branches has almost doubled in
the past 10 years, albeit from a low base (Figure II.6). Nonetheless access to formal banking services
remains low; access to financial services is similar to other CEMAC countries but lower than in
comparable countries outside the region. The indicator of banks per inhabitant underperforms the
estimated statistical benchmark. Only 15 percent of the adult population has a bank account and
barely 3 percent received their wages directly through their bank account. This explains the limited
amount of retail banking because banks focus their lending on customers that have monthly
paycheck deposits.
14.

MFIs help reach the unbanked population. Saving and lending behaviors of households

and small and medium-size enterprises reflect the importance of informal and microfinance
institutions. More than half of the adult population that has saved money in the past year has done
so through an MFI or a savings club. Similarly, the vast majority of loans are obtained through family
and friends followed by private lenders. Less than 3 percent of the population has received a loan
from a bank in the past 12 months, underscoring the marginal dimension of retail banking.

C. Financial Stability and Risks
15.

Overall conditions in the banking sector have improved, but the situation varies

substantially across banks. The system-wide capital adequacy ratio (CAR) remains below the
minimum regulatory requirement of 8 percent in March 2013. It hides important variations and
reflects weak capital positions only in some problem banks (Table II.2 and Figure II.7). The overall
improvement at the system level reflects mostly a positive evolution at a large domestic bank in the
first quarter of 2013; the ongoing supervisory procedure led to understandings between the COBAC
and this bank on the adequate amount of required provisions and on assets to be recognized as
quasi equities. As a result, and with the caveat of preliminary data requiring verification, the bank
appears to be on the way of recovery. Four smaller domestic and regional banks show negative
equity at end March 2013 and progress with restructuring plans has been slow. For one of them, a
long-overdue restructuring plan is coming closer to implementation.

The system is liquid and shows limited interest and exchange rate risks. As lending

activities are typically limited to the short term (up to 12 months) and non-interest income is high,
banks can be considered as not vulnerable to interest rate shocks. They face virtually no exchange
rate risk because assets and liabilities are in CFA francs, and most banks possess large cash reserves.
17.

Asset quality remains weak, credit risk remains high, and banks are vulnerable to a

high concentration of lending to a few economic sectors and corporations. Even though they
improved slightly compared to 2011, system-wide non-performing loans (NPLs) remain relatively
high at 11.7 percent of gross loans. All banks are vulnerable to a default by a large borrower
because their lending is concentrated on a few sectors and corporations. In a severe downturn
situation, risks could become systemic. In addition, persistent government arrears to SONARA
translate into a substantial credit risk for the banking sector.

D. Recommendations
Stability Issues
18.

It is important to take swift action to resolve financial problems at the troubled banks

while limiting the fiscal costs.


The authorities need to accelerate the finalization of the resolution of one regional bank as the
process is nearing its end. In addition to the recapitalization of the bank on public funds and the
creation of a separate “bad bank” structure that would take on all impaired assets, the
government should try to recover as much as possible of impaired assets to minimize the
burden on public finances.



A bank has been put under temporary administration and its restructuring or resolution should
be implemented as swiftly as possible.



The intention of a parent group regarding the onward sale or absorption of a bank needs either
to be confirmed shortly or its license should be revoked.



The timetable for recapitalization of a bank has been agreed by the COBAC, but the plan must
be implemented swiftly.

Boosting COBAC’s resources is of paramount importance. A lack of adequate resources

has been hampering COBAC’s activities for many years.4 This constraint limits the frequency of
on-site inspections and hinders early detection of problems. It severely restricts the capacity to
supervise the growing microfinance sector. A specific recruitment process has started and needs to
be completed as swiftly as possible.

Access Issues and Structural Constraints
20.

Financial intermediation and access to credit remain hampered by a number of

structural constraints. These include a poorly functioning judicial system, absence of adequate
collateral, and limited credit information. To help alleviate these constraints, the authorities are
planning to launch three databases on (i) payment incidents; (ii) balance sheet data of small and
medium-size enterprises; and (iii) microfinance institutions.
21.

Institutional reforms need to be pursued to improve the legal framework of credit

through: (i) improving procedures for recording and enforcing guarantees; (ii) modernizing the
operations of land and commercial registries; (iii) strengthening creditor rights enforcement by
enhancing governance of the courts; and (iv) upgrading standards of disclosure of information by
borrowers and lenders.
22.

The supervision of MFIs needs to be strengthened. Given the rising importance of the

sector and its significance for vulnerable households, it is important to adequately supervise MFIs.
Good practice is available regarding adequate supervision of MFIs, and COBAC should be
encouraged to follow it. However COBAC resources constraints need to be taken into account and
supervisory activity to be opportunely focused on large establishments that could present a risk for
depositors. In addition prevention should be emphasized, and the process of granting operating
licenses should be reinforced. Better coordination between the supervisor and the national
authorities could help boost transparency and inform users.

The lack of adequate resources was highlighted in the 2006 Financial Sector Assessment Program report.

Appendix III. Cameroon: External Competitiveness
The present exchange rate assessment follows the three approaches of the Consultative Group on
Exchange Rate Issues (CGER). 1 It is broadly consistent with the findings of the 2012 Central
African Economic and Monetary Community’s (CEMAC) external assessment,2 because it finds
that Cameroon’s real effective exchange rate (REER) may be slightly overvalued. Despite some
improvements in recent years, structural competitiveness remains low. The analysis of non-price
indicators highlights the need for Cameroon to improve its business climate and to lower the cost
of doing business, which implies better access to financing and improved infrastructure.

rate (REER) has been slowly depreciating
since 2010 (Figure III.1). This recent trend has
not offset, however, the long period of
appreciation, which culminated in 2009, when
the REER appreciated by almost 24 percent
compared to its 1994 level. Since 2010, the
REER has depreciated by 3.7 percent,

reflecting the depreciation of the euro, to

closely followed this trend.

As preliminary assessments, ad hoc

assumptions could be made on the long-run behavior of the REER, and results would be
derived from the comparison between the assumed long-run REER and the current REER. One
assumption would be to consider that long-run equilibrium was reached within the two years of the
currency’s devaluation. In this case, comparing the long-run equilibrium level (LREER) with the actual
LREER indicates that the REER was overvalued by about 6.7 percent at end-2012. Another

The external stability assessment of the CEMAC region (IMF Country Report No. 12/244, 2012) found that the REER
was overvalued, but was within the margin of error, indicating that the REER was broadly consistent with equilibrium
under current policies, and reserves remained adequate.

assumption would be to consider the sample mean during 1994–2012 was at its long-run
equilibrium. This method suggests that the LREER was undervalued by 2.3 percent at end-2012.
Conclusions therefore differ, but both preliminary assessments are heavily dependent on the strong
assumption that the LREER was constant. As noted in the previous exchange rate assessment, this is
unlikely to be the case, because one important determinant of Cameroon’s LREER, the country’s
terms of trade, has been on a declining trend since 1994.

B.

Model-Based Assessments

3.

The REER is assessed using the three approaches that are adopted by the CGER,

namely, the macroeconomic balance (MB), the equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER), and the
external sustainability (ES) approaches. The IMF assessment toolkit, which contains annual data
for 184 countries for 1973–2012 is used, along with projections that reflect the macroeconomic
framework discussed during the 2013 Article IV Consultation. Those standard CGER procedures are
also complemented by two methods, an adjusted macroeconomic balance approach and an
adjusted external sustainability approach that explicitly consider Cameroon’s oil wealth and the
projected exhaustion of its oil resources.
4.

The MB approach calculates the difference between the current account balance

projected over the medium term at prevailing exchange rates (the underlying current account
balance) and an estimated equilibrium current account (also called the current account norm),
which is a function of economic fundamentals. This approach consists of three steps. First, an
equilibrium relationship between current accounts and a set of macroeconomic fundamentals is
estimated. Second, based on the projection of economic fundamentals over the medium term, the
current account norm for each country is obtained using the previously derived coefficients. Third,
the difference between the current account norm and the underlying current account reflects the
exchange rate adjustment necessary to close the gap between the two current account balances.
The extent to which the real exchange rate will need to adjust will mostly depend on the countryspecific elasticity of the current account with respect to the real exchange rate.
5.

Results from the MB approach suggest that the REER was slightly overvalued at end-

2012 (Figure III.2). The estimated current account norm points to a deficit of 2.4 percent, while the
underlying current account deficit is about 4.6 percent. The real exchange rate would then need to
eliminate this difference. Given an elasticity of the current account to the real exchange rate of -0.4,

estimated from similar countries’ export and import elasticities,3 the MB approach suggests that the
REER would need to depreciate by about 5.5 percent, with the lower bound o 1.75 and upper bound
of 9.25, to close the external current account gap. This result is however highly dependent on the
elasticity of the current account to the real exchange rate. The more elastic the current account is, or
the more open a country is, the less the magnitude of the exchange rate adjustment needs to be.4
6.

The ERER approach suggests the REER was undervalued, but within the margin of
5

error. The ERER approach calculates the difference between the actual real exchange rate and an
estimated equilibrium real exchange rate, which is directly derived from the projection of mediumterm fundamentals, such as net foreign assets, productivity differential between tradable and nontradable sectors, and the terms of trade. As in the MB approach, this approach consists of three
steps. First, an equilibrium relationship between equilibrium real exchange rates and a set of
macroeconomic fundamentals is estimated. Second, using the coefficients that were found in the
first step, the equilibrium real exchange rate is obtained as a function of medium-term projections
3

The current account elasticity is calculated as (export elasticity) x (export-to-GDP ratio)-(import elasticity – 1) x
(import-to-GDP ratio).

REER assessments for Sub-Saharan African countries use elasticities of the current account to the REER ranging
from -0.3 to -0.6.

unavailability.

of economic fundamentals. Third, the difference between the equilibrium real exchange rate and the
actual real exchange rate reflects the needed REER adjustment.
7.

Assuming the same elasticity of -0.4 as the MB approach, the ES approach suggests

that the REER was slightly overvalued at end 2012. The ES approach calculates the difference
between the actual current account and the current account that would stabilize the net foreign
assets (NFA) position of a country at some benchmark level. As in the previous methods, the ES
approach consists of three steps. First, the level of current account that would stabilize the NFA
position of a country at given benchmark values is determined. Second, the NFA stabilizing current
account is compared to the actual current account that is projected to prevail over the medium
term. Third, the difference between the NFA-stabilizing current and the medium-term current
account reflects the exchange rate adjustment that is required to close the gap, assuming a certain
elasticity of the current account to the real exchange rate.
8.

To complement the above analysis, the MB and ES approaches were specifically

tailored to oil-producing countries.6 These adjusted procedures notably imply considering
Cameroon’s oil wealth and the projected exhaustion of oil resources in estimating the current
account norm. Results show that both MB and ES-adjusted approaches point to an overvaluation of
Cameroon’s REER at end-2012 of about 15.8 percent for the MB approach and 12.8 percent for the
ES approach.
9.

The above results indicate that Cameroon’s REER may be slightly overvalued,

confirming last year’s exchange rate assessment. The above results are however very dependent
not only on the macroeconomic assumptions on which the baseline scenario is predicated, but also
on the hypotheses each approach uses, such as the level of elasticity of the current account to the
real exchange rate.

C.

Alternative Indicators of External Competitiveness

10.

The REERs discussed above measure the relative domestic and foreign price levels

expressed in a common currency. The economic literature on developing countries considers,
however, that the “internal” real exchange rate (IRER), defined as the relative price of nontradable to
tradable goods, is a more appropriate measure of competitiveness because it is the key relative
price influencing resource allocation, the production and consumption of tradables and
6

See Bems, Rudolfs, and Irineu de Carvalho Filho, 2009, “Exchange Rate Assessments: Methodologies for

Oil-Exporting Countries,” IMF Working Paper No.09/281, Washington, DC.

67

CAMEROON

nontradables, and thus, ultimately, external balance. Although the theoretical concept of the IRER is
straightforward, its empirical measurement raises the problem of finding operational counterparts
for the required price indices of tradable and nontradable goods. As a result, the literature uses a
variety of proxies. We depart from a two-good framework by dividing the economy into three
categories of goods: exports, imports, and domestically produced and consumed goods. We
consider that aggregating imports and exports into one composite tradable good blurs the effects
of changes in the terms of trade and constitutes a price index that does not adequately translate the
incentive effects of a change in IRER either on the supply side or on the demand side of the
economy.
11.

The three-good framework produces two IRERs, corresponding to the relative prices of

exportables and importables in terms of domestically produced and consumed goods:
IRERx = Pd / Px
IRERm = Pd / Pm
Where Pd is the price of the domestic goods, and Px and Pm are the domestic prices of exportables
and importables, respectively, measured in domestic currency terms. IRERx could be considered an
indicator of the internal price competitiveness of exports relative to domestic goods. A decline in
IRERx would indicate a gain in competitiveness for the export sector. IRERm is similarly an indicator
of the internal price competitiveness of domestic goods relative to importables (or imported goods).
A rise in IRERm indicates a loss in competitiveness for importables.
12.

Figure III.3. compares the evolution of the four categories of relative prices in

1994–2012. They include the (external) REER used above in the model-based assessment, the
relative price of domestic goods to imports (IRERm), the relative price of domestic goods to exports
(IRERx), and the relative price of nontradables to tradables published by the Cameroonian National
Institute of Statistics (IRERTn).7 The following observations can be drawn:
IRERm and IRERx continue to be more volatile than the external REER. Because some of these



volatilities are not embodied in the external REER, the latter is likely to be an incomplete
measure of competitiveness in the case of developing countries. In 2012, both IRERm and IRERx

7

The 2012 relative price of nontradables to tradables was estimated based on past values. The proxy used for the

price of domestic goods is derived from national accounts data as explained in Hinkle, L., and F. Nsengiyumva, 1999,

Misalignment: Concepts and Measurement for Developing Countries (Washington, DC; World Bank).

took the opposite direction they had taken in 2011, implying a brief gain in competitiveness in
the importables and a slight loss of competitiveness in the export sector for that year.

The 2012 brief movements were not, however, strong enough to compensate for the long-run
trends of IRERx and IRERm. Since its peak in 1998, IRERx continues its declining trend,8
suggesting a broad gain in competitiveness in the export sector, even though it went through
two short periods of upward movements or loss of competitiveness, in 2000–04 and 2008–09.
These two periods corresponded to important changes then happening in the global trade
environment, including an increased traded share of processed agricultural foods and a strong
trade growth in manufactured goods. The 2012 decline in IRERm was not insignificant,9 but more
broadly, IRERm continues to be on an upward trend since 1994,10 indicating a sustained loss of
competitiveness in the importables.

8

The cumulative depreciation of IRERx from 1998 to 2012 was 46 percent.
A 7 percent decline in 2012 compared to 2011, which almost matches its most important decline in 2008 of
8 percent.

The cumulative appreciation of IRERm from 1994 to 2012 was 56 percent.



As in previous years, the estimated IRERn for 2012 follows relatively closely the external REER,
hence not capturing the volatilities shown in IRERm and IRERx. Considering this perspective, the
Cameroonian National Institute of Statistics discontinued the publication of the tradables and
nontradables price series in 2012.

D.

Assessment of Structural Competitiveness11

13.

Competitiveness, defined by the World Economic Forum as the set of institutions,

policies, and factors that determine the level of productivity of a country, can also be
measured with non-price indicators in addition to using price indicators. This section presents
available survey data that compare Cameroon on the structural determinants of external
competitiveness.
14.

According to the 2013 Global Competitiveness Index (GCI), Cameroon ranks 112th of

142 surveyed countries, with a score of 3.7 of 7, hence gaining four places since the 2012
report and doing slightly better than Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) (Table III.1). Cameroon obtained
higher scores than the SSA average on basic requirements (macroeconomic environment, health,
primary education), on all efficiency enhancers except for technology readiness and financial sector
development, and on both factors of innovation and sophistication.
15.

However, Cameroon’s business climate, as measured by the 2013 World Bank Doing

Business indicators has deteriorated since last year. The country lost five places in 2013, reaching
the rank of 161 of 185, compared to 156 of 183 in the 2012 report (Table III.2). Cameroon moved up
in the subtopics of trading across borders, enforcing contracts, and resolving insolvency, but lost
places on the rest. This was especially true concerning getting credit and protecting investors, where
the country lost four places in both subtopics, compared to last year. Cameroon’s 2013 rank is still
below that of SSA, which obtained an average rank of 139. In comparison to the CEMAC and West
African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) regions, Cameroon does relatively better than the
CEMAC, but less well than the WAEMU, which respectively rank 174 and 152.

According to the 2013 World Economic Forum’s report on global competitiveness,

firms identify the same five major constraints as in to the 2012 report. Those constraints are
corruption, access to financing, inadequate infrastructure, government bureaucracy, and tax

to financing, which was the major source of concern in last year’s survey. However, according to the

(Table III.3), gaining two places in its

The MDRI provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries that qualified

for the assistance. Grant assistance from the MDRI Trust and HIPC resources provide
debt relief to cover the full stock of debt owed to the Fund as of end-2004 that remains
outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief.

Decision point - point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country
qualifies for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to

be committed.
Interim assistance - amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision
and completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance
committed at the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional
circumstances).
Completion point - point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its
assistance committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of
interest income as defined in footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is linked
to the implementation of pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).
Implementation of Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief (PCDR): Not Applicable
Safeguards Assessments:
In accordance with Safeguards Policy requirements for regional central banks, a quadrennial
safeguards assessment of the Bank of the Central African States (BEAC) is underway. The
assessment, which included a mission to Yaoundé during March 20–29, 2013, occurs against
the backdrop of fraudulent activities uncovered in the BEAC office in Paris in 2009, and
subsequent special audits initiated by the BEAC authorities that identified governance
challenges and control failures. For its part, the BEAC adopted an action plan with the aim of
reforming its own governance, strengthening key safeguards, and building capacity. In
addition, a series of rolling measures were agreed between the BEAC and the IMF, as a basis
for determining whether periodic IMF program reviews could continue for those BEAC
members using IMF resources. A summary of the results of the current assessment will be
reported upon its completion.
Exchange Arrangements:
Cameroon participates in a currency union with five other members of the CEMAC and has no
separate legal tender. Cameroon’s currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to the euro at the fixed
rate of CFAF 655.957 per euro. Local currency equivalent: CFAF 755.95=SDR 1, as of
May 31, 2013. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the CEMAC countries
has been reclassified to the category of conventional pegged arrangement from the category
of exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on
the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the
lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional change,
and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange
regime or other policies of the currency union or its members.
Cameroon maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions, except for restrictions maintained for security
reasons that have been notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board decision 144 152/51.

The last Article IV consultation with Cameroon was concluded by the Executive Board on

FSAP Participation and ROSCs:
A Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) report was issued in May 2000. An update of
the FSSA was completed in February 2009, based on the work of a joint IMF-World Bank
mission that visited Cameroon as part of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in
June 2007, itself building upon the Central African Economic and Monetary Community
(CEMAC) regional FSAP that was conducted in 2006.
The first Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) on fiscal transparency
and transparency of monetary and financial policies for Cameroon was issued in June 2000.
A fiscal ROSC reassessment mission visited Yaoundé, Cameroon, during May 6–18, 2009. Its
report was issued in June 2010.

Strategy: The World Bank Country Assistance Strategy for 2010–2013 aims to stimulate
growth by improving governance, competitiveness, and service delivery. The World Bank will
help stimulate more inclusive growth by improving competitiveness through (i) increased
infrastructure investment in the energy, transport, and telecommunications sectors;
(ii) activities geared toward ensuring the transparent, equitable, and sustainable use of natural
resources; and (iii) promotion of high potential value chains and improved business climate.
For service delivery, the emphasis is on (i) human development (education, health and social
protection to help develop an effective safety net system based on targeted programs); and
(ii) local development, where the focus will be on increasing access to basic services through
infrastructure upgrading and capacity building for improved local governance.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
A.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance
purposes. There is scope for improvements in quality, coverage, and timeliness in most
macroeconomic dataset. In recent years, the authorities have taken initiative to improve the
macroeconomic database, particularly the national accounts.
Real sector statistics: The Institut National de la Statistique du Cameroun (INS) has compiled a
revised set of national accounts estimates based on the 1993 System of National Accounts (1993
SNA). Updating to the 2008 SNA is ongoing. The framework for the collection and production of
business enterprise statistics was found to be weak, creating difficulties for gauging the structure
of the economy and current industrial activity. Particularly serious difficulties affect data quality in
the following key sectors: agriculture, manufacturing, retail and wholesale trade, local
government, and services. The production index should be overhauled and integrated with the
corresponding components of the annual national accounts. Other areas for concern include a
limited selection of price indices for deflation of national accounts concepts and the limited
information on employment. In light of these shortcomings, technical assistance will remain
essential in the coming years. The STA missions in 2009, 2010 and 2011 sought to support the
compilation of improved national accounts statistics, and led to the development of quarterly
national accounts statistics starting in 2012.
Government finance statistics: The quality of fiscal data is broadly adequate for surveillance, but
has some shortcomings in coverage, periodicity, timeliness, and accessibility. Quarterly reports on
the overall budget execution, and the investment budget execution have been produced on a
continuous basis. Despite this progress, data on the public finances are still in need of
improvements in quality, coverage, timeliness, and dissemination of data based on the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). Weaknesses in the fiscal data include:
(i) incomplete compilation of budget implementation data on a commitment and, to some extent,
on a cash basis; (ii) a lack of information on the financial information of local governments;
(iii) poor monitoring of cross-liabilities in the public sector and of public enterprise debt; and
(iv) lack of information on the financial information of public enterprises more generally. The
authorities plan to establish comprehensive fiscal accounts on a commitment basis, a functional
classification of the budget and will strive to monitor the float. Moreover, the ongoing audit of
government domestic debt, which will cover cross-liabilities in the public sector and public
enterprise external debt, is expected to strengthen debt data. Efforts to enhance transparency of
financial operations in the oil sector should also improve overall fiscal reporting. Efforts are also
underway to collect data on the operations of the largest 20 public enterprises.
Monetary and financial statistics: Monetary statistics are reported to the Fund by the Banque
des États de l’Afrique Centrale (BEAC) on a monthly basis in the format of the standardized report
forms (SRFs), with delays of up to two months. A key shortcoming of monetary and financial
statistics is the lack of data for interest rates offered by the financial institutions sector to nonfinancial entities on deposits and loans. In addition, the depository corporation survey does not
include data from deposit taking microfinance institutions, a growing sector in the country.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

10

CAMEROON

Balance of payments: Since March 2006 STA technical assistance, the authorities have started to
produce higher quality data within a reasonable time period but there are still some significant
delays. Balance of payments data are reported annually to STA albeit with some lags. The latest
reported data refer to 2010.
External debt: External debt data are broadly adequate for surveillance, but are comprehensive
only for public and publicly guaranteed debt. Data are collected by the Caisse Autonome
d'Amortissement (CAA), which is responsible for signing international loan agreements and
servicing the government's external debt obligations. The CAA's database is fairly comprehensive
and up-to-date, and contains accurate stock data, and produces projected debt-service flows on
a loan-by-loan basis, but regular statements are not received from creditors.

B. Data Standards and Quality
Cameroon commenced its participation in the
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) in 2001.

No ROSC data is available.

C. Reporting to STA
Cameroon does not report data for publication in the IMF Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook or the government finance statistics section in International Financial Statistics. Data
reporting for publication in the Fund’s Balance of Payments Statistics publications has encountered
delays.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By
Anne-Marie Gulde-Wolf and
Dhaneshwar Ghura (IMF) and
Jeffrey Lewis and Marcelo
Giugale (World Bank)

Prepared by the International Monetary
Fund—African Department and the
International Development Association

The present debt sustainability analysis updates the analysis conducted at the time of the
2012 Article IV Consultation (Country Report No. 12/237, August 2012). It finds that the
level of debt distress remains low, as all debt indicators are well below their respective
policy-dependent thresholds. The underlying macroeconomic assumptions used in this
analysis are somewhat different from the ones used in the previous analysis. Projected oil
revenue is higher, but growth and export prospects are less favorable in the short and
medium terms. As the government intends to increase its debt in response to the large
financing need of the country’s ambitious public investment program, heavier borrowing
could jeopardize sustainability over the long term and calls for a prudent approach
regarding the terms of borrowing.

CAMEROON

BACKGROUND
1.
This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) was prepared jointly by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, and updates the 2012 DSA of Cameroon (IMF
Country Report No. 12/237, August 2012).38 It uses the standard debt dynamic template for lowincome countries, based on end-2012 data, and the macroeconomic framework resulting from
discussions with the Cameroonian authorities during the 2013 IMF Article IV consultation. Data are
composed of external and domestic debt of the central government and debt and guaranteed debt
of public enterprises. Efforts continue to be made in improving debt statistics and analysis, but, as
noted in the previous DSA, debt statistics could benefit from a more comprehensive coverage of
liabilities of public enterprises and municipalities, contingent liabilities of financial institutions, and
government obligations to state-owned entities.
2.
The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiatives resulted
in a significant reduction in Cameroon’s public debt ratios, from more than 50 percent of GDP
in 2005 to less than 10 percent of GDP in 2008. However, the public debt-to-GDP ratio has been
steadily increasing since then, reaching about 16 percent in 2012 (Tables 1-3a). This increase mainly
corresponds to a rise in public external debt (Text Table 1). Public external debt is still dominated by
multilateral debt, representing 31.3 percent of total public debt in 2012, but bilateral loans,
especially loans from non-Paris club members, have significantly grown in proportion, representing
16.1 percent of total public debt in 2012, as opposed to only 4.3 percent in 2008. This outcome
reflects the increasing number of nonconcessional loans or loans with less favorable financing
conditions, in response to the authorities’ ambitious public investment program and its large
financing needs. Although the previous DSA noted a rise in domestic debt overtime, the stock of
domestic debt decreased in 2012 compared to 2011, both in proportion of total public debt and as
a percentage of GDP (Text Table 2). It is nonetheless projected to increase, notably because of the
projected securitization of CFAF 100 billion of arrears in 2013.

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
3.

The baseline scenario assumes higher oil revenue, but lower growth and export

prospects (Text Table 3 and Box 1). Although oil prices are projected to decline, oil revenue is
expected to be higher because of larger oil production. Actual real GDP growth was revised
downward in 2012 because of the slow implementation of reforms and public investment. Exports
were revised downward because of the less favorable external environment stemming from the
ongoing euro area growth slump. Inflation is projected to remain low, in line with the convergence

38

The draft DSA was discussed with the Cameroonian authorities in the course of the 2013 Article IV consultation.
The present DSA follows the IMF and World Bank Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint IMF-World
Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries, dated January 22, 2010 (available at
http://www.imf.org/external/pp/longres.aspx?id=4419 and http://go.worldbank.org/JBKAT4BH40).

Public investment remains the driver of medium and long-term growth, as the
authorities continue to carry out an ambitious public investment program. In this context, large
infrastructure projects buttress the country’s growth strategy. The full impact of these projects is
assumed to take place after 2018. Resources to finance the projects are expected to come from the
budget, and from domestic and external loans. Concerning the latter, it is important to note the rise
in nonconcessional loans—about 77 percent of all commitments since 2010 have been
nonconcessional (Text Table 4).39 The use of nonconcessional debt has not been limited to financing
investment projects with high returns. This trend is expected to continue in view of Cameroon’s
large financing needs (Text Table 5). The volume of committed but non-disbursed loans has
considerably increased from CFAF 1,421.7 billion in 2011 to CFAF 2,095.2 billion in 2012
(Text Table 6).

39

New nonconcessional borrowing commitments are projected at CFAF 746 billion in 2013. This DSA will provide an
input to the analysis of World Bank staff to establish ceilings for nonconcessional borrowing in 2013, under the
International Development Association’s nonconcessional borrowing policies. The amount of nonconcessional
borrowing expected for 2013, 2014, and 2015 are CFAF 207, 276, and 308 billion, respectively.

Box 1. Cameroon: Macroeconomic Assumptions for the Baseline Scenario1
Medium Term, 2014–18



Real GDP growth is projected to reach an average of 5.2 percent in the medium term, supported
by non-oil exports, increased oil production, and higher capital spending, as private sector
develops and business climate improves. Inflation is projected to remain low, at 2.5 percent a year,
in line with historical trends and the Central African Economic and Monetary Union (CEMAC)
convergence criterion.



The revenue-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase over the medium term, from 18.4 percent in
2012 to 19.1 percent in 2018. Although oil prices are expected to be reduced in the medium term,
higher oil production is assumed to offset the decline in prices.



The external current account deficit is projected to widen from 3.7 percent of GDP in 2013 to
4.3 percent of GDP in 2018, caused by more imports, which in turn are driven by real growth and
the increasing need for equipment and intermediate goods for infrastructure projects. The current
account deficit is expected to be financed through foreign direct investment, external public
borrowing, and other private capital inflows.

Long Term, 2019–33



Real GDP growth is projected to reach an average of 4.7 percent. Long-term growth is driven by
non-oil exports, a sustained rate of capital spending, as the economic activity benefits from
private sector development, induced by a more favorable business climate.



Revenue is projected to decrease from 19.1 percent of GDP in 2018 to 17.5 percent of GDP in
2033. This trend assumes that oil revenue will decline with the depletion of oil reserves, while nonoil revenue is sustained by further structural reforms, improving revenue collection, and a more
diversified economy.



The external current account deficit is projected to narrow until 2023, reaching then 4 percent of
GDP. From 2024 onward, it widens again, reaching 5.7 percent of GDP in 2033. It is assumed that
until 2023, the current account is mainly driven by a rebound in exports, as the European market
recovers. The larger deficit from 2024 onward assumes stronger import of equipment and
intermediate goods, as private sector develops and the business climate improves.

Oil prices are expected to decline in the short and medium terms, but production is
projected to increase. These measures include the re-opening of several wells, thanks to new
extracting techniques, the search for new extraction zones, and the discovery of an important oil
field in Rio del Rey. Although some industries are expected to contribute to export growth in the
medium term (e.g., electricity, cement), export prospects remain tame, because Europe, the main
trading partner, is still prone to slow growth.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT
A. Baseline Scenario
6.
The low-income country (LIC) debt sustainability framework is guided by policydependent indicative debt burden thresholds for external debt. These thresholds reflect the
empirical findings that sustainable debt levels for a LIC increase with the quality of policies and
institutions. Such quality is measured by the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA)
index, compiled annually by the World Bank. Compared to last year, Cameroon has slightly
improved its ranking, but still scores low, at 3.5 (yearly score on a scale of 1 to 6; Text Table 7).
Cameroon’s rank is similar to the CEMAC average, but is above the Sub-Saharan African (SSA)
average. The indicative external debt burden thresholds for countries in this category are (i) a
present value (PV) of the debt-to-exports ratio of 100 percent; (ii) a PV of the debt-to-revenue ratio
of 200 percent; (iii) a PV of the debt-to-GDP ratio of 30 percent; and (iv) debt-service-to-exports and
debt service-to-revenue ratios of 15 percent and 18 percent, respectively.

Cameroon’s external debt remains sustainable, with all external debt ratios staying

below their respective thresholds (Text Table 8 and Figure 1).40 There is however an upward trend

for all debt ratio indicators until 2023, before stabilizing at the end of the projection period. The
grant element of new borrowing and the grant equivalent financing as a percent of GDP decrease
over time. These trends reflect an intensification of debt contracting and a deterioration in the level
of concessionality mostly in response to the large financing needs that result from the public
investment program. Given these trends, a further increase in nonconcessional borrowing may
present a threat to debt sustainability in the long term, especially given the size of already
committed but not disbursed, nonconcessional loans.

B. Alternative Scenario and Stress Tests
8.
An alternative scenario, in which no loan is concessional, was conducted (Table 3b). Under
this scenario, the PV of debt-to-exports breaches its threshold following an export shock in a long
and protracted way, hence qualifying the level of debt distress as moderate. Although all other debt
indicators remain below their thresholds, they now have a more pronounced upward path. As in the
previous DSA, historical scenarios, characterized by an external current account surplus which is
unlikely to occur given our previously described macroeconomic assumptions, is therefore not
shown in Figures 1 and 2.
9.
As in the previous DSA, an export shock would remain a source of increased debt
vulnerability. This shock has become more relevant, as the latest International Energy Agency (IEA)
medium-term market report shows41 the positive oil supply shock in the United States will likely
have a lasting impact on the global oil market, especially affecting demand from African
oil-exporting countries. The export stress test, defined as export growth in US dollar terms in
2014–2015 at one standard deviation below the ten-year historical average, assumes a drop of
5.7 percent in the value of exports in 2014–15, and a return to the growth rates assumed in the
baseline scenario thereafter. Following this shock, the present value of debt to export increases
significantly until 2028, and although remaining below its threshold, closely approaches it.

PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT
10.
As in the previous DSA, the inclusion of domestic debt does not change the results,
but shows a clear deterioration in the debt ratios. The PV of debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to
reach even higher levels than in the last DSA, rising from 17 percent of GDP in 2013 to 54 percent of
GDP in 2033. The PV of debt-to-revenue and the PV of debt service-to-revenue also follow an
upward trajectory. The upward trend in the debt ratios reflects more issuance of government
securities, more securitization of arrears to SONARA (concerning the latter, the authorities already
announced during the 2013 Article IV consultation mission that CFAF 100 billion worth of arrears will
be securitized in 2013), and the accumulation of further domestic debt related to projected fiscal
financing gaps.

It is essential to monitor debt closely to preserve sustainability, especially in view of
the large financing needs that result from the public investment program. As discussed in the
previous DSA, the authorities have started implementing a new debt management strategy. This
strategy provides an important role for the National Debt Committee (NDC), whose mission is to
implement the country’s debt strategy and oversee its good management. While the NDC made
significant progress in becoming operational—through the adoption of its internal rules of
procedure, clarification of the borrowing process, and identification of the Committee’s intervention
points—its ability to advise on potential loans should be reinforced.

CAMEROON

CONCLUSION
12.
On the basis of this DSA, Cameroon remains at a low risk of debt distress, but
vulnerabilities persist. All debt indicators are below their thresholds. However, contrary to the
previous DSA, vulnerabilities not only come from domestic debt, but also from external debt,
through the decreasing trend in the grant element of new borrowing. This result not only calls for
the adoption of prudent fiscal policies, but also the close monitoring of potential loans from nonresidents to assure the highest possible level of concessionality. Nonconcessional loans should only
be considered in well-assessed, high-yield commercial and infrastructure projects that will generate
sufficient government revenue to cover related debt service. In order to mitigate these risks, further
structural reforms—and their timely implementation and enforcement—to improve non-oil revenue
collection and promote a more diversified private sector, will be necessary.
13.
The present DSA should be interpreted with caution because problems with
insufficient data coverage and weak public financial management continue. Under these
conditions, the existence of contingent liabilities and quasi-fiscal liabilities of state-owned
enterprises and distressed banks, as well as the build-up of domestic arrears may inform the analysis
and highlight the existing underlying risks. It may be prudent to limit the participation of the state to
the financing of projects linked to the natural resources sector, to lessen the potential burden of
contingent liabilities.
14.
The Cameroonian authorities have indicated their agreement with the analysis and
conclusion reached in this DSA. They agreed that it is essential to maintain debt sustainability,
especially in the broader context of achieving the country’s long-term growth through an ambitious
public investments program. They indicated, however, that given Cameroon’s large financing needs,
finding loans with favorable conditions may not be always possible. The authorities will endeavor to
secure concessional loans whenever possible, and by default, contract nonconcessional loans only
for projects that have sufficiently high returns to cover debt service. In addition, the authorities are
working closely with the World Bank regarding the ceiling of contracted nonconcessional loans.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 1, 2013

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation
with Cameroon
On June 26, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Cameroon.1
Background
The economic recovery strengthened in 2012, with growth reaching 4.4 percent (compared to
4.2 percent in 2011), reflecting an increase in the value of oil exports. Average inflation
moderated to 2.4 percent (from 2.9 percent in 2011), helped by stable food prices. The current
account deficit (including grants) widened from 2.9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in
2011 to 3.7 percent of GDP in 2012 following a decrease in net income owing to higher profit
repatriation by local subsidiaries of international companies. Although Cameroon has had
robust growth in the past few years, there has been little growth in per capita income, despite a
relatively diversified and well-endowed economy.
The fiscal situation eased in 2012. Non-oil revenue was higher than expected, mostly because
of a stronger yield of the corporate income tax. Oil revenue increased slightly, as the dip in
international oil prices was compensated by higher production. On the expenditure side, budget
execution was close in nominal terms to that of the year before, and thus represented a
contraction of expenditure in terms of GDP. As a result, the overall deficit (including grants) on a
cash basis narrowed from 3.6 percent of GDP in 2011 to 2.0 percent of GDP in 2012.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

The banking system has stabilized, but remains a cause for concern. Two of the five
commercial banks in financial distress appear to be in the process of re-establishing their
financial soundness; but the other three show few signs of progress. Moreover, commercial
banks remain exposed to excessive concentration in bank credit, payment difficulties of the
national oil refinery, and weaknesses in the framework for dealing with troubled banks.
Cameroon’s debt burden remains low, thanks in part to debt relief under the Heavily Indebted
Poor Countries (HIPC) and Multilateral Debt Relief (MDR) Initiatives. However, external
financing in 2012 increasingly relied on nonconcessional borrowing. On current trends, the
updated debt analysis points to a deterioration of debt sustainability indicators by 2018. The
stock of debt would rise from 16 percent of GDP in 2012 to 34 percent of GDP in 2018.
Economic growth is expected to increase moderately under current policies, which would imply
a modest per capita growth in 2013. Staff projects real GDP to increase gradually to 5½ percent
by 2018. Non-oil growth is projected to be supported by major public investment projects;
ongoing efforts to boost agricultural productivity and competitiveness; and measures to improve
the business environment. The oil sector is also expected to contribute to growth, following
successful exploration efforts and new extraction techniques. Meanwhile, inflation is expected to
remain below the regional convergence criterion of 3 percent.
However, fuel subsidies are slated to increase in 2013 and crowd out more productive
expenditure. Their level is expected to reach 3.2 percent of GDP in the absence of efficiency
gains or retail price adjustments. High subsidies, increasingly nonconcessional external
financing, and an unpropitious business environment fuel macroeconomic vulnerabilities.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the recovery of economic activity in a low inflation environment,
but noted that the economy still faces vulnerabilities and impediments to private-sector-led
growth. They encouraged the authorities to renew efforts on fiscal, financial, and structural
reforms needed to meet Cameroon’s growth potential.
Directors emphasized the need to address the significant fiscal challenges. They noted that the
fiscal deficit in 2012 was contained mainly by higher oil revenue and under-execution of the
investment budget. Going forward, risks to fiscal sustainability arise from fuel subsidies, which
are crowding out developmental expenditure and contributing to outstanding payment
obligations. Directors urged the authorities to contain the 2013 budget deficit and to rebuild
fiscal space over time. They called on the authorities to wind down fuel subsidies gradually,
clear outstanding payment obligations, and develop mitigating programs for the neediest
segments of the population. They also saw a need to reduce tax exemptions and strengthen
revenue mobilization.

3

Directors welcomed efforts to implement program-based budgeting. They encouraged the
authorities to consolidate reforms in public financial management, including public procurement,
and strengthen expenditure execution and control. Directors noted Cameroon’s low risk of debt
distress. Nevertheless, they urged caution in tapping nonconcessional financing and advised
the authorities to be prudent in their selection of externally financed projects, focusing on
investments with a high return.
Directors noted that risks to financial sector stability have abated. They emphasized that
decisive action is needed to put financial intermediation back on a sound footing, and called for
swift action to restructure distressed banks. They also recommended close supervision of the
important microfinance sector.
Directors stressed that achieving higher, private-sector-led growth will require stronger efforts to
improve the business environment and address infrastructure and energy bottlenecks. They
encouraged the authorities to work with Central African Economic and Monetary Community
(CEMAC) member countries to ensure adequate external buffers and foster regional integration
in order to support trade and diversification of the economy.
Directors also encouraged the authorities to strengthen economic and financial statistics.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of
the IMF's views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the
country (or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article
IV consultations with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional
level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with
longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of
general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

My Cameroonian authorities would like to thank the IMF team for the open and constructive
discussions during the mission and the useful analysis and recommendations included in the
staff report. The report presents a balanced assessment of the strengths and risks faced by the
Cameroonian economy. My authorities value the advice of the staff on the different sectors of
the economy. This advice is an important input in the design of their policies. My Cameroonian
authorities broadly concur with staff’s assessment and welcome the recognition that the
authorities are making progress, but still face low but rising macroeconomic risks to achieve
their ambitious goal of becoming an emerging market by 2035.
Recent Economic Developments
Cameroon’s macroeconomic performance improved further in 2012, with real GDP growth
reaching 4.4 percent, and projected to reach 4.8 percent in 2013. The increase is due mainly to a
turnaround in oil production, strong growth of the non-oil sector (agriculture and forestry), and a
robust domestic demand. Inflation continues to be moderate at 2.4 percent, and the fiscal deficit
was reduced. The external debt remains low and sustainable with all external debt ratios staying
below their respective thresholds.
On the fiscal side, the overall fiscal deficit was reduced to 2 percent of GDP in 2012 (from
3.6 percent in 2011) as revenue exceeded budget projections. This deficit reduction was driven
by higher-than-expected non-oil revenue, mostly because of a stronger yield of the corporate
income tax, while expenditure was in line with budget appropriations. However, the stock of
government arrears increased on account of rising fuel subsidies, although the government did
settle all outstanding arrears at end-2011 toward the national refinery (SONARA). Delayed
payments of taxes by corporations are an important factor in the accumulation of arrears, and
my authorities will continue to take steps to improve their treasury management to limit further
arrears.
Developments and Policies in 2013 and over the Medium Term
Based on their policies and continued reforms as well as the implementation of a number of
important public projects, my authorities expect annual average real growth to be about
6 percent over the medium term. This reflects conservative assumptions regarding the pace of
execution of large infrastructure and power supply projects, as well as ongoing investment in the
hydrocarbon sector and efforts to raise agricultural production. However, following legislative
and municipal elections, the political uncertainty is expected to be removed which should enable
a strengthening of policies and an improvement in the business environment thus leading to

stronger growth. Inflation is expected to be kept under control below 3 percent, although it could
be affected by volatile food prices which are an important component of the inflation basket.
The fiscal deficit is likely to show an increase over the medium term, reflecting higher capital
expenditure linked to the large infrastructure projects and a projected decline in revenue from
oil. However, non-oil revenue is expected to increase on account of tax and customs
administrations reforms. On the issue of fuel subsidies, my authorities agree with staff that they
should be reined in through a number of measures, including a gradual adjustment in pump
prices. However, the authorities would like to point out that it is a very sensitive issue with
direct social impact and needs to be implemented cautiously. Reforms will have to be carefully
prepared with extensive consultation and accompanied by mitigating measures so as to build a
consensus and preserve social peace.
Nevertheless, my Cameroonian authorities agree with staff that they should take steps to rebuild
fiscal buffers and ensure fiscal sustainability over the medium term. In this regard, they will
continue to take measures to raise non-oil revenue. They are also thankful to staff for the
detailed recommendations of structural measures aimed at strengthening medium term fiscal
sustainability. This will be helpful in the formulation of their fiscal policies. In the same spirit of
strengthening fiscal control, my Cameroonian authorities have also embarked upon an ambitious
plan to strengthen and modernize Public Financial Management. In this regard, they welcome
staff’s recommendations. Although the introduction of the reforms are challenging, as they
require a fundamental change in administrative culture, the authorities intend to implement
them, albeit gradually.
The financial system is broadly sound. My Cameroonian authorities will continue to take steps
to address the weaknesses in the system and are working with the regional bank regulator
(COBAC) to strengthen supervision.
My authorities agree with staff that the overarching policy issue is how to spur reform
momentum to set Cameroon on a higher growth path, while mitigating low but growing risks to
macroeconomic stability. Developing Cameroon’s growth potential requires continuous reforms
in fiscal policy, public finance management, and the business climate and tackling barriers to
greater competitiveness and sustainable growth. My authorities believe that the acceleration of
the pace of the large infrastructure development on the way, and the continuous improvement of
the business environment will remove these impediments and place the country on a higher
GDP growth path that is inclusive and sustainable. These reforms will also help in the efforts to
reduce poverty.
Debt and Development
As the DSA shows, the level of debt distress remains low. The authorities are mindful of the
need to maintain debt sustainability. They take this into full consideration in the broader context
of achieving the country’s long-term growth through their ambitious public investment program.

That said, given the needs of the country, and the global financial conditions, it has become very
difficult to obtain financial grants or concessional loans to finance these vital projects. The
authorities will, nevertheless, always endeavor to secure concessional financing as much as
possible, and will contract non concessional loans only in the absence of such concessional
resources and for projects that are of critical importance to the development of the country. They
will also take into consideration the returns on the projects. As hinted above, the authorities are
also of the view that the country’s competitiveness will greatly benefit from the completion of
the large public investment projects, and would like to stress that financing of most of the
projects have already been mobilized or under negotiations. They are also working closely with
the World Bank regarding the ceiling on contracted nonconcessional loans.
Conclusion
Cameroon is at a cross roads, and the authorities understand the need to maintain prudent
policies to ensure macroeconomic stability while developing the growth potential of the country.
In their efforts, they will be guided by the need to maintain debt sustainability and ensure
external competitiveness. Domestic stability continues to be anchored by membership to the
Zone franc, which has served the economy well. Already the country has been able to
significantly raise its real rate of growth, the policies being followed by the authorities are
intended to raise this growth further and make it inclusive. They are hopeful to benefit from
Fund’s continued assistance in this endeavor.
