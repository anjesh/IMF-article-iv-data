REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN
Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the
2004 Consultation with the Republic of Kazakhstan
Approved by Mohsin S. Khan and Martin Fetherston
June 28, 2004

•

The 2004 Article IV consultation mission took place in Astana and Almaty during
April 15–30, 2004. The mission met with Assistant to the President Marchenko, Governor of
the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) Saidenov, Minister of Finance Dunaev, Minister of
Economy and Budget Planning Kelimbetov, Chairman of the Financial Supervision Agency
Zhamishev, as well as senior officials from the Ministries of Agriculture, Energy, Industries and
Trade, and Labor and Social Protection. The mission also met with representatives from
parliament, the business community, commercial banks, and other members of civil society.

•

The team consisted of Mr. Berengaut (head), Mr. P. Keller, Ms. Elborgh-Woytek, Mr. Lohmus,
Mr. Kisinbay (EP) (all MCD), and Mr. Yang (PDR). Mr. Saudabaev, Assistant to the Executive
Director, participated in some of the discussions.

•

Over the last ten years, Kazakhstan had one SBA followed by two EFF arrangements.
Only one purchase was made under the first EFF and none under the second EFF. In May 2000,
all outstanding credit to the Fund was repaid and no reviews under the second EFF were
completed, although the arrangement was only formally cancelled in February 2002. In the
context of the Ex-Post-Assessment, the mission discussed with the authorities their views on
Kazakhstan’s experience with Fund-supported programs.

•

Kazakhstan accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 in 1996
and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions for current international
transactions. Capital account restrictions are administered liberally.

•

The quality and coverage of economic data is generally adequate for macroeconomic
policy assessment (Appendix V). In March 2003, Kazakhstan subscribed to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS).

•

Kazakhstan has made good progress in implementing standards and codes. In 2003, the
Staff Report for the Article IV Consultation (IMF Country Report No. 03/210), the Selected
Issues and Statistical Appendix (IMF Country Report No. 03/211), and the reports for the data
module ROSC (IMF Country Report No. 03/78) and the fiscal ROSC (IMF Country Report
No. 3/100) were published. The authorities agreed to the publication of the report for the 2004
FSAP update.

•

It is proposed that Kazakhstan remain on the standard 12-month consultation cycle.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Kazakhstan’s economy continues to grow rapidly, driven by the expansion of the oil
sector, and supported by a favorable external environment as well as prudent
macroeconomic policies. The medium-term outlook remains highly favorable, as large-scale
investment continues to flow to the oil and gas sectors. Prospects have improved further
following recent agreements with Russia and China on oil and gas pipelines, aimed to
enhance Kazakhstan’s market access.
With upward pressures on energy prices, the challenges of oil inflows for the mix of
macroeconomic policies may become increasingly difficult. The authorities have eased
their tight fiscal stance with the 2004 budget. While this relaxation is welcome, greater
spending efficiency needs to be encouraged by developing institutional capacity. The
authorities should be prepared to sharply reduce foreign exchange market interventions by
the NBK in order to keep inflation stable. The National Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan
(NFRK) will continue to play a crucial role in safeguarding Kazakhstan’s mounting oil
wealth.
To avoid overdependence on the oil sector, the economy should be diversified by
improving the investment climate, in particular for small and medium-scale enterprises.
The authorities are encouraged to pursue their structural reform agenda, including trade
liberalization, more vigorously.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The 2003 Article IV consultation with Kazakhstan was completed on
May 28, 2003.1 Executive Directors commended Kazakhstan’s strong macroeconomic
performance, also resulting from sound macroeconomic policies and early implementation of
first-generation structural reforms. Directors encouraged the authorities to accelerate the
structural reform agenda in order to improve the investment climate, and to seek early
accession to the WTO. They agreed that a key challenge over the medium term will be the
continued effective management of rapidly rising oil revenues, in view of both
intergenerational considerations and the urgent need to reduce wide-spread poverty. In this
context, Directors supported the easing of the fiscal stance, reflected in substantial
expenditure increases in the 2004 budget and the tax rate cuts scheduled for January 2004.
Directors noted that the NFRK had eased the burden on monetary policy. In view of
Kazakhstan’s strong balance of payments position, they encouraged the authorities to allow
some appreciation of the tenge.

During this period, non-oil GDP grew by 9.3 percent on average.

agricultural sector grew only marginally in 2003, as a result of poor weather. Over the past
three years, inflation has remained below 7 percent.
3.
Labor market trends have been favorable, with significant gains in employment
since 2000. In 2003, the unemployment rate fell from 9.3 percent to 9.0 percent. Real wages
have grown in line with real GDP, averaging about 10 percent during 2000–03.
Notwithstanding the reduction in the share of the population living below the poverty line
from 34 percent in 1998 to 25 percent in 2003, poverty remains a serious problem, in
particular in rural areas and among the elderly.

Following the adoption of a new
monetary policy framework in 2003, the
NBK now treats price stability as the key
monetary policy objective. However, the
NBK also continues to monitor closely the
development of the real exchange rate of the
tenge against a basket of 24 currencies of key
trading partners. NBK purchases of foreign
exchange, aimed to prevent the rapid
appreciation of the tenge, reached the
equivalent of 9 percent of GDP in 2003.
Since the beginning of 2003, reflecting the
movements in the U.S. dollar/euro rate,
the tenge has appreciated against the
U.S. dollar by about 13 percent, but
depreciated sharply against the Euro. The
tenge remained largely stable against the
Russian ruble during 2001–03, but
appreciated against this currency by 4 percent
in early 2004.

C. Fiscal Developments
6.
With a general government
surplus of 3 percent of GDP in 2003,
fiscal policy continued to play a key role
in containing aggregate demand, which
helped to reduce inflationary pressures
in the presence of large capital inflows.
Measured by the non-oil budget deficit,
the fiscal stance remained largely
unchanged compared to 2002. Revenues
reached 26.3 percent of GDP, increasing
by 4 percentage points over the previous
year. The strong performance was
supported by an increase in non-oil sector
revenues resulting from higher corporate
profitability in non-oil industries and the
services sector, and one-off payments

related to the oil and gas sectors. The rise in expenditures by 2.3 percent of GDP was mainly
driven by higher outlays for infrastructure, and construction of the new capital Astana, which
accounted for 1.5 percent of GDP. Capital injections to state-owned development institutions
were also significant, while the increase in social spending remained limited. A substantial
share of the fiscal surplus and privatization receipts was saved in the NFRK (Box 1).
7.
Despite a reduction in tax rates, equivalent to an estimated 1.5 percent of GDP,
budget revenues remained strong in the first quarter of 2004. The VAT rate was reduced
from 16 percent to 15 percent and the highest personal income tax rate from 30 percent to
20 percent, with an increase in minimum thresholds. Moreover, a social tax rate reduction
from a flat 21 percent to a regressive rate from 7 percent to 20 percent was introduced. The
authorities have redirected a substantial share of tax revenues from mining and oil
operations—previously earmarked for the NFRK—to the financing of the 2004 budget. New
rules for the taxation of oil and mining revenues, introduced in January 2004, were expected
to increase the government’s share in resource-based revenues. However, the impact of these
changes will be delayed as existing contracts remain subject to the old tax regime. The new
single treasury account became fully operational on May 1, 2004.

Box 1. The National Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan (NFRK)
Faced with a surge in foreign exchange earnings from higher oil production and prices, the authorities
established the NFRK in 2001 to reduce the impact of volatile market prices of natural resources on the
economy, and to smooth the distribution of oil-wealth over multiple generations. The NFRK is
domiciled in the NBK, which has the responsibility of managing its assets on behalf of the government.
All NFRK assets are invested exclusively abroad. As of end-May 2004, $3.7 billion (equivalent to
10 percent of GDP) were accumulated in the fund.
The mechanics of assigning flows into the NFRK remain quite complex and the mission has suggested
simplifications in line with moving to non-oil deficit targeting. Initially, the authorities identified
14 major companies in the natural resources sector, revenues from which were subject to transfer to the
NFRK. The number of entities was reduced to 7 in early 2004, and the list was limited to petroleum
companies. The income of the NFRK is reinvested.

investors. External borrowing by commercial
banks and domestic enterprises increased
substantially (with domestic lending becoming increasingly diversified in terms of sectors),
leading to a surplus of 9 percent of GDP in the capital and financial account. Official
international reserves increased to $6.5 billion at end-May 2004, equivalent to 4.5 months of
import coverage; in addition, the NFRK balance reached $3.7 billion. Public external debt
rose somewhat in U.S. dollar terms, but fell to 12 percent of GDP, continuing the trend seen
over the past few years. Kazakhstan’s official sector became more significant as a net
creditor to the rest of the world. Standard & Poor’s upgraded Kazakhstan’s Foreign Currency
Sovereign Credit Rating to investment grade/BBB- in May 2004.
E. Structural Policies
9.
Structural reforms are well advanced compared to other countries in Central
Asia, but the implementation of the reform agenda has slowed somewhat since 2000.
Outside the oil sector, the business climate remains difficult, notably for small- and
medium-scale enterprises and foreign investors; wide-spread corruption in law enforcement,
customs, and tax authorities is often cited as a significant impediment to private sector
development.
10.
Reforms of the financial sector were bolstered by the establishment of an
independent Financial Supervisory Agency in early 2004. Legislative reforms were
carried further with the introduction of consolidated supervision requirements. The
authorities have announced the privatization of the country’s second largest pension fund.
The recent Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update mission commended the
positive developments since the 2000 FSAP, while highlighting some remaining risks to the
financial sector (Box 2). In line with this mission’s recommendations, a draft law on

Box 2. Key Findings of the Update of the Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP)
•

The main risks in the banking sector include the credit risk, indirect exchange rate risk, and reliance
on volatile wholesale funding.

•

Lending and deposit rates declined somewhat in 2003, the latter turning negative in real terms.
Continued significant spreads and high real lending rates are largely explained by uncertainties in
the legal environment and slow structural reforms.

•

The share of classified loans remains substantial, increasing from 29 percent of total loans at
end-2002 to 39 percent at end-2003. The increase is largely the result of new stricter classification
requirements. However, rapid credit growth continues to challenge the internal risk management
capabilities of banks.

•

Measures to reduce interest rates comprise disallowing interest deductions as a business expense
and excluding deposits from insurance coverage if interest rates exceed certain limits.

•

Financial sector legislative reforms are commendable, but implementation is lagging in some areas,
such as consolidated supervision.

•

Pension funds are currently focused on high returns through short-term investments. These risks
have to be addressed by both regulators and market participants.

•

Initiatives to prevent money laundering and financing of terrorism have been taken, but the
legislative framework does not yet meet international standards. Concerns remain that the new
AML/CFT law could undermine confidentiality and endanger confidence in the banking system.

11.
In June 2003, after an intense debate, a new Land Code was passed with the
stated aim to create a functioning land market, and to promote private investment in
agriculture. Under the new law, users of land have until end-2004 to decide whether to
purchase the land they are cultivating or use it as a contribution to the chartered capital of
large farms. Some members of civil society noted the potential for misappropriation of land
under this code. They were also concerned about adverse effects on those lacking financial
resources to purchase land.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS AND OUTLOOK FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2004
A. Overview
12.
Kazakhstan’s macroeconomic prospects are very positive. Supported by a highly
favorable external environment, real growth is expected to reach about 9 percent in 2004.
The fiscal surplus will likely remain significant, despite recent tax cuts. The current account
is expected to be balanced as substantial inflows from rising oil exports will likely be offset
by increasingly negative services and income balances, largely as a result of higher outward

- 12 -

remittances, growing import demand for services associated with FDI, and repatriation of
FDI earnings.
13.
Macroeconomic policy discussions with the authorities focused on the policy mix
for 2004 and beyond. The authorities have decided to relax their fiscal policy stance by
expanding government spending on sectoral initiatives and social protection. The mission
underlined that the strong record of macroeconomic performance since 2000—high growth,
low inflation, and a stable exchange rate—was facilitated by rapid remonetization and
budgetary surpluses resulting from tight fiscal policy. While remonetization could be
expected to continue from its still modest level, the prospective easing of the fiscal stance
will render the sterilization of oil inflows more difficult. The authorities were well aware of
the macroeconomic consequences of the fiscal loosening. They noted that, even after taking
it into account, the prospective inflows could be accommodated by a combination of greater
exchange rate flexibility and stepped-up sterilization through the sale of NBK notes. The
mission cautioned that with upward pressures on energy prices, the challenges of the oil
inflows for the mix of macroeconomic policies would become increasingly difficult if the
exchange rate were not allowed to appreciate.
14.
While expressing its support of the change in the fiscal stance, the mission raised
concerns about expenditure priorities. With the still low level of social protection, the
expansion of programs for improving the health and education of the population was highly
appropriate. However, the mission questioned the authorities’ recent initiatives to become
active in specific sectors through specialized financial institutions and funds, which in 2003
accounted for 6 percent of general government expenditure, and tax breaks for emerging
processing industries. The authorities explained that these programs were geared to ensure
diversification of the economy and that the private sector featured prominently in their
implementation. They noted that they were adopting measures to reduce the associated risks
of introducing distortions, and that the costs of tax breaks would be very limited. The
programs, especially housing subsidies, remain controversial even within the government.
Some officials stressed the political economy considerations of pre-empting populist
pressures and developing a middle class with strong interest in property rights, while other
officials criticized the open-ended nature of the program.

The mission discussed with the authorities their views on Kazakhstan’s
experience with Fund-supported programs (Box 3).The authorities’ assessment of
Kazakhstan’s experience with Fund programs was generally favorable. However, they noted
that performance criteria had in some cases been too detailed and that a streamlining of
conditionality would have increased its effectiveness. More flexibility on the side of the Fund
would have been helpful in complex negotiations and could have encouraged greater
ownership. The staff believes that Fund supported programs have contributed to the
development of macroeconomic policies that brought about stabilization and high economic
growth, although implementation was uneven. Medium-term growth performance would
have benefited from more vigorous completion of the structural reform agenda.

- 14 -

Box 3. Ex-Post Assessment of Longer-Term Program Engagement
During 1995–2000, the Fund approved one SBA and two EFF programs for Kazakhstan. Under the second EFF
program no purchases were made, and in May 2000, Kazakhstan repaid all outstanding obligations to the Fund,
amounting to SDR 295.8 million. In view of the country’s very strong balance of payments position, it is not
expected that Kazakhstan will request the use of Fund resources over the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, these
programs were classified as longer-term program engagement.
• On June 5, 1995, the Executive Board approved a Stand-by arrangement for Kazakhstan in the amount of
SDR 185.6 million, all of which were drawn.
• On July 17, 1996 the Fund approved a three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement for Kazakhstan
in support of the government’s medium-term economic reform program for 1996-98. Following the fifth
review on December 15, 1998, several performance criteria were missed, and the sixth review under the
arrangement was not completed, as an agreement on the measures necessary to bring the program back on track
could not be reached. The arrangement expired on July 16, 1999. Of the total amount of the arrangement of
SDR 309.4 million, SDR 154.7 million were drawn.
• On December 13, 1999 a second three-year EFF arrangement, in the amount of SDR 329.1 million, was approved
by the Executive Board. The authorities treated this agreement as precautionary. Discussions on the completion
of the first review, envisaged for end-June 2000, were not finalized. No review was completed and no purchases
were made under the arrangement, which was cancelled in February 2002.
The authorities’ assessment of Kazakhstan’s experience with Fund programs was generally favorable. However, in
terms of program design, they noted that performance criteria had in some cases been too detailed and that a
streamlining of conditionality would have increased its effectiveness. Moreover, the authorities expressed concerns
about the complexities of the negotiation process. Overall, more flexibility on the side of the Fund would have been
helpful in negotiations and could have encouraged greater ownership.
Some officials raised questions about the Fund’s immediate response to the 1998 Russian crisis, especially the
support for large-scale interventions to support the tenge in late 1998 and early 1999. They noted that this policy
had not prevented the sudden collapse of the national currency, with substantial real sector implications.
The staff believes that Fund supported programs have contributed to the development of macroeconomic policies that
brought about stabilization and high economic growth. Moreover, the authorities were largely receptive to Fund
policy advice, although it proved impossible to complete the first EFF. The policy dialogue, in combination with
substantial technical assistance, supported the authorities’ efforts to build institutional capacity at the National Bank
of Kazakhstan and in the key ministries.
The authorities appreciated the Fund’s contribution to the build-up of intellectual capacity in the NBK and the
Ministry of Finance, and regretted the more limited availability of advice following the change to surveillance status.
Program implementation has at times been uneven. During the initial stage of Fund programs, cooperation with the
authorities was affected adversely by lack of ownership of the program, largely as a result of vested interests. At a
later stage, the completion of the review under the second EFF program was held up by lack of agreement on an
appropriate macroeconomic framework and insufficient measures to address governance issues, especially with
regard to the budgetary aspects of resource based operations. Overall, the staff believes that Kazakhstan would have
benefited from more vigorous completion of the structural reform agenda, including decisive restructuring of
enterprises and enhanced transparency in resource extraction.
As regards the effectiveness of Fund surveillance since the end of the active program engagement, the authorities’
macroeconomic policies were largely in line with the views expressed by the Executive Board, although they resisted
the appreciation of the tenge, thereby constraining monetary policy.

- 15 -

B. Monetary Policy and Exchange Rate Issues
16.
The authorities noted that they were comfortable with the current pace of
monetary expansion, which they expect to slow somewhat in 2004. Nevertheless, they
were prepared to step up sterilization activities as necessary. In this context, NBK staff
indicated that, in the absence of sufficient amounts of government paper, they would be
ready to increase the amount of NBK notes issued to keep up with sterilization efforts, even
beyond the limited amount budgeted for 2004.
17.
Against the backdrop of large oil-related inflows, the authorities acknowledged
that a significant real appreciation of the tenge may become necessary. They indicated
that they were not at the current stage overly concerned about a potential strong real
appreciation of the tenge over the medium-term as a result of higher oil revenues. They
thought that, with appropriate policies, the ongoing modernization of the capital stock,
including human capital, would result in productivity gains that would be sufficient to
maintain competitiveness of the non-oil sector despite a real appreciation. For the period
immediately ahead, the authorities noted that they would be prepared to adjust their
intervention in the foreign exchange market as necessary to attain their inflation objective of
5–7 percent in 2004. The mission strongly endorsed the authorities’ policy to allow greater
exchange rate flexibility in order to strengthen the role of monetary policy.
18.
The authorities remained concerned about large-scale foreign borrowing by
commercial banks on monetary policy grounds, and because of its impact on
Kazakhstan’s external debt profile. Commercial banks have recently attracted external
longer-term funding through syndicated loans, thereby complicating sterilization operations
by the NBK. (In 2003, unaffiliated private sector debt increased by $3.2 billion.) While the
authorities were willing to take measures to limit such borrowings, they found it difficult to
implement them without affecting adversely the efficiency of the banking sector. Tax
measures, which limit the tax-deductible share of the cost of foreign borrowing, were
expected to yield first results by the end of the year. The authorities acknowledged that, in
spite of these measures, large-scale external borrowing by banks may continue in view of the
lower costs and longer maturities offered. The mission encouraged the authorities to consider
increasing reserve requirements for funds borrowed abroad and supported their intention to
liberalize capital outflows further.
19.
The authorities plan to adopt an inflation targeting regime by 2006. To this end,
the NBK has developed, together with the National Statistics Agency, a set of core inflation
indices, which are monitored closely. The mission cautioned that, at this stage, the absence
of a well established monetary policy framework, shallow financial markets, and the still low
level of monetization, implying the potential for surprises in money demand, were likely to
complicate monetary policy implementation. Moreover, large budget surpluses limited the
amount of government paper available for liquidity operations. NBK staff were presently
reviewing the development of new monetary instruments. The Ministry of Finance aimed to

- 16 -

issue 15-year bonds on a pilot basis later this year, and papers issued by the Development
Bank and the Mortgage Bank could be used for Open Market Operations.
C. Fiscal Issues
20.
The budget for 2004 projected a surplus of 0.1 percent of GDP (based on an
oil-price assumption of $22 per barrel). In early June, the authorities passed a
supplementary budget, based on an oil price of $27 per barrel, which provided for additional
expenditures of 1 percent of GDP,

1/ Medium-term fiscal policy plan for 2004-06.

If the authorities were to choose a non-oil deficit target in line with permanent income, the sustainable general
government budget deficit would be around 10 percent of GDP in 2004 and 2005 and would decline to around
5 percent by the end of the decade, assuming enhanced spending efficiency and stronger budgetary institutions
(see Chapter V of the Selected Issues paper accompanying this report).

- 17 -

domestic use of rising oil revenues will require stronger budgetary institutions and continued
budgetary reforms, the mission encouraged the government to make progress in this area and
to engage with the World Bank on public expenditure reviews. The authorities noted the
improvements to their expenditure management over the past years, which had reduced the
share of unspent budgetary allocations to below 3 percent of planned expenditures. They
pointed out that the medium-term budgetary framework, adopted in 2004, will further
increase the efficiency of government spending (Box 4). They also noted their intention to
delegate the allocation of education funds to the regional (rayon) level and the allocation of
health funds to the provincial (oblast) level. The objective would be to bring the allocation of
funds closer to the intended beneficiaries, with a view to increasing the accountability of
local authorities. However, some officials noted that the quality of local governments
remained poor.

Box 4. The Medium-Term Budgetary Framework
The 2004 budget is based on a three-year government program, which defines the overall goals on
the basis of two diverging macroeconomic scenarios. The main scenario projects GDP growth on the
order of 7–8 percent on average, inflation in the range of 4.5–5.5 percent, and growth in oil
production of 42 percent during the three-year period. The budget is expected to show a small
surplus of 0.5–1.0 percent of GDP.1 Under the low-case scenario, GDP growth is expected to slow
down to 4.0–4.7 percent. However, in line with rising oil prices, significant revisions are expected for
2005–07.
This approach is commendable as it outlines budgetary policy within a medium-term framework and
explicitly recognizes the risks to projections. In the future, a more detailed agenda, including specific
steps linked to defined targets could be useful. In defining the resource envelope, comprehensive fiscal
coverage should be ensured, including envisaged extra-budgetary funds and any potential quasi-fiscal
sources of financing or expenditures. Ideally, the medium-term strategy could assess the cost of the
proposed policies and the quality of expenditures, and analyze alternative scenarios.
______________________
1

The authorities’ budgetary presentation in a different format results in a projected deficit of around
1.5 percent of GDP in 2005, which will decrease in subsequent years. Larger budget surpluses in staff
projections for 2004–06 result from higher assumed oil revenues.

D. External Sector Issues
22.
The current account is expected to remain strong in 2004. The projected
deterioration in the services and income accounts will likely be offset by rising volumes of
oil exports and continued high oil prices. As the development of new oil fields continues,
FDI inflows are expected to remain substantial. External public debt as percent of GDP is
projected to decline further in 2004. Continued large-scale private sector borrowing could be
mitigated by higher amortization of intra-company loans in the oil sector.

- 18 -

23.
The mission underlined the importance of strengthening the financial system
to safeguard macroeconomic stability as the capital account continues to be liberalized.
While the rapid accumulation of private sector foreign debt continues, external debt
is expected to remain at a manageable level, given the large share of long-term and
intra-company loans. The mission encouraged the authorities to improve their debt
management, including by compiling debt data on a remaining maturity basis.6 The
authorities noted that they were establishing a centralized debt data management system,
expected to be operational by 2007. In line with their intention to fully open the capital
account by 2007, the authorities are implementing a three-step plan to liberalize (i) less
volatile long-term flows, such as outward FDI in foreign exchange; (ii) long-term portfolio
investments by residents; and (iii) all outward investments in domestic and foreign currency,
and deposits abroad.
24.
The mission inquired about the authorities’ approach to WTO accession. They
acknowledged that the WTO accession process had been slow over the past year owing to
continued disagreements with major trading partners on a number of issues, in particular the
level of protection for agriculture and the extent of market opening in certain services sectors
(Box 5). While trade liberalization remained on the policy agenda, progress had stalled in
recent years. Although the average tariff is low, there are 10 bands with considerable
dispersion.7 The mission recommended that trade liberalization should be intensified,
including converting specific and combined tariffs into ad valorem ones; reducing tariff
dispersion; refraining from contingency protection; removing registration requirements and
fees for foreign trade companies; and improving customs valuation procedures.
25.
Advancing regional integration was a key policy objective for the authorities.
While supporting this objective, the mission cautioned the authorities against the risks of
trade diversion. The authorities noted that they had no intention to pursue new regional
initiatives, as their current priority was to enhance existing regional arrangements (Box 5).
The mission welcomed the recent agreements on trade and transit with the Kyrgyz Republic,
China, and Pakistan, and emphasized that rigorous implementation would be needed to
achieve lasting benefits. In this context, the mission underlined that informal trade barriers
should be reduced, especially inspections at customs and en route; road transit charges; fees
for customs declaration; deposits of cargo value for transit traffic; duplicate certification
requirements; and wide-spread corruption in customs and transportation.
6

At end-2003, all public debt and about 83 percent of private sector debt were long-term. The non-guaranteed
debt/reserves ratio was 3.9, with non-affiliated debt accounting for 37 percent of total private sector debt and
intra-company loans accounting for the remaining 63 percent. As the latter normally do not have specified
amortization schedules and their repayment tends to coincide with favorable economic conditions, they have a
stabilizing effect on debt service capacity.

7

Kazakhstan’s average tariff has remained at about 8 percent (excluding non-ad valorem tariffs) since 1998,
when tariff reforms agreed under the EFF arrangement were not implemented. Some non-tariff measures and ad
hoc trade restrictions have continued. Since 1999, Kazakhstan has been rated “4” out of 10 on the Fund’s
Overall Trade Restrictiveness Index, where 1 means no restrictions.

- 19 -

Box 5. WTO Accession and Regional Trade Initiatives
At the recent sixth meeting of the Working Party (WP), WTO members gave a mixed assessment of
Kazakhstan’s progress toward WTO accession. While acknowledging the authorities’ efforts in legislation
and services negotiations, WP members denied their request for long transition phases before complying
fully with WTO agreements. The authorities’ insistence on the extensive use of safeguard measures and
emergency provisions attracted particular criticism. Tariff offers, including those on agriculture, were
deemed inadequate, and the authorities promised to return to the WTO with a new offer around mid-2004.
The authorities’ approach reflected their aim to protect certain domestic processing industries and
agriculture.
Kazakhstan continues to maintain strong trade links with other CIS countries, which account for
47 percent of its imports and 43 percent of its non-oil exports. The country is a member of the Eurasian
Economic Community (EAEC),1 but the harmonization of tariffs with other EAEC countries remains
incomplete. Intra-Community trade continues to be subject to a multitude of informal barriers, impairing
both ordinary and transit trade among Community members. The establishment in September 2003 of a
“Single Economic Space” including Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus has not yet contributed
significantly to trade liberalization in the region. Regional trade within Central Asia continues to be
hampered by a fractured pipeline network and inadequate surface infrastructure. Moreover, complex
barter arrangements involving seasonal trade in electricity and water, have proven inflexible and
non-transparent.
__________________________

Replacing the 1995 CIS Customs Union, the Eurasian Economic Community (EAEC) was founded in
2001 by Belarus, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, the Russian Federation, and Tajikistan.

E. Structural Reform
26.
The authorities’ structural reform agenda remains unfinished. In particular, the
difficult business climate impedes the development of small and medium-size enterprises.
The authorities noted the ongoing efforts to ease the tax burden faced by small enterprises,
enhance their access to credit, and simplify the regulatory environment. The mission
emphasized that second generation reforms in the area of institution building will be essential
to ensure adequate job creation outside the oil sector. Moreover, additional efforts are needed
to enhance public sector management, develop a high-quality public investment program,
strengthen the social safety net, and improve the physical infrastructure.
27.
As regards the financial system, the authorities largely agreed with the
recommendations of the follow-up FSAP mission. They recognized the distortionary
effects of administrative limits on interest rates set by the Deposit Insurance Fund, aimed to
discourage banks from offering high interest rates on deposits. The mission underscored the
need to complete the launching phase of the new supervisory agency by filling staff
vacancies and developing effective consolidated supervision practices. In view of increasing
foreign activities of Kazakhstani banks, the mission urged the FSA to reinforce cooperation
with financial supervisors in neighboring countries. At the request of the authorities, the
Fund will provide technical assistance for strengthening risk-management practices and
bringing prudential regulation up to EU standards by 2007.

- 20 -

28.
Anticipating a significant real appreciation of the tenge and a fall of the oil price
over the medium term, the authorities have stepped up their efforts to diversify the
economy. These involve, as initial stages of longer-term programs, the newly-established
specialized financial institutions and special funds, such as the Development Bank and the
Innovation Fund, and programs of sectoral subsidies, mainly in the housing sector. The
mission endorsed the authorities’ objective to build a more diversified economy, but
cautioned against relying on channeling resources to government-favored industries and
providing selective tax incentives. The authorities agreed that in order to reduce the high cost
of doing business in Kazakhstan, efforts should be intensified to reduce overregulation,
excessive inspections, procurement restrictions, poor delivery of government services, and
endemic corruption. In this context, they pointed out the positive effects of the moratorium
on inspections that was in effect in 2003.
29.
The authorities recognized that extensive poverty remained a problem. With the
support of international donor agencies, the authorities were currently developing a program
aimed to develop income generating skills through micro credit and training. Further pension
reform measures, focusing on support for uninsured elderly people were also expected to
contribute to poverty alleviation. The authorities intended to bolster the voluntary
contribution pillar in addition to the already established pay-as-you go and fully funded
mandatory contribution schemes.
F. Governance and Transparency
30.
Kazakhstan has supported Fund initiatives on data dissemination and
publication of reports. The quality of macroeconomic data is generally adequate for policy
analysis. The authorities subscribe to the SDDS and agreed to the publication in 2003 of the
data module ROSC and the fiscal ROSC. The reports for the 2003 Article IV consultation
were published, and it is expected that the 2004 consultation reports will also be published.
The authorities have agreed to the publication of the report for the 2004 FSAP update.
31.
Surveys indicate that corruption was prevalent in law enforcement, courts, and
customs and tax authorities. In December 2003, the Agency for the Fight Against
Economic and Corruption Crimes was established with a semi-autonomous status under the
Ministry of the Interior. The agency operates on the basis of the Anti-Corruption Law, passed
in 1998 and amended in 2003, which provides for criminal, administrative, and disciplinary
sanctions. The authorities were currently assessing anti-corruption legislation and measures
in a large number of countries, in order to learn from best practices.
32.
Kazakhstan’s oil sector has not been fully transparent. Contracts related to oil
production in Kazakhstan are neither published nor approved by parliament. The authorities
have so far not followed up on their earlier positive response to the U.K. Government’s
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). The mission encouraged the authorities
to enhance transparency in the oil sector, including through the publication of all new oil
related contracts.

- 21 -

G. Medium-Term Outlook and Vulnerability
33.
Kazakhstan’s medium-term outlook
remains highly favorable. Over the next 15 years,
Kazakhstan’s production of crude oil is projected to
triple to around 3½ million barrels per day, placing
the country among the top ten oil producers in the
world (assuming that Kazakhstan’s access to world
markets would be maintained). Large-scale
investment, mainly from abroad, continues to flow to
the oil and gas sectors. Medium-term prospects have
improved further following recent agreements on oil
and gas pipelines,8 aimed to enhance access to
western markets and China.9

increasing earnings of foreign investors, the current
account is expected to register deficits as from 2005. Despite larger projected capital
outflows, the capital account balance is expected to remain positive. In view of continued
high inflows from oil, the projections assume a gradual nominal appreciation of the tenge.
The authorities target a further deceleration of inflation, but achieving this objective may
prove difficult.

35.
The medium-term fiscal profile assumes that the government will adopt a
non-oil budget deficit targeting rule, with the aim to lower the non-oil budget deficit to
around 4 percent of GDP in the outer years. In line with falling world market prices for oil
from their current high levels, this would imply a drop in revenues by about 6 percent of
GDP, and only a small decrease in the expenditure ratio. The overall government balance is
expected to decline from a surplus of 1.6 percent in 2005 to a deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP in
2010.

A major slow-down in Chinese growth could have adverse effects on Kazakhstan, as China accounted for
13 percent of Kazakhstani exports in 2003.

- 22 -

36.
Kazakhstan’s external debt is projected to remain at comfortable levels over the
medium term. Although the debt stock is likely to increase over time, rapid GDP growth
and the appreciation of the tenge are expected to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio. Some
95 percent of the country’s debt is long-term, and 63 percent of non-guaranteed debt consists
of intra-company loans, which have no specified repayment schedule. Public debt (including
government guaranteed debt) has been declining as percent of GDP, and this trend is likely to
continue as the government shifts to domestic financing. Stress tests indicate that
Kazakhstan’s external debt would remain at a manageable level even if it faced multiple
negative shocks. Public sector domestic debt, amounting to only 4 percent of GDP, is
expected to increase somewhat as the government substitutes some foreign debt (including
assets accumulated in the NFRK) with domestic debt to support capital market
developments.10
37.
The assessment of medium-term prospects includes a low-case scenario with a
gradual decline in the oil price to $15/bbl by 2008. Under this assumption, economic
growth would fall to around 5 percent per year, as lower investment into the hydrocarbon
sector would entail lower production in the oil and associated sectors. With the non-oil fiscal
balance at 4 percent of GDP, the overall fiscal balance would move into a deficit of 3 percent
of GDP. The build-up of the NFRK would continue, mostly owing to the interest payments
and savings component, increasing just below 1 percent of GDP annually during 2007–10.
The substantial decline in oil exports could be partly offset by lower profit-related
repayments of intra-company loans. Even if the oil price were to remain at the level of
$15/bbl during 2008–10, the debt-to-GDP ratio would decline over time, albeit at a much
slower pace.

10

In view of the low level of public sector domestic debt, a separate fiscal sustainability analysis was not
conducted.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
Kazakhstan’s economy continues to grow rapidly, driven by the expansion of the
oil sector, and supported by a favorable external environment and sound
macroeconomic policies. The medium-term outlook remains highly favorable, with
projected annual growth of the economy on the order of 8 percent. However, poverty is a
serious concern, especially in the rural areas and among the elderly, and the generally
difficult business climate impedes the development of the small and medium-size private
sector.
39.
With the 2004 budget, the authorities have relaxed somewhat their tight fiscal
stance. The continuation of sizable fiscal surpluses in a country with large social needs and
no financing constraints could well make reforms––including the cautious use of the oil
wealth––politically unsustainable. Thus, the increase in expenditure is welcome, but greater
spending efficiency should be ensured by bolstering institutional capacities. The composition
of increased government expenditures gives rise to concerns, in particular where it is linked

- 24 -

to a more prominent role of the government in influencing allocative decisions in the
economy through the Development Bank, other state-owned developmental institutions, and
sectoral initiatives. The staff welcomes the authorities’ efforts to limit the potential for
introducing distortions through these programs.
40.
The establishment of a medium-term budgetary framework is commendable as
it outlines budgetary policy and explicitly recognizes the risks to projections. In defining
the resource envelope, comprehensive fiscal coverage should be ensured, including the
extra-budgetary funds, such as the social insurance fund.
41.
Depending on developments in money demand, the easing of the fiscal policy
stance may need to go hand in hand with sharply reduced foreign exchange market
purchases by the NBK. In this context, the authorities’ commitment to allow real
appreciation to ensure the attainment of the inflation objective is welcome. The authorities’
inflation objective of 5–7 percent per annum is appropriate.
42.
The NBK is preparing to adopt an inflation targeting regime by 2006. While the
ongoing work on a core inflation index and an inflation model are important steps, the
staff agrees with the authorities that further progress will be necessary in establishing a
well-functioning monetary policy framework and deepening financial markets. Therefore,
the target date will need to be treated flexibly.
43.
The NFRK has played an important role in protecting oil revenue and easing the
burden on monetary policy. It will be crucial to continue to safeguard the mounting wealth
in the NFRK through strict adherence to budgetary procedures and increased transparency,
including by publishing regularly the external audit report. The present rules governing the
NFRK could be strengthened by moving to a non-oil budget deficit target, and inflows to the
NFRK should be treated as budgetary income.
44.
Reforms of the financial sector have been carried further with the establishment
of the Financial Supervision Agency. In light of continued high credit growth and a
significant share of classified loans, internal risk management, including stress testing, needs
to be strengthened further. Adequate loan-loss provisions should cover unexpected losses.
Moreover, care should be taken to ensure that measures to control interest rates do not create
distortions; in any case, they could not be a substitute for more effective supervision. Risks to
pension funds, which are currently focused on high returns through short-term investments,
have to be addressed by both regulators and market participants. The authorities’ intention to
publish the FSAP update report is highly welcome.
45.
It will be important for Kazakhstan to maintain a diversified economy and avoid
overdependence on the oil sector. While the authorities have only recently started to set up
programs in support of these objectives, staff would suggest that a cautious approach be
followed. Reliance on import substitution policies and other activist industrial policies can
lead to distortions and serious misallocation of resources. Instead, a well thought-out public
sector investment program should be a priority. Moreover, a better investment climate is a

- 25 -

critical precondition for sustained and broad-based employment generation, in particular for
small and medium-size domestic and foreign investors. Overregulation, excessive
inspections, procurement restrictions, import content rules, restrictions on the employment of
foreign experts, transfer pricing regulations, poor delivery of government services, and
endemic corruption contribute to the high cost of doing business in Kazakhstan. The staff
urges the authorities to intensify their efforts in these areas.
46.
Kazakhstan could take advantage of its strong external position to liberalize the
trade system further. In particular, tariff dispersion should be reduced and non-tariff
barriers eliminated. It will also be important to improve trade facilitation, including by
implementing measures against wide-spread corruption in customs and transportation, and
through reductions in unnecessary requirements for documentation. Recent progress on trade
and transit arrangements with neighboring countries is most welcome. The authorities should
pursue WTO accession discussions vigorously.
47.
Kazakhstan has made significant progress with respect to data transparency
with the publication in 2003 of the fiscal and data module Reports on Observance of
Standards and Codes (ROSCs). The authorities are now implementing their agenda for
further improving the oversight and transparency of state institutions, building on the results
of the fiscal ROSC. It will be essential to further strengthen audit and procurement agencies
and to clarify intergovernmental fiscal relations. Continued wide dissemination of key
macroeconomic statistics would be welcome, including through official websites and by
publishing the staff report.
48.
Greater transparency in the oil sector, including in the context of the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), could yield important benefits. Making new
agreements with oil companies public and publishing regularly comprehensive information
about oil bonuses, privatization proceeds, and other payments secured should be a priority.
49.
With regard to the ex-post assessment of longer-term program engagement, staff
noted the authorities’ view that Kazakhstan’s experience with Fund programs had been
generally favorable, although greater flexibility on the side of the Fund would have been
helpful in complex negotiations and could have encouraged greater ownership. The staff
believes that Fund supported programs contributed to the development of macroeconomic
policies that brought about stabilization and high economic growth, although implementation
has been uneven.
50.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangements:
The currency of Kazakhstan is the tenge, which was introduced in November 1993.
The official exchange rate is determined on the basis of foreign exchange auctions
that are held daily. Auctions are held for U.S. dollars, euros, and Russian rubles, and
official rates are quoted for over thirty other currencies on the basis of cross-rates.
On April 4, 1999 the tenge was allowed to float freely but in practice has been kept
relatively stable since the latter part of 1999. On April 30, 2004, the rate was
T 138.19 per U.S. dollar. Nearly 2,000 exchange bureaus have been established

- 34 -

APPENDIX I

throughout Kazakhstan; the rates at these bureaus are very close to the auction rate,
and the spread between buying and selling rates is very small. The exchange system
is free from restrictions on payments and transfers for current international
transactions.
IX.

Article IV Consultation:
Kazakhstan is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The last consultation was
concluded on May 28, 2003 (see IMF Country Report 03/210).

FSAP Participation and ROSCS:
Kazakhstan participated in the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in 2000.
The Staff Report on the Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) was issued on
November 27, 2000 (FO/DIS/00/142). The FSSA included the following ROSC
modules: Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision, Core Principles
for Systemically Important Payment Systems, Code of Good Practices on
Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies, IOSCO Objectives and Principles
of Securities Regulation, IAIS Insurance Core Principles. An FSAP update mission
took place in February 2004. The fiscal transparency module was completed in
October 2002 and the final report published in April 2003. A data module mission
took place in April/May 2002, and its final report was published in March 2003.

XI.

Technical Assistance:
Kazakhstan has received considerable technical assistance and training by the Fund in
virtually every area of economic policy, including through about 75 technical
assistance missions provided during 1993–2003 by FAD, MFD, STA, LEG, and the
IMF Institute. In addition to short-term missions, the Fund has provided resident
advisors to the National Bank of Kazakhstan, to the Agency of Statistics of the
Republic of Kazakhstan, and to the Ministry of Finance. Other international agencies
and governments, including the World Bank, EU TACIS, EBRD, UNDP, OECD, also
are providing a wide variety of technical assistance.
The following list summarizes the technical assistance provided by the Fund to
Kazakhstan since 1995.

Monetary and Financial Systems
Technical assistance has enabled steady progress to be made in a number of arrears related to
monetary and exchange affairs, including banking legislation, central bank accounting,
payments system reform, central bank organization and management, foreign operations and
reserve management, banking supervision, monetary statistics, currency issuance, monetary
operations and money-market development. Since 1996 missions to Kazakhstan by the
Monetary and Financial Systems Department of the Fund have included:

Kazakhstan—Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of May 31, 2004)
Kazakhstan became a member of the World Bank and IDA in July 1992, and of the IFC in
September 1993. The Bank’s lending program has been curtailed in recent years as a result of
the country’s reduced borrowing needs. At present, there are 6 active projects with a total
commitment of $540 million, of which $302 million have been disbursed. The Bank is
preparing 4 new operations in support of the agricultural sector and the environment with an
expected financing envelope of $90 million.
A Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) is under preparation, focusing on knowledge transfer
(some of which embedded in lending operations) and a strategic partnership. It will build on
the $3 million three-year Joint Economic Research Program, which is co-financed by the
Government of Kazakhstan.
The IFC maintains 19 active operations, equivalent to total financing of $330 million,
including syndications in the financial sector, manufacturing, agribusiness, oil and gas, and
extending IFC’s Reach Program; to date, $121 million have been disbursed.
The Bank is assisting the government in attracting grants from the Global Environmental
Facility (GEF), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), and, together
with UNAIDS, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM).

- 38 -

APPENDIX III

Kazakhstan––Relations with the EBRD
(As of May 31, 2004)
As of December 31, 2003, the EBRD’s gross cumulative disbursements amounted to
€599 million. The current portfolio is composed of 32 projects with a total value of
€1.8 billion, of which €931 million are financed by the EBRD. The Bank expects to sign new
project agreements in Kazakhstan on the order of €200–300 million per year.
EBRD’s strategic priorities include (i) the advancement of commercial principles in public
sector infrastructure, including through non-sovereign lending; (ii) the promotion of
economic diversification through support for domestic and foreign investment, SMEs, and
trade liberalization; and (iii) the development of the financial sector in order to increase its
capital base, enhance its stability, encourage prudent credit expansion, and facilitate the
diversification of domestic financial assets.
Assistance to Kazakhstan focuses on infrastructure operations and the financial sector. In
March 2004, EBRD agreed to provide without sovereign guarantee $60 million to the
state-owned Kazakhstan Electricity Grid Operating Company for the construction of a new
electricity line facilitating the transmission of surplus power from north to south Kazakhstan
(co-financed with Raiffeisen Bank Österreich, Bayerische Landesbank, and Kazakhstan
Development Bank). Other infrastructure projects target the development of roads, railroads,
ports, airports, and telecommunications. In September 2003 EBRD provided a loan
amounting to €48 million to Kazakhtelecom as part of a larger support package involving
international banks and the donor community. EBRD also provided $119 million for the
rehabilitation of the 900-km road between Kazakhstan’s main port of Aktau on the Caspian
Sea and the regional center of Atyrau. In the area of banking, the Kazakhstan Small Business
Program has disbursed since 1998 close to 85,000 micro credits totaling $471 million. In
June 2003, EBRD purchased a 15 percent share of Kazkommertsbank, Kazakhstan’s largest
bank, for $30.6 million. The Bank also provides targeted technical assistance in the areas of
tariff reform and infrastructure.

- 39 -

APPENDIX IV

Kazakhstan––Relations with the Asian Development Bank
(As of May 31, 2004)
Kazakhstan became a member of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1994. As of
March 31, 2004, total loan commitments amounted to $501.6 million, covering
12 investment projects in agriculture, rural water supply, transportation, and education, as
well as policy-based program lending for special assistance, agriculture, and pension reforms.
At end-March 2004, total loan disbursements amounted to $383.5 million. In 2003, ADB
approved a $34.6 million loan for a rural water supply project, the first loan since 2000. A
new country strategy and program (CSP) was prepared in 2003. ADB sees knowledge
transfer as the main pillar of collaboration, with a modest investment program of about
one public sector project and one private sector investment project per year planned for
2004–05. Kazakhstan is no longer eligible for concessional resources from the Asian
Development Fund.
The ADB has provided Kazakhstan with TA grants in several sectors, including agriculture,
education, finance, pension reform, transportation, energy, water supply and sanitation, aid
coordination and management, public investment programming, and poverty reduction
planning and implementation. As of March 31, 2004, total TA commitments amounted to
$23.4 million, covering 50 projects.

- 40 -

APPENDIX V

Kazakhstan––Statistical Issues
The April 2002 data ROSC mission found that the quality of Kazakhstan’s macroeconomic
statistics had improved in recent years. Nevertheless, there were shortcomings in some
statistical practices that could potentially detract from the accurate and timely analysis of
economic and financial developments and the formulation of appropriate policies. Also,
agencies compiling national accounts, fiscal, monetary, and balance of payments statistics in
Kazakhstan could better coordinate investigation of intersectoral discrepancies.
On March 24, 2003 Kazakhstan became the 53rd subscriber to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS), marking a major step forward in the development of the
country’s statistical system. It is the first country to graduate from the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) to the SDDS, and the second country of the Commonwealth
of Independent States to subscribe to the SDDS.
Sector specific issues
In the area of national accounts, several weaknesses remain in both the quality of GDP
estimates by sector produced by the National Statistical Agency (NSA) and the quality and
timeliness of GDP estimates by expenditures. First, the quality of GDP estimates by
industry is affected by the poor coverage of production and financial statistics, particularly
concerning small enterprises and informal activities. Second, while some progress has been
made in making GDP estimates by final expenditure consistent with output-based
measures, there remain substantial shortcomings, particularly in the estimation of fixed
capital formation.
Data on prices conform to international standards. The consumer price index is calculated
for a basket of 329 items using a weighting system based on an annually revised Household
Budget Survey. The index covers 19 regions (oblasts) and is calculated on a monthly basis.
In addition, a provisional index is compiled weekly, based on a smaller basket of consumer
goods. The producer price index is a Laspeyres type index with weights of previous years
and a price reference period of December of the previous year. Appropriate chain-linking
procedures are used for linking the data to produce long-term series. The National Statistical
Agency and the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) are in the process of developing a core
inflation index.
The coverage and quality of data on wages and employment have improved. In addition to
agriculture, industry, and services, collective farms and joint ventures have been included in
the survey used for the wage data. Two sets of unemployment data are provided by the
Ministry of Labor—the monthly data on unemployment covering only those who are
officially unemployed and receiving benefits; and data on hidden unemployment, comprising
workers on compulsory leave or on involuntary part-time status.
Most real sector data are published in a monthly statistical bulletin issued by the NSA,
which is made available to other government authorities.

- 41 -

APPENDIX V

As a result of extensive technical assistance, the quality of fiscal data has improved, in
particular following the consolidation, in 1999, of most extrabudgetary and social
security funds into the fiscal accounts and the provision of more detailed expenditure data
on a quarterly basis. However, the coverage of oil revenues, particularly royalties, is not
transparent and may be undervalued to a significant degree. Progress has also been made in
the establishment of a classification of the fiscal accounts consistent with the Fund’s
government finance statistics (GFS) methodology. However, as a result of the reorganization
of the public sector, including the re-definition of budgetary units, difficulties have arisen
with regard to the recording and reporting of expenditure arrears. Since 1997, the
authorities have reported detailed data for publication in the GFS Yearbook. The latest data
reported for publication cover consolidated general government and are presented using the
new template consistent with the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001. The Ministry
of Finance also provides monthly indicators (general government) for publication in
International Financial Statistics (IFS).
The existing framework for compiling monetary statistics generally conforms with
recommended Fund methodology, and data are compiled on a timely basis. Steps are being
taken by the NBK to further improve the quality and coverage of data. In particular, the
chart of accounts for commercial banks has been revised to enable the NBK to distinguish
sectors and financial instruments in accordance with the Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual. The NBK intends to extend institutional coverage to compile a financial sector
survey, which is important in light of the exclusion of the Development Bank and EXIM
Bank from the monetary survey. However, the authorities have not implemented
recommendations of past money and banking statistics missions regarding the use of
residency criteria as defined in the Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5). Not
all financial assets held by commercial banks are valued at current market prices, and there
are inconsistencies among banks in recording syndicated lending. These factors can distort
the measure of net foreign assets and credit to the domestic economy. Also, data revisions in
the monetary statistics are not synchronized with those for the International Investment
Position and balance of payments statistics. MCD and STA staff are working with the
authorities to harmonize the presentation of monetary statistics for both the area department
and IFS purposes.
In the area of balance of payments, the overall quality and timeliness of data are
satisfactory. Considerable progress has been made in implementing the Fund technical
assistance recommendations to address two major deficiencies. First, the coverage of trade
data has been improved through a survey to determine the volume of shuttle trade and travel
expenses. The NBK has also worked closely with relevant agencies to update the ratios used
for adjusting c.i.f. imports to an f.o.b. basis. Nevertheless, the timeliness of trade data
remains an issue; improvements can be expected with the continuing computerization of
customs administration. Second, the NBK has initiated changes and additions to the Law of
the Republic of Kazakhstan “On State Statistics” to improve the coverage of international
operations of branch offices of foreign companies and thus bring foreign direct investment
statistics in line with the standards set forth in BPM5. In particular, work is continuing to

- 42 -

APPENDIX V

ensure the correct treatment of construction services provided by foreign companies that
operate local branch offices. A Data ROSC mission in April/May 2002 also noted some other
shortcomings in the compilation of balance of payments statistics. These shortcomings
include (1) commercial banks defining nonresidents on a legal basis rather than on the BPM5
principle, which affects data reporting by these banks for balance of payments purposes, and
(2) discrepancies between balance of payments and other macroeconomic statistics.

Background
Kazakhstan’s economy continues to expand rapidly, with average real growth of more than
10 percent over the past three years, and an estimated 9.1 percent in the first quarter of 2004.
Economic growth has been driven by increasing oil production, supported by high oil prices and
rising foreign investments. The production of oil and gas condensate reached 51.3 million tons
in 2003, an increase of 9 percent over the preceding year. Led by the petroleum sector, other
key sectors such as services, manufacturing, and construction have also shown significant
gains. Labor market trends have been favorable, with significant gains in employment since
2000. In 2003, the unemployment rate fell from 9.3 percent to 9.0 percent. Real wages have
grown in line with real GDP. Notwithstanding the reduction in the share of the population living
below the poverty line, poverty remains a serious problem, in particular in rural areas and
among the elderly.
Growth in monetary and credit aggregates remained high in 2003, mainly because foreign
exchange purchases by the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) were not fully sterilized.
As a result of ongoing remonetization, inflationary pressures have remained subdued and the
inflation rate remained below 7 percent over the past three years. The level of dollarization of
bank assets and liabilities has continued to decline.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

Following the adoption of a new monetary policy framework in 2003, the NBK now treats price
stability as the key monetary policy objective. With the aim to prevent a rapid appreciation of the
tenge, the NBK continued its large-scale purchases of foreign exchange. Since the beginning of
2003, reflecting the movements in the U.S. dollar/euro rate, the tenge has appreciated against
the U.S. dollar by about 13 percent, but depreciated sharply against the euro. The tenge
remained largely stable against the Russian ruble during 2001–03, appreciating somewhat
against this currency in early 2004.
With a general government surplus of 3 percent of GDP in 2003, fiscal policy continued to play
a key role in containing aggregate demand. Measured by the non-oil budget deficit, the fiscal
stance remained largely unchanged compared to 2002. The strong performance was supported
by an increase in non-oil sector revenues resulting from higher corporate profitability in non-oil
industries and the services sector, and one-off payments related to the oil and gas sectors.
The rise in expenditures mainly resulted from higher outlays for infrastructure and construction
of the new capital Astana. A substantial share of the fiscal surplus and privatization receipts was
saved in the National Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan (NFRK). The authorities have
redirected a significant share of tax revenues from mining and oil operations—previously
earmarked for the NFRK—to the financing of the 2004 budget. The new single treasury account
became fully operational on May 1, 2004.
The external current account was essentially balanced in 2003, improving by more than
3 percent of GDP compared with the previous year. Exports of goods and services increased
sharply because of higher oil and metal prices and an increase in non-oil export volumes of
14 percent, while the expansion of imports kept pace with GDP growth. Gross foreign direct
investment inflows reached a record level, although net inflows rose only slightly as a result of
accelerated debt repayments by foreign investors. Official international reserves increased to
$6.5 billion at end-May 2004, equivalent to 4.5 months of import coverage; in addition, the
NFRK balance reached $3.7 billion. Public external debt rose somewhat in U.S. dollar terms,
but fell to 12 percent of GDP, continuing the trend seen over the past few years. Kazakhstan’s
official sector became more significant as a net creditor to the rest of the world. Standard &
Poor’s upgraded Kazakhstan’s Foreign Currency Sovereign Credit Rating to investment
grade/BBB-in May 2004.
Structural reforms are well advanced compared to other countries in the region, but the
implementation of the reform agenda has slowed somewhat since 2000. Outside the oil sector,
the business climate remains difficult, notably for small and medium-scale enterprises and
foreign investors; lack of transparency in law enforcement, customs, and the tax authorities is
considered a significant impediment to private sector development.
Reforms of the financial sector were bolstered by the establishment of an independent Financial
Supervisory Agency in early 2004. Legislative reforms were carried further with the introduction
of consolidated supervision requirements. The recent Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) update mission commended the positive developments since the 2000 FSAP, while
highlighting some remaining risks to the financial sector. In line with this mission’s
recommendations, a draft law on Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism
(AML/CFT) has been prepared.

Progress with trade liberalization has stalled in recent years, including with regard to WTO
accession. Although the average tariff is low, there are 10 bands with considerable dispersion.
Advancing regional integration is a key policy objective for the authorities, who recently
concluded agreements on trade and transit with the Kyrgyz Republic, China, and Pakistan.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Kazakhstan for continued prudent macroeconomic policies,
which, supported by high oil prices and increasing foreign investment, have led to strong
economic performance, broad-based economic growth, and the rapid accumulation of
international reserves and assets in the National Fund. In view of a highly favorable mediumterm outlook, Directors emphasized that the main policy challenges facing Kazakhstan are to
prudently manage the country’s substantial petroleum wealth, and to undertake the structural
reforms necessary for sustainable broad-based economic and social development.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ more relaxed fiscal stance in the 2004 budget, which
increased outlays on pensions and wages, and reduced the rates of the value-added tax,
income tax, and social security tax. In view of rapidly rising revenues from oil, they underlined
the need to increase spending on education, health care, anti-poverty programs, and
infrastructure development, as well as the importance of enhancing institutional capacities, in
collaboration with the World Bank, to ensure greater spending efficiency. Directors cautioned,
however, against any tendency toward an excessively pro-cyclical budget and recommended
the adoption of a non-oil fiscal deficit target as an important step to guide fiscal policy in the face
of volatile oil and gas revenues. They welcomed the establishment of a medium-term budgetary
framework, stressing the importance of linking it to the annual budget.
Directors noted that inflation has been contained despite significant growth in monetary
aggregates as this growth was accompanied by rapid financial deepening. They advised the
authorities, however, to monitor developments in money markets carefully and to continue
developing tools to manage excess liquidity to ensure that the easing of fiscal policy does not
threaten the inflation objective. In this regard, they noted the supporting role of a more flexible
exchange rate policy, which accords with the authorities’ intention to adopt an inflation targeting
regime over the medium term. In view of Kazakhstan’s strong balance of payments position,
buoyed by increasing oil revenues, Directors urged the NBK to reduce its purchases of foreign
exchange and allow some real appreciation of the currency.
Directors commended the authorities for their prudent management of increasing oil revenues,
noting that the NFRK, which accumulates excess oil revenues, has played a crucial role in
easing the burden on monetary policy and reducing pressure for an appreciation of the
exchange rate. They urged the authorities to safeguard the assets of the NFRK through
enhanced transparency in its operations and the regular release of external audit reports.
Directors called on the authorities to ensure that the rules governing the NFRK are aligned with
the budget. They encouraged the authorities to enhance transparency in the extractive
industries, including by publishing information about all new oil-related contracts and payments,
and through the adoption of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.

Directors observed that Kazakhstan would benefit from developing a diversified economy by
avoiding overdependence on the oil sector, and referred in this regard to lessons from other
resource intensive countries. They encouraged the authorities, in addition to prudently
managing petroleum wealth, to strengthen the competitiveness of the non-oil economy by
adopting measures to enhance productivity, and as a starting point, to develop a well thoughtout public sector investment program with a focus on infrastructure investment. Directors
cautioned the authorities against allowing state-owned developmental initiatives to take a more
prominent role in allocative decisions in the economy, and urged them to adopt measures to
reduce the potential for these programs to distort economic decisions.
Directors encouraged the authorities to press ahead further with the implementation of their
structural reform agenda. In this regard, they emphasized the overarching importance of
improving the overall business climate by strengthening public administration and the judiciary,
and by fighting corruption. They called on the authorities to adopt measures to improve the
investment climate for small- and medium-sized enterprises, with a view to creating more
employment. Directors encouraged the authorities to take advantage of the positive economic
environment to strengthen their efforts to reduce poverty, especially in the rural areas and
among the elderly. They also welcomed the adoption of a land code, which allowed private land
ownership.
Directors commended the authorities for their continued progress with financial sector reforms
and the update of the 2000 FSAP, emphasizing the importance of the establishment of the
Financial Supervision Agency in early 2004. They encouraged the authorities to strengthen
further their systems of consolidated supervision and internal risk management, in view of
continued high credit growth and foreign borrowing by commercial banks, and to enhance
supervision of the non-bank financial sector, as recommended by the FSAP update mission.
Directors stressed the importance of reducing distortions in credit markets through adequate
prudential and market conforming measures. A few Directors also encouraged the authorities to
consider temporarily raising reserve requirements for funds borrowed abroad in order to
mitigate the significant increase in foreign borrowing by commercial banks. Finally, they urged
the authorities to pass AML/CFT legislation, in line with international standards.
Directors encouraged the authorities to take advantage of their strong external position to
liberalize the trade system further. They welcomed recent progress on trade and transit
arrangements with neighboring countries and agreed that Kazakhstan could play a major role in
facilitating regional trade by reducing non-tariff barriers and removing obstacles to trade in
transportation and customs. Directors called on the authorities to pursue WTO accession
discussions vigorously.
In the context of the ex-post assessment of longer-term program engagement, Directors
welcomed the authorities’ generally favorable assessment of Kazakhstan’s experience with
Fund programs, while noting that performance had been affected by some differences in views
regarding economic policies at certain stages.
Directors commended the authorities for their progress with respect to improving data
transparency, in general, and by subscribing to the Special Data Dissemination Standard and
publishing the fiscal and data Reports on the Observance of Standards and Codes in 2003.
