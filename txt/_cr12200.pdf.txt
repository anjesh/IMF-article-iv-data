STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
May 24, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context: Economic conditions remain favorable and there has been little impact to date
from the European crisis. Zambia has achieved sustained high growth and
macroeconomic stability over the last decade, but poverty remains high. Inflation has
declined to single-digit levels, international reserves have grown to a comfortable position,
and debt is low. The key policy challenge is how to make growth more inclusive.
Outlook for 2012: Growth is expected to remain robust in 2012 at around 7.7 percent and
inflation to remain close to 6 percent. The authorities plan to widen the fiscal deficit (but
reduce net domestic borrowing) and have tightened monetary policy in line with achieving
these objectives.
Risks: The principle downside risks are policy slippages that could arise from a failure to
implement measures needed to meet their 2012 budget deficit target or a larger than
envisaged global downturn that substantially reduces world copper prices. Large deficits in
a government pension fund, below cost recovery energy pricing, and contingent liabilities
also pose medium-term risks.

Promoting inclusive growth will require reforms on a number of fronts while
simultaneously continuing to safeguard macroeconomic stability. These reforms
include creating space for growth enhancing and poverty reducing spending;
improving access to financial services for the unbanked population; and boosting the
agriculture sector and other labor intensive activities.

ZAMBIA

BACKGROUND
1.
Zambia has achieved high and
sustained growth and macroeconomic
stability over the past decade, but poverty
remains high. Real GDP growth averaged
5.2 percent in 2000–10 (or 3.1 percent per
capita); inflation declined from 30 percent to
single digits; debt declined sharply; and
international reserves increased markedly.

intensive or urban-based sectors like mining,
construction and services. Per capita
agricultural growth—a key factor for the rural
population—lagged for most of the period.
Moreover, policies that kept maize prices high
disadvantaged the urban poor and the many
poor smallholders that are net buyers of maize
in 2008–10 when agriculture growth was
strong.2

However, the 2011 Ex-Post
Assessment (EPA) found that despite this
strong macroeconomic outcome, extreme
poverty remained high—about 60 percent
of the population still lived below the
poverty line in 2010.1 The EPA found that
economic growth has not sufficiently
benefitted the areas and sectors where the
poor are most numerous. This may reflect a
concentration of growth in highly capital1

IMF Country Report No. 11/197. The EPA, which
assessed Zambia’s performance during the 2004–07
and 2008–11 Enhanced Credit Facility arrangements,
also found that the program performance had been
strong.

2005 and 2008 respectively.

3.
The EPA also found that despite
weathering the 2008–09 global financial
crisis well, Zambia could do more to reduce
vulnerabilities to future shocks. Achieving
sustainably higher and more inclusive growth
would require entrenching macroeconomic
stability, improving human capital and
infrastructure, and diversifying the economy. In
this context, the EPA concluded that policies
should focus on: (i) reversing declines in capital

spending and strengthening public
infrastructure; (ii) mobilizing revenues;
(iii) sustaining the recently achieved low to
moderate levels of inflation; and (iv) further

developing the financial sector. The
Article IV discussions centered on these issues
and on how to achieve a more broad-based
inclusive growth more generally.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
4.
Macroeconomic performance in
2011 was positive, with robust growth and
declining inflation (Figure 1).






Real GDP is estimated to have grown by
6½ percent, driven by a record maize
harvest and bank credit growth of about
30 percent.
Inflation declined to 7.2 percent at end2011, broadly in line with the authorities’
target, and has declined further to
6.0 percent in February 2012. The
monetary policy stance was eased in late
2011 with a reduction in both the reserve
requirement and liquid asset ratios. The
kwacha has depreciated by 7 percent
against the U.S. dollar since September
2011, likely reflecting the easing of
monetary conditions in Zambia and shifts
in foreign portfolio investment flows to
other East African markets in search of
higher yields, and possibly some
perceptions of a less favorable investment
climate (Figure 2).
Despite copper prices rising to record
highs, the external current account surplus
narrowed from 7.1 percent to 1.3 percent
of GDP, mainly reflecting a strong
expansion in imports and a decline in

grants. Still, gross international reserves
rose above $2 billion for the first time ever,
equivalent to 3 months of prospective
imports (Figure 1).


Preliminary data suggest that the fiscal
deficit of the central government remained
flat at around 3 percent of GDP in 2011,
reflecting a large expansion in electionrelated current spending and public
investment being offset by one-off
payment of mining tax arrears (Figure 3).



The authorities’ 2012 economic
program aims to increase growth while
keeping inflation below 7 percent. Real
GDP is projected to rise by 7.7 percent,
reflecting strong growth in copper
production and non-maize agriculture, and
an expansionary fiscal policy. The 2012
budget targets a deficit of 4.1 percent of
GDP and a significant increase in
investment. More than half of budget
financing is expected to come from a
sovereign bond issue, and net domestic
financing is targeted to remain low at
about 1 percent of GDP. With a slight
tightening of monetary policy, inflation is
projected to remain around 6 percent in
2012.

5.
There are near-term downside risks.
Key risks arise from the uncertain prospects for
the global economy that could lower copper
prices and from domestic policies. Although
the crisis in Europe has had little spillover to
the Zambian economy to date, and mining
companies are moving forward with ambitious
plans to expand their operations, a further
deterioration in the global economic
conditions could squeeze trade credit lines;
reduce demand for Zambian exports; and
lower copper prices. On domestic policies,
0.8 percent of GDP in fiscal measures could be
needed to ensure that the fiscal, inflation, and
reserve targets are met, especially if much
needed maize sector reforms are delayed;
while careful implementation of planned
financial sector reforms will be necessary to
safeguard financial sector stability. The
perception of a less favorable investment
climate is also a risk as there are indications
that some early pronouncements had led to

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

uncertainties about the new government’s
policy intentions.3
Authorities’ Views
6.
The authorities had a broadly similar
view on the outlook and risks. There was
agreement on the need to continue to build
buffers to deal with a possible sharp decline in
copper prices given the uncertain prospects
for the global economy. Regarding market
perceptions about the investment climate, they
noted the measures taken by the president to
stop unauthorized statements by government
officials that did not reflect the views of the
Cabinet, and restated their intention to
maintain current policies that promote the
development of the private sector as the key
driver of economic growth under secure
property rights and the rule of law.

PROMOTING INCLUSIVE GROWTH AND REDUCING
VULNERABILITIES
7.
Over the medium term, the
authorities aim to sustainably raise growth
and employment and reduce poverty, while
maintaining macroeconomic stability.
Growth is targeted at around 8 percent a year,
inflation at around 5 percent, net domestic
financing at around 1 percent, and the fiscal
deficit at around 2½ percent of GDP, which is
consistent with public debt remaining below
25 percent of GDP.
8.
Achieving these outcomes will
require strong macroeconomic policies and
reforms in a number of areas:



Fiscal discipline to complement monetary
policy efforts to achieve the medium-term
inflation objectives without crowding out
private sector support;



Fiscal reforms to create space for increased
capital spending, improve public financial
management, and strengthen incentives
for formal sector development;

3

This reason was cited by one international rating
agency for downgrading Zambia’s rating outlook in
February this year.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

ZAMBIA



Financial sector reforms to improve the
sector’s role in facilitating development;



Agriculture sector reforms to reduce the
dependence on maize and promote
poverty reduction; and



Other reforms designed to improve the
business climate and promote private
investment, especially in labor intensive
activities in the formal sector.

The staff’s medium-term macroeconomic
projections describe one scenario in which
these targets are met (Figure 4).

9.
Staff developed an alternative
scenario that shows the consequences of
not undertaking these policy adjustments
(see Figure 5). In that no-adjustment scenario,
relatively low non-mining revenues and
steadily rising transfers for the maize support
program and the public pension scheme limit
the ability to scale up public capital spending.
Growing fiscal deficits also crowd out credit to
the private sector. As a result, growth reverts
to the 5–6 percent range, and rising domestic
debt and lower-than-recommended
international reserve accumulation increase
vulnerabilities.

A. Creating Fiscal Space
10.
Fiscal policy must walk a fine line
between building buffers against a fragile
global economy and contingent liabilities,
the need to prioritize growth-enhancing
expenditures, and maintaining
macroeconomic stability. Declining aid and
potentially volatile copper revenues increase
the urgency of enhancing domestic revenue
mobilization and reorienting spending to
create the needed fiscal space to satisfy those
fiscal policy objectives.
11.
The authorities’ 2012 budget is in
line with these objectives, but the
authorities have yet to outline specific

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

policy measures to achieve the budget
targets. Staff estimates that fiscal measures of
about 0.8 percent of GDP would be needed to
meet the budget target. The budget had
underestimated the costs of the maize
marketing support program (by 0.2 percent of
GDP); the fertilizer support program
(0.3 percent of GDP); and transfers to fund
public pension benefits (0.4 percent of GDP)
that would only be partly offset by higher
revenues (0.1 percent of GDP). In addition, in
April, the government granted higher-thanbudgeted increases in basic salaries to
government employees 0.9 percent of GDP),

which will be offset by eliminating a number of
allowances for civil servants, and cuts in other
recurrent expenditures.4 Given the results of
the “no-adjustment” scenario, staff
emphasized the importance for maintaining
macroeconomic stability of implementing
measures to secure the budget deficit target.
Reorienting spending
12.
The marketing and fertilizer support
programs for the maize sector have become
too costly and hampered diversification of
the agricultural sector. The combined costs
of these programs grew from 1.2 percent of
GDP in 2009 to 2.7 percent in 2011. Staff noted
that reforms envisaged during the recent ECF
to reduce fiscal costs and the government’s
involvement in maize marketing had not yet
been taken and urged that reforms be
implemented before the 2012 season starts in
May.
13.
Staff warned of the need to
minimize fiscal risks arising from the
current petroleum and electricity pricing
policies. It argued for the reinstatement of the
automatic petroleum price adjustment
mechanism as soon as possible. Substantial
subsidy costs may be accumulating as prices
appear to have been below full cost recovery
since October 2011 when prices were last
adjusted.5 There is also the risk of a future
build-up of contingent liabilities arising from
electricity generation public-private4

The wage adjustment in 2012 also reflects the effects
of the ongoing public service pay reform and involves
moving certain allowances to the base wage for a
more transparent assessment of compensation with
respect to grade and performance.

These costs would be reflected in balance sheet

partnerships for new power plants under
construction or being planned that have
guaranteed purchase agreements based on
break-even even tariffs that are more than
30 percent above current tariffs. Staff
recommended accelerating the
implementation of the multi-year electricity
tariff framework aimed at raising tariffs to full
cost-recovery levels (which has been slower
than originally planned), and introducing of
lifeline tariffs to protect the most vulnerable
customers.
14.
A reform of the Public Service
Pension Fund (PSPF) is also needed to
ensure fiscal sustainability. Staff estimates
that budget transfers to fill the funding gap for
pension benefits payable from this fund
together with the normal pension
contributions of the government would reach
0.9 percent of GDP in 2012 and, in the absence
of reforms, could rise to 2 percent of GDP by
2015.6
Mobilizing Revenues
15.
There is room to significantly raise
revenues to help create fiscal space. Both
with respect to mining and non-mining
revenues, Zambia does not compare favorably
with its comparators. The authorities have
increased the resources allocated to the
Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) in the 2012
budget, including to the mining unit. However,
additional steps to increase technical capacity,
including information management and audit
functions (especially of mining companies) will
be needed.
6

One reason for the cash flow deficit of the PSPF is
that no new entrants are being admitted to the
scheme. New entrants take part in the National
Pension Scheme, which was started in 2000 and
currently runs large cash surpluses.

On tax policy, the authorities
doubled the royalty rate for copper
production in the 2012 budget.7 Staff’s
analysis of the current mining regime suggests
that the average effective tax rate is relatively
high (Figure 6), but that there is scope to
improve the progressivity of the regime
(Annex II). On the VAT, staff argued for
substantially reducing exemptions and on
corporate income taxes, for streamlining the
use of incentives to ensure that they are
aligned with the government’s objective of
promoting inclusive growth.



Maize marketing and fertilizer support
program. The authorities aim to improve
the targeting of the fertilizer program to
the neediest farmers while broadening the
scope to include non-maize farmers; scale
back government’s role in maize marketing
to allow the private sector to take the lead;
and limit government maize purchases to
that required to maintain food security
stocks.



Public Service Pension Fund. The authorities
are contemplating a reduction in the lumpsum benefits paid up front; and accepting
new entrants into the pension scheme
without jeopardizing the solvency of the
other main public pension fund.

The authorities admitted that securing
Cabinet-level support for these reforms
could prove challenging. At the same time,
they were optimistic that yields from tax
administration reforms, which were supported
by Fund TA and focused on improving
technical capacity, would yield higher-thanbudgeted revenues. The authorities indicated
that following the increase in royalty rates,
they did not want to implement any further
changes to the copper fiscal regime for the
time being to avoid any negative impact on
the investment climate. They did not indicate
any specific contingency plans in the event
that the tax administration or expenditure
reforms failed to yield the expected savings.

B. Structural Reforms for Improved Fiscal Management
18.
Public financial management
reforms will be crucial to improve
budgetary planning and execution, and
efficiently scale up capital spending. Staff
recommended a gradual scaling up of capital
expenditures to ensure that the authorities
have adequate time to build their technical
expertise, including to evaluate and implement
projects. Moreover, shifting from the current
decentralized process for appraising and
prioritizing capital expenditure projects to a
centralized framework should help reconcile
competing funding demands with available
resources while ensuring consistency with the
government’s policies and objectives.
19.
With Zambia set to access
international capital markets, it will be
important to develop a comprehensive debt
management strategy. While total borrowing
should be guided by the medium-term fiscal
strategy and debt sustainability considerations,
the authorities should develop a strategy to
guide their decisions on the different types
and quantities of debt they incur. As part of
their 2012 funding strategy, the authorities
plan to issue a sovereign bond—Zambia’s first
external bond issue. Staff’s debt sustainability
analysis (DSA) suggests that the bond issue
should have no material impact on debt
dynamics: all debt indicators remain below the
critical thresholds and the risk of debt distress
should remain small.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

20.
Contingent liabilities of the public
sector, especially the operations of the
state- owned enterprises, need to be
monitored more closely. The government of
Zambia has interest in 39 state-owned
enterprises, the majority of which are not
profitable. Some of these enterprises borrow
from commercial banks with government
guarantees and/or have large outstanding tax
arrears.
Authorities’ Views
21.
The authorities noted that, with
technical assistance from donors and
international financial institutions, they
have been focusing on improving public
financial management. They plan to
complete the implementation of IFMIS and
Treasury Single Account by 2013 and have
prepared a new Public Expenditure
Management and Financial Accountability
strategy, with prioritizing agreed. To
strengthen debt management, they intend to
restructure their International Debt
Management department in tandem with a
planned restructuring of the Ministry of
Finance and Planning. They are also preparing
a coherent state ownership policy to enhance
performance monitoring of state-owned
enterprises, enforce provision of adequate
information and disclosures, and provide a
legislative framework to address weaknesses in
governance.

C. Enhancing Monetary Policy Formulation and Implementation to Anchor
Stability
22.
The BOZ is changing its monetary
policy framework to better support the
objective of achieving and maintaining low
and stable inflation. Effective April 2, 2012,
they introduced the BOZ policy rate—initially
set at 9 percent centered within a 400 basis
point band for the interbank rate, and to be
reviewed monthly—to replace reserve money
as BOZ’s main monetary policy tool. This is
part of their strategy to create a more flexible
monetary policy framework, improve the
interbank market, enhance bank competition,
and possibly formally adopting full-fledged
inflation targeting sometime in the future. Staff
welcomed the increased emphasis on
stabilizing short-term interest rates, but noted
that the trading band is wide and that
improvements to BOZ’s daily liquidity
management operations would be needed to
keep overnight interbank rates close to the
policy rate.
23.
The authorities’ official target is to
keep inflation below 7 percent in 2012 and
declining further to 5 percent in the
medium term. In this context, and to reduce
inflation volatility, the Bank of Zambia (BOZ)
plans to operationally aim at keeping inflation
around 6 percent in 2012. Headline inflation is
currently around 6 percent, but there are risks
that inflationary pressures could increase as a
result of the recent months’ depreciation of
the currency, and any delays in fiscal measures
to secure the budget target. For this reason,
signaling a tightening of the monetary policy
stance, the BOZ set the new policy rate 200
basis points above the prevailing interbank

rate. Staff noted that the authorities should
remain vigilant and stand ready to tighten
monetary policy further as needed.
Authorities’ Views
24.
The authorities agreed that there
may be short-term inflation pressures,
particularly from the lagged effects of the
recent exchange rate depreciation. They
argued that inflationary pressures may be
moderated by an expected slow-down in
domestic food inflation, and that the
introduction of the policy rate, and associated
monetary policy tightening, should provide
financial markets with a credible and stable
anchor for setting of interest rates and help
better anchor inflation expectations. They
pointed out that, with Fund TA, a plan to
increase technical capacity to underpin the
setting of the policy rate and improve
monetary policy implementation was already
being implemented. Furthermore, they noted
that monetary aggregates would continue to
play a key role in assessing the monetary
policy stance and setting the policy rate.

D. Exchange Rate Policy and Building International Reserves
25.
The flexible exchange rate regime
has served Zambia well during a period of
several large external shocks. Staff’s updated
exchange rate assessment suggests that the
real effective exchange rate remains broadly in
line with macroeconomic fundamentals.
However, Zambia’s Doing Business Indicators
suggest that there is a need for improvements
in a number of non-price competitiveness
areas (Annex IV).

mitigation benefits of holding reserves against
the financial cost of reserves, suggests
that increasing the reserve coverage to around
4–4½ months of imports over the medium
term would be appropriate in light of Zambia’s
vulnerabilities to external shocks (Annex III).

26.
Stronger international reserve
coverage would provide an added buffer.
Although international reserves are at record
levels, import coverage is still lower than in
many comparable countries. Staff
recommended that the authorities continue to
strategically aim to build reserves further over
the medium term—as favorable conditions
present themselves—as a buffer against a
possible sharp decline in copper prices.

Authorities’ Views
27.
The authorities agreed with the
staff’s exchange rate assessment. They
reiterated their commitment to the floating
exchange rate regime, and concurred on the
strategy to increase the reserve coverage
further.

E. Promoting Financial Sector Development to Support Growth
28.
The banking sector generally
remains sound and profitable. Lending to
the private sector has recovered and exceeded
pre-crisis (2008–09) levels, and is booming
despite high base lending rates. While asset
quality has improved following the crisis, staff
expressed concern that the sharp increase in
credit to the private sector in 2011, especially
personal loans, which increased by 43 percent
and accounts for about 30 percent of total

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

loans and advance, could elevate risks of
renewed deterioration.8
29.
The authorities are concerned about
high lending rates and low access to
financial services for broad segments of the
population, including for SMEs. To
encourage banks to lower their base rates, in

crisis resolution framework, as part of their

Sector Development plan, as recommended by the

Program Update.

ZAMBIA

late 2011, the authorities lowered the upper
corporate tax rate for banks by 5 percentage
points, aligning the tax rate with the
35 percent paid by other non-agriculture firms.
They also plan to recapitalize the Zambia
Development Bank to be more active in credit
delivery to sectors usually under-served by the
traditional commercial banks. Staff noted that
credit delivery to under-served sectors has
been hampered by structural factors such as
lack of information on potential
borrowers, high transactions costs for creditors
to deal with non-performing loans and the
high cost of doing business in Zambia. In this
context, reforms to improve the coverage and
effectiveness of the credit reference bureaus;
and streamline procedures for collateral
enforcement to ensure collateral enforcement
would be crucial. Staff also stressed the
importance for growth and poverty reduction
of extending other financial services, including
payment services and saving facilities, to those
without bank accounts. A review of the legal
and regulatory framework to allow for the
development of innovative products and
institutions tailored to the needs of the
informal sector would also be important
(Appendix V).
30.
To strengthen the balance sheets of
commercial banks to support Zambia’s
growing economy, the authorities have
increased the minimum capital
requirement. The capital requirement was
increased from $2.4 million to $20 million for
majority domestically-owned banks and to
$100 million for majority foreign-owned banks.
Banks will need to be in compliance with the
new requirements by January 1, 2013. While
the country’s two domestically owned banks
should not have any problem meeting the new
requirement, this could be a challenge for a
number of foreign-owned banks. The top

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

5 foreign banks have an average capitalization
of close to US$60 million, but the average for
the remaining 12 foreign-owned banks is
below US$10 million.
31.
Staff expressed concerns about the
measure, citing the risk of unintended
consequences, and advised the authorities
take a more gradual approach and to seek
technical assistance. On the one hand, the
required rapid increase in capital could
encourage risky lending and lead to a
substantial deterioration in asset quality, as
occurred in Nigeria between 2004 and 2006. At
the same time, the BOZ could encounter
challenges in terms of their capacity to
effectively supervise banks as they aggressively
extend their loan books. On the other hand,
there could be a withdrawal of some foreign
banks that either serve small, niche markets or
have no corporate interest in
expanding/merging, possibly resulting in a
decline in competition and the scope of
financial services.
32.
The authorities will rebase the local
currency and take off three zeros. This is
expected to ease the burden on the payments
system, reduce transaction costs, and simplify
accounting processes. Staff noted that, as was
the case in Europe and other sub-Saharan
African economies, rebasing of currencies
requires significant lead time for planning,
technical work, and extensive public education
program to ensure a smooth transition and
minimum risks to the banking and payments
systems.
Authorities’ Views
33.
The authorities took note of the
staff’s concerns. They stressed that in
implementing the higher capital requirement,
the BOZ will work closely with the commercial

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

ZAMBIA

banks to avoid any negative impact on the
financial system. The authorities noted that
many banks had accumulated sufficient
reserves that could be converted into the
required capital. The measure would put the
banks in a position to participate in financing
large projects that have in the past relied on

external financing or required syndication. On
the planned rebasing of the currency, the
authorities assured staff that technical
preparations had been underway for a long
time and that a broad public education
campaign would soon be launched.

F. Boosting Competitiveness and Inclusive Growth through Structural
Reforms
34.
Achieving economic diversification
and inclusive growth remains a challenge.
Zambia remains overly dependent on copper
exports; the cost of doing business remains
high; unbalanced agriculture policies have
caused an over-production of maize and
hampered the development of other segments
of the agriculture sector; below cost recovery
electricity tariffs impede tapping Zambia’s
hydro power potential; the large informal
economy negatively impacts productivity and
poverty; and economic governance remains a
concern. Against this background, staff
highlighted the importance of a broad-based
strategy that included the key reforms
identified in the Sixth National Development
Plan (covering 2011–15) and the fiscal and
financial sector reforms discussed earlier.
35.
Efforts to increase productivity in
the informal sector and identify and
remove barriers to formal sector
development are needed. Currently,
around 90 percent of the total workforce is in
the informal sector or through informal labor
arrangements (casual workers) in the formal
sector. Continued efforts to achieve the
Millennium Development Goals targets (e.g., in
health and education, Table 8) and scale up
infrastructure spending should improve
informal sector productivity and inclusive
growth. Additional gains would come from

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

addressing impediments to formal sector
development. A recent IMF study9 of the
drivers of the informal economy in oilimporting countries in the Middle East and
North Africa found that a large informal
economy is often the consequence of a
difficult business environment and high costs
and burdens of entering the formal economy,
including restrictive labor market regulations,
and excessive taxes. At the same time, limited
benefits (weak financial and public service
delivery to SMEs) reduce the incentives to
operate in the formal sector. Staff urged that
better information on the key Zambia-related
obstacles to formal sector development, is
needed to inform policies in this area.
36.
With more than 70 percent of the
employed population in the agriculture
sector, agriculture development is critical
for achieving inclusive growth and poverty
reduction. Staff recommended the
government to formulate a broad-based
reform strategy for the agriculture sector, with
the help of development partners.

The strategy should include strong
participation of the private sector, commodityneutral agricultural policy, and prioritizing
government spending on raising productivity,
including through provision of irrigation,
roads, research, and extension services.

Authorities’ Views
37.
The authorities agreed with the
staff’s assessment. They noted that they
already are preparing reforms in line with the
staff’s recommendation to their agriculture
policies.

STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
Zambia is to be commended for its
strong macroeconomic performance in
recent years, reflecting sound
macroeconomic management. Economic
growth is projected to remain strong and
inflation moderate in 2012. The real effective
exchange rate is broadly in line with
macroeconomic fundamentals and the risks to
external stability appear low. However, there
are downside risks, related mainly to
uncertainties in the global economic outlook
and possible delays in implementing fiscal
measures needed to meet the authorities’
budget deficit target. Large deficits in a
government pension fund, below cost recovery
energy pricing, and contingent liabilities also
pose medium-term risks.
39.
Growth will have to be broadened
over the medium term to raise employment
and reduce poverty. Achieving this, while
maintaining financial stability will require fiscal
and monetary discipline. It will also require a
broad set of reforms to provide room for
growth-enhancing fiscal spending; broaden
access to financial services; and strengthen
incentives for labor-intensive activities in the
formal sector, including through tax and labor
market reforms. Measures to reduce the
dependence on maize and promote rural
development would also be critical.

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

40.
The government’s fiscal targets for
2012 and the medium term are consistent
with achieving the authorities’
macroeconomic objectives. Their plans to
keep net domestic financing at around
1 percent of GDP and the medium-term fiscal
deficit at 2–3 percent would keep debt stable
as a percent of GDP, ensure that the risk of
debt distress remains low, and provide room
for solid private sector credit growth and
support a further reserve accumulation.
41.
However, sizable fiscal measures are
needed to achieve these targets, while
providing room for higher growthenhancing and poverty-reducing spending.
Failure to take measures to secure the 2012
fiscal targets would likely put significant
pressure on inflation and the balance of
payments and raise concerns about the
authorities’ commitment to macroeconomic
stability. The authorities are urged to quickly
implement reforms currently being considered
to maize marketing and pricing, fertilizer
subsidies, and public sector pension funds.
These reforms should provide sizable fiscal
savings both in 2012 and over the medium
term, restore sustainability, and, in the case of
the agricultural programs, correct serious
market distortions that have contributed to an
overdependence on maize production.

ZAMBIA

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

42.
Enhanced revenue mobilization also
has an important role to play in achieving
the medium-term fiscal targets. Staff
encourages the authorities to continue to
implement tax administration reforms
recommended by Fund technical assistance. In
the area of tax policy, there is room to
substantially reduce the number of exemptions
and incentives in non-mining taxes, while
ensuring that those that remain are closely
linked to facilitating productivity and
employment growth in the formal sector. In
the mining area, Staff agrees with the
authorities’ decision not to make any further
changes to the mining fiscal regime at this
time.

should also be strengthened. In that regard,
staff welcomes plans for enhanced monitoring
of the state-owned enterprises. As the
authorities move to tap the international
capital markets, it will be important to develop
a comprehensive debt management strategy.

43.
The fiscal risks associated with
below cost-recovery energy pricing must
also be addressed. The automatic petroleum
price adjustment mechanism should be
reinstated as soon as possible to ensure that
prices are kept in line with supply costs. The
implementation of the multi-year electricity
tariff framework aimed at raising tariffs to full
cost-recovery levels should also be accelerated
to ensure the economic viability of the large
private and public investment in electricity
generation currently being undertaken. At the
same time, lifeline tariffs should be considered
to protect the most vulnerable customers.

46.
Staff welcomes BOZ plans to
enhance the monetary policy framework.
The introduction of the monetary policy rate,
and use of a broad set of economic
indicators—including monetary aggregates—
to assess the monetary policy stance, should
make monetary policy more flexible and
forward looking, enhance liquidity
management, and better shape the
transmission mechanism. At the same time,
staff encourages the authorities to continue to
develop all the key structures necessary for the
effective functioning of the policy rate as the
main monetary policy tool.

44.
Further public financial
management reforms are needed to
improve spending efficiency and
transparency and debt management. The
government needs to strengthen its
investment management capacity–the
targeted scaling up of capital expenditures
should be gradual to provide adequate time to
build the needed technical expertise. The
existing procedures for debt recording and
monitoring, especially of contingent liabilities,

47.
Staff supports the authorities’
efforts to strengthen the financial sector
and improve access to financial services.
However, staff is concerned that current plans
to raise minimum capital requirements for
banks may have unintended results by
encouraging risky lending practices or the
withdrawal of some specialized foreign banks.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to
work closely with the commercial banks to
ensure that these risks do not materialize. To

45.
Staff believes that the authorities’
2012 monetary program is consistent with
achieving their goal of keeping inflation

Annex I. Revenue Mobilization and Growth Friendly Tax Reforms in Zambia1

4.
Finally, there is scope to shift the
burden of taxation away from labor taxes,
which could support employment growth.
The 2012 Doing Business Report finds that
labor taxes (pension and workman
compensation contributions) in Zambia
constitute 10.4 percent of profits, whereas
countries likes South Africa and Mozambique
have much lower labor taxes relative to profits.
There might be scope to lower labor taxes in a
revenue-neutral way, through reducing tax
holidays and other incentives on corporate
income taxes.

2.
Revenue mobilization should target
indirect taxes which are less distortive and
better capture informal activity. Taxes on
consumption, such as VAT and excises, are less
distortive than taxes on income and capital
since they do not alter labor supply and
investment incentives. Also, while income taxes
only capture formal sector activity and
provides incentives to participate in the formal
sector, consumption-based taxes indirectly
also capture income originating from informal
activities. In addition, indirect taxes account for
most of the deterioration in tax yields over the
recent years, and reversing this trend can
generate considerable revenues. Performance
of value added and excise taxes can be
improved significantly through revenue
administration measures and eliminating
exemptions and zero-rating of products.

inadequate and outdated. If designed
properly, property taxes can provide a stable
revenue base with a progressive tax burden.

% Tax on profits

1.
Revenue mobilization will be crucial
if Zambia is to create space for higher
spending on priority sectors. Non-mining
revenues have displayed a worrying decline in
recent years and the composition of tax
revenues is unbalanced; relying more on direct
income taxes while consumption and property
taxes are underexploited. Growth-friendly nonmining tax policy reforms will be necessary to
ensure a stable and permanent revenue base,
improve economic efficiency, and support
employment and growth.

3.
More effective use of property taxes
would also help increase revenue
mobilization and ensure a stable revenue
base. Property taxes are underutilized in
Zambia as the property rating system is

Annex II. Mining Revenues and the Mining Fiscal Regime in Zambia
1.
Although copper exports constitute
about 30 percent of GDP in Zambia, mining
revenues have remained relatively low.1
This has been driven by a combination of
generous development agreements that were
signed with the international mining
companies in the late 1990s with the
privatization of the industry, and the fact that
most mining companies had to undertake
large capital expenditures to revive production
and therefore had losses that they have carried
forward.

During 2007–08, Zambia made
significant changes to the mining fiscal
regime designed to increase revenues.1
Some of the major changes included an
increase in the corporate income tax and
royalty rates, and the introduction of a variable
income tax schedule. The 2012 budget
introduced additional changes such as a

1

further increase in the royalty rate for base
metals.
3.
Mining related revenues should
increase in the medium-term for a number
of reasons: (i) More companies should reach
tax-paying status; (iii) the current fiscal regime
has a considerably higher average effective tax
rate; and (iv) the authorities have launched a
program, backed by Fund technical assistance,
to improve mining revenue administration,
which is a key prerequisite for achieving the

ZAMBIA

higher potential revenues from mining.
Sustaining investment in the mining sector and
increasing production levels depend on the
investor burden that is imposed by the fiscal
regime and the investment environment.
Compared to other mineral producers, the
current fiscal regime in Zambia has a relatively
large government take, especially for high cost
projects (see table below). The fiscal regime in
Zambia is also not very progressive with
respect to changes in international copper
prices, which can deter investment in periods
of low price expectations. Maintaining a
positive investment environment will depend
on the ability to offer a stable fiscal regime,

sector, improving infrastructure, and lowering

Annex III. Optimal Level of International Reserves for Zambia
1.
Zambia has gradually increased its
gross official reserves over the past few
years. Reserves reached about US$2.2 billion
(3 months of prospective imports) as of
December 2011, from about US$180 million
(1 month of prospective imports) in 2001. The
authorities consider 3 months of import
coverage, the so-called “rule of thumb," to be

the goal for the medium term. They are
building up reserves to insure themselves
against shocks, but whether 3 months is
enough needs to be assessed. This annex
analyzes the optimal level of international
reserves for Zambia, adopting a new
methodology to assess reserve adequacy.

A. Potential Sources of External Sector Shocks
2.
The most common external shocks
for developing countries are related to
terms of trade shocks, sudden reversals in
capital inflows (including grants), and
global interest rate hikes (Becker et al.,
2007). To determine the frequency and nature
of the shocks to which Zambia is exposed, we
take into account Zambia’s specific
characteristics, focusing on the first two types
of shocks:
3.
Terms of trade: Zambia’s exports
(about 38 percent of GDP) are highly
concentrated in copper (around 75 percent
of total export receipts). However, the
international price of copper has shown a
high degree of volatility, in particular during
the last decade. The standard deviation
of international copper price variations in
2001–10 was five times the standard deviation
in 1980 and 2000.
4.
Sudden reversals in capital flows: To
assess this potential risk, we analyze
Zambia’s capital inflows for 2000–10:
5.
Annual average net foreign direct
investment (FDI): Is estimated to have been
about US$500 million (5¾ percent of GDP),
and historically has mainly been in the mining
sector. It is expected to increase because large
new mining and energy projects are now

36

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

getting underway. FDI is projected to total
US$953 million in 2012 (4.7 percent of GDP).
6.
Annual average grant inflows,
including current transfers: Have been about
US$380 million (almost 5 percent of GDP).
Even though the standard deviation for grants
is lower than that for FDI, the inability to
predict when these inflows will arrive within a
given year could affect the build-up of
reserves.
7.
Annual average loan disbursements:
Have been around US$140 million (around
2.6 percent of GDP). The volatility of official
disbursements has been much lower than that
of loans and FDI.
8.
Foreign portfolio investment:
Foreign investment in Zambian government
securities began in early 2005, after Zambia
reached its HIPC completion point. The
stock of government securities in the hands of
foreigners increased rapidly to almost
US$280 million (almost 14 percent of the total
stock) in mid-2006, but has declined since
then. Foreigners’ holding of Zambian
government securities was around
US$110 million (around 4 percent of the total
stock) in February

B. Traditional Measures of Reserve Adequacy
9.
Traditional reserve adequacy
measures are useful as a starting point for
further analysis. Zambia’s indicators are
compared to that of a sample of selected
African low-income “mature stabilizers” that
have “graduated” from a PRGF arrangement to
a PSI.1 All but one of these countries have
benefited from HIPC and MDRI relief.
10.
Reserve-to-imports: This indicator is
particularly relevant for countries that are
exposed to terms of trade shocks but do not
have significant access to international capital
markets. It represents the number of months a
country can support its level of imports after
all inflows stop. Reserves equivalent to
3 months of prospective imports is the rule of
thumb most commonly used (Wijnholds,
2001). While there is no theoretical basis for
this rule, in many cases it would be justified by
the need to meet unexpected external shocks
with reserves to avoid a sudden stop in
essential imports (import compression).
Although Zambia’s reserve coverage has
climbed above 3 months of imports, it is still
well below the average coverage of the
considered PSI countries.

11.
Reserves-to-short-term external
debt by remaining maturity: This indicator is
useful for countries that have significant access
to international capital markets and are
therefore vulnerable to a financial account
crisis.

12.
Countries could benefit by holding
enough international reserves to cover all
obligations falling due within the coming
year. The Guidotti-Greenspan rule
recommends that reserves be at least equal to
the stock of short-term debt. Both Zambia and
the considered PSI countries comfortable
exceed the threshold.
13.
Reserves-to-broad money: This
indicator is relevant for countries facing a
potential capital flight risk and is particularly

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

37

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

ZAMBIA

appropriate for countries with a pegged
exchange rate. However, even countries with
flexible exchange rates must be concerned
about the possibility of a run on their currency
due to contagion or spillover effects.
According to Wijnholds (2001), the usual
benchmark range for this indicator would be
between 5 percent and 20 percent, with
countries having a more flexible exchange rate
regime holding a lower ratio. For both Zambia
and the comparator PSI countries, the reserveto-broad money ratio is above the suggested
threshold. However, the average reserve-to-

broad money ratio for the comparator PSI
countries has been higher than in Zambia
during most of the last decade.
14.
Reserves-to-GDP: Even though there
is no threshold for this indicator, it allows
cross-country comparisons. Zambia’s
international reserves-to-GDP ratio has been
less than half the average of the ratio for the
PSI countries for most of the last decade, but
has strengthened over time. Zambia’s reserves
reached 12 percent of GDP in 2010, still well
below the average of 19 percent registered by
the comparator PSI countries.

C. Potential Shock to the Current Account Based on Historical Patters
15.
Current account shocks have
traditionally been the main cause of
balance of payments instability in lowincome countries. For that reason, it is useful
to assess the reserve coverage against a
possible current account shock. Table 1 shows
the estimated the import coverage required
to fully absorb through change in reserves a
one-standard deviation shock to the current
account and GDP (as a percent of GDP). As can
be seen, Zambia’s current account balance has
been more volatility than in most of the
considered PSI countries—reserves equivalent
to 1.9 months of prospective imports would be

38

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

needed to fully absorb a one standard
deviation current account shock. Similarly,
reserves equivalent to 1.4 months of
prospective imports would be needed to fully
absorb a one standard deviation shock to
exports, and reserves equivalent to 2.4 months
imports would be needed to fully absorb a one
standard deviation shock to copper prices.
These reserve requirements are relatively large
compared to the current reserve coverage of
3 months of prospective imports. In particular,
a one standard deviation copper price shock

ZAMBIA

would almost exhaust Zambia’s 2011 level of
reserves.2 In contrast, the current reserve
coverage in the comparator PSI countries
would allow them to fully absorb the various

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

shocks with comfortable margins. Based on
this, Zambia would benefit from building up
reserves further.

D. Assessing the Optimal Reserve Level for Zambia
16.
Countries hold international
reserves to build a buffer against external
shocks that could undermine domestic
economic welfare.3 Reserves mitigate the
impact on welfare of a temporary balance of
payments crises by reducing the fall in
domestic output and consumption needed to
restore external balance. Moreover, higher
reserves may themselves reduce the

probability of a crisis. However, because
building up reserves has a cost, it is necessary
to understand the probability and the likely
size of shocks in order to properly balance the
cost and benefits of holding larger reserves.
17.
Dabla-Norris et al. (2011) and IMF
(2011) have proposed a new methodology
to assess reserve adequacy for low-income
countries that takes into account both the
costs and benefits of holding reserves. In
this framework, a crisis is defined as a sharp
drop in domestic absorption, and the optimal
level of reserves is determined when the crisis
prevention and mitigation benefits of holding

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

39

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

ZAMBIA

reserves, defined in terms of reducing the
expected cost of a crisis, are balanced against
the net financial cost of reserves, defined as
foregone investment opportunities measured
by the marginal product of capital. An
important feature of the approach is that
optimal reserve holdings depend on country
characteristics and policy fundamentals.
18.
Based on this methodology, we
estimate the optimal level of reserves in the
context of potential large external shocks
to the country; i.e. we set the shock
variables (terms of trade, external demand,
FDI to GDP ratio, and aid to GDP ratio) at the
bottom 10 percentile of the country-specific
distribution over the past ten years (2001–10).4
Fundamentals (CPIA and fiscal balance) were
set at their 2010 levels.

of reserves varies from 4 to 8 months of
imports, depending on the unit cost of holding
reserves. If higher CPIA (3.8, median of PSI
countries) is assumed, optimal reserve
holdings will be smaller than the baseline
because stronger institutions lower the
probability of a crisis. Further assuming an
improved fiscal position (a deficit of 2 percent),
optimal reserve holdings will become even
smaller.
20.
In light of the large infrastructure
investment needs, the opportunity costs of
holding reserves could be relatively high for
Zambia. The average return of FDI in the last
two years is estimated to be between 4.5 and
5 percent. In this context, the model suggests
that the optimal reserve holdings for Zambia
would be between 4 and 4.5 months of
imports.5

19.
Reserve holdings calculated under
these assumptions would be interpreted as
the optimal level of reserves in the face of
large shocks, given that the fiscal deficit is
3.1 percent of GDP and the CPIA index, which
measures institutional strength, is 3.3. Under
these baseline assumptions, the optimal level

5. Note that this estimate is based on current imports.
Import coverage based on prospective imports tends
to be slightly lower than that based on current
imports. In this sense, if we take the higher end
(4.5 months of current imports) as the optimal level,
the reserve coverage in terms of prospective imports
would be between 4 and 4.5 months of prospective
imports.

Annex IV. External Stability Analysis
1.
The real effective exchange rate
(REER) has appreciated steadily since the
early 2000s, mostly because the
improvement in Zambia’s terms of trade
(Figure 1). High copper prices were a major
driver of the terms of trade, and copper
contributed about three-fourths of export
earnings. The subsequent depreciation in
2008–09 was mainly driven by a plunge in
copper prices, and outflows of portfolio
capital, associated with the global financial
crisis. In 2011, the level of the REER was similar
to the one observed in 2010.

impact of the mining related flows on the
foreign currency market, and the exchange
rate and international reserves, for the purpose
of this exercise, these outflows have been
reclassified to the current account as
additional dividends.
3.
The real effective exchange rate is
close to its estimated equilibrium level, and
there’s no evidence of misalignment
(Table 1).1 The estimates based on the
external sustainability and macroeconomic
balance approaches suggest that the exchange
rate currently could be moderately
undervalued, while the estimate of the real
equilibrium exchange rate suggests that the
exchange rate is close to its equilibrium value.
The estimates also suggest that the steady
appreciation of the REER since the early 2000s
was largely driven by changes in the
fundamentals, including in particular the rise in
copper prices (Figure 2).

2.
We have used the standard tools
developed by the IMF’s Consultative Group
on Exchange Rate (CGER) to assess the
Zambian exchange rate. For that purpose,
the current account balance presented in the
official Balance of Payments (Table 6) has been
adjusted. The official balance of payments for
Zambia show the (mostly foreign owned)
mining companies as keeping a large share of
the mining export proceeds as rapidly
increasing deposits abroad. This large financial
account outflow is simply the estimated
difference between the declared miningrelated inflows and outflows, conventionally
recorded in the financial account instead of in
the current account. To better reflect the true

Zambia still has room to improve its
competitiveness. Even though the exchange
rate appears to be broadly in line with the
fundamentals, Zambia’s Doing Business
Indicators suggest that there is a need for
improvements in a number of non-price areas.
The World Bank’s Doing Business 2012 report
ranks Zambia 84th out of 183 countries.
Zambia compares favorably to other
comparator countries in the region in the areas
of starting a business, getting credit, paying

taxes, and enforcing contracts (Table 2).
However, even though Zambia’s scores are
better than for the whole SSA region, it needs
to improve in the areas of resolving insolvency,
protecting investors, and trading across
borders. In addition, Zambia ranks 112th out
of 142 countries in the Global Competitiveness
Index produced by the World Economic Forum
(2012). Areas for improvement highlighted are
related to infrastructure, health and primary
education, higher education and training, and
labor market efficiency. In all these areas,
Zambia ranks between the position 105 and
125. Dialogue with private sector
representatives, including in the mining sector,
confirms the issues raised by these
competitiveness studies: low productivity
levels, higher cost of transport and factor
inputs, inadequate transport infrastructure,
and shortage of skilled labor.

Annex V. Challenges to Financial Services in Zambia1
1.
The financial sector in Zambia has
continued to experience significant growth
in the last decade, but access to financial
services continues to be low and lags
behind Zambia’s peers. About 63 percent of
the adult population does not have access to
any form of financial services (FINSCOPE
Report 2009). Access to financial services is
particularly limited for informal sector workers
(about 89 percent of the total workforce).
2.
Lack of competition, and regulatory
and structural bottlenecks have impeded
the delivery of financial services. Financial
penetration has been weak for the following
reasons: (i) high overhead costs for the
provision of savings and payment services to
the large unbanked population; (ii) lack of
clarity in the enforcement of collateral even
though legal framework exists; (iii)
information asymmetry especially from the
informal sector; (iv) relatively high funding
costs, arising from competition for large
institutional depositors; (v) lack of long-term
capital; (vi) non-existence of bookkeeping
records and corporate governance in the
micro, small, and medium enterprises
(MSMEs), making it difficult for banks to
conduct accurate due diligence; and (vi) in
some cases, lack of experience and skills by
banks to assess, manage and price risks.

3.
These policy and structural
bottlenecks have complicated the delivery
of credit and financial services more
generally, especially to the informal sector
in Zambia. Where banks have been willing to
extend credit; these have been at relatively
large premiums, resulting in higher interest
rate spreads.

4.
A key element for improving access
is to address these challenges with a
holistic approach, focusing on financial
inclusion as a whole. In particular, efforts
should be made to: (i) review the legal and
regulatory framework to facilitate
development of innovative products tailored

to the needs of the informal sector, and where
possible, creating special purpose vehicles to
deliver these services ); (ii) facilitate the use of
new technologies for provision of credit,
savings, and payment services, including
mobile banking and “smart cards” and other
micro banking tools; (iii) review provisions
underpinning the credit reference bureau to
make it central to credit appraisal and
delivery; and (iv) provide business support
services to MSMEs to ensure minimum
standards in bookkeeping and corporate
governance. Cross-country evidence shows
that addressing these bottlenecks has usually
come with rationalization of interest rate
spreads, and promotes financial inclusion.

Based on the Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-income Countries
(LIC DSA), Zambia’s risk of external debt distress remains low as all debt indicators stay
below the indicative policy thresholds throughout the projection period (2012–32). Under
the baseline and alternative scenarios, all external debt sustainability indicators remain
below their relevant thresholds. The public DSA suggests that Zambia’s overall public
sector debt dynamics are sustainable in light of the current size and the evolution of the
domestic debt stock. However, besides sound macroeconomic policies, both strong debt
management and project appraisal capacity are needed to maintain debt sustainability
in the face of access to international capital markets and a gradual increase in nonconcessional borrowing.

BACKGROUND
1.
Zambia’s stock of external and public
debt remains relatively low. External public and
publicly guarantee debt was about 11.6 percent of
GPD in 2011 (US$ 2.1 billion).1 Most of the public
external debt is multilateral (around 70 percent)
and contracted with concessional terms. In 2011,
the Government of Zambia guaranteed the
contracting of external debt for US$ 285 million

(about 1.5 percent of GDP) mainly related to
ZESCO (the government owned electric
power utility company). Zambia’s total public
sector debt also remains low at about 28 percent
of GDP at end-2011. As for the composition, the
share of domestic debt is about 60 percent. In
2012, authorities plan to issue an international
sovereign bond.

UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS
2.
The Zambia’s strong economic
performance is expected to continue in 2012.
GDP is projected to expand by 7.7 percent,
reflecting strong growth in copper production (an
increase of 23 percent in mining output
compared to a decline of 5 percent in 2011) and
non-maize agriculture, and an expansionary fiscal
policy (increase in public investment of
1 percentage point of GDP). Inflation is projected
to remain around 6 percent, in line with the
authorities’ stated objective. The external current
account surplus is projected to be just above
1 percent of GDP (compared to 1.3 percent of
GDP in 2011), reflecting both higher export
volumes of copper and higher non-traditional
exports. However, international reserves are
projected to rise to 3.3 months of prospective
imports, reflecting a continued current account
surplus and strong capital inflows, including a
debut US$500

Zambia’s stock of external debt declined substantially
from about 86 percent of GDP in 2005 to around
9 percent in 2006 as a result of debt cancellation
under the HIPC Initiative and MDRI.

international sovereign bond issue. The baseline
scenario assumes prudent economic policies to
provide fiscal space for growth-enhancing
expenditure while safeguarding macroeconomic
stability. The medium-term assumptions are
summarized in Box 1.
3.
The baseline scenario assumes new
public external borrowing in the order of
US$2.8 billion in 2012–17 (US$2.3 billion without
the proceeds of the international bond; i.e.;
between 1.3 and 1.6 percent of GDP). Of this,
US$ 970 million would be in non-concessional
terms (US$470 million without the proceeds of
the international bond). It is assumed that the
proportion of non-concessional borrowing would
gradually increase from 26 percent of total
disbursements in 2013 to around 50 percent by
2032.
4.
The baseline scenario includes
potential contingent liabilities arising from the
public sector pension fund (PSPF). Currently,
without any policy or reform adjustment, the PSPF
would barely manage to cover half its expenses
with contributions over the next twenty years,
registering an actuarial deficit between 0.3 and
0.4 percent of GDP annually until 2030. Staff

estimates that budget transfers to fill the funding
gap for pension benefits payable from this fund
together with the normal pension contributions of
the government would reach 0.9 percent of GDP
in 2012 and, in the absence of reforms, could rise
to 2 percent of GDP by 2012. This underscores the
need of a reform to ensure that the pension
scheme does not jeopardize fiscal sustainability.
Public Investment and Growth
5.
The impact of new borrowing to
finance public infrastructure investment on
debt sustainability depends critically on its
impact on growth. A number of empirical
studies generally find a positive impact of public
investment on growth both through a direct
impact on economic activity and through spillover
effects on private investment. 2 Among these
studies, Burnside and Dollar (1997) found that a
sustained increase in grant-financed investment
by one percent of GDP raised real GDP growth in
low-income countries with good policy
implementation on a sustained basis by about
0.4 percentage points. 3 Gupta et al. (2011) find
that the unadjusted output elasticity of public
capital would be 0.25 (however, the marginal
product of (unadjusted) capital would be around
0.5). 4 Also, the growth impact of public
investment on growth is affected by how it is
financed. Aschauer (2000) found that external
debt financing of public investment could reduce
the impact on growth, depending on the quality

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

and effective use of the investment, as well as the
financing costs.
6.
The baseline scenario projects an
increase in capital expenditure in the medium
term. The capital expenditure ratio to GDP would
increase from 5.8 percent in 2011 to 9.4 percent in
2016. Between 20 and 35 percent of such increase
would be financed with external borrowing, a mix
between concessional and non-concessional
resources. Based on the empirical studies
mentioned above, it would be expected that the
projected increase in capital expenditure would
raise real GDP growth between 1.25 and
1.75 percentage points over the medium term.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

ZAMBIA

Box 1: Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions
Economic growth: Real GDP growth is assumed to
pick up to about 8 percent in the medium term
supported by mining activity (copper production
would double by 2016, from 0.7 million tons to
1.4 million tons, giving current production and
investment plans), large infrastructure investment
(capital expenditures would increase from
5.8 percent of GDP in 2011 to 9.4 percent of GDP in
2016) and increased electricity generation capacity.
In the long run, the mining sector remains to be
important, but economic diversification is also
assumed in other areas such as electricity
generation, agriculture, and tourism, and the
economy is expected to grow at around 6.5 percent
annually.
Inflation: The current objective of monetary policy is
to reduce inflation to below 7 percent by end-2012
and maintain single digits thereafter. Prudent
monetary and fiscal policies are expected to reduce
annual inflation to around 5 percent in the medium
term.
External sector: Mining output is expected to
remain strong over the medium term, and the
copper price growth is assumed to stabilize at
around US$ 3.3 per pound in the long run. Copper,
whose exports have been particularly strong in 2010
and 2011, will remain Zambia’s most important
export (around 75 percent of total exports).
However, nontraditional exports would increase
their rate of growth in the medium term (between
16–18 percent) consistent with higher non-mining
output growth and infrastructure expenditure that
would positively impact on economic diversification
and then stabilize at around 10 percent for the rest
of the period.

5

In 2012, the proportion of non-concessional
borrowing would be around 40 percent.

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Foreign direct investment (FDI) is expected to rise in
the medium term to around 5.5 percent of GDP,
especially in mining, manufacturing and transport
sectors, but stabilize in the long run at around
3.5 percent of GDP. The current account surplus is
expected to increase in the medium-term (at around
3.5 percent of GDP) and then gradually decline
(a current account deficit of 0.2 percent of GDP at
the end of the period) as the growth rate of copper
production decelerates from around 15 percent in
the medium term to around 7.5 percent.
Government revenue and expenditure: Fiscal
policy will be geared at creating space for spending
needs to enhance the economic diversification of
Zambia. To this end, higher revenue will be
mobilized through improvements in tax
administration, especially with respect to the VAT
and mining taxes, and new tax policy measures that
would broaden the tax base (reduction of tax
incentives and exemptions and introducing new
taxes). As a result, revenues would rise gradually
from 22 percent of GDP in 2012 to 26 percent by
2032. Expenditures would stay at an elevated level in
the near term mainly due to the growth-critical
infrastructure investment and spending on
education and health, but are expected to remain at
about 26 percent of GDP, with current spending
contained.
Government financing: External financing is
expected to be between 1.3 and 1.6 percent of GDP
(excluding the sovereign bond in 2012) in the
medium term to finance social and capital spending.
However, external financing is expected to decline to
about 1 percent of GDP over the long term.

ZAMBIA

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Baseline scenario
7.
External debt burden indicators rise in
the medium term, but are expected to remain
below the indicative policy thresholds (Figure 1
and Table 1). 6 The stock of external public and
publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt is expected to rise
to around 13 percent of GDP by 2017 but
gradually decline thereafter. The present value
(PV) of PPG debt to GDP increases to 11 percent
by 2016 before declining to around 6 percent by
2032, well below the 40 percent threshold. The PV
of debt to exports increases to 23 percent by
2013, and falls gradually thereafter, remaining well
below the threshold of 150 percent. The PV of
PPG debt to revenue increases from 24 percent in
2011 to about 44 percent in 2016, falling
thereafter, but it is below the threshold of
250 percent.7
Stress test
8.
External debt sustainability is
maintained under an array of stress tests. The
standard sensitivity analysis points to a low risk of
debt distress (Table 3 and Figure 1), where debt
burden indicators remain below their thresholds
6

The World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutions
Assessment (CPIA) ranks Zambia as a medium
performer (the average 2008–10 CPIA is 3.46). Thus,
the external debt burden thresholds for Zambia are
(i) a PV of debt-to-GDP at: 40 percent; (ii) a PV of
debt-to-exports at: 150 percent; (iii) a PV of debt-torevenue at: 250 percent; (iv) a debt service-to-exports
at: 20 percent: and (v) a debt service-to-revenue at:
30 percent.
7
The large residuals in Table 1 are caused by the
fact that the official balance of payments for Zambia
show the (mostly foreign owned) mining companies
as keeping a large share of their mining export
proceeds as rapidly increasing deposits abroad.

after the shocks. In particular, under the historical
scenario (which uses the historical average of the
non-interest current account, FDI flows, real GDP
growth, and the GDP deflator for the complete
period) the ratio of the PV of debt-to-GDP would
increase significantly, but would still remain below
the threshold. In addition, regarding the bound
tests, the most extreme stress test for the debt
burden indicators assumes an export value
growth equivalent to its historical average minus
one standard deviation in 2013–14.8 This shock
scenario illustrates Zambia’s vulnerability to
copper price volatility and the need to diversify its
export base. Under this scenario, the ratio of the
PV of debt-to-GDP doubles by 2014, but would
still remain below the threshold.
9.
External debt indicators would
deteriorate, but remain below their respective
thresholds under an alternative high
investment-low growth scenario. This scenario
assumes that there are constraints in the
appraisal, selection and project implementation
capacity of public investment projects in the
medium term, which are not mitigated through
the implementation of PFM reforms. In this
context and based on the discussion provided in
paragraphs 5 and 6, real GDP growth would
remain about 1 percentage point below the
baseline in the medium term (around 7 percent)
and about ½ percentage points in the longer
term (around 6 percent). In addition, we assume
that the decline in GDP growth will have a
negative impact on exports growth, in particular
to non-traditional exports, due to lower
8

The most extreme stress test is defined as the test
that yields the highest ratio in 2022.

infrastructure capacity (for the purpose of this
exercise it is assumed that the calculated decline
in GDP growth would reduce the exports-to-GDP
ratio by two percentage points in the medium
term and one percentage point in the long term).
The lower growth would result in lower domestic
revenues and a higher financing requirement that
are assumed to be met by additional external
borrowing on commercial terms. The additional

ZAMBIA

financing would rise to about 2 percent of GDP in
the medium term. By the end of the forecast
period, the domestic primary balance would
deteriorate by about 1 percent of GDP compared
to the baseline. Under this scenario, the ratio of
the PV of debt-to-GDP increases by around
13 percentage points by 2022 compared to the
baseline, but would still be below the threshold.

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Baseline scenario
10.
Zambia’s public debt rises slightly in
the medium term, but declines gradually over
time. Under the baseline assumptions, the PV of
public debt to GDP ratio would reach 24 percent
in 2015 and comes down thereafter to about
16 percent by 2032.
Stress test
11.
Risks to public debt dynamics would
mainly come from a deterioration of the fiscal
position and negative shocks to GDP growth.
Under the alternative scenarios, the results under

the fixed primary balance scenario (fixing the
primary balance unchanged from 2012)
underscore the negative effects of not continuing
to maintain fiscal discipline over the medium term
to maintain public debt sustainability (Figure 2
and Table 4). Under this scenario, PV of debt-toGDP ratio and PV of debt-to-revenue ratio keep
rising over time. Regarding the bound tests, risk
would mainly come from lower GDP growth. The
latter underscore both the need for Zambia to
diversify its production structure to mitigate
vulnerabilities related to potential declines in
mining production in the long term and to
improve public investment management in order
to ensure productivity-enhancing investments.

CONCLUSIONS
12.
Zambia is considered at low risk of
debt distress. The external debt indicators remain
below their thresholds in the baseline scenario
and bound tests. The public debt DSA also
suggests that Zambia’s overall public sector debt
dynamics is sustainable in light of the current size
and the evolution of the domestic debt stock in
the baseline scenario. On the other hand, the fixed
primary balance scenario demonstrates the need

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

for an improved fiscal position. Finally, in addition
to sound macroeconomic policies, strengthening
debt management and developing project
appraisal capacity are needed in order to maintain
debt sustainability and productivity-enhancing
investments in the face of access to international
markets and a gradual increase in nonconcessional borrowing.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

IX. Safeguard Assessments
Safeguards assessments of the Bank of Zambia
(BoZ) were completed in June 2004,
January 2009, and October 2010. The
2009 assessment concluded that the bank had
adequate safeguards in several areas, but
confirmed the existence of certain
vulnerabilities in the BoZ’s legal framework
and financial reporting. The 2010 update
report concluded that the BoZ had made
progress in implementing safeguards
recommendations. Staff noted improvements
in the internal audit and internal control
mechanisms. Weak statutory independence
remains a substantive safeguards concern.
X. Exchange Rate Arrangement
The currency of Zambia is the kwacha. The
exchange rate arrangement is a “float,” with
the kwacha exchange rate determined in the
interbank market. The buying rate of the BoZ is
a simple average of the primary dealers’ low
bid rates, and the BoZ’s selling rate is the
simple average of the primary dealers’ high
offer rates. On April 19, 2002, Zambia accepted
the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and
4 of the Articles of Agreement. However, the
Fund urged the authorities to eliminate the
exchange restriction shown by the
accumulation of external payments arrears,

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

which is subject to Fund approval under Article
VIII, as soon as possible.
XI. Article IV Consultations
Zambia is on the standard 12-month Article IV
Consultation cycle, subject to the provisions of
the decision on consultation cycles approved
on July 15, 2002. The Executive Board
concluded the last Article IV consultation on
December 14, 2009.
XII. FSAP Participation and ROSC
Zambia has participated in the financial sector
assessment program (FSAP); an FSAP mission
from the Fund and the World Bank conducted
a comprehensive external assessment of the
financial system April 30–May 15, 2002, and
July 15–26, 2002. A mission from the Fund and
the World Bank conducted a follow up FSAP in
November 2008.
The fiscal transparency module of a Report on
Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC)
assessing compliance with the IMF’s Code of
Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency—
Declaration of Principles was issued to the
Executive Board on October 31, 2001. A ROSC
data module was issued to the Executive Board
on January 18, 2005.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of February 15, 2012)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Issues with
source data and compilation affect most datasets, but are particularly problematic in the national accounts,
balance of payments, and consumer prices.
National accounts: There is a high degree of uncertainty attached to estimates of the level and growth
rate of real GDP, because 1994 is the latest benchmark year for value-added ratios to estimate GDP under
the production approach. For many important industry areas, such as wholesale and retail trade,
construction, business services, and many other service industries, (consisting mainly of small-scale private
service providers) no appropriate indicators exists. Data on total production and intermediate consumption
of establishments are not available. On the expenditure side, no reliable indicators of household
consumption exist and private final consumption expenditure is derived as a residual. Source data for
estimating gross fixed capital formation and changes in stocks are incomplete. There is also lack of high
frequency real sector data to support a more flexible monetary management. The situation largely reflects
resource constraints and organizational weakness within the Central Statistical Office that have affected its
ability to produce economic statistics on a timely basis.
Price statistics: The CPI broadly adheres to international methodological standards. The classification
system used for compilation closely follows the Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose. With
STA technical assistance, a new CPI series with updated weights based on the latest household budget
survey was released in February 2012.
Government finance statistics: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes. The
transactional coverage of these data is however limited to government operations and transactions in
nonfinancial assets. Data on transactions in financial assets and liabilities are still unavailable. The
authorities report monthly budget releases data to AFR for operational use in a timely manner, but the
data are often subject to substantial revisions, and data on extra-budgetary institutions and local
governments are not available. STA is providing technical assistance in this area.
Monetary statistics: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes. Since the 2005
monetary and financial statistics mission, there has been a noticeable improvement in the quality of
monetary accounts compiled and reported in accordance with the standardized report forms (SRFs) for the
BoZ and other depository corporations (ODCs).
Balance of payments statistics: Little progress had been made since the assessment by the 2004 Data
ROSC mission. Data sources remain poor (some items are estimated without reference to current source
data) and compilation methods are inadequate. Resources available for balance of payments compilation
have been increased, but are still inadequate, while coordination between the BoZ and CSO had improved.
As a result, significant gaps in data remain in many areas including reinvested earnings, trade in services,
and the financial account (including export proceeds held abroad by mining and nontraditional exporters).
While the source data are generally adequate in terms of timeliness, they fall short in terms of coverage. As
a result the shortcomings in source data coverage, indirect estimation methods are used, some of which
have remained unchanged for many years and are out of date. Source data on private sector foreign assets
and liabilities are insufficient to compile an International Investment Position statement.

External and domestic debt statistics: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes.
Recent efforts, facilitated by technical assistance, have led to an improvement in the consolidation of the
debt databases, both in terms of external and domestic debt. Further work is underway in these areas.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation
with Zambia
On June 13, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Zambia.1
Background
Zambia has achieved high and sustained growth and macroeconomic stability over the
past decade, but poverty remains high. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth
averaged 5.2 percent in 2000–10 (or 3.1 percent per capita); inflation declined from
30 percent to single digits; debt declined sharply; and international reserves increased
to comfortable levels.
Economic conditions remain favorable and there has been little impact to date from the
European crisis. Real GDP growth is estimated to have been strong in 2011, driven
by a record maize harvest and strong expansion in bank credit, which has surpassed
pre-crisis (2008–09) levels. Inflation continued to decline, broadly in line with the
authorities’ target of 7 percent. Despite copper prices rising to record highs, the external
current account surplus narrowed significantly, mainly reflecting a strong expansion in
imports and a decline in grants. However, gross international reserves rose above
$2 billion for the first time, equivalent to 3 months of prospective imports. Preliminary

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing up
can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

data suggest that the fiscal deficit of the central government remained flat at around
3 percent of GDP in 2011, as a large expansion in election-related spending was offset
by a one-off payment of mining tax arrears.
In 2012, real GDP is projected to rise by 7.7 percent, reflecting strong growth in copper
production and non-maize agriculture, and an expansionary fiscal policy. The 2012
budget targets a deficit of 4.1 percent of GDP and a significant increase in investment.
More than half of budget financing is expected to come from a US$500 million
sovereign bond issue, and net domestic financing is targeted to remain low at about
1 percent of GDP. Inflation is projected to remain close to its current level of around
6 percent in 2012. The Bank of Zambia (BOZ) recently changed its monetary policy
framework from reserve money targeting to the use of a policy rate as the main
monetary policy tool.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their sound macroeconomic
management and welcomed Zambia’s strong economic performance in recent years.
Directors noted that while the outlook for the economy is favorable, it is subject to risks
arising from volatility of copper prices and delays in implementing measures needed to
meet the 2012 budget deficit target. To safeguard macroeconomic stability and to make
growth more inclusive, they stressed the need for continued commitment to strong
policies and implementation of structural reforms.
Directors agreed that fiscal policy should aim at prioritizing growth enhancing
expenditures and mobilizing revenues to create the space needed to achieve the fiscal
objectives. They emphasized the importance of implementing reforms to maize
marketing and pricing, fertilizer subsidies, and public sector pension funds. These
measures should help restore fiscal sustainability and correct market distortions that
have created overdependence on maize production. Directors noted that revenue
enhancing measures, including strengthening tax administration and reducing subsidies
and incentives will also be critical for achieving the fiscal targets. In addition, the
reinstatement of the automatic petroleum price adjustment mechanism and the
implementation of the multi year electricity tariff framework are needed to minimize
fiscal risks associated with the current pricing below cost recovery.
Directors underscored that public financial management reforms are essential to
improve budgetary planning and execution and prioritizing spending. They welcomed
the plan to complete the implementation of the Treasury Single Account and urged the
authorities to continue to strengthen their investment and debt management capacity.
These measures would support the planned scaling up of infrastructure spending and
increased use of non-concessional financing.
Directors endorsed the plans to further enhance the monetary policy framework in
support of a low inflation objective. They encouraged the authorities to remain vigilant to

3
inflationary pressures and tighten policy if needed. Directors agreed that the
introduction of the monetary policy rate, combined with use of a broad set of economic
indicators to assess the monetary policy stance, should make monetary policy more
flexible and forward looking and enhance liquidity management. Directors noted that the
flexible exchange rate regime has helped Zambia weather external shocks. They
highlighted that increasing the reserve coverage would also provide an added buffer.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to strengthen the financial sector and
improve access to financial services. They urged the authorities, however, to work
closely with key stakeholders to minimize any risks to the financial sector stemming
from the implementation of the new minimum capital requirement for commercial banks
and the redenomination of the local currency.
Directors emphasized that structural reforms will be critical to achieve economic
diversification and make growth more inclusive, in order to tackle the high rate of
poverty and unemployment. In this context, they encouraged the authorities to
formulate a broad based reform strategy for the agriculture sector, and to strengthen
formal sector development, in particular by improving the business climate.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Moeketsi Majoro, Executive Director for Zambia
June 13, 2012
Introduction
We note that the staff report is in support of the authorities’ macroeconomic policy
stance and structural reform agenda for which, the authorities should be commended.
This marks Zambia’s first Article IV consultation without a formal program with the Fund
since July 2011. While we are in broad agreement with the staff assessment we have a few
areas of concern. We focus on the following for emphasis.
Background
The authorities’ economic policies and structural reforms are anchored on the Sixth
National Development Plan (SNDP) that covers the period 2011-2015. As we pointed out
in our Buff statement of June 20, 2011, the SNDP focuses on two pillars—improving
infrastructure and human development—in order to achieve the strategic objectives of
accelerating diversified economic growth, attaining the Millennium Development Goals,
lowering inflation and strengthening the resilience of the economy against external shocks.
The attendant macroeconomic policy stance and structural reforms remain valid,
notwithstanding ushering into office of a new administration on September 23, 2011
following elections won by the opposition party, the Patriotic Front.
Economic performance
Economic growth performance was robust at 6.5 percent in 2011 as a result of a record
maize harvest and expanding bank credit. Inflation was recorded at 7.2 percent at end2011. The fiscal deficit was low, at 3.5 percent of GDP. The external current account surplus
narrowed and gross international reserves stood at 3 months of prospective imports. In 2012,
growth is expected to be even higher, at 7.7 percent, on account of strong growth in the
mining sector and non-maize agriculture as well as expansionary fiscal policy. Inflation is
to be contained at around 6 percent. The budget deficit is targeted at 4.1 percent of GDP as a
consequence of a ramp up in infrastructure capital spending. Net domestic financing is
targeted at 1 percent of GDP. In the medium-term, growth is expected to remain strong,
propelled by the mining and manufacturing sectors.
Key challenges include enhancing revenue performance in the medium term, containing
spending, reducing unemployment and high rural poverty, and enhancing diversification. The
authorities remain committed to ensuring sustainable and high growth in order to create
employment and reduce poverty while maintaining macroeconomic stability; creating fiscal
space for growth enhancing expenditures, targeting low inflation and gradual migration to
inflation targeting; enhancing structural reforms aimed at deepening the financial sector,
over-hauling maize marketing and pricing; and continuing public financial management
reforms, including better budgetary planning and execution.

On investment climate, while one international rating agency—Fitch Ratings—revised
Zambia’s long-term foreign and local currency issuer default rating from stable to negative
on account of reversal of fraudulent/corrupt transactions and unauthorized statements,
Standard & Poor’s on the other hand maintained the Country’s B+ rating. As has been
explained by the authorities, the fight against corruption and indeed the unauthorized
statements should not be interpreted as reflecting policy reversal. Moreover, evidence on the
ground shows that mining companies are moving forward with ambitious plans to expand
their operations, paragraph 5 on page 9. In light of this, we would have expected a balanced
staff report on these issues.
Fiscal policy
The fiscal policy objective aims at fiscal consolidation while creating space for priority
infrastructure and social spending. This is based in the main, on improving collection of
taxes including enhancement of mining tax through technical assistance from cooperating
partners and the IMF which has stationed a Resident Advisor, aimed at improving the
collection of mining taxes, which are currently under performing (Figure 6, page 15)
compared to comparators and continued implementation of a comprehensive reform of tax
policy. On the expenditure side, focus shall be on controlling the growth of the wage bill and
enhancing domestically financed priority infrastructure and social spending. If revenues do
not match projections, the authorities are ready to undertake expenditure re-prioritization
particularly in current expenditure. Only slow moving capital expenditure will be
reprioritized within the capital budget.
Monetary and financial policies
The monetary policy objective is to maintain low and stable inflation at single digits
without constraining growth and private sector credit expansion. Monetary policy was
accommodative towards the end of 2011 with both the reserve requirements and liquid assets
ratios reduced in an attempt to lower high lending ratios. As reported before, the authorities
continue to monitor closely developments in the financial sector to ensure stability in the
financial system and stand ready to tighten monetary policy should circumstances warrant.
The current practice to base the monetary framework on reserve money targeting will
continue while efforts to shift to interest rates as the main instrument to anchor inflation
expectations are ongoing—as evidenced by the recent introduction of the policy rate. We
note staff support in this direction.
Structural reforms
As earlier reported, progress in the implementation of the remaining structural reforms
continues. This includes rolling out the implementation of the treasury single account, the
second phase of the Financial Sector Development Plan, lender of last resort, addressing
inadequacies in maize marketing, ensuring cost recovery in energy pricing, and improving
debt management capacity and project appraisal. The authorities’ intentions to improve
project and debt management capacity at sectoral and central level aimed at enhancing
project/debt selection, effective implementation and oversight should not be construed as a

shift in policy. Again, we note staff support in this direction but wish to caution that it cannot
be achieved overnight.
On the background note, we do agree with the analysis that “keeping maize prices high
disadvantaged the urban poor and many poor smallholders that are the net buyers of maize”,
page 4. While agreeing with the staff, we would like to point out that the authorities are
committed to reforming the program by refocusing the role of the Food Reserve Agency and
attaining a more market based pricing system. The authorities are also addressing the
problem of poor targeting of the Farmer Input Support Program (FISP) that has a bias
towards maize production by introduction of the electronic voucher system that will better
target beneficiaries and allow for a more diversified crop range. This measure will diversify
the agriculture sector and allow for growing of cash crops that will better benefit the
smallholder farmers. In this regard, the authorities are cautiously piloting the electronic
voucher system in 10 districts in the 2012/13 agricultural season with the aim of up-scaling
the program in the later years. This is expected to have a considerable impact on reducing the
high poverty levels.
Inclusive growth
We commend staff for the various informative annexes. However, on inclusive growth, we
were expectant of the outcome of the recent tripartite conference on inclusive growth in
Zambia organized by the authorities, the International Labor Organization and the IMF.
Accordingly, we look forward to the findings of the conference in the near future.
