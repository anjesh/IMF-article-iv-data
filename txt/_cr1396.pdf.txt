STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND FIRST REVIEW UNDER THE TWO-YEAR
PRECAUTIONARY AND LIQUIDITY LINE

KEY ISSUES
Background: Morocco’s overall solid economic performance has been challenged by
the deterioration of the situation in Europe, high oil and food prices and, in 2012,
lower-than-average agriculture production, heightening pressures on the public and
external accounts. Looking ahead, external pressures are not expected to abate and
risks are tilted to the downside. In this context, sustained implementation of the
authorities’ economic agenda will be crucial to preserving Morocco’s performance and
making further progress toward higher and more inclusive growth.
PLL review: The authorities’ program, supported by the Precautionary and Liquidity
Line (PLL), is on track; staff’s assessment is that Morocco continues to meet the
qualification criteria for a PLL. Both end-October 2012 quantitative indicative targets
were met. The authorities’ economic strategy of prudent monetary and financial
policies, fiscal consolidation, and structural reforms to increase competitiveness,
potential growth, and employment, remains appropriate. However, in the context of a
challenging environment, there is increased urgency in moving ahead with the reforms,
in particular that of the subsidy system. Also, more flexibility in the exchange rate is
increasingly needed to address external pressures. More investment in human capital
and basic infrastructure is necessary to promote inclusive growth.
Article IV consultation: Discussions focused on: (i) ensuring continued fiscal
sustainability; (ii) strengthening competitiveness; (iii) fostering higher and more
inclusive growth; and (iv) maintaining the stability of the financial sector.
Staff views: Staff recommends the conclusion of the 2012 Article IV consultation and
the approval of the first review under the PLL.

CONTEXT1
1.
Morocco’s solid performance has been challenged by a combination of domestic
vulnerabilities and external shocks. Morocco has a track record of strong macroeconomic policies
that, over the past decade, helped deliver solid growth, low inflation, comfortable external reserves,
financial deepening, and poverty reduction, despite stubbornly high youth unemployment. However,
the economy’s own rigidities, social pressures, and repeated external shocks from the global crisis
and commodity prices have led to a significant erosion of fiscal and external buffers. Furthermore, in
2012, growth was dragged down by a lower-than-average harvest resulting from low rainfall.
2.
The PLL continues to support the authorities’ efforts to rebuild buffers and address
medium-term challenges by providing insurance against external risks. The authorities intend
to continue to treat the PLL as precautionary and to draw on it only in the event of unforeseen
external shocks or a substantial worsening of the international outlook relative to current
assumptions. Their economic strategy supported by the PLL, which aims at ensuring fiscal
sustainability and increasing competitiveness, potential growth, and employment, remains
appropriate.
3.
The program is on track but, with a weaker environment, the economic outlook hinges
on the sustained delivery of reforms. Morocco continues to meet the qualification criteria for the
PLL. Performance at end-October 2012 was in line with indicative targets on the central government
fiscal deficit and net international reserves (NIR). In the context of a deteriorating short-term outlook
for the external sector and risks still heavily tilted to the downside, prompt implementation of the
program’s policies remains essential for the authorities to achieve their objectives. At the top of that
agenda is continued progress in addressing short- and longer-term fiscal issues, including pursuing
fiscal consolidation. There is a need for a reform of the general subsidy system, including a better
targeting of social protection. Further product and labor market reforms, investment in human
capital and infrastructure, increased access to financial services, and improvement of the business
climate are needed to boost competitiveness, potential growth, and employment. Moving toward a
more flexible exchange rate would help enhance the economy’s ability to absorb shocks and
preserve competitiveness. However, the timing of such a move should be carefully coordinated with
other macroeconomic policies, especially a shift toward a new monetary policy framework.
4.
In the context of political transition and high social demands, effective communication
is important to sustaining reforms. During a period of political transitions in many countries in the
region, a new constitution adopted in July 2011 paved the way for broad-ranging political reforms,
including a strengthened role for the head of government and parliament, as well as for local
elected officials as part of a move toward greater decentralization. A new coalition government took
office in January 2012, led by the Justice and Development Party, a moderate Islamist party, and also

comprising long-time government parties such as the Istiqlal (Independence) Party. The challenge
for the government is to sustain the delivery of difficult reforms, in a context of high expectations
and a volatile regional environment. Under these circumstances, good communication and a highquality social dialogue will be key to success.
5.
The 2012 Article IV consultation focused on the main medium-term policy challenges.
Discussions centered on (i) ensuring continued fiscal sustainability; (ii) strengthening
competitiveness; (iii) fostering higher and more inclusive growth; and (iv) maintaining the stability of
the financial sector.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
6.
The economy’s recent performance has continued to be affected by a deteriorating
external environment and poor rainfall. Output growth in 2012 is estimated to have slowed to
3.2 percent, mostly due to a lower-than-average cereal crop.2 However, real nonagricultural GDP
growth is expected to have remained relatively robust at around 4.5 percent, with the negative
impact of weak external demand from key trading partners—notably the EU—being more than
offset by robust domestic consumption. Despite significant increases in the price of several
subsidized energy products in June 2012, which were part of the government’s effort to contain the
fiscal cost of subsidies, headline inflation remained low at 1.6 percent (y-o-y) in November, as
second-round effects of the price increases have not yet fully materialized. Core inflation (excluding
food and transport) was close to zero due to the large negative contribution of lower
communication tariffs. Unemployment has hovered around 9 percent since 2010 and remains
particularly high among the youth, at almost 18 percent. Overall, macroeconomic performance has
been broadly in line with the original framework of the PLL, but the current account deteriorated
significantly more than anticipated, although reserves have stabilized at the expected level.

However, the decline in agriculture production is not as strong as was anticipated under the initial PLL framework,
which will lead to a smaller rebound, and therefore to lower real GDP growth in 2013.

7.
The 2012 fiscal deficit is expected to have contracted in line with PLL projections.
Based on data as of November 2012, it is estimated that the combination of measures taken in 2012,
notably the increases in energy-administered prices in June and the control of nonessential
spending, have helped reduce the deficit from 6.8 percent of GDP in 2011 to about 6 percent of
GDP in 2012.3 Both revenue and total expenditure were in line with the government’s objectives.
While the subsidy bill is expected to have reached about 6.2 percent of GDP, lower-than-projected
investment spending kept outlays for the whole year within target. The lower investment resulted
from the late adoption of the 2012 budget and delays in the expected receipt of grants from the EU
and GCC, which will finance investment in 2013 rather than in 2012 as originally planned.
8.
Weak external demand and high oil prices in 2012 have continued to put pressure on
the current account. The strong adverse impact of weak external demand and higher commodity
prices resulted in a further deterioration of the current account in 2012, with the deficit now
projected to increase to 8.8 percent of GDP from 8 percent of GDP in 2011, as opposed to
contracting slightly as expected under the initial PLL framework. Higher international oil prices
pushed up energy-related imports, while the worse-than-projected deterioration in the European
economy weighed more heavily on exports, tourism and, particularly, remittances. Furthermore, the
poor cereal harvest boosted food imports in late 2012. While gross international reserves (GIR) fell
steadily in 2011 and most of 2012, they reversed this trend in the last quarter of 2012 and stabilized,
as expected, at around four months of imports, supported by the issuance of a US$1.5 billion
sovereign bond in December.
9.
The central bank responded to a tightening of monetary conditions by increasing
liquidity injections. Lower international reserves had a substantial restrictive impact on bank
liquidity, contributing to slowing credit growth to 7 percent in 2012 from 9.9 percent in 2011. While
the policy interest rate has remained unchanged at 3 percent since March 2012, the central bank,
Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM), broadly doubled the daily average of its liquidity injections compared to
2011 to help fill the liquidity shortage. It extended eligible collateral for its repo facilities to shares of
mutual funds backed by mortgages and loans to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and
softened the eligibility criteria for certificates of deposits. In September 2012, it also cut its reserve
requirements for banks by two percentage points to 4 percent.
10.
The financial sector has remained sound overall. In June 2012, the ratio of regulatory
capital to risk-weighted assets ratio reached 12.2 percent at the aggregate level, and nonperforming
loans (NPLs) remained stable and low at 5 percent of total loans. The low reliance of domestic banks
on external funding has shielded them from deleveraging in Europe. However, banks’ deposit–toloan ratio has been steadily decreasing since 2007 because the pool of available deposits can no
longer accommodate the growing size and pace of lending activities. The problem is exacerbated by
the narrow domestic debt markets and limited resort to external funding. In response, banks are

enlarging their funding sources by expanding securitization instruments, increasing their financing in
foreign currencies via subsidiaries, and extending their collateral eligible under BAM monetary
operations.
11.
Morocco has enjoyed favorable market conditions, supported by the PLL. Morocco’s

confidence, despite the change in S&P’s rating outlook from neutral to negative in October 2012.4
12.
The outlook will be supported by the authorities’ planned fiscal consolidation,
structural reforms and a prudent monetary policy. Growth is expected to accelerate somewhat in
2013 (to 4.5 percent) on account of a rebound in agriculture. Inflation will increase because of the
increase in administered domestic energy prices but is expected to remain low at about 2½ percent.
The current account deficit is expected to contract by more than two percentage points of GDP in
2013, as a result of the significant reduction in the fiscal deficit, lower global energy prices, a
recovery in agriculture, and recent investments in export-oriented sectors, but will remain larger
than projected at the time of the PLL approval, due to a base effect and a less favorable global
growth outlook. Over the medium term, the authorities’ economic strategy, based on fiscal
consolidation, structural reforms, and prudent monetary policy, is expected to gradually promote
higher growth and reduce the current account deficit. The program framework is based on a gradual
and relatively conservative increase of real GDP growth to close to 6 percent in the medium term.
This is in line with the initial PLL framework, but remains lower than what steadfast implementation
of ambitious structural reforms could deliver to help make a significant dent in unemployment, as
discussed below.

Risks to the outlook have risen and are tilted to the downside. The baseline scenario of
steadily improving macroeconomic performance is vulnerable to significant external and domestic
risks (see Risk Assessment Matrix below):


Europe. In the short term, a worsening of the recession in Europe or, in the medium to long
term, a period of prolonged stagnation, would have sizeable real spillovers to growth and
the balance of payments, although financial spillovers are expected to remain limited.



Oil prices. Morocco is vulnerable to a spike in international oil prices, which would further
increase the fiscal and current account deficits and reduce growth.



Slower-than-needed pace of reforms. The authorities are committed to implementing difficult
reforms. However, and in the context of ongoing tensions in the region, there is a risk that
political or social difficulties may undermine the pace of the needed reforms.

MAIN CHALLENGES AND POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Rebuilding Fiscal Buffers, Ensuring Medium-Term Fiscal Sustainability
14.
The authorities are committed to ensuring fiscal sustainability. The 2013 budget is
consistent with the medium-term fiscal objective of achieving a deficit of 3 percent of GDP by 2016
through the implementation of policy reforms, both on the revenue and expenditure sides. The
authorities plan to launch a broad tax reform that should help tax revenues remain broadly stable in
percent of GDP, despite losses in customs revenues following trade liberalization. On the
expenditure side, key elements of the government’s strategy are: (i) reforming the subsidy system;
(ii) moderating the public wage bill; and (iii) reforming the public pension system.
15.
The 2013 budget envisions a more ambitious fiscal consolidation than initially planned
under the PLL. The government’s budget includes a larger reduction of the deficit than in the
original PLL framework (1.4 percent vs. 0.8 percent of GDP), bringing the deficit in 2013 to
4.7 percent of GDP. Staff supports this fiscal stance, as it will help address the deterioration in the
external sector. However, staff noted that a large part of the additional effort to reduce the deficit
comes from lower public investment, and expressed concerns about the potential impact on growth.
The authorities agreed with staff that the composition of the fiscal consolidation should be as
growth-friendly as possible. They intend to increase the efficiency of public investment by better
prioritizing high value-added projects aimed at increasing productivity and potential growth. As in
2012, the budget deficit is expected to be met through a mix of domestic and external official and
market financing.
16.
The authorities plan to undertake significant tax policy reform. Morocco enjoyed a
strong revenue performance in 2005–08. But this intake proved to be temporary, resulting from the
exceptional performance of the real estate and stock markets, and the finance, telecom, and natural
resource sectors, which all boomed during that period. The tax-to-GDP ratio fell considerably in
2009 and has stabilized since then at around 24 percent of GDP. Against this background, staff
supports the authorities’ intention to accelerate tax reforms, with a view to broadening the tax base.
A national conference on tax policy will be held in early 2013, for which the authorities have
requested technical assistance from the Fund. The conference is expected to consider reforms of the
taxation of the agricultural sector, the simplification of the tax code and streamlining of procedures,
the reduction of the number of VAT rates, the reduction in the number of special regimes and
loopholes, and the strengthening of tax administration. In addition, the 2013 budget introduces tax
measures to support the development of SMEs (see paragraph 6 of the authorities’ written
communication (W.COM.-¶6 in Appendix I)). It also introduces new taxes on net corporate profits,
high-income earnings, tobacco and profits of land sales to contribute to a Solidarity Fund created in
2012. The fund is to finance new social programs or the extension of existing ones, mostly on health
and education (W.COM.-¶8).
17.
The authorities aim to reduce the government wage bill to less than 11 percent of GDP
over the medium term. While the compensation of employees will increase in 2013 in nominal

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

MOROCCO

terms, mainly due to regular grade promotions and the creation of about 24,000 new posts in
education, health, and security, it is expected to decline by 0.3 percent of GDP, with no new acrossthe-board public wage increases being planned, in a departure from previous practice.5 Over the
medium term, the authorities plan to limit the creation of new posts to cover priority needs,
including by not systematically filling positions freed by retiring civil servants. The authorities also
intend to gradually introduce a system of performance-based salary increases (W.COM.-¶7).
18.
The authorities are preparing to reform the subsidy system, aiming to reduce its cost
to 3 percent of GDP by 2016. Staff and the authorities concur that the current system of
generalized subsidies on most energy and some food products needs to be reformed, as it is an
ineffective way to support the poor and a drain on the budget. Consistent with their intention at the
time of the PLL approval, the authorities plan to limit the subsidy cost to about 4½ percent of GDP
in 2013, as reflected in the 2013 budget, and have been actively preparing to reform the system. To
this end, as part of a consultative process on the reform, three technical commissions have worked
with economic partners and civil society on (i) evaluating the macroeconomic impact of possible
reforms; (ii) formulating proposals to revise the price structures of subsidized products; and
(iii) developing an alternative targeted social protection scheme. Several options are being
considered to reduce the cost of subsidies, such as gradually liberalizing industrial fuel, revising the
price formula for distribution costs, limiting the usage of subsidized butane gas to consumers,
gradually revising the prices of diesel and gasoline, and gradually reducing the coverage of some
food subsidies. Moreover, the government has stepped up its public communication on the cost of
subsidies, including through a full annex on this issue to the 2013 budget law. The authorities intend
to conclude their broad consultations on the options for reforms in the first quarter of 2013, so the
final decisions could be made rapidly and the reform start soon after (W.COM.-¶8).
19.
The gradual subsidy reform will be accompanied by a better-targeted system to
protect the vulnerable groups. The authorities’ overall objective remains to increase the passthrough from international prices to domestic retail prices gradually, while replacing universal
subsidies with a targeted package of social protection. These will include the programs on education
and health financed by the Solidarity Fund, as well as a nation-wide program of unconditional cash
transfers targeting the poorest segments of society and possibly the lower middle class and
financed by the savings from the reduction in the universal subsidies. The targeting commission has
been actively working with the World Bank on the design of a generalized system that would build
on existing programs by finalizing the creation of a unique register, determining benefits, and
preparing a communication campaign.
20.
Staff welcomed the important steps already taken, while stressing the urgent need to
move ahead with full implementation of the subsidy reform. The mission agreed with the
authorities that the reform of the current system should be progressive and move in parallel with
5

May 2011.

the rolling out of a better-targeted social protection scheme. Nonetheless, it stressed that the
current system makes the fiscal position more vulnerable to shocks to the international price of oil
and exchange rate, and that therefore the implementation of the reform needed to be initiated
without delay.6 On pricing, it noted that between the current system of flat subsidies and fully
liberalized prices, the authorities could consider intermediate pricing mechanisms allowing an
automatic adjustment of domestic prices to international prices while smoothing the impact of the
volatility of world prices (an objective that the authorities are pursuing by exploring hedging
options, in consultation with the World Bank). Staff also stressed the importance of a well-planned
communication strategy to explain the need for and directions of the reforms.
21.
The position of the general government is better than that of the central government
but, to ensure fiscal sustainability, pensions and decentralization require attention. Staff’s
assessment, based on data up to 2011, is that the general government (which includes the central
government, nonmarket public institutions, social security funds, and local governments) has
historically been in a better overall fiscal position than the budget of the central government. Two
factors explain this: (i) transfers from the budgetary central government to extrabudgetary units and
local governments have been partly saved by the recipient entities, and (ii) social security funds as a
whole had surpluses averaging 0.5 percent of GDP until 2011.7 However, the projected actuarial
deficit of the pension system may worsen the broader fiscal situation over the medium to long run if
not managed properly. Furthermore, the government’s intended move towards greater fiscal
decentralization needs to be managed carefully to safeguard against the fiscal risks of such a
process.



Pensions. Morocco’s demographic transition and its relatively high pension benefits make the
current system financially unsustainable, with large deficits projected over the medium to long
term (Box 1). Under plausible demographic and labor market assumptions, pension expenditure
would rise from 3 percent of GDP in 2011 to almost 10 percent by 2050, while contributions
would remain broadly flat. The main civil service pension fund (Caisse Marocaine de Retraites) is
expected to be in flow deficit from 2012 onwards and, absent reforms, may deplete its reserves
by 2020. The authorities agreed that the pension system needs urgent reforms. They have
prepared parametric and institutional options to restore the viability of the system while
increasing its relatively low coverage (27 percent of the labor force in 2010). The technical
commission for pension reform, instituted in 2003, provided formal recommendations at the end
of 2012. Welcoming this preparatory work, the mission urged the authorities to move quickly to
the implementation phase, noting that, at a minimum, parametric reforms would need to be put
in place rapidly (W.COM.-¶8).



Decentralization. Advanced regionalization is a key element of the recent constitutional reform
and a priority for the current legislature. The government is working on an organic law to
transfer more executive powers to the regional councils, following recommendations of an
advisory committee on this matter. Staff noted that transferring fiscal power to local entities may
in principle help improve spending efficiency, but that international experience shows that
decentralization entails fiscal risks and needs to be well managed to be undertaken in the most
fiscally responsible way (Annex). The authorities concurred and saw the reform as progressive,
with a gradual implementation over the coming years (W.COM.-¶9). Staff expressed the Fund’s
readiness to provide technical assistance in this area.

Reform options have been debated since 2003. A technical committee, which includes
representatives from the pension funds, social partners, and the government, recently concluded the
work started about a decade ago. Based on its findings, three reform options are being considered:
(i) parametric reforms within the current architecture, (ii) a system with two pillars (one public, one
private), and (iii) one fully integrated system. In the first instance, parametric reforms consisting of a
combination of increasing the retirement age, reducing benefits, and increasing contribution rates
are urgently needed, even though they would not fully resolve the financial situation of the
respective funds. A restructuring of the current system, including merging some of the existing
funds and extending their coverage, would also contribute to restoring financial soundness if
accompanied with a parametric reform. In all scenarios, it is probable that some recapitalization of
the most troubled public sector fund will be needed.1/
1/ Such recapitalization would be unlikely to affect the sustainability of public debt, as illustrated by the shock on
contingent liability in the public Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) (Figure 3).

B. Rebuilding External Buffers, Strengthening Competitiveness
22.
Morocco’s external position has been deteriorating over the past few years, following
an extended period of strength. Gross international reserves averaged close to eight months of
imports during 2001–08, but have fallen to about four months of imports since then as the current
account balance moved into deficit. The fall in the current account balance has been accompanied
by a rapid increase in unit labor costs (ULCs) consistent with a loss in competitiveness, although the
CPI-based real effective exchange rate was depreciating. The negative net international investment
position (NIIP) is projected to increase to 59 percent of GDP in 2012, with private and public debtcreating flows expected to become increasingly important in financing the current account deficit
over the medium term. External debt remains well below the average for emerging markets. It is
projected to peak at 27½ percent of GDP in 2013 and steadily fall to under 25 percent of GDP by
2017.

There is evidence of some external sector misalignment. The Fund’s pilot External
Balance Assessment (EBA) current account-regression methodology suggests that the dirham is
overvalued (Box 2). However, the external stability methodology under EBA and CGER-type methods
do not find evidence of significant overvaluation.9 On balance, staff considers that these results,
combined with rapid reserve losses and the downward trend in the current account balance, provide
evidence of some degree of overvaluation.

Box 2. Morocco: External Balance Assessment
Two of the three methodologies under the Fund’s new External Balance Assessment (EBA) were applied
to Morocco. EBA estimates the degree of external misalignment using three methods: (i) the current
account regression-based analysis, (ii) the external sustainability analysis, and (iii) the real effective
exchange rate (REER) regression-based analysis.1 Only the first two methods were applied to Morocco
as not all necessary data were available to apply the third one.
Under the current account method, Morocco is found to have a current account “gap” of about
-3.7 percent of GDP (i.e., a larger deficit
than expected, given the country’s key
characteristics), suggesting that the
dirham is overvalued. The contribution
of various macroeconomic policies to
the external misalignment, which is
based on estimates of “policy gaps” in
the areas of fiscal policy, social spending,
reserves policy, and capital controls is

Structural reforms to increase export diversification and competitiveness, and
continued fiscal consolidation are needed to support external sustainability. Morocco has
proven that it is an attractive destination for FDI. Recent important investments in the automobile
and aerospace industries are expected to boost exports in 2013 and contribute to a reversal of the
recent downward trend in the current account balance.10 The ongoing effort to lower the fiscal
deficit to 3 percent of GDP by 2016 will also contribute to reducing the savings-investment
imbalance in the short and medium terms. Further progress in strengthening the business
environment (including streamlining of procedures, reforming the judiciary system, and fighting
corruption), improving education and training programs, and reforming the labor, product, and
financial markets are needed to further increase FDI and boost competitiveness.11
26.
The authorities agreed that urgent
measures are needed to address external
pressures. They noted that the recent downward
pressures on the current account and reserves
were largely driven by high commodity prices
and a downturn in Europe. In this environment,
they stressed that the 2013 budget made
strengthening competitiveness a priority as part
of the government’s comprehensive strategy to
boost exports. They welcomed the rebound in

tourism receipts observed since October 2012 and expected it to continue in 2013 as tourists from
traditional and new markets return. The authorities are confident that the coming onstream of
ongoing or recently-completed projects, such as off-shoring agreements and public-private
partnerships with major international companies, will help boost exports in the period ahead,
thereby mitigating some of the external pressures. They also anticipate an increase in financial
services exports as Moroccan banks continue to expand abroad. They noted that planned fiscal
measures incentivizing investment and reducing tax-related labor costs, combined with continued
efforts to improve the business environment, access new export markets, and develop alternative
sources of energy will further contribute to reducing the current account deficit over the medium
term. In this context, they emphasized the continued trend of greater geographic diversification of
exports, including exports to Sub-Saharan Africa.
27.
The fixed exchange rate regime has provided an important nominal anchor for the
economy, but more flexibility is increasingly needed. The recent loss in reserves in the face of
rising energy prices and weak external demand underscores the vulnerability of the fixed exchange
rate regime to external developments. More flexibility in the exchange rate is increasingly needed to
help preserve Morocco’s competitiveness and better equip the economy to respond to external
shocks. Staff emphasized that early implementation of prerequisites will be essential for a successful
reform of the exchange rate regime and the monetary framework. The authorities recognized that
increased exchange rate flexibility would allow the economy to better respond to shocks and
support competitiveness, but considered that it was unlikely to have a large impact on exports in the
current context of weak external demand and that fiscal consolidation, including a reduction in
subsidies, was a prerequisite for exchange rate regime and monetary framework reforms. They were
also concerned about the possible increase in imported inflation (W.COM.-¶12).

C. Fostering Higher and More Inclusive Growth
28.
Morocco has made substantial progress in increasing inclusive growth over the past
decade, but additional efforts are needed. Morocco’s social indicators have improved over the
past decade. Higher economic growth, lower unemployment, better health and educational
outcomes, better access to basic infrastructure, and a marked reduction in poverty rates are tangible
evidence of the progress made in fostering inclusive growth. Additional efforts are, however, needed
to increase potential growth, further improve educational outcomes, and reduce the high youth
unemployment and inequalities in the distribution of income and access to health care, particularly
across regions.12
29.
The urgency of implementing growth and employment-enhancing structural reforms
has increased. Given the strong trade linkages with European countries, a protracted downturn in
euro area countries is likely to have significant short- and medium-term effects on Morocco’s
growth performance. Against this background, and given the limited space for macroeconomic
12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

MOROCCO

policy to boost demand in the short term, the need for trade and financial liberalization, structural
reforms in labor and product markets, and greater access to finance has arguably grown more
urgent. Potential gains from such structural reforms in employment and growth could be large. Staff
estimates that, with an ambitious reform agenda, the overall potential growth gain from undertaking
a full range of reforms might exceed two percentage points over the medium term. Similarly, labor
and product market reforms may have sizeable effects in reducing overall and youth unemployment
over the medium term. The authorities’ planned reforms, aimed at boosting competitiveness and
potential growth, accelerating private sector-led development by facilitating transparency in the
business environment, including by focusing on SMEs, and reforming the labor market, are therefore
welcome.13 They have also put in place a number of initiatives to support professional training, help
the insertion of new graduates into hiring firms, and foster entrepreneurship and self-employment.
30.
While higher growth and employment are prerequisites to reducing poverty,
strengthening social policies and increasing safety nets are also needed. Creating fiscal space to
increase resources for spending on health, education, and basic infrastructure is key to improving
outcomes and reducing disparities in access to health and education between different income
groups and between rural and urban areas. The increase in budgetary resources available for the
social sector will be obtained through savings from the subsidy reform and the new taxes financing
the Solidarity Fund as discussed above. Improvement in the quality of spending (including
investment in infrastructure, health, and education) and other efforts on revenue will also help.

D. Maintaining Adequate Monetary Conditions and Preserving the
Stability of the Financial Sector
31.
The current monetary policy stance is appropriate within the existing monetary and
exchange rate frameworks. BAM has been successful in keeping inflation in check. It is committed
to closely monitoring potential pressures from imported or domestic prices and taking all necessary
measures to ensure continued price stability. Facing a significant decline in systemic liquidity, it has
managed banks’ liquidity needs to keep the overnight rate close to its benchmark interest rate while
ensuring an adequate pace of credit growth (W.COM.-¶10). While a liquidity deficit remains, staff is
of the view that BAM’s current monetary stance is appropriate. This is because monetary policy
should guard against potential second-round effects on inflation of domestic energy price increases,
the nonagricultural output gap is only moderately negative, and further monetary policy loosening
would likely exacerbate pressures on the current account and lead to further downward pressure on
foreign reserves. As discussed above and in previous staff reports, the monetary framework will
need to evolve in line with a move toward a more flexible exchange rate.14
32.
The financial sector has proven resilient to the crisis, and BAM is further strengthening
regulation and supervision in line with new international standards. At the aggregate level,

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MOROCCO

capital adequacy and profitability ratios have remained appropriate. BAM is committed to fostering
the health of the banking sector through enhanced regulation and supervision, including the
gradual adherence to Basel III norms on capital adequacy and liquidity. BAM has increased the Tier 1
capital to risk-weighted asset ratio requirement to 9 percent and the regulatory capital adequacy
ratio to 12 percent, effective June 2013. The new definition of capital by the Basel Committee will be
adopted in April 2013. Regarding the liquidity coverage ratio, a draft law is expected to be finalized
once the final text is published by the Basel Committee. However, a transitory period will be
observed before this ratio becomes fully operational. To strengthen macro-prudential supervision,
mechanisms to better monitor systemic risk are being considered as part of ongoing reviews of the
central bank statute and the Banking Act. A systemic risk map has been elaborated with technical
assistance from the Fund, and work will continue in this area (W.COM.-¶11).
33.
The authorities are seeking to further deepen the financial sector. The financial sector is
large, with assets exceeding 110 percent of GDP. The three largest banks account for two-thirds of
the sector. Although it is relatively well-developed, the sector needs to mobilize additional resources
to further expand and maintain adequate credit growth. Overall, staff supports the authorities’ and
the sector’s strategic directions for the development of the sector, which include:


Access to finance. The authorities are seeking to make finance accessible to a larger part of
the population by promoting the development of products and services more adapted to
their needs and by improving financial literacy. The development of Islamic finance, for
which a framework is being prepared as part of a new banking law, is expected to help in
that respect. The authorities have also taken measures to extend micro-credit activity. They
target a ratio of financial access of two-thirds of the population by end-2014, up from
54 percent at present.



Credit to SMEs. To improve SMEs’ access to credit, BAM, in coordination with the General
Confederation of Moroccan Enterprises (CGEM), is taking measures to strengthen financial
transparency and risk assessment tools, improve dissemination of information and advice on
banking services, and better adapt collateral instruments to the needs of SMEs.



Internationalization. Already present in 23 countries, the largest banks are further expanding
their presence in Africa while increasing reliance on borrowing on international markets as a
source of funding. During its discussions with BAM, staff noted that financial expansion
comes with new challenges for banking supervision. Staff welcomed BAM’s close monitoring
of these activities and its efforts to strengthen domestic supervision and coordination with
supervisory agencies in recipient countries.



Financial hub. The authorities are planning to further develop Casablanca as a financial
sector center to operate as a regional hub for financial activities. Staff noted that such a
strategy would be supported by greater flexibility in the exchange rate and openness in the
capital account.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

MOROCCO

FSAP. The authorities expressed interest in an update of the 2008 FSAP, which could provide
a useful basis for making further progress on the authorities’ agenda. The mission strongly
supports this interest.



34.
Morocco is currently listed by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as a jurisdiction
with strategic anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT)
deficiencies. While significant progress has been made, the criminalization of terrorism financing is
still inadequate and Morocco is at risk of being elevated to a higher level in the FATF list. This could
lead to additional scrutiny by foreign financial institutions and potential negative consequences for
the domestic financial sector. The authorities indicated that they are in the process of undertaking
the necessary legislative changes in line with international standards.

PROGRAM-SPECIFIC ISSUES
35.
The program is on track. The end-October 2012 quantitative indicative targets on the
central government fiscal deficit ceiling and NIR floor were both met. The proposed revised endApril 2013 and new end-October 2013 targets are consistent with the planned fiscal consolidation
efforts and stabilization of reserves at an adequate level.
36.
Morocco continues to meet the qualification criteria for a PLL. It continues to have
sound economic fundamentals and institutional policy frameworks, is and has a track record of
implementing sound policies, and remains committed to such sound policies in the future. Morocco
performs strongly in three out of the five areas (financial sector and supervision, monetary policy,
data adequacy) while not substantially underperforming in the two other areas (fiscal policy, and
external position and market access):
Morocco has a record of sound public finances over a prolonged period, despite the
recent challenges. Morocco’s fiscal policy had been prudent until 2011 when rising
international oil prices led to a widening of the central government fiscal deficit.15 In 2012,
the authorities took significant measures that helped reduce the deficit to about 6 percent of
GDP, including an increase in domestic energy-related prices. They met their end-October
2012 fiscal deficit target. They are committed to a consolidation path consistent with
bringing the deficit to 3 percent of GDP in 2016 through a combination of measures
(notably tax reform, moderation of the wage bill, and subsidy reform) that will improve longterm fiscal sustainability. The 2013 budget confirms these commitments, and implies a
significantly larger reduction in the deficit than initially anticipated under the PLL. Staff
assesses the public sector debt to be sustainable.16



15

However, the deficit of the general government was only about half that of the central government in 2011.

16

The coverage of the public sector in the public sector debt sustainability analysis is that of the central government
(Table 8 and Figure 3) as data on the accounts of the general government come with a long lag. Nevertheless, at
end-2011, the gross debt stock of the general government was only ½ a percentage point of GDP higher than that of
the central government. Furthermore, the results of the DSA show that public debt continues to be sustainable under

(continued)
20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MOROCCO



Pressures on Morocco’s external position mostly stem from exogenous shocks; market
access at very favorable terms was reconfirmed with the recent bond issuance. External
pressures continue to be a concern and resulted in a widening of the current account deficit
in 2012. However, the external debt remains low and reserve levels have stabilized in the last
quarter of 2012 and remain broadly adequate. The successful issuance of a US$1.5 billion
bond in December 2012 at very favorable terms has helped support external buffers and
clearly demonstrates continued market access. Looking ahead, the authorities’ program of
sustained fiscal consolidation and structural reforms to boost competitiveness, notably by
improving the business climate and professional training, and fostering access to new
markets, will help reduce the current account deficit and underpin external sustainability. The
exchange rate regime continues to be consistent with the fiscal-monetary mix: while the
deterioration in fiscal and external positions has weakened the appropriateness of the
exchange rate regime in relation to the fiscal-monetary policy mix, the authorities are taking
actions to ensure fiscal sustainability and restore the consistency of the policy mix.



Morocco’s monetary policy is credible and transparent and, in combination with
exchange rate policy, has a strong record of keeping inflation low and stable. Monetary
policy has kept inflation low at 1.3 percent in 2012. BAM has been effective at anchoring
inflation expectations by influencing the overnight interest rate and adjusting the reserve
requirement rate as needed, while maintaining a fixed exchange rate against a basket of
dollar and euro.



The financial sector has remained sound overall, supported by effective supervision.
The tier 1 capital ratio is well above 9 percent, and NPL ratios continue to be stable and low.
BAM has been active in providing the necessary liquidity. BAM is committed to continuing to
foster the health of the banking sector through enhanced regulation and supervision,
including the gradual adherence to Basel III norms relating to capital adequacy and liquidity.



Morocco subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). Data provision
has been appropriate in all sectors.

37.
Were Morocco to draw the entire amount available under the PLL, it would be wellpositioned to repay the Fund. This positive assessment is based on the following rationales: i)
access would be slightly below the median and significantly below the mean exposure of recent
exceptional access cases, and far below the access of recent crisis resolution programs, as discussed
in the staff report for the PLL request;17 ii) Fund credit would represent a modest share of Morocco’s
low external debt, and the reserve coverage ratio would be comfortable; and iii) external debt
service would increase moderately over the medium term and would be manageable under staff’s
a contingent liability shock of 10 percent of GDP (far above the estimated recapitalization cost of the public sector
pension system), hence suggesting that a broadening of the coverage of the public sector would not alter the
assessment of debt sustainability.

baseline medium-term macroeconomic projections, as well as adverse scenarios around this
baseline, which could result, for instance, from the materialization of risks flagged in the risk
assessment matrix (Table 10).18
38.
The safeguards assessment of BAM, which is substantially complete, found an overall
robust safeguards framework, including strong control mechanisms. However, under the
current legal system, the effectiveness of these mechanisms is reliant on continuing to have strong
staff in key positions. Staff is therefore of the view that current existing good practices and key
safeguards should be formally enshrined in the new central bank law that is being prepared. Steps
are also needed to enhance financial reporting. As a first step, the authorities have improved
transparency through the publication of a full set of audited annual financial statements. Measures
recommended by the assessment have no implications for the completion of the first review, and
will be monitored going forward.

STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
Morocco’s extended period of sound economic performance has been challenged by a
combination of domestic and external shocks. Morocco has enjoyed sustained growth, low
inflation, and a stable financial sector over the past decade. However, a widening of the fiscal deficit
in the face of social pressures and a worsening external environment have eroded fiscal and external
buffers. In addition, in 2012, growth was dragged down by a lower-than-average harvest. Inflation
remains subdued despite domestic energy price increases, while unemployment has remained high,
especially among the youth.
40.
The PLL program is on track and its design remains adequate, but the outlook hinges
upon the sustained and timely delivery of important reforms. Morocco continues to meet the
qualification criteria for the PLL. Both end-October 2012 quantitative indicative targets were met.
The PLL continues to support the authorities’ economic program, which aims to ensure fiscal
sustainability, increase competitiveness, potential growth, and employment through structural
measures, and maintain prudent monetary and financial policies. However, in the context of a
deteriorating external outlook and risks heavily tilted to the downside, prompt, consistent, and
sustained implementation of the policies underpinning the PLL are needed for the authorities to
achieve their objectives. The key reforms are socially and politically difficult, but delays would only
contribute to increasing existing vulnerabilities. At the top of the agenda is continuing to address
short and longer-term fiscal issues, through measures that include fiscal consolidation supported by
a reform of the general subsidy system and better targeting of social protection, as well as reforms
to boost competitiveness, potential growth and employment.
41.
Staff supports the authorities’ fiscal consolidation path, within which space needs to
be created for higher and more efficient social spending. The authorities’ fiscal strategy is in line

Under the most extreme shocks, the DSA shows that the external debt would remain low and sustainable reflecting
Morocco’s capacity to repay the Fund even under an adverse scenario (Figure 4).

with their commitment to maintain fiscal sustainability and support external adjustment. The 2013
budget implies a larger reduction of the deficit than originally expected under the PLL. Staff
considers that this is consistent with the more difficult external position and uncertain global
environment. Staff highlighted the need to ensure that the composition of fiscal consolidation
continues to support growth objectives, notably by maintaining an adequate level of productive
investment. Within the authorities’ planned fiscal medium-term path, space needs to be created for
higher spending on education, health, and basic infrastructure. In that context, the authorities’
planned tax policy reform rightly aims at widening the tax base.
42.
On the expenditure side, there is urgency to move ahead with the reforms of the
costly and inefficient subsidy system and of the pension system. Staff supports the authorities’
plan to gradually reduce the government’s wage bill as a share of GDP. It welcomes their
commitment to improving the targeting of subsidies and reducing their cost to 3 percent of GDP
over the medium term, starting with a reduction of the subsidy bill to about 4½ percent of GDP in
2013. Staff stressed that the current system makes the fiscal position more exposed to external
shocks and that its reform should start without delay. Staff underlined the need for an explicit and
well-communicated strategy, which should include gradual price adjustments and mitigating
measures to protect the poorest sectors of the population. After years of preparation and debate,
the reform of the pension system is also urgently needed to ensure its viability while extending
coverage to the large share of the population currently without coverage. Looking ahead, staff notes
that it will be important that the planned decentralization be conducted with appropriate fiscal
safeguards.
43.
There is a need to strengthen competitiveness and better equip the economy to
respond to external shocks. Morocco’s external position has been deteriorating over the past few
years. Gross international reserves have fallen as the current account deficit widened. The PLL has
played an important role as insurance against external shocks. However, in the absence of
adjustments, continued pressures on the current account would erode buffers and exacerbate
external misalignment. Staff considers that the planned fiscal consolidation and structural reforms to
improve the business climate and increase export diversification will help underpin external
sustainability. Investment in education and training is also needed. Moving towards a more flexible
exchange rate is increasingly needed to enhance the economy’s ability to absorb shocks and
preserve competitiveness. Such a move should be carefully coordinated with other macroeconomic
policies, while the shift toward a new monetary policy framework is also being prepared.
44.
Over the past decade, Morocco has made substantial progress in increasing potential
growth and making it more inclusive, but additional efforts are needed. Morocco’s social
indicators have improved over the past decade, but additional efforts are needed to increase
potential growth, improve educational outcomes, and further reduce youth unemployment and
inequality in the distribution of income and access to health care. The authorities’ planned reforms
aimed at boosting potential growth, accelerating private sector-led development, and reforming the
labor market, are welcome in this regard.

45.
Monetary policy has remained appropriate. BAM has been successful in controlling
inflation while undertaking monetary policy actions to address the deterioration of bank liquidity,
although the tightness of liquidity conditions was not fully alleviated. However, further monetary
stimulus is not warranted at this time as it would likely exacerbate pressures on the current account
and lead to a further deterioration of foreign reserves, and monetary policy should guard against
the second-round effects of increases in domestic prices of subsidized products.
46.
Staff supports BAM’s efforts to continue strengthening regulation and supervision
while fostering the development of the financial sector. The financial sector has remained sound
overall, but further development will hinge on its ability to adapt its funding strategies. Staff
welcomes BAM’s plan to further strengthen financial regulation and supervision. It also supports the
direction of further financial sector development and deepening, noting in particular that greater
financial access is needed to foster higher and more inclusive growth. However, staff notes that
financial development, including international expansion, may come with new challenges for
banking supervision. Staff supports the authorities’ interest in an update of the 2008 FSAP.
47.
The PLL has supported the authorities’ efforts to rebuild buffers and address mediumterm challenges by providing insurance against external risks. The adoption of the PLL also
helped improve market conditions. Staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to continue treating the
PLL as precautionary.
48.
Staff’s assessment is that Morocco continues to qualify for the PLL and that the
program is on track. Furthermore, the authorities are committed to continuing their overall sound
policies while addressing remaining vulnerabilities. Staff therefore recommends the completion of
the first review, subject to the Board’s assessment in the context of the 2012 Article IV consultation
presently discussed that Morocco’s policies are generally positive.
49.
In accordance with the policy for PLL countries, the next Article IV consultation is
proposed to take place on the standard 12-month consultation cycle.

1/ Public sector includes central government only.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.

The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium- and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.

1/ Shaded areas represent actual data. Individual shocks are permanent one-half standard deviation shocks.
Figures in the boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the baseline and scenario being
presented. Ten-year historical average for the variable is also shown.
2/ For historical scenarios, the historical averages are calculated over the ten-year period, and the information is
used to project debt dynamics five years ahead.
3/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and primary balance.
4/ One-time real depreciations of 30 percent and 10 percent of GDP shock to contingent liabilities occur in 2013,
with real depreciation defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local
currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).

ANNEX. FISCAL DECENTRALIZATION
1.
Decentralization is a key element of the recent constitutional reform. The goal is to
empower regional councils and formalize their roles in order to foster more inclusive development.
An advisory committee (Consultative Commission for Regionalization) was appointed by the King in
January 2010 to prepare, in consultation with various stakeholders, a roadmap for a new model of
decentralization. This would be the basis for an organic law to transfer more executive powers to
democratically elected regional councils.
2.
The concept of a decentralized state in not new in Morocco. Morocco already operates
under a system in which regions have some autonomy, and raise some of their own revenue while
also receiving transfers from the central government. Currently, the regions’ own resources from
local taxes account for about 40 percent of their total revenue. Central government transfers to
regional councils represent half of their revenue and consist of 30 percent of VAT receipts, one
percent of corporate tax receipts and one percent of income tax receipts overall.1 However, the
distribution of those resources amongst respective regions involves a cumbersome process that has
generated disparities between regions. Broadly speaking, the allocation of resources consists of
three types of flows: (i) lump sum transfers based on size and population which are mainly used to
finance recurrent spending; (ii) special allocations to finance investment spending; and (iii) incentive
funding based on past (local) revenue collected. There are also differentiated rules between
provinces, municipalities, rural versus urban areas, etc., which render resource allocation even more
complex and, in some cases, exacerbate inequalities.
3.
The Consultative Commission proposed a number of significant reforms. They include:
(i) democratizing of the regional councils, which are to be elected through universal suffrage;
(ii) improving governance at the regional level; (iii) transferring competencies from the central
government to local councils; and (iv) systematically involving regional councils in the elaboration
and implementation of development strategies and in the discussions on large infrastructure
projects affecting their region. In addition, given large disparities between regions in terms of
human capital, a plan to bring up to speed regions that are lagging behind would be proposed.
Furthermore, a mechanism of equalization between regions is proposed. To support these efforts,
two new funds are being proposed, one for capacity-building and one for regional solidarity. The
former is to be funded by the central government and to aim at addressing shortcomings of regions
in infrastructure, human development, and basic social services within a 12-year horizon.2 The latter
is to consist of contributions from regions based on their own resources with the aim of reducing
resource inequality. In addition, it is recommended that the government increase transfers to help
regional councils fulfill their development objectives. Specifically, the proposal calls for: (i) higher
regional taxes (without significantly increasing the national tax burden); (ii) increased borrowing
1

In addition, the state transfers 13 percent of receipts of the tax on insurance contracts, along with proceeds from a
special assistance fund.
2

The estimated overall cost needed to fund the regional capacity-building program is between 15 and 25 percent of
GDP, to be funded in tranches from the budget over 12 years.

capacity for regions; (iii) an increase from 1 percent to 5 percent of the shares of proceeds from
corporate and income taxes allocated by the state to regions; (iv) an equal repartition between the
central government and the regions of registration fees and special taxes on motor vehicles; and (v)
the eligibility of regions for VAT receipts with respect to investment.
4.
Although fiscal decentralization can improve the efficiency of allocation and the quality of
provided goods and services, international experience shows that if not soundly designed it can also
pose risks to macroeconomic stability.


Benefits and Costs. The main benefits from decentralization rest largely in improvements in
the allocation of public goods and services, as subnational governments enjoy a
comparative advantage in accounting for the diversity of preferences. In addition,
decentralization can increase efficiency by increasing competition and accountability, and by
allowing experimentation in the provision of public goods and services. At the same time,
decentralization could pose risk to macroeconomic stability by: (i) reducing the effectiveness
of automatic stabilizers and limiting the ability to conduct discretionary stabilization policies;
(ii) creating moral hazard problems and leading to overspending, low revenue collection,
and higher fiscal deficits; (ii) undermining the quality of public goods and services when
geographic and functional mobility of civil servants is limited; (iii) weakening economic
activity by increasing spending volatility and fiscal uncertainty; and (iv) decreasing the
strength of governance.



Empirical evidence. Empirical studies seeking to quantify the relationship between
measures of fiscal decentralization and macroeconomic variables have yielded contradictory
findings, with results varying according to the definition of fiscal decentralization used, time,
and country coverage. While this ambivalence is partly due to difficulties in compiling
comparable measures of fiscal decentralization across countries, there is a common
consensus that it is the design of intergovernmental fiscal relations that affects efficiency
and growth, as well as macro-stabilization.



Policy lessons for a sound design.3 While the optimal design of decentralization depends
on each country’s specific circumstances including macroeconomic, institutional constraints,
and preferences, some general lessons can be drawn from international experiences:
(i)

Decentralization should start with a clear definition of the role of each level of
government in the provision of services, to avoid duplication, waste, and loss of
accountability.

(ii)

The sequencing of decentralization should be appropriate, with resources made
available to subnational governments pari passu with the assignment of spending

3

(2009).

40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MOROCCO

responsibilities. In this context, it is important to define ex ante the resource
envelope devoted to subnational governments that would allow them to carry out
their spending assignments with an adequate level of efficiency.
(iii)

The pace of decentralization should be linked to the capacity of subnational
governments to carry out effectively the functions assigned to them. In particular,
increased devolution of expenditure functions should be conditioned on compliance
by the subnational governments with a minimum set of public finance management
(PFM) requirements, and asymmetric arrangements should be considered during the
starting phase when capacity varies across subnational levels.

(iv)

Investments in capacity-building and the improvement of PFM at the subnational
level are a prerequisite to ensuring that the potential efficiency gains of
decentralization are achieved.

(v)

Control by the central government over a portion of subnational resources should
be considered, to promote accountability of those governments to their
constituents, as well as fiscal responsibility. To enforce any form of control,
availability of relevant information is crucial, including, information on debt and
contingent liabilities. Limits to subnational borrowing are also needed in most cases
to ensure adequate fiscal discipline.

(vi)

Intergovernmental transfers should be considered, to offset resulting vertical
imbalances and to moderate horizontal imbalances within each level of government.

(vii)

Complementary policy reforms, such as in the civil service and regulatory
frameworks, should be envisaged when the geographic and functional mobility of
civil servants (including providers of health and education services) is limited.

APPENDIX I. WRITTEN COMMUNICATION
Rabat, Morocco
January 17, 2013
Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
U.S.A.

Dear Ms. Managing Director:
1.

Morocco continues to pursue sound economic policies. Despite the deterioration in the

international environment, Morocco's economic fundamentals remain strong, and recent
performance has been consistent with the government's economic program supported by the
Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL). While Morocco continues to face risks relating to
uncertainties in the world economy, the authorities remain committed to implementing the
economic policies described in the letter sent on July 27, 2012, with a view to achieving their shortand medium-term macroeconomic objectives.
2.

Low rainfall and a worsening external environment have slowed growth in 2012 and

increased the pressures on the external accounts. The slowdown in the first three quarters of the
year was mostly due to a lower-than-average agricultural harvest. However, the continued support
of domestic demand is expected to keep nonagricultural GDP growth strong at 4.5 percent. Inflation
has remained subdued and the unemployment rate stable at about 9 percent. The banking system
remains sound and monetary conditions have been supportive of economic activity. In 2012,
imports rose more quickly than exports, owing to high food and energy prices and to the continued
deterioration of the economic situation in Europe. In addition, tourism receipts and remittances
were also affected. Nevertheless, the effort to consolidate public finances has helped to limit the
worsening of the savings investment balance. Reserves stabilized at an adequate level and were
recently strengthened following a $1.5 billion bond issuance on the international financial market.
The success of this issuance and the retention of the "investment grade" rating for Morocco are a
sign of investors' confidence in the Moroccan economy.

42

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MOROCCO

3.

Morocco is not faced with immediate balance of payments needs, but the persistence of an

unfavorable external environment will likely continue to create pressures on reserves. The Moroccan
authorities' program includes a comprehensive set of economic policies and structural reforms to
deal with such pressures. Fiscal consolidation and the prudent stance of monetary policy should
help to reduce the current account deficit in the near term. The reforms under way, which aim to
increase the functioning of the product and labor markets, and the measures to promote training
and education, combined with the accelerated implementation of sectoral strategies, will help
improve potential growth and external competitiveness and ensure medium-term sustainability of
the external accounts. In the current uncertain economic environment, the PLL arrangement serves
Morocco's needs well, and Morocco will continue to treat this arrangement as precautionary, unless
unforeseen external shocks or a substantial worsening of the international environment relative to
current assumptions require additional financing to meet an urgent balance of payments need.
4.

The 2012 budget was implemented in line with government objectives. Revenue and

expenditure have been on track to meet our targeted fiscal deficit reduction in 2012. The cumulative
deficit at end-October was DH 41.0 billion, slightly below the indicative target of DH 41.6 billion. The
measures taken in June to raise the prices of certain subsidized petroleum products, as well as
savings in operating expenses and the rationalization of investment expenditure, together with a
sustained effort in revenue collection, will help to bring the 2011 deficit from 6.8 percent of GDP
down to about 6 percent of GDP in 2012.
5.

The government's strategy with regard to public finances is to rebuild fiscal space while

promoting competitiveness and stronger, more inclusive growth. The objective is to reduce the
deficit to 4.7 percent of GDP in 2013 and lower it further to 3 percent by 2016, in line with the
government's program.
6.

On the revenue side, the government intends to continue reforming tax policy to widen the

tax base, reduce the number of special regimes, close tax loopholes, and improve the fairness of the
tax system, while strengthening tax administration and encouraging the integration of the informal
sector. The 2013 budget introduces tax measures to reduce the tax burden on small and mediumsized enterprises with a view to supporting their development and promoting employment in the
private sector, and measures to strengthen revenues intended to finance social cohesion programs,
such as those described in paragraph 8 below. The tax conference, “Assises Fiscales” scheduled for

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

43

MOROCCO

early 2013 will provide the opportunity to organize a broad debate with social and economic
partners to establish the guidelines for tax reform.
7.

On the expenditure side, the government's aim is to continue to contain the wage bill to

reduce it to below 11 percent of GDP in the medium term. Accordingly, the government intends to
limit the creation of budgetary posts to cover the administration's priority needs. Additionally, a
remuneration system based on job type and performance will be established in the medium term,
replacing the current system based on a grading scale. Efforts to maintain strong public investment
will continue, while stressing the need for rationalization and improvement of its efficiency.
8.

The government's objective in the area of social protection is to gradually reduce universal

subsidies in favor of a system based on direct monetary transfers and other social safety net
measures targeting poor and vulnerable members of the population, while progressively increasing
international price pass-through of currently subsidized products. In this context, in consultation
with the economic sectors concerned and with civil society, three ministerial technical committees
carried out the following: (i) an assessment of the macroeconomic impacts of various reform
options, (ii) a review of targeting options for social transfers, and (iii) an identification of options for
revision of price structures. The conclusions of this technical work will form the basis for a broad
consultation to be organized during the first quarter of 2013, with political parties and labor unions
to help shape the reform of the system, such that the final decisions can be made swiftly and the
reform can start in 2013. In order to strengthen the resources allocated to social protection, the
2013 budget includes a new tax on net corporate profits, on high income earners, as well as taxes on
tobacco, insurance contracts, and the delivery to self of residential premises. The 2013 budget has a
budget allocation for subsidies of DH 40 billion in 2013, equivalent to 4.5 percent of GDP, in line
with the government’s aim to reduce these expenditures to 3 percent of GDP in the medium term.
The government also intends to swiftly complete consultations with the social and economic
partners, with a view to deciding on the terms of the pension system reform that will ensure its
sustainability and increase its coverage.
9.

As part of the Advanced Regionalization, a draft organic law is currently being prepared to

transfer additional executive powers to elected regional councils, to enhance the efficiency of
spending and to promote a balanced development of the regions. A road map will be developed
covering the implications of the regionalization program for the budget, with a view to establishing

44

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MOROCCO

the appropriate coordination, financing, and institutional arrangements while preserving the stability
of public finances.
10.

Inflation has remained low to date, despite the increase in domestic administered prices for

various energy products in June 2012. Bank Al-Maghrib continues to closely monitor any potential
external or domestic price pressures, and remains steadfastly committed to taking all necessary
measures to ensure price stability in the medium term. In response to growing liquidity needs,
resulting mostly from the fall in net external assets, the Bank reacted by injecting liquidity primarily
through seven-day advances and longer-term (three-month) repurchase agreements. In addition,
and given the persistence of the banks’ liquidity squeeze, the Board of Bank Al-Maghrib cut the
minimum reserve ratio from 6 percent to 4 percent at its September 2012 meeting. By the same
token, the collateral was widened to include all certificates of deposit as well as paper representing
loans to very small enterprises (VSEs) and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The Bank will
continue to supply the liquidity necessary to ensure appropriate financing of the economy. In
addition, it will further strive to encourage banks to use a broader range of refinancing instruments
to adjust their balance sheets. The Bank will continue to monitor closely the implementation of
refinancing plans adopted by some banks, in order to ensure that credit growth is supported by
stable resources that are better suited for their use. It will also ensure that banks hold sufficient
liquidity buffers on their balance sheets and adopt appropriate contingent plans to deal with
liquidity crises.
11.

Bank Al-Maghrib will continue to monitor the soundness of the banking sector and to

strengthen it with strong regulation and effective supervision. Accordingly, it will progressively align
the prudential framework with the new Basel III standards. In this regard, it raised the solvency ratio
to 12 percent and stipulated a Tier 1 ratio of 9 percent to be implemented in June 2013, and will
review the definition of capital in accordance with the new Basel III rules starting from the second
quarter of 2013. The Bank will also reform the short-term liquidity ratio to bring it into line with
international standards. The ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans remained stable at
5.2 percent at end-November 2012 and Bank Al-Maghrib will continue to ensure that such loans are
sufficiently provisioned. In addition, the reform of the central bank charter and the banking law
provides for new arrangements with regard to financial stability. The central bank and the other
financial sector regulators continue to strengthen coordination in this area. They have agreed on a
crisis management protocol and are working to establish a macroprudential framework. With this

prospect in view, the safeguard assessment mission to the Bank found that the reforms of the
central bank charter and the banking law incorporated the necessary financial stability provisions.
12.

The fixed exchange rate regime of the dirham against a euro/dollar basket has contributed

to economic stability over the past ten years by providing an important nominal anchor. However,
the maintenance of reserves at an adequate level could be jeopardized by the persistence of an
increasingly difficult external economic environment. After trending downward, reserves have
stabilized at about four months of imports. The authorities will continue their endeavors to maintain
reserves at an appropriate level through structural reforms to enhance external competitiveness, and
to attract foreign investment by continuing the process of fiscal consolidation, and turning to
international financial markets when necessary. In due course, the Moroccan authorities believe that
increased flexibility in the exchange rate would provide greater scope for the economy to respond
efficiently to external shocks and to strengthen competitiveness. Nevertheless, it will be essential to
strengthen medium-term fiscal sustainability in advance, specifically by reforming the subsidy
system and completing the preparation of the transition to a new monetary policy framework.
13.

The levels of central government deficit and net international reserves are in line with the

indicative targets at end-October 2012; we will continue to ensure that we meet the targets for endApril and end-October 2013 specified in Table 1 attached. We have also observed and will continue
to observe the standard criteria related to trade and exchange restrictions, bilateral payments
arrangements, multiple currency practices, and the nonaccumulation of external debt payment
arrears, in accordance with requirements under the PLL.
14.

In sum, we continue to pursue sound economic policies and remain steadfastly committed

to ensuring macroeconomic stability and external and fiscal sustainability in the medium term, as
well as to responding appropriately to any adverse shocks. Given that the economy remains
exposed to external risks, the insurance provided by the PLL remains important to support
Morocco's economic strategy. The descriptions in this letter, together with the letter dated July 27,
2012, requesting approval of a PLL arrangement, outline the main themes of our economic program,
on the basis of which we are requesting completion of the first review under the PLL.

Exchange Rate Arrangement and Exchange System

Morocco maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers on current international transactions. However, Morocco maintains certain restrictions
relating to Iraq and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), pursuant to UN
Security Council Resolutions. These are subject to notification to the Fund in accordance with
Decision 144 (52/51). The exchange rate is freely determined in the interbank foreign exchange
market, which was created in 1996. Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM) intervenes in the market to maintain the
exchange rate within its target range, defined around a fixed central rate. Morocco has a
conventional peg arrangement. The current exchange rate of the Moroccan dirham is pegged to a
basket of currencies comprising the euro and the U.S. dollar, with respective weights of 80 and
20 percent. BAM fixes daily rates for the rated currencies on the basis of variations on the value of
the basket. Rates for most currencies quoted in Morocco are established on the basis of the daily
dirham-euro rate and the cross rates for those currencies in relation to the euro in the international
exchange markets. As of January 2, 2013, the SDR/dirham exchange rate was SDR 1=MAD 9.60.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Morocco
On February 1, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Morocco.1
Background
Morocco has a track record of strong macroeconomic policies that, over the last decade,
contributed to solid growth, low inflation, comfortable external reserves, financial
deepening, and poverty reduction. These favorable developments have helped Morocco
cushion the impact of the international crisis and respond to pressing social needs. In the
context of political transitions in many countries in the region and high social demands, a
new constitution was adopted in July 2011 in order to pave the way for broad-ranging
political changes and reforms, including strengthened roles for the head of government and
Parliament. Morocco’s positive record helped it qualify last August for a 24-month
arrangement under the Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL), which aims to provide
insurance against external shocks. More recently, this performance has been challenged
by a deteriorating external environment and, in 2012, poor rainfall. Growth is expected to
slow in 2012 to 3.2 percent, largely due to a lower-than-average cereal crop, but
nonagricultural GDP growth is projected to remain robust at around 4.5 percent. Headline
inflation has remained subdued at 1.6 percent (year-on-year) in November 2012, despite
significant increases in the prices of several subsidized energy products in June, as part of
the government’s effort to contain the fiscal cost of subsidies. Core inflation (excluding food
and transport) was close to zero due to the large negative contribution of lower

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

MOROCCO

communication tariffs. Despite relatively strong growth, unemployment has remained
around 9 percent since 2010.
The fiscal deficit should decline to about 6 percent of GDP in 2012, thanks to a combination
of measures notably the increase in some energy-administered prices in June and the
control of nonessential spending. Delays in the adoption of the 2012 budget and in
disbursement of external grants resulted in lower-than-projected investment. This, in turn,
helped offset the subsidy bill that reached about 6.2 percent of GDP. The 2013 budget
envisions a further reduction of the deficit by 1.4 percent point of GDP to 4.7 percent of
GDP. For the medium term, the authorities aim at a deficit below 3 percent of GDP.
The current account deficit is expected to increase to 8.8 percent of GDP in 2012 as import
growth, pushed by energy-related imports, outpaced slow export growth. Tourism receipts
and remittances are projected to fall slightly relative to 2011, reflecting the deterioration in
the European economy. While gross international reserves (GIR) fell steadily in 2011 and
most of 2012, they stabilized at around four months of imports in the last quarter. The
issuance of a US$1.5 billion sovereign bond at favorable terms in late 2012 provided
additional support in this regard.
Monetary conditions have remained broadly supportive. Lower international reserves had a
substantial restrictive impact on bank liquidity, contributing to slowing credit growth to
7 percent in 2012. To help fill the liquidity shortage, the central bank stepped up its liquidity
injection, including by extending eligible collateral for its repo. The policy interest rate was
cut by 0.25 percentage point to 3 percent in March 2012 and has remained unchanged
since then. In September 2012, it also cut its reserve requirements for banks by
2 percentage points to 4 percent.
Morocco’s social indicators have improved over the past decade. Higher economic growth,
lower unemployment, better health and educational outcomes, better access to basic
infrastructure, and a marked reduction in poverty rates are tangible evidence of the
progress made in fostering inclusive growth. However, unemployment remains high
particularly among the youth. The authorities’ reform agenda includes measures to boost
potential growth, tackle inequalities in the distribution of income and access to health care,
particularly across regions as well as reduce unemployment.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their overall sound macroeconomic
policies, which, over the past decade, have helped deliver solid growth, low inflation, and
poverty reduction despite continued high youth unemployment. This strong performance
has been challenged recently by external and domestic shocks in a context of pressing
social demands. Directors agreed that the authorities’ program of fiscal consolidation,
prudent monetary and financial policies, and structural reforms to boost competitiveness
2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MOROCCO

and inclusive growth and rebuild shock buffers is appropriate to deal with these challenges.
They emphasized that the outlook hinges on the timely and sustained implementation of
the reform agenda.
Directors welcomed the fiscal consolidation envisioned in the 2013 budget and beyond to
help maintain external and fiscal sustainability, while emphasizing that consolidation should
be as growth-friendly as possible. They welcomed the steps being taken toward reforming
the subsidy system, and called on the authorities to move ahead resolutely in this area to
aid medium-term fiscal adjustment and better assist the most vulnerable groups of the
population. Directors also stressed the importance of moving ahead with pension reform to
ensure the system’s viability. They encouraged a careful approach to fiscal decentralization
so as not to increase fiscal risks. They welcomed plans to lower the ratio of the government
wage bill to GDP and accelerate tax reforms. Directors concurred that clear
communications and high-quality social dialogue will be key to successful implementation
of the fiscal reform agenda.
Directors considered the current monetary policy stance to be appropriate. They
encouraged the authorities to move toward greater exchange rate flexibility to enhance
external competitiveness and the economy’s ability to absorb shocks, in coordination with
other macroeconomic and structural policies.
Directors called for stepped-up efforts to foster higher and more inclusive growth, including
by boosting youth employment and reducing inequalities in income and in access to health
care and education. They underscored the importance of structural reforms to enhance
external competitiveness and diversify the export base. They welcomed planned reforms to
improve the business climate and promote small and medium-sized enterprises, both
crucial to accelerate private-sector-led growth.
Directors noted that the financial sector remains sound overall. They commended the
authorities’ efforts to further strengthen financial regulation and supervision, particularly in
light of increasing international exposure of Moroccan banks. In this regard, they welcomed
the authorities’ interest in a Financial Sector Assessment Program update. Directors
encouraged the authorities to strengthen legislation against money laundering and
terrorism financing, and to intensify reforms to promote financial development and
deepening.
Directors agreed that Morocco continues to meet the qualification criteria for a
Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL) arrangement. They noted that the arrangement
provides useful insurance against exogenous shocks and that the program supported by
the PLL is on track. Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to continue to treat the
PLL as precautionary.

Press Release No. 13/38
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 4, 2013

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

The IMF Executive Board Completes the First Review Under Precautionary and Liquidity
Line Arrangement for Morocco
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on February 1, 2013 completed
the first review of Morocco’s performance under an economic program supported by a two-year
Precautionary Liquidity Line (PLL) arrangement and reaffirmed Morocco’s continued
qualification to access PLL resources.
The PLL was approved on August 3, 2012 in an amount equivalent to SDR 4,117.4 million
(about US$6.3 billion, 700 percent of quota, see Press Release No. 12/287). The access under the
arrangement in the first year is equivalent to SDR 2.4 billion (about US$3.6 billion, or
400 percent of quota), rising in the second year to cumulatively SDR 4.1 billion (about US$6.3
billion).
The PLL arrangement will continue to support the authorities’ home-grown reform agenda
aimed at achieving higher and more inclusive economic growth by providing a useful insurance
against external shocks. The PLL was introduced to meet more flexibly the liquidity needs of
member countries with sound economic fundamentals and strong record of policy
implementation but with some remaining vulnerabilities.
The IMF’s Executive Board welcomed the authorities’ intention to continue treating the
arrangement as precautionary.
Following the Board’s discussion, Ms. Nemat Shafik, Deputy Managing Director and Acting
Chair, issued the following statement:
“Over the past decade, Morocco’s overall sound macroeconomic policies helped deliver solid
growth, low inflation, and poverty reduction, despite continued high youth unemployment. This
extended period of sound economic performance has been recently challenged by a worsening of
the external environment and a below-average harvest, even though the nonagricultural GDP
growth remained robust and inflation low. Against this backdrop, the authorities’ economic
strategy is built appropriately on fiscal consolidation, structural reforms and prudent monetary

MOROCCO

and financial policies. Sustained implementation will be key to rebuilding buffers, preserving
macroeconomic stability and achieving stronger and more inclusive growth.
“The arrangement under the Fund’s Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL), which the
authorities intend to continue to treat as precautionary, has provided Morocco with an insurance
against external risks and supported the authorities’ economic strategy.
“The authorities’ fiscal strategy, including the 2013 budget, is in line with their commitment to
maintain fiscal sustainability and support external adjustment. As part of this strategy, it will be
important to move ahead with the reforms of the general subsidy system and the pension system
and to better target social protection. Fiscal space needs to be preserved to support higher and
more inclusive growth.
“Efforts to strengthen competitiveness and better equip the economy to respond to external
shocks are a priority. The planned fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, such as those to
improve the business climate and professional training, will help underpin external
sustainability. Morocco is encouraged to move toward greater exchange rate flexibility to
enhance external competitiveness and the economy’s ability to absorb shocks, in coordination
with other macroeconomic and structural policies.
“Over the past decade, substantial progress has been made in improving social indicators.
However, sustained further efforts are still needed to increase growth and make it more
inclusive, notably by boosting employment, in particular of the youth, reducing income
inequalities, and increasing access to health care and education.”

Statement by Mohammed Daïri, Alternate Executive Director for Morocco
February 1, 2013
My authorities wish to thank Mr. Dauphin and his team for the excellent and fruitful
dialogue during the discussions on the Article IV consultation and the first review of the
PLL, and for the well-written staff report and useful Selected Issues Paper. They are
grateful to management and the Board for their continuous support and invaluable advice.
Recent economic developments and prospects
Despite an unfavorable environment, Morocco has maintained macroeconomic stability
and solid nonagricultural growth performance. After demonstrating strong resilience to
the global and the euro area crises over 2008-11, reflecting the strength of its
fundamentals and policies and the peaceful political transition, Morocco was adversely
affected in 2012 by several shocks, including a drought-related decline in agricultural
production, a worsening of the economic situation of its main partners in the euro area,
and further increase in world petroleum and other commodity prices. As a highly oil
import-dependent country and a large wheat importer, Morocco has been severely hit by
the unusual combination of high commodity prices and low world growth. Against this
background, the new Cabinet that took office in January 2012 announced an economic
medium-term program aimed at achieving higher and more inclusive growth while
preserving macroeconomic stability. In recognition of Morocco’s demonstrated track
record of strong policies and the authorities’ continued commitment to reform,
notwithstanding the difficult international environment and the pressing social demands,
this program was supported by the IMF under the PLL, with the objective of providing
insurance against a further deterioration of the international environment.
Implementation of the authorities’ program in 2012 was broadly satisfactory.
Nonagricultural GDP growth was maintained at 4 ½ percent, with total GDP growth at
3 percent. Inflation remained very low at 1.3 percent, despite the mid-year increase in
petroleum prices, which has not led to second round effects due to wage restraint.
Unemployment stabilized at 9 percent, even though it remained unacceptably high among
the youth. Improved weather conditions and continued solid performance of
nonagricultural sectors should help a recovery of GDP growth to 4 ½ percent in 2013,
with inflation remaining within a range of 2 to 2.5 percent.
The protracted slowdown in the euro area, which had limited impact on Morocco until
2011, affected more significantly the balance of payments in 2012. Exports declined in
US dollar terms, although part of the shortfall compared to PLL projections stemmed
from lower international prices for phosphates and derivatives and the drought-driven
decline in agricultural exports. Excluding these exogenous shocks, total exports remained
broadly unchanged from 2011, with significant contribution from the automobile sector,
following the entry into production of the new factory. Energy imports increased, in line
with international oil prices, but total imports are estimated to be lower-than-projected
under the PLL. Workers’ remittances and tourism receipts declined, with lower receipts
from some euro area countries mitigated by stronger flows from other regions. While the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

1

MOROCCO

current account deficit is estimated at around 9 percent of GDP, instead of 7.2 percent
under the PLL, part of the deterioration was due to lower-than-expected grants, since
agreements with GCC donor countries were not completed by end-2012 as envisaged.
With FDI remaining broadly unchanged at some 2 percent of GDP, gross reserves
declined, while import coverage remained at 4 months of imports, as a result of lower
projected imports.
Morocco’s strong fundamentals and policies in an unfavorable environment were also
recognized by the international capital markets, with its sovereign risk rating maintained
at investment grade, and CDS spread remaining moderate and declining further after the
announcement of the PLL. This enabled Morocco to raise $1.5 billion in the international
bond markets at very favorable terms, 1/3 of which at a 30-year maturity, with the
issuance several times oversubscribed and prevalence of US funds. Government access to
markets has helped attenuate the impact of the deterioration in the current account on
reserves and provides a benchmark for private borrowers.
The staff report also highlights the important progress made in improving social
indicators and inclusiveness, with noteworthy progress in per capita GDP growth,
employment, education and health indicators, access to infrastructure, and poverty
alleviation. The authorities are cognizant of the important remaining challenges. They are
strongly committed to strengthen growth and employment outcomes, with particular
emphasis on youth and female employment, improve labor participation and social
protection, and reduce income inequalities.
Fiscal policy
The authorities demonstrated strong determination to achieve their fiscal objectives for
2012. In addition to increasing energy prices in June, they strengthened revenue
collection and increased expenditure prioritization by further reducing nonessential
expenditures and greater selectivity in capital spending to preserve key social and
growth-enhancing programs. While the end-year data are not yet available, the fiscal
deficit, excluding grants, is estimated to decline in 2012, both in relation to 2011 and to
the projections under the PLL.
In line with the 3 percent of GDP target by 2016, the 2013 budget, the first to be
presented by the new Government, aims at reducing the deficit further to 4.8 percent of
GDP, half a percentage point lower than the target under the PLL. It includes a number of
new tax measures to support SMEs and mobilize resources for social programs, as
detailed in the Written Communication. Current expenditures are projected to decline,
reflecting the envisaged reduction in the cost of subsidies and the moderate wage policy.
Capital expenditures will increase by more than half a percentage point of GDP
compared to the expected 2012 outcome which, along with better selectivity, should
improve their growth impact.
The main objectives of the authorities’ tax policy reform are to enhance revenue
mobilization by broadening the tax base and reducing exemptions, strengthening

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MOROCCO

administration, and improving compliance and equity, including through better customer
relations and enhanced audit capacities, while promoting efficiency and competitiveness.
This will be crucial for the achievement of the authorities’ fiscal consolidation objectives
and for creating space for key infrastructure and social spending. It should also help
offset the significant impact of the gradual elimination of tariffs on imports under the
association agreement with the EU, which was just completed in 2012, as well as the
ongoing reduction in corporate and income tax rates to bring these more in line with other
emerging markets’ levels. A national conference on tax reform (Assises Fiscales)
scheduled in early 2013, involving the main stakeholders and tax experts, to which the
Fund has been invited, will provide the opportunity to discuss the challenges facing the
tax system and the roadmap for reform.
In line with their objective of reducing the fiscal burden of the subsidy system and
improving its targeting, the authorities have just completed, in close consultation with the
economic sectors concerned and civil society, a comprehensive technical work aimed at
assessing the macroeconomic impact of various reform options and the related targeting
and pricing options. On the basis of this technical work a broad consultation involving
trade unions, political parties, and other stakeholders will be organized in the first quarter
of 2013 to reach a consensus on the reform strategy.
The authorities are also cognizant of the risks stemming from the pension system. They
are determined to take the necessary measures to restore its viability and reduce the
related fiscal risks while broadening its coverage. Actuarial studies and identification of
options for reform have been completed and made public, and broad consultations with
social partners expected in early 2013 will help draw a roadmap for reform.
The Advanced Regionalization program aims at deepening the democratic process and
promoting regional economic development by giving greater executive powers to elected
regional bodies. It should help in better assessing local needs and setting priorities,
enhancing spending efficiency and control, and mobilizing own resources. The program
provides for a contractual framework for sharing spending responsibilities and revenue,
and emphasizes good governance and public expenditure management. To meet human
resource needs, the civil service legislation will be reviewed to facilitate staff
redeployment to the regions. The authorities are cognizant of the potential fiscal risks
linked to decentralization. In this regard, utmost importance will be given to preserving
fiscal and debt sustainability at the state and the regional levels, and implementation will
be gradual.
Monetary and financial policies
Bank Al-Maghrib remained vigilant in responding to the economy’s financing needs
following the tighter bank liquidity stemming from the decline in foreign assets, while
closely monitoring inflation and external developments as well as financial stability. In
response to the difficult environment and in the absence of inflationary pressures that
would threaten medium term price stability, the central bank’s Board reduced the policy
rate by 25 bps to 3 percent in March 2012, and maintained it at the same level in its

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

3

MOROCCO

subsequent meetings. The central bank increased its liquidity injections and broadened
eligibility to its facilities, including to SMEs. In its September meeting, the Board
reduced the reserve requirement by two percentage points to 4 percent. While broad
money growth moderated to 3.4 percent in November from 6.5 percent in 2011, credit to
the economy increased by 5.6 percent.
The central bank continued to enhance the soundness of the banking system through
stronger regulation and effective supervision. It closely monitored banks’ liquidity and
the refinancing plans agreed with some banks, and encouraged the banks to diversify
refinancing instruments and adopt appropriate contingent plans to deal with liquidity
crises. The ratio of NPLs has stabilized at a low level and the central bank is taking the
necessary action to ensure that their provisioning remains adequate. Cooperation with
other supervisors is being strengthened to preserve financial sector stability. As
elaborated in the authorities’ Written Communication, Bank Al Maghrib is progressively
aligning the prudential framework with the new Basel III standards, with significant
advances already implemented or to take effect in June 2013. It is also closely monitoring
Moroccan banks’ growing presence in Africa, in close coordination with host countries’
supervisors. The central bank is also giving high priority to further improving financial
inclusion by expanding access to banking services and establishing an observatory for
very small enterprises. Further progress in deepening and strengthening the stability of
the financial system, a gradual move to exchange rate flexibility and further capital
account liberalization, along with continued strong policy implementation, will be crucial
for successful establishment of Casablanca Finance City as a regional financial hub. The
authorities are in the process of introducing the necessary legislative changes to fully
comply with international AML/CFT standards.
The Safeguards Assessment mission has recognized the robustness of Bank Al-Maghrib
safeguards framework and the strong control mechanism. The central bank is grateful for
the useful discussions and recommendations, some of which have already been
implemented, while others are addressed in the draft new central bank law. It will give
due consideration to other recommendations, some of which are still being discussed with
the mission.
External sector and exchange rate policies
The authorities are cognizant of the risks from the unfavorable external environment and
are working to strengthen the resilience of the economy, reduce vulnerabilities, and
rebuild fiscal and external buffers. They are not overly worried about the decline in
foreign reserves in the short term, since the current level, supported by the PLL, is
adequate to face unanticipated external shocks, and while attentive to the cost of holding
reserves, they have ample room to rebuild reserves further if needed, in view of the low
external debt and the favorable market sentiment toward Morocco. This being said, they
consider that fiscal consolidation will be crucial for strengthening the external position
and the reserves cushion.

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MOROCCO

While the authorities agree with staff that the pegged exchange rate system has served the
economy well so far by providing a useful nominal anchor, the authorities are of the view
that a move to more exchange rate flexibility is contingent on a number of conditions.
Among the key preconditions are: putting the budget position on a firmer path toward
fiscal sustainability, including by removing the key vulnerability arising from the
untargeted subsidy system; further deepening the capital markets; and further
strengthening the monetary policy framework. They are working in earnest toward
meeting these conditions to allow a smooth transition to the new system.
The authorities do not see strong evidence of an appreciation of the real exchange rate.
They note that, in addition to the usual uncertainties attached to this type of calculations,
only the current account method used by staff suggests some overvaluation of the
currency, whereas the very small overvaluation estimated under the external
sustainability analysis falls well within the margin of error. In this regard, the authorities
underscore the importance of the appropriate timing for a move to more exchange rate
flexibility, including a more responsive international environment.
Enhancing competitiveness and the business climate
The authorities attach high priority to enhancing competitiveness, which they are seeking
mainly, in addition to sound macroeconomic policies, through increased labor
productivity, with better education and vocational training, wage moderation, and
improved business climate. In this regard, significant efforts are being made in
developing infrastructure, streamlining regulations, strengthening the rule of law and the
judiciary, fighting corruption, and ensuring fair competition and a level playing field,
including through further product market liberalization. Progress in these areas and other
related issues will be monitored by a recently established high level Competiveness
Committee involving government and private sector participants. The major solar and
windmill power projects underway, as well as a program aimed at enhancing energy
efficiency, along with clearer price signals, should help reduce dependency on energy
imports and related vulnerabilities. The authorities are encouraged by the success of their
efforts at diversifying the economy and exports, and the strong interest expressed by
major foreign investors in the Moroccan economy, as evidenced by the mega projects
being implemented in high value-added sectors such as aviation and the automobile
industry, as well as the progress made in accessing new export markets. Ongoing
strategic partnership discussions with GCC countries will open new possibilities for
enhanced trade and FDI.
Conclusion
Staff has provided strong evidence of Morocco’s continued qualification to the PLL, with
the program implemented as envisaged, including compliance with the indicative
indicators for the fiscal deficit and net international reserves for end-October, and the
authorities’ continued commitment to program objectives. In view of the risks from the
still uncertain external environment, the authorities request Board approval of their
request for completion of this first PLL review. They remain firmly committed to staying

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

the course of sound policy implementation to achieve their broader economic and social
objectives under their medium term program. In this regard, they consider maintaining
social peace and stability, as crucial for the success of their reform efforts. The authorities
will continue to treat the PLL as precautionary.
