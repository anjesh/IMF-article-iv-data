IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Zambia
On May, 20, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Zambia.
Zambia has strong growth potential, but lingering vulnerabilities pose risks to the outlook. In the
last two years, the Zambian economy has been weighed down by large fiscal imbalances, lower
copper prices and policy uncertainties. Real GDP growth has slowed, the current account has
deteriorated, international reserves have fallen and the exchange rate has been under downward
pressure. Fund staff estimate that real GDP growth slowed from 6.7 percent in 2013 to
5.6 percent in 2014, driven by a contraction in copper production. Year-on-year inflation fell
from a peak of 8.1 percent in November 2014 to 7.2 percent in March 2015, largely driven by
lower fuel prices. The fiscal deficit on a cash basis rose sharply to 6.5 percent of GDP in 2013
and remained elevated at 6 percent in 2014.
The Zambian kwacha has fluctuated widely since the beginning of 2014. After depreciating by
about 20 percent in the first half of the year, it recovered in the second half of the year reflecting
tightened monetary policy and the issuance of Zambia’s second Eurobond in the amount of
US$1 billion. Downward pressures on the Kwacha re-emerged in the first quarter of 2015
reflecting external developments (U.S. dollar strength, and lower copper prices) as well as
domestic factors (growing fiscal deficit, depleting government deposits and a change in the fiscal

regime that adversely affected the outlook for the mining sector). Monetary policy has carried
the burden of containing inflation and countering the depreciation pressures on the Kwacha.
Growth is projected to average 5.5–7 percent a year over the medium term, reflecting the impact
of investments in mining and electricity in recent years. Inflation is projected to stay in single
digits and decline gradually to 5 percent. Key risks to the outlook are delayed fiscal adjustment
in the lead-up to general elections in 2016, persistent low copper prices, and policy uncertainties
that could undermine investment in the economy. On the upside, steps taken by the government
to resolve mining taxation problems by easing documentation for VAT refund claims by
exporters and the decision to rescind the new fiscal regime for mining introduced in
January 2015 could lead to higher copper production and growth.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that, after a period of strong macroeconomic performance, the
Zambian economy is facing significant challenges arising from large fiscal deficits, lower copper
prices, and policy uncertainties. Directors emphasized that steadfast and strong efforts are
needed to ensure macroeconomic stability and foster inclusive growth.
Directors underscored the need for significant fiscal consolidation in 2015 and over the medium
term, to reduce the deficit, stabilize debt, and create conditions for lower interest rates.
They welcomed the authorities’ decision to implement the policy of full cost recovery in the
pricing of petroleum products. Directors called for sustained expenditure and revenue efforts,
including efforts to contain the wage bill, target social spending through cash transfers, broaden
the tax base, and put the pension system on a sustainable footing. They also welcomed the
authorities’ decision to rescind the royalty-based mining fiscal regime, and called for swift
action to resolve the issue of outstanding VAT refund claims to exporters.
Directors welcomed recent progress in the implementation of public financial management
reforms, including the Integrated Financial Management Information System and the pilot phase
of Treasury Single Account. They encouraged the authorities to utilize these tools to strengthen
2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can

budget controls to avoid the accumulation of arrears, and to enhance the transparency of the
budget process by improving fiscal reporting.
Directors noted that Zambia’s moderate risk of external debt distress calls for prudence in
borrowing on commercial terms. Recognizing the need to address infrastructure gaps, they
advised the authorities to strengthen the project selection process and prioritize capital spending.
They also called for the development of a comprehensive debt management strategy to help
address public debt vulnerabilities.
Directors supported the commitment of the Bank of Zambia to maintain a tight monetary policy
stance to contain inflationary pressures. They stressed the importance of continued exchange rate
flexibility and rebuilding reserves to provide adequate buffers for the economy.
Directors noted that the financial sector remains well capitalized and stable, and commended the
strengthened banking supervision. They recommended continued efforts to enhance financial
inclusion, including improving access to financial services in rural areas. Directors also called
for the elimination of interest rate ceilings as they restrict access to credit.
Directors noted that poverty remains high, particularly in rural areas. To foster job creation,
inclusive growth, and economic diversification, Directors encouraged the authorities to improve
the business climate by restraining labor costs and ensuring a stable regulatory environment.
They also recommended action to address infrastructure and electricity supply constraints;
develop skills; and rationalize farm subsidies with a reallocation of resources to the social cash
transfer program.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
May 5, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context. Zambia achieved strong growth and macroeconomic stability over most of
the last decade. However, in the last two years, the Zambian economy has been facing
strong headwinds from large fiscal imbalances, lower copper prices, and policy
uncertainties. The current account has deteriorated, international reserves have fallen,
and the exchange rate has been under downward pressure.
Outlook and risks. Provided the authorities implement strong adjustment measures,
growth is projected to remain at annual rates of 5½–7 percent over the medium term,
as investments in mining and electricity bear fruit. Annual inflation is projected to stay
in single digits and decline gradually to 5 percent. Key risks to the outlook are
persistent low copper prices, delayed fiscal adjustment in the lead-up to general
elections in 2016, and policy uncertainties that could undermine mining operations and
overall investment in the economy.
Resolving mining sector tax issues. A large build up of VAT refund claims of
exporters and a change in the mining fiscal regime that came into effect at the
beginning of 2015 adversely impacted the outlook for the mining sector which
accounts for three quarters of Zambia’s export earnings. The authorities have partially
addressed the VAT refund problem and have announced that the mining fiscal regime
will revert to a system similar to what was in effect in 2014.
Ensuring macroeconomic stability and reducing external vulnerability. Growing
fiscal deficits and depleting government deposits are threatening macroeconomic
stability. Fiscal adjustment and continued tight monetary policy will help stabilize the
exchange rate and contain inflation pressures. Given Zambia’s susceptibility to external
shocks, the Bank of Zambia should aim to rebuild reserves over the medium term.
Also, the export base needs to be diversified to reduce the high dependence on
copper.
Enhancing competitiveness and inclusive growth. The government needs to address
impediments to doing business and labor market policies in order to enhance
competitiveness and promote job creation. To maintain Zambia as an attractive
investment destination, frequent regulatory changes and uncertainty about policy
direction should be avoided.

ZAMBIA

BACKGROUND
1.
Zambia achieved high growth and macroeconomic stability over most of the past
decade (Figure 1). This performance was the result of market-liberalizing reforms that started in
the 1990s, strong copper prices (from 2004) which helped attract foreign direct investment (FDI),
and prudent macroeconomic policies. However, poverty remains high (at over 60 percent of the
population) with a large population of underemployed youth, and Zambia is likely to miss many of
the Millennium Development Goals (Table 9).
2.
The economy is facing strong headwinds. Over the last two years, large fiscal deficits,
lower copper prices and policy uncertainties have exerted significant pressures on the exchange rate
and slowed growth. The new royalty-based mining fiscal regime that came into effect in January
2015 dampened the outlook for production and investment in the mining sector, with ripple effects
to other sectors. On April 20, the cabinet of ministers approved a return to a mining fiscal regime
similar to what was in place in 2014, comprising a corporate income tax and uniform royalty.
This reversal, which is expected to become effective from July 1, requires parliamentary approval.
3.
There has been a large build-up of VAT refund claims of exporters and expenditure
arrears. In September 2013, the government tightened enforcement of documentation
requirements on VAT refunds, which led to a significant backlog of refunds (Appendix II).
Outstanding VAT refund claims grew from 1 percent of GDP at end-2013 to 3 percent of GDP at
end-2014. The documentation requirements for exporters were eased in February 2015 but there
has been no progress yet on resolving the outstanding claims.1 On the expenditure side, the
government accumulated domestic arrears equal to 2.5 percent of GDP in 2014, including to the
public pension system, contractors for road projects, and obligations associated with agricultural
subsidies.
4.
Progress in implementing past Fund policy advice has been mixed (Box 1). The fiscal
situation has worsened, and a new royalty-only mining fiscal regime was introduced against the
advice of Fund staff. Domestic fuel prices and electricity tariffs were adjusted to reduce subsidies,
but fuel subsidies re-emerged in early-2015 because of depreciation of the kwacha and a large
reduction in domestic retail prices in January (SI, Chapter IV). The Bank of Zambia (BoZ) tightened
monetary policy to contain inflation and allowed more exchange rate flexibility. The authorities have
also made progress in improving access to financial services.
5.
Zambia’s data provision has some shortcomings but is broadly adequate for
surveillance purposes. The authorities improved national accounts data with technical assistance
from the Fund, including rebasing their benchmark year to 2010 from 1994 and expanding
coverage. According to the rebased GDP data, 2013 nominal GDP was about 20 percent higher than
previously estimated.

1

The authorities have not formally recognized all these claims as obligations. Some of the claims were the subject of
court cases.

6.
A new president took office in January 2015. Following his narrow victory in a byelection, Mr. Edgar Lungu was sworn in as the sixth president of Zambia on January 25. He will serve
out the remainder of the term of President Michael Sata who died in October 2014. General
elections are scheduled for September 2016.
Box 1. Main Recommendations of the 2013 Article IV Consultation

Recommendations

Status

Fiscal policy: Reduce the fiscal deficit to 5 percent
of GDP in 2014 and to 3 percent over the medium
term by containing recurrent expenditures while
boosting domestic revenue.

Following a 45 percent average increase in wages
and salaries in late 2013, a two-year wage freeze
was introduced in 2014 and has been maintained
in 2015. While the cash deficit narrowed slightly in
2014, the underlying deficit increased as a result
of overspending, and accumulation of VAT refund
claims and expenditure arrears.

Public financial management: Stepped up
efforts are needed. In particular, investment
planning needs to be strengthened to support the
scaling up of capital spending.

Progress has been made in implementing the
Treasury Single Account and rolling out the
Integrated Financial Management Information
System (IFMIS), but investment planning needs to
be improved.

Monetary policy: BoZ needs to continue to
tighten monetary policy to contain inflation. BoZ
should allow more exchange rate flexibility and
continue to build up reserves.

BoZ tightened monetary policy. The exchange rate
moved flexibly and BoZ built up international
reserves, although still below its medium-term
target. BoZ removed the exchange restrictions in
the regulation on foreign exchange transactions.

Financial sector policy: Remove lending rate
ceilings as part of the effort to improve access to
financial services.

Access to financial services has improved but
lending rate ceilings remain.

Competitiveness. Staff advised maintaining a
good business environment for strong growth and
economic diversification.

Frequent changes in regulations and uncertainty
about policy direction are clouding the business
climate.

exchange rate pressure in the first half of 2014, the BoZ has maintained a tight policy stance; at its
November 2014 monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting, the BoZ increased the policy rate by
50 basis points to 12.5 percent, citing deterioration in the external sector and the objective of
lowering inflation to 7 percent by end-2015, and kept the rate at 12.5 percent at the February 2015
MPC meeting. In light of the renewed pressure on the exchange rate in recent months, the BoZ
increased reserve requirements from 14 to 18 percent from early April 2015.

Sources: Zambian authorities and IMF saff calculations.

11.
The external position has been under pressure (Figure 3). The current account deficit is
estimated to have widened to 1¾ percent of GDP in 2014 as a decline in imports (mostly driven by
lower investment activity in the mining sector and kwacha depreciation) was more than offset by a
reduction in non-copper exports. Financing inflows increased, but mainly due to proceeds from the
$1 billion Eurobond issued in April 2014, which allowed international reserves to rise to $3 billion
(3.8 months of imports) in 2014 from $2.7 billion (3.1 months of imports) in 2013. Since then,
reserves have again fallen back to the end-2013 level, partly reflecting intervention in the foreign
exchange market.
12.
Sovereign bond spreads. The yield for the Eurobond issued in 2014 was 8.625 percent,
3 percentage points higher than on the 2012 Eurobond at issuance. Zambia’s Eurobond yields have
tended to move broadly in line with those of other sub-Saharan African countries.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
13.
Zambia has strong growth potential. Growth in 2015 is expected to be maintained at the
2014 level (estimated at 5.6 percent) as the projected impact of increased output from the mining
sector (reflecting the coming on stream of a major new mine) is offset by a decline in agricultural
output due to unfavorable weather conditions. Over the medium term, growth is projected to
remain strong at 6–7 percent a year on the back of an expected further increase in mining
production due to large FDI in the sector in recent years. Given the depreciation of the kwacha and
expected increases in fuel prices, inflation is projected to reach 8 percent in 2015. Assuming the
authorities implement fiscal adjustment measures discussed with the mission and that monetary
policy remains tight, staff projects inflation to decline gradually to 5 percent in the medium term.
Increased copper production and non-copper exports together with the proposed fiscal adjustment
are expected to improve the current account to a small surplus over the medium term (Text Table 1).

Lingering vulnerabilities pose downside risks to the outlook (Box 2). The pressures on
the exchange rate in the first half of 2014 and earlier this year demonstrated the economy’s
vulnerability to shocks. Key external risks include a surge in global financial market volatility
(possibly linked to normalization of monetary policy in the U.S.), which could result in capital
outflows and higher financing costs, and persistent low copper prices, which would have significant
adverse effects on export earnings, investments, growth and government revenue.3 Domestic risks
include delayed fiscal adjustment and continued uncertainty about policy direction that could lead

to lower production in the mining sector and threaten investment more generally. On the upside,
the reversal of the royalty-only mining fiscal regime could lead to higher copper production and
growth than assumed in the baseline macro framework.
15.
Authorities’ views. The authorities were more optimistic about near-term growth prospects
but otherwise broadly agreed with staff’s assessment of the economy and outlook. They noted that
measures would be taken to contain the fiscal deficit in 2015 and over the medium term. They also
emphasized their commitment to improving the business environment, noting the recent changes to
VAT refund documentation and their ongoing dialogue with mining companies to address their
concerns.

ENSURING MACROECONOMIC STABILITY
16.
Strong and credible fiscal adjustment and policy coherence are needed to ensure
macroeconomic stability. Fiscal adjustment and maintaining tight monetary policy will help
stabilize the exchange rate and contain inflation pressures. Over the medium term, fiscal
consolidation would help achieve the authorities’ target of 5 percent annual inflation, improve the
current account balance, and facilitate the accumulation of international reserves. Shifting to a more
balanced macroeconomic policy mix with a tighter fiscal stance would allow room for lowering
interest rates to support investment and growth.

A. Fiscal Policy
Mining taxation
17.
The government underestimated the adverse consequences of a change in the mining
fiscal regime (SI, Chapter I). The change was from a dual (royalties and corporate income tax (CIT))
regime to a royalty-only regime—8 percent for underground mines and 20 percent for open cast
mining operations as final taxes. In response, several companies announced postponement of
planned investments and one company served notice to government that it was going to put its
operations in care and maintenance mode. Staff noted that at 6 percent, Zambia’s royalty rate in
2014 was already high by international standards, and that much higher rates would have a
significant negative impact on future production. In January–February 2015, mining revenue was
about 40 percent lower than projected. Staff urged the government to resolve the impasse over the
mining fiscal regime as quickly as possible but advised against mine-by-mine agreements that
would be difficult to manage and could lead to the government foregoing substantial revenues to
keep individual mines in operation. International best practice suggests that a sound regime ought
to be stable over time while also being flexible to fluctuating economic and financial conditions.
In staff’s view, this is best achieved with a regime that combines royalty and CIT. Staff recommended
that the government consider reinstating the 2014 regime while it undertakes a fresh review of
mineral taxation, in consultation with all relevant stakeholders. Staff also urged the authorities to
settle the issue of the outstanding stock of VAT refund claims.
18.
On April 20, 2015, the government announced that the mining fiscal regime will revert
to a system similar to what was in place in 2014. The main changes to the regime that came into
effect in January 2015 include: (i) a single royalty rate of 9 percent for all mines; (ii) 30 percent CIT on
mining operations; and (iii) variable profit tax. The changes require parliamentary approval.
The government plans to submit a bill on the new regime to the next session of parliament
(scheduled for June) and expects it to take effect from July 1.

Fiscal adjustment
19.
Absent strong adjustment measures, the fiscal deficit will rise sharply in 2015. The 2015
budget targets a deficit of 4.6 percent of GDP on a cash basis, but staff estimates that changes in
assumptions about the external and domestic environment as well as unbudgeted expenditures
10

would likely add about 4.0 percent of GDP to the deficit. 4 Furthermore, the clearance of expenditure

the authorities plan to maintain the current
wage freeze throughout 2015 and to cut spending on travel allowances, goods and services, and
agricultural subsidies (through increased efficiency in the operations of FRA and in the
implementation of the Farmer Input Support Program (FISP)). Moreover, capital spending would be
prioritized to strategic projects to create room to clear arrears on road projects, and fuel prices
would be adjusted to fully cover costs. Finally, 2 percent of GDP in this adjusted cash deficit refers to
paying off arrears and VAT refunds from previous years. Taking these out yields the underlying
deficit of 5.7 percent of GDP.
20.
In summary, the implementation of the proposed measures would reduce the
underlying fiscal deficit substantially in 2015 (Text Table 3). The underlying deficit would
decline from 10.6 percent of GDP in 2014 (see paragraph 10 above) to 5.7 percent of GDP in 2015,
mainly by avoiding a repeat of the expenditure overruns that occurred in 2014 (FRA extra maize
purchases, FISP) while also avoiding accumulation of new expenditure arrears and VAT refund
claims. Staff urged the authorities to better manage the government’s cash flow and deposits to
avoid the accumulation of new arrears.

Downward revision to revenue to reflect the impact of lower copper prices, reduction in projected volume of

unbudgeted capital spending (0.2 percent of GDP); higher intergovernmental transfers (0.2 percent of GDP); and cost
of presidential and parliamentary elections (0.1 percent of GDP).

21.
Given the small size of the domestic financial market, staff recommended that the
government limit recourse to domestic financing to less than 2 percent of GDP to avoid
crowding out private sector credit. Even after taking the measures discussed above, this would still
leave a need for almost 6 percent of GDP of external financing in 2015. Staff expressed concerns
about the increasing reliance on external borrowing and urged the authorities to consider additional
measures (including on the revenue side) to avoid excessive external borrowing. The authorities
are considering various options for external financing, including non-concessional bilateral and
multilateral loans.
22.
Staff recommended that the authorities reduce the overall fiscal deficit to 3 percent of
GDP over the medium term to limit the rapid increase in government debt (Text Chart). In the view
of staff, this strikes an appropriate balance between the need to reduce the large fiscal deficit and
meeting infrastructure investment needs, and would stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio at around
40 percent. This level of debt is moderate, but considering limited absorptive and debt management
capacities, it would be prudent to limit debt-financed spending to critical public infrastructure
projects. If the deficit is not reduced, the fiscal position will become unsustainable (Text Chart).

23.

Possible measures to achieve projected medium-term fiscal consolidation include:



Raise the VAT rate.5



Harmonize corporate income tax rates (by raising rates on low-tax sectors).



Reduce tax expenditures.



Restrain growth in the wage bill (including through a comprehensive civil service reform).



Eliminate fuel subsidies by enforcing the policy of full cost recovery in the pricing of
petroleum products.



Enhance efficiency of FISP (including by moving to an e-voucher system).



Move to cost-reflective electricity pricing to ease pressure on the budget and attract much
needed investments into the energy sector.

24.
Subsidies and social benefits. Current government subsidies are costly (2 percent of GDP
in 2014) and are not well targeted towards the poor. Recent assessments by the World Bank and
other development partners indicate that there is significant scope for reducing poverty by shifting
resources from subsidizing FRA operations and FISP to the better targeted social cash transfer
program. Staff urged the government to scale up the social cash transfer program by re-allocating
resources. Staff also recommended that the government limit the operations of FRA to its mandate
of maintaining a strategic reserve (understood as requiring no more than 500,000 metric tons of
maize) and leave the bulk of the distribution of maize to the private sector.

Zambia’s rate of 16 percent is below the median for sub-Saharan Africa (17 percent).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

ZAMBIA

25.
Pension reforms. Putting the pension system on a sustainable footing remains an important
challenge facing the government. The Public Service Pension Fund (PSPF) had arrears of 1.6 percent
of GDP at end-2014, which the government intends to clear by 2018, including about 0.4 percent of
GDP in 2015 (Tables 2 and 3). The government announced that it intends to modify the decision
taken last December to increase the retirement age for civil servants from 55 to 65, by lowering to
60 and introducing the option for early retirement at age 55. Staff highlighted the need to continue
with pension reforms to ensure the financial sustainability of the system, including by revising the
formula for calculating benefits and reviewing commutation factors.
26.
Managing risks. Zambia does not have scope to respond, especially on the fiscal side, to a
significant downside scenario. In the event of disruptions to proposed external financing for the
budget or delayed fiscal adjustment, there is limited space for additional domestic financing.
Any revenue over-performance, including from higher-than-projected copper prices, should be used
to reduce the fiscal deficit further rather than being used for higher spending.
27.
Authorities’ views. The authorities emphasized their determination to implement all the
adjustment measures discussed with staff, which would be reflected in a mid-year budget to be
presented to Parliament in June. They agreed that fiscal deficit reduction would help rebuild fiscal
space, which will help the country cope with future shocks, and would rebalance the macroeconomic
policy mix, which will facilitate the lowering of interest rates. They noted that although government
debt is still modest by international standards, its rate of increase has been rapid and needs to be
arrested. The authorities indicated that no decision has been made on the nature of external
financing and that, to reduce external borrowing costs, they are considering borrowing from the
non-concessional window of the African Development Bank for a number of investment projects.
They stressed that the government is strongly against mine-by-mine agreements to resolve the
current impasse over mining tax issues.

Fiscal structural reforms
28.
Revenue administration reforms. Staff supported ongoing efforts to strengthen the
capacity of Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) to effectively monitor the tax returns of mining
companies. Staff welcomed the progress made in cross checking taxpayers’ information between
customs and the domestic revenue services and the introduction of electronic filling and payment,
which will help improve efficiency and enhance transparency. Staff encouraged early
implementation of the Mineral Value Chain Monitoring framework.
29.
Public Financial Management (PFM) reforms. Staff urged the authorities to step up PFM
reforms in order to improve budget planning and implementation and fiscal reporting. Staff
welcomed the progress made in rolling out the Integrated Financial Management Information
System (IFMIS)—bringing coverage to 44 out of 51 institutions—and encouraged the authorities to
resolve remaining implementation issues, including generation of in-year cash based financial
reports reconciled with banking data. Staff emphasized the importance of maintaining appropriate
levels of government deposits to prevent arrears accumulation and highlighted the need to
strengthen the government cash flow forecasting framework. In this regard, the launch of a pilot

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ZAMBIA

phase of the Treasury Single Account (TSA) at the Ministry of Finance (MoF) in January 2015 is
welcome, but the TSA needs to be extended to other line ministries to help improve cash
management and strengthen transparency and accountability. Internal information sharing remains
weak, with inconsistent figures between the BoZ and the MoF (Budget Office, and Investment and
Debt Management Unit).
30.
Investment planning. While there is a need to boost infrastructure, investment planning is
weak and procurement practices are frequently poor. Staff underlined the need to strengthen the
public investment cycle by properly vetting projects, aligning them to the country’s development
strategy, and improving government’s project appraisal capacity. In light of projected rises in
commercial borrowing, debt management also needs to be improved further.
31.
Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed with the need to strengthen PFM and investment
planning, and noted that, with TA from IMF and other donors, they are stepping up PFM reforms.
Given growing pressures on the government budget, the authorities intend to speed up the
implementation of the TSA, which will improve liquidity management and reduce borrowing by
utilizing line ministries’ idle balances at banks. The authorities plan to improve collaboration across
ministry units and with the BoZ to produce more reliable data.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
32.
Exchange rate regime. Zambia has a floating exchange rate regime with the authorities
committed to intervening in the foreign exchange market mainly to smooth excessive volatility.
Exchange rate flexibility provides an important buffer for the economy. In view of the susceptibility
of the economy to external shocks, the authorities are also committed to rebuilding international
reserves to provide at least four months of import cover.
33.
Monetary policy stance. The BoZ intends to maintain a tight monetary policy stance in line
with the inflation target of 7 percent for end-2015 and 5 percent over the medium term. Risks to
inflation are on the upside over the near term, because of the recent large depreciation of the
kwacha and the need to increase retail fuel prices. The large fiscal imbalances are complicating the
BoZ’s task of containing inflation. Staff supported the recent tightening of monetary policy, which
reduced the banking system’s liquidity and helped stabilize the kwacha. Should further tightening
be needed, the BoZ should consider raising the policy rate on a temporary basis to signal its
determination to restore stability.
34.
Monetary policy framework. The BoZ introduced the policy rate in 2012. Given the still
weak interest rate transmission mechanism, staff supported the BoZ’s plan to keep reserve money
and bank liquidity in check during the transition period from conducting monetary policy through
reserve money targeting to conducting policy through the policy rate. Further progress will be
needed to develop high frequency indicators of economic activity to aid policy formulation.
Successful implementation of a TSA starting in early 2015 will help improve liquidity forecasting.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

ZAMBIA

35.
Interest rate caps aimed at reducing the cost of credit are impeding access to finance,
particularly by small- and medium-scale enterprises. Staff noted that caps on commercial bank
lending rates have become increasingly binding as treasury bill rates have risen. Moreover, the
current level of the lending rate cap for microfinance institutions appears lower than the minimum
level required to compensate for the credit risk and high administration costs relating to microenterprise loans, limiting access to credit by micro-enterprise borrowers. Staff urged the authorities
to remove the caps.
36.
Authorities’ views. The authorities reiterated their commitment to a flexible exchange rate
regime. They stated that BoZ will maintain a tight monetary policy stance to contain inflation.
Utilizing the ongoing Norway/MCM TA, BoZ will continue to develop all the structures necessary for
the effective functioning of the policy rate as the main policy tool. BoZ plans to implement a credit
market monitoring program with support from a foreign NGO to collect data needed to conduct an
in-depth study of the impact of the lending rate ceilings.

C. Financial Sector Stability
37.
Background. The banking sector (which dominates the financial sector) has grown steadily
and remains well-capitalized. Credit growth has moderated since mid-2013 (see private sector credit
panel in Figure 4), and the average lending rate has increased substantially. Nonperforming loans
(NPL) have declined from 15 percent of total loans in 2010 to 6 percent in December 2014.
One medium-sized bank was successfully restructured, contributing to the decline in NPL, and the
BoZ continues to make efforts to strengthen two small banks’ balance sheets. Banks’ total credit to
the private sector remains low at 14 percent of GDP in 2014, below the sub-Saharan regional
average (21 percent), but their exposure to foreign currency denominated loans is relatively high at
25 percent of total loans. Banks face limited funding risks since loan-to-deposit ratios remain low at
60-65 percent and their dependence on wholesale funding is limited. Moreover, the banking system
is profitable and well-capitalized with Tier 1 and total capital adequacy ratios of 25 and 27 percent,
respectively. The Basel II capital framework is expected to be implemented later in 2015. Most banks
have met the new minimum capital requirements, and the minimum capital requirements for
nonbank financial institutions were increased in 2014.
38.
Banking supervision. Staff supported the BoZ’s intensive banking supervision to assess
potential build-up in vulnerability and risks to financial stability. The BoZ is closely monitoring banks’
net open foreign currency positions given the large exchange depreciation and volatility since early
2014. Staff also welcomed the BoZ’s efforts to conduct stress testing of bank balance sheets and
produce a financial stability report. Given the importance of stress testing to assess banks’ potential
vulnerability and its implications for adequate bank capital requirements, future stress tests should
be more stringent than ones based on historical events.
39.
Financial inclusion. Staff welcomed the authorities’ continued efforts to enhance financial
services delivery by strengthening the Credit Reference Bureau, expanding bank branches and agent
banking in rural areas, and improving credit culture. The planned introduction of a unified collateral
registry system, agency banking guidelines, and an Insolvency Bill will further facilitate credit

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ZAMBIA

provision and improve access to financial services. Staff analysis indicates that relaxing constraints
on collateral appear to offer the greatest benefits in terms of economic growth while inclusion of
firms is better tackled through measures that lower financial participation cost (SI, Chapter II).
40.
Authorities’ views. The authorities noted that the BOZ is carefully monitoring
developments in bank and nonbank lending and collecting weekly returns on banks’ net open
foreign currency positions, which show that banks largely comply with the applicable prudential
limits. On foreign currency loans, the BoZ stated that they assess the adequacy of banks’ foreign
exchange risk management frameworks during onsite inspections and found no major problems; a
large part of the foreign currency loans have been provided to borrowers which generate foreign
currency incomes, such as export-oriented commercial farmers and mining companies.
The authorities noted enhancing financial inclusion as a government priority.

REDUCING EXTERNAL VULNERABILITY
41.
The external position has been under pressure in the last few years. Reflecting sharp
declines in government saving, the current account balance has deteriorated by about 7 percent of
GDP between 2012 and 2014, despite an increase in copper exports by about 3½ percent of GDP.
Reducing the pressure on the exchange rate and improving the current account balance in a lasting
way will require large reductions in fiscal deficits over the medium term. Increased copper exports
and the planned fiscal adjustment are projected to improve the current account balance. Resolution
of uncertainties around mining taxation and fiscal adjustment is likely to attract FDI and portfolio
inflows resulting in an overall balance of payments surplus, which, in turn, would allow the BoZ to
accumulate reserves in line with its medium-term target of 4 months of imports.
42.
Given weaknesses in metrics for assessing the adequacy of reserves in Zambia
(Appendix I), staff advice was based mainly on recent developments in the country. In view of
the fast pace of reserve depletion in the last two years, the economy’s vulnerability to external
shocks and the need to boost confidence in the kwacha, staff advised BoZ to seize opportunities to
rebuild reserves to its medium-term target of 4 months of import cover.
43.
Exchange rate assessment. Two model-based approaches, EBA-lite and ERER, provided
divergent assessments (Appendix I). EBA-lite indicated that Zambia’s current account deficit was
larger than the level consistent with the medium term fundamentals by almost 5 percent of GDP in
2014, partly reflecting loose fiscal policy. ERER suggested that the real exchange rate was slightly
undervalued. Taking into account uncertainties about data quality, the recent deterioration in the
external terms of trade, the relatively flat real effective exchange rate over the last the last few years,
and the loose fiscal policy over the last two years, staff concludes that the kwacha was moderately
over-valued in 2014. The planned fiscal deficit reduction and improved policy stability and
consistency (particularly regarding the mining sector) should ease pressure on the exchange rate.
44.
Coping with terms of trade shocks. The historically high terms of trade and increases in
FDI and copper production have been key drivers of economic growth over the past decade.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

ZAMBIA

With copper exports representing three quarters of total exports in 2014, Zambia is vulnerable to
terms of trade shocks. The country needs to diversify its export base. The floating exchange rate will
help by depreciating when the terms of trade fall, making other tradable goods and services more
competitive.
45.
Debt sustainability analysis (DSA). Zambia’s external debt remains relatively low, but
vulnerabilities have increased. With higher fiscal deficits and borrowing than assumed in the
previous DSA, the current DSA indicates moderate risk of external debt distress and heightened
public debt vulnerabilities (see DSA). Under the baseline and alternative scenarios, all the external
debt sustainability indicators remain below their thresholds, but the debt service-to revenue ratio
breaches the threshold under a number of shocks. With Zambia’s increased access to international
capital markets, it will be important to develop a comprehensive debt management strategy.
Contingent liabilities of the public sector, particularly the operations of SOEs, need to be monitored
closely.
46.
Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment of the external
balance and the exchange rate. They indicated that BoZ will start building up reserves once the
foreign exchange market stabilizes. With respect to the DSA, the authorities noted that, to
strengthen debt management, the MoF prepared its own DSA in 2014 with donor assistance, and
that the results were similar to those obtained by staff. However, they emphasized that they do not
intend to rely on the international capital markets to the extent assumed under staff’s baseline
scenario. They referred to ongoing work by the MoF on a debt management strategy aimed at
lowering refinancing risks among other objectives. Specific actions under consideration to facilitate
repayment of the Eurobonds include establishment of a sinking fund.

ENHANCING COMPETITIVENESS AND INCLUSIVE
GROWTH
47.
Background. Despite strong growth over the past decade, poverty remains high at
over 60 percent of the population, well above the sub-Saharan Africa average of 48 percent.
Urban poverty has fallen to about 30 percent, but rural poverty remains high at over 70 percent, and
high youth underemployment persists. Assessments of constraints to inclusive growth in Zambia
suggest that reforms are needed to address bottlenecks in infrastructure services, low quality of
human capital, low agricultural productivity, and weak business environment (SI, Chapter III).
Zambia’s ranking in the latest Doing Business indicators shows a slight decline as compared to the
previous year. In particular, Zambia needs to make improvements in getting electricity,
trading across borders, and registering property. Zambia’s revised Sixth National Development Plan
(2013–16) proposes to address constraints to inclusive growth by focusing on developing
infrastructure and human capacities, promoting employment and developing rural areas.
Better prioritization of various development projects is needed given the difficult fiscal situation.
48.
Agriculture. Rationalizing farm subsidies and other distortive government interventions in
agriculture can support greater diversification, trade competitiveness, and rural income growth.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ZAMBIA

Periodic trade bans (e.g., on maize exports and wheat imports), market distortions caused by
FRA pricing and procurement policies, and inefficiencies in the FISP discourage private investment in
agricultural production and food processing. Savings from eliminating the inefficiencies can also
support the scaling up of the more targeted cash transfer program to reduce poverty more
effectively.
49.
Fuel supply. Although ensuring cost-recovery fuel pricing will reduce pressures on the
budget, cutting the underlying cost of supplying fuels is needed to enhance the competitiveness of
Zambia’s economy. Staff discussed the need to increase transparency in national fuel procurement.
In light of the worldwide transition towards larger-scale and more efficient oil refineries, it will also
be important to reevaluate the benefits of continuing to operate a national refinery.
50.
Minimum wage policies are hindering job creation. The public sector minimum wage is
about three times the private sector minimum wage, which is already higher than in many
neighboring and peer countries. Pressuring private companies to adopt the public sector minimum
wage will hamper the country’s competitiveness and job creation. To encourage job creation, the
government needs to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the welfare of workers and
adding to the costs of doing business. Staff recommended promoting labor-intensive employment
through improving skills development and the business climate.
51.
Authorities’ views. The authorities underlined that the government’s priority is to
maintain high capital spending on roads and electricity to address key bottlenecks to inclusive
growth and competitiveness, but agreed that better prioritization can deliver results more efficiently.
They stated that against the backdrop of recent fuel shortages in the country, the government is
reviewing fuel procurement policies to reduce pressures on the budget and facilitate reliable supply.
The authorities noted that extending the government minimum wage to the private sector is not
official policy.

STAFF APPRAISAL
52.
Outlook and risks. The Zambian economy is facing strong headwinds. Large fiscal
imbalances, lower copper prices, and policy uncertainty are dampening economic activity and
putting pressures on the exchange rate. Key risks to the outlook are persistent low copper prices,
delayed fiscal adjustment, and domestic policy uncertainties that threaten to lower investment and
current production in the mining sector. Zambia’s risk of external debt distress is moderate but the
overall risk of debt distress is heightened by public debt vulnerabilities.
53.
Macro policy mix. The curent policy mix combines tight monetary policy and a loose fiscal
stance. Monetary policy has carried the burden of fighting depreciation; the Zambian kwacha
depreciated by about 20 percent in the first quarter of 2015. There is an urgent need to ensure
macroeconomic stability by implementing a credible fiscal deficit reduction plan. Fiscal adjustment
and maintaining the current tight monetary policy stance will help stabilize the exchange rate and
contain inflation.

ZAMBIA

54.
Fiscal deficit reduction. Staff estimates that the 2015 deficit is likely to reach 10 percent of
GDP, on a cash basis, in the absence of further measures. Revenue is projected to be lower than
budgeted by about 1 percent of GDP, and unbudgeted spending to amount to about 4 percent of
GDP, including on fuel and agricultural subsidies and clearance of arrears on road projects.
To maintain macro stability, it will be important to reduce the 2015 deficit by about 2½ percent of
GDP and to continue to reduce the deficit to 3 percent of GDP over the medium term through
revenue and expenditure measures. Eliminating fuel subsidies and containing the wage bill would
create fiscal space for the needed capital and social spending. In the event of revenue overperformance, the authorities should reduce the deficit rather than increase spending. Deficit
reduction will help the country cope with shocks and alleviate domestic financing pressures that are
keeping interest rates high. Staff urges the government to resolve the outstanding issues regarding
VAT refunds to exporters and to foster policy consistency and stability to boost investor confidence.
55.
PFM reforms. Staff welcomes recent progress in implementing the TSA and IFMIS, and
encourages the authorities to attach high priority to PFM reforms, including on fiscal reporting and
budgetary controls. Investment planning and implementation also need to be improved.
56.
External vulnerability. Reducing the pressure on the exchange rate and improving the
current account balance in a lasting way will require addressing the large fiscal deficit. Exchange rate
flexibility provides an important buffer for the economy. Given Zambia’s susceptibility to external
shocks, staff supports the BoZ’s plan to start rebuilding reserves once the foreign exchange market
has stabilized. The export base needs to be diversified to reduce the dependence on copper.
Strong debt management capacity is needed to maintain debt sustainability in light of increasing
reliance on non-concessional borrowing.
57.
Financial sector issues. The banking sector remains well-capitalized and profitable.
The BoZ’s intensive banking supervision to assess potential build-up in vulnerability and risks to
financial stability is welcome, given the large exchange rate depreciation and volatility. The planned
introduction of various measures, including agency banking guidelines, will improve access to
financial services particularly in rural areas. Staff recommends the elimination of the lending rate
ceilings introduced in early 2013, which restrict access to credit, particularly by SMEs, and have
become binding as treasury bill rates have increased.
58.
Inclusive growth and competitiveness. Despite strong growth over the past decade,
poverty remains high, particularly in rural areas. Rationalizing farm subsidies and other government
interventions in agriculture and reallocating resources to social cash transfers can contribute to rural
income growth and greater diversification. Staff recommends that the current fuel supply policy be
revisited to reduce the cost of supplying fuels and to ensure a proper supply of fuels. Staff strongly
advises against pressuring private companies to adopt the government’s minimum wage, which
would hamper competitiveness and job creation. To maintain Zambia as an attractive investment
destination, frequent regulatory changes and uncertainty about policy direction should be avoided.
Improving the business environment would also help promote inclusive jobs-creating growth.

Statistics. Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
Issues with source data and compilation affect most datasets, but are particularly problematic in
fiscal reporting.
60.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Appendix I. External Stability Assessment1
REER and NEER Dynamics in 2014
1.

Zambia’s real effective exchange rate depreciated by 4 percent in 2014, reversing a

similar size appreciation in 2013. This depreciation reflects a continued deterioration in terms of
trade (reflecting an ongoing decline in copper prices of almost 40 percent between the peak in early
2011 and late 2014–early 2015) and is accounted for by an 8 percent depreciation of the nominal
effective exchange rate (mainly reflecting stress in the local foreign exchange market in the first half
of 2014) partly offset by inflation differential against Zambia’s trade partners. While the
deterioration in terms of trade has been ongoing since 2011, the REER has remained broadly flat
over this period, suggesting a build-up of a REER gap.

External Position Assessment
3.

In order to assess Zambia’s external position in 2014, tools developed by the IMF staff

have been used. These are empirical methods that link either the real exchange rate (the so-called
ERER approach of the CGER methodology2) or the current account balance (the so-called EBA
methodology3) to their respective fundamentals.
4.

In the past decade a prominent feature of Zambia’s BOP statistics has been current

account surpluses (or small deficits) combined with sizeable outflows, recorded as part of the
financial account.4 Based on the reported data, Zambia recorded current account surpluses of
some 6 percent of GDP on average during 2009–12. Notable developments included a 25 percent
import contraction in 2009 and an 80 percent increase in copper export proceeds in 2010.
Subsequently, the current account balance deteriorated to -0.6 percent in 2013 and further to
-1.7 percent in 2014. However, throughout this period, Zambia also saw outflows of 8–20 percent of
GDP.
5.

The headline current account balance, if taken at face value, would imply

undervaluation of the kwacha in 2014. While the preliminary estimates indicate a current account
deficit of 1.7 percent of GDP, the EBA-lite methodology suggests that a low-income country with
macroeconomic fundamentals similar to those of Zambia (such as per capita income, budget deficit,
demographics, etc) could run a current account deficit. But this methodology is not adjusted for
copper exports, which would suggest that Zambia should run a strong current account balance.
Indeed, the reality is one of downward pressures on the kwacha and BoZ has been encountering
difficulties in keeping its stock of international reserves from declining. To obtain a more accurate
picture, an adjustment is made, where a part of the aforementioned outflows (paragraph 4) is
reclassified to the current account to better reflect their impact on the domestic foreign exchange
market, the exchange rate, and international reserves. These outflows are driven by mining
companies’ preference to keep a share of export proceeds abroad and are estimated by the BoZ
staff based on declared mining-related flows as well as BIS data on international banking
transactions. For the purposes of this current exercise, the part to be reclassified is estimated as
a linear function of exporting industries’ FX cash flow—approximated by adding up export proceeds,
new (i.e. excluding reinvested earnings) FDI inflows, net borrowing and subtracting imports of

equipment, dividend outflows, and private sector interest payments—with which it is highly (0.88)
correlated.5
6.

The adjusted current account balance reflects a persistent deficit, in contrast to

headline surpluses. In particular, reclassification of the outflows results in a current account deficit
of almost 13 percent of GDP in 2014. Application of

components of the 2014 current account being preliminary estimates.
7.

The two methods of evaluating the real exchange rate provide diverging assessments.

While the estimate of the adjusted current account gap implies a sizeable overvaluation in 2014, the
ERER approach of CGER suggests the REER to be undervalued by few percent. Given this divergence
and uncertainties described earlier, staff sees the kwacha as moderately overvalued.
Reserve Adequacy
8.

It has proved difficult for the BoZ to keep its stock of international reserves from

declining. After peaking in 2009 at 5.7 months of current imports, reserve coverage fell to 2.9 in
2013, bounced back to 3.6 at end-2014, and as of March fell again to 3.3, below the authorities’
target of 4.0. The reserves were boosted in 2014 as the Bank of Zambia purchased the Eurobond
proceeds from the government, but it also had to spend a significant part of it in order to stabilize
the kwacha. The loss of reserves, however, would have been higher, had it not been for the currency
depreciation.

5

A similar adjustment was made for the 2012 and 2013 Article IV consultations as well, but with a fixed share of the
outflows reclassified into the current account.

To assess adequacy of the stock of reserves, a cost-benefit approach developed by

Fund staff is used.6 This approach weighs the benefits of holding reserves with the view to smooth
domestic absorption/consumption in case of large exogenous shocks against the opportunity cost
of holding reserves. The opportunity cost is measured in three ways: marginal product of capital
(MPK), sterilization costs, and external financing costs. However, only the metric associated with
external financing costs (for LICs that have had access to international capital markets) seems
appropriate to Zambia’s circumstances. Even this metric has shortcomings for Zambia, since the
country’s two Eurobonds were issued in very different environments; the first (September 2012)
during highly favorable market conditions that produced a yield of 5.625 percent, and the second
(April 2014) in highly unfavorable market conditions that produced a yield of 8.625 percent.
The analysis suggests benchmarks in the range between 2.0 and 3.6 months of imports.
10.

While the current costs of attracting foreign exchange are somewhat high, BoZ should

aim at accumulating reserves over the medium term. Given a rather fast depletion in the
last two years and the need to boost confidence, staff recommends an additional buffer and aim at
a 4-month import coverage. In this context, BoZ’s recent interventions would be in line with the
purposes for which reserves have been accumulated in the first place, provided their stock does not
fall much further.

Appendix II. Value Added Tax Refunds to Exporters1
1.

The VAT is a tax on domestic consumption. Its objective is to allow a government to

capture part of the value added on goods and services at each stage of their production and
distribution without adding to production costs. Like other countries, Zambia uses an invoice-credit
method. Under this system, taxpayers credit the VAT paid on their purchases against the VAT
charged on their sales, transferring the net balance to the tax authority. If the balance is negative—
usually the case for net exporters—the tax authority is required to refund taxpayers. Timely
compliance with such refunds is important to preserving the VAT as a tax on domestic consumption
and maintaining the competitiveness of exports.
2.

Zambia’s VAT refund system is regulated, among others, by VAT Rule 18 for proof of

export. Before 2013, exporters were required to provide: (a) copies of export documents bearing a
certificate of shipment provided by Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA); (b) copies of import
documents bearing a certificate of importation into the country of destination provided by the
customs authority in that country; (c) proof of payment by the customer; and (d) tax invoices for the
goods exported. ZRA, however, made VAT refunds without enforcing requirement (b).
3.

In 2013, ZRA amended Rule 18. Starting in January 2013, exporters were required to

provide: (e) documentary evidence, proving that payment for the goods has been made by the
customer into the exporter’s bank account in Zambia. Beginning in September 2013, the ZRA also
started enforcing requirement (b), rejecting those requests that did not meet all five requirements.
The stated aim was to prevent abuses where refunds were sought for goods that had not been
exported. Exporters, mainly mining companies, complained that getting proof from other
countries’ tax authorities was impractical in the commodities business, where goods such as copper
are often sold to traders and where ownership may change several times before the goods
reach their final destination. As a result of the ensuing impasse, the government accumulated, as of
end-February 2015, about K5.7 billion or 3.1 percent of GDP in outstanding VAT refund requests.
4.

Requiring proof of export is normal international practice. Table 1 shows the

requirements in a range of other countries, including commodity exporters in the region and
elsewhere. Requirements vary across countries, but are generally less stringent than in Zambia.
In particular, no country in the sample requires documentation from the importing country’s

ZAMBIA

customs authority, although South Africa in some cases requires proof that the goods were received
by the purchaser in the importing country. Moreover, no country in the sample requires proof of
payment into the domestic bank account of the exporter.
5.

Following dialogue with mining companies, the government again amended Rule 18 in

late February 2015. Requirement (b) was eased by allowing exporters to provide documentation
from the country of transit instead of final destination. The amendment was not retroactive,
however, leaving the backlog of claims unresolved. While the Chamber of Mines has indicated that
the amended rule is manageable, there is also an issue for non-mining exporters who may face
difficulties obtaining documents from the importing country’s customs authority.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

Approved By

David Owen and
Bob Traa (IMF)
and John Panzer (IDA)

Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the International Development Association (IDA)

Based on the Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-income Countries
(LIC DSA), Zambia’s risk of external debt distress is moderate and the overall risk of debt
distress is heightened, given total public debt vulnerabilities. The risk of external debt distress
has been changed from low given deterioration in debt dynamics since the previous DSA,
issued in November 2013.
Under the baseline and alternative scenarios, all external debt sustainability indicators
remain below their applicable thresholds, but the debt service-to-revenue ratio breaches the
threshold under a number of shocks.
Zambia’s overall public sector debt dynamics is sustainable under the baseline. However, the
fixed primary balance scenario underscores the need for an improved fiscal position, as
advocated by staff.
Besides sound macroeconomic policies, strong debt management, greater diversification of
the export base, and improved project appraisal are needed to maintain debt sustainability in
the face of a projected rise in non-concessional borrowing and potential external shocks.

ZAMBIA

BACKGROUND
1.
Zambia’s stock of external public and private debt has been rising since 2011
(Text Table 1). At the end of 2014 it stood at 24 percent of GDP compared to 15 percent in
2011. An increase in the stock of external public and publicly guaranteed debt (PPG) of the
central government (10 percentage points between 2011 and 2014) to a large extent reflects
issuance of Eurobonds in 2012 and 2014 (3.0 and 3.8 percent of GDP respectively). The share of
central government’s debt from multilaterals has fallen sharply (from 60 percent to 27 percent),
while the share owed to private banks/investors has increased from zero to 46 percent.
Meanwhile, the stock of private and parastatal external debt has decreased from 7 percent of
GDP in 2011 to 6 percent in 2014.
2.
Zambia’s total public debt has also increased rapidly, mainly reflecting the
evolution of the PPG external debt of the central government. Domestic public debt
increased from 12 percent of GDP in 2011 to 17 percent of GDP in 2014. In 2011, treasury bills (Tbills) and treasury bonds (T-bonds) accounted for about 93 percent of the total domestic debt,
with the remainder coming from accumulation of arrears (e.g., to the pension system) and
financing from the banking system. In 2014, the share of government securities (T-bills and
T-bonds) dropped to 72 percent of total domestic debt while arrears increased to about
15 percent of the total and the remaining 14 percent reflected debt to the Bank of Zambia and
domestic commercial banks.

UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS
3.
The medium-term scenario underlying the debt sustainability calculations assumes
implementation of strong fiscal adjustment measures and monetary policy aiming at
decreasing inflation to 5 percent. Zambia’s economic growth in 2015 is projected to be
maintained at the 2014 level (estimated at 5.6 percent) and to remain strong at 6–7 percent over
the medium term on the back of an expected further increase in mining production due to large
foreign direct investment (FDI) in the sector in recent years and a scale-up of government
investments. The fiscal deficit is projected to temporarily increase in 2015 as the authorities plan
to clear a substantial portion of arrears accumulated in recent years; the deficit decreases to 3
percent of GDP by 2020. Expenditure policy is assumed to give priority to social (i.e., education,
health, and social safety net) and capital investment spending as a means of promoting broadbased economic growth. Increased copper production and non-copper exports together with the
proposed fiscal adjustment are expected to improve the current account to surpluses over the
medium term (see Box 1 for details).

ZAMBIA

Box 1. Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions
Economic growth: Real GDP growth in 2015 is projected to remain at the 2014 level (estimated at 5.6 percent),
with higher mining production offset by an anticipated decline in agriculture. Growth is projected to remain
strong, averaging about 6½ percent over the medium term (down from 7¾ percent in the previous DSA). Based
on investments that have to a large extent already been completed, copper production is expected to reach over
1.4 million tons by 2020, almost twice the 2014 level. Medium-term growth will be further underpinned by
ongoing large public investment, mainly in transportation and energy infrastructure. In the long run, the mining
sector will remain important, but economic diversification—including in areas such as electricity generation,
agriculture and food processing, and tourism—is expected to support economic growth at around 5 percent
annually.
Inflation: In the context of the current depreciation of the kwacha and expected adjustments in fuel prices,
inflation is projected to reach 8 percent in 2015 and then gradually decrease to 5 percent in the medium term
(similar to the previous DSA). This projection is underpinned by continued tight monetary policy and the
implementation of a credible fiscal consolidation plan.
External sector: Mining export volumes are expected to show an average annual increase of 11.5 percent over
2015–20; and the copper price is assumed to remain around US$2.6 per pound. Copper remains Zambia’s most
important export product (around 75 percent of total exports of goods). Nontraditional exports, after growing by
40 percent on average in 2010–13 and registering a sharp decline in 2014, are projected to grow over the medium
term at 12 percent a year. After peaking at 9.8 percent of GDP in 2010 and somewhat abruptly coming down
in 2011, FDI is expected to stabilize at 6.6 percent of GDP (compared to 7¾ percent of GDP in the previous DSA),
concentrated in the mining, manufacturing, and transport sectors. The current account balance is projected to
increase to above 3 percent of GDP by 2020.
Fiscal sector: The fiscal deficit, on a cash basis, is projected to temporarily increase in 2015 as the authorities clear
a substantial portion of arrears accumulated in recent years. The deficit is then reduced to 4 percent of GDP by
2018 and to 3 percent of GDP by 2020. This is supported by government plans to strengthen and modernize tax
and customs administrations, broaden the tax base by reducing exemptions, and other reforms to mobilize higher
revenue. As a result, domestic revenues would rise gradually from 16.4 percent of GDP in 2014 (net of outstanding
VAT refunds) to 19.0 percent by 2020 (lower ratios relative to the previous DSA are due to GDP rebasing). Primary
expenditures are projected to decline from 22.5 percent of GDP in 2014 to 19.2 percent of GDP in 2020 on the
back of a lower wage bill due to the 2015 wage freeze and recruiting limited to the education, health, and security
sectors. This is expected to be followed by civil service reforms, including of the pay structure and recruiting and
promotion policies. Additionally, the government would work towards increasing the efficiency of the farmer input
support program, including through the rollout of an e-voucher mechanism, and reallocate resources to the social
cash transfer program for better targeting of the most needy. Capital spending would be maintained at about
5 percent of GDP during 2015–20, prioritized to strategic sectors of the economy, including energy, transport,
health, and education, with a view to promoting broad-based economic growth.
Government financing: Net external financing is expected to decline from near 6 percent of GDP in 2015 to
2 percent of GDP by 2020 and stabilize at 1.5 percent of GDP over the long term. External financing, obtained by
issuance of sovereign debt, would be used to finance social and capital spending. Net domestic financing would
be maintained at 1.5 percent of GDP.

1/ The current DSA uses rebased GDP. According to the rebased GDP data, 2013 nominal GDP was
about 20 percent higher than previously estimated.

4.
Compared to the previous DSA (Text Table 2), the growth path has been lowered,
largely reflecting lower copper prices, while the inflation path has been revised up, reflecting the
projected higher inflation in 2015 due to the recent large depreciation of the kwacha and the
need to increase retail fuel prices. Staff forecasts higher budget deficits in the medium term,
given looser fiscal policy in 2014–15 than assumed at the time of the 2013 DSA. The current
account balance has been revised up for a number of reasons, including lower imports (in line
with recent developments) and upward revisions to exports of services (reflecting revisions to
historical data based on recent survey results). FDI inflows are projected at a lower rate given
worsening of the business environment.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
5.
External debt burden indicators rise in the medium term, but are expected to
remain below the indicative policy thresholds (Table 1 and Figure 1).1 The stock of external
debt is expected to peak at 35 percent of GDP in 2017 and decrease to 24 percent by 2035.
1

The World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutions Assessment (CPIA) ranks Zambia as a medium performer (the average
2010–12 CPIA score is 3.45). Thus, the external debt burden thresholds for Zambia are (i) a PV of debt-to-GDP at 40 percent;
(ii) a PV of debt-to-exports at 150 percent; (iii) a PV of debt-to-revenue at 250 percent; (iv) a debt service-to-exports at
20 percent; and (v) a debt service-to-revenue at 20 percent.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ZAMBIA

The present value (PV) of PPG debt relative to GDP increases from about 16 percent in 2014 to
26 in 2017 and declines afterwards.2 The PV of PPG debt relative to exports peaks at 58 percent
in 2016, well below the threshold of 150 percent. The PV of PPG debt relative to revenue
increases from 84 percent in 2014 to 151 percent in 2016; again, remaining below the threshold
of 250 percent.3

Eurobonds). If part of the external funding
were to be secured from multilateral and bilateral partners instead under more favorable terms,
the stress test would show breaches in 2022 and 2024 when the Eurobonds mature (see text
chart, which assumes an equal split between external funding from official bilateral and
multilateral sources and from the issuance of sovereign debt5).
7.
These scenarios illustrate Zambia’s vulnerability to swings in the copper price and
underline the need for the country to diversify its export base and strengthen its external
debt management. Several of the stress tests under which breaches occur are related to
Zambia’s ability to generate export earnings. As developments in 2014–15 illustrate, a sizeable
decline in copper prices can exert significant pressures on the exchange rate while government’s
ability to step in and substitute the FX flows with external borrowing is limited.

2

Present Values (PV) are calculated based on a 5 percent annual discount.

3

The large residuals in Table 1 are caused by the fact that the official balance of payments statistics for Zambia show
the (mostly foreign-owned) mining companies as keeping a large share of their mining export proceeds as rapidly increasing
deposits abroad (see also Appendix II of the 2015 Article IV Staff Report).
4

The calculations of the export shock are modified. The standard assumption is that losses in export proceeds are
compensated one-to-one by public external borrowing. In the case of Zambia, however, the exporting sector is dominated by
foreign-owned mining companies. A shortfall in export proceeds will be partly offset by a decline in mining income outflows,
giving rise to a BOP gap that is less than the assumed shortfall in export proceeds, and thus requiring less additional
government borrowing than the stress test assumes.
5

6

Under these circumstances, the most extreme shock is not an export shock, but a one-time depreciation shock.

ZAMBIA

8.
The authorities stressed that they do not intend to tap international bond markets
to the extent assumed in the baseline. They indicated that the government is exploring other
sources of external financing, including from multilateral and bilateral sources, on more favorable
terms. They also emphasized ongoing work to strengthen public debt management, including
the development of a debt management strategy (with support from the World Bank, the IMF
and the Macroeconomic and Financial Management Institute of Eastern and Southern Africa
(MEFMI)), aimed at lowering refinancing risks among other objectives. Specific actions under
consideration include the establishment of a sinking fund for the Eurobonds. The authorities
suggested that the pace of fiscal adjustment would be faster than projected under the baseline
scenario.

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
9.
Zambia’s total public debt is projected to rise gradually over the medium term, but
remain at manageable levels over the long term (Table 2 and Figure 2). Staff estimates that,
under the baseline scenario, the PV of total public debt would peak at 39 percent of GDP in 2017,
declining to 34 percent of GDP by 2035.
10.
Under the standard shock scenarios, risks to public debt dynamics would come
mainly from a deterioration of the fiscal stance and negative shocks to GDP growth.


The results under the fixed (at the 2014 level) primary balance scenario underscore the
need to strengthen fiscal consolidation over the medium term to maintain public debt
sustainability (Figure 3 and Table 2). Under this scenario, the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio and
the PV of debt-to-revenue keep rising over time.



The bound tests show that the main risk would mainly come from lower GDP growth,
which highlights the need for Zambia to diversify its production structure to mitigate
vulnerabilities related to declines in mining production over the long term and to
strengthen public investment management to ensure productivity-enhancing investment
and thus addressing the country’s constraints to broad-based growth.

CONCLUSIONS
11.
Zambia faces a moderate risk of debt distress, based on an assessment of public
external debt, but a heightened overall risk of debt distress given total public debt
vulnerabilities.6 The public debt DSA suggests that Zambia’s overall public sector debt dynamics
would be sustainable under the baseline scenario, but the fixed primary balance scenario
6

Per page 35 of the DSA guidance note (http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2013/110513.pdf): “Moderate
risk: although the baseline scenario does not lead to breaches of thresholds, stress tests result in one or more
breaches.”

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ZAMBIA

underscores the need for an improved fiscal position. The external debt indicators remain below
their thresholds in the baseline scenario but the indicative threshold is breached for one of the
indicators under a number of stress tests. In addition to sound macroeconomic policies and debt
management strengthening, developing project appraisal capacity and diversification of the
export base are needed in order to maintain productivity-enhancing investments and debt
sustainability in the face of access to international markets and a gradual increase in nonconcessional borrowing.
12.
The authorities’ assessment of debt sustainability is somewhat more favorable.
In 2014 the Ministry of Finance of Zambia prepared its own DSA with donor assistance, the
results of which are similar to the ones obtained under the alternative scenario described earlier
in the text, where the debt service-to-revenue ratio briefly breaches the threshold under a onetime depreciation shock in years when the Eurobonds mature. The authorities indicated that they
are looking into ways to facilitate repayments of the Eurobonds and while specific plans are still
to be laid out, the considered options include establishment of a sinking fund.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Country authorities; and IMF staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt
creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same
as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline
level after the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Safeguard Assessments
Safeguards assessments of the Bank of Zambia (BoZ) were completed in June 2004, January 2009,
and October 2010. The 2009 assessment concluded that the bank had adequate safeguards in
several areas, but confirmed the existence of certain vulnerabilities in the BoZ’s legal framework and
financial reporting. The 2010 update report concluded that the BoZ had made progress in
implementing safeguards recommendations. Staff noted improvements in the internal audit and
internal control mechanisms. Weak statutory independence remains a substantive safeguards
concern.
Exchange Rate Arrangement
The currency of Zambia is the kwacha. The exchange rate arrangement is a “float,” with the kwacha
exchange rate determined in the interbank market. The buying rate of the BoZ is a simple average of
the primary dealers’ low bid rates, and the BoZ’s selling rate is the simple average of the primary
dealers’ high offer rates. On April 19, 2002, Zambia accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections
2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement.
On January 31, 2014, the Zambian authorities amended the regulation on foreign exchange
transactions (Statutory Instrument 55 of 2013) to remove the two exchange restrictions identified in
the 2013 Article IV staff report. On March 21, 2014, the authorities repealed Statutory Instrument
55 of 2013 in full. However, Zambia continues to maintain an exchange restriction, which is subject
to Fund approval under Article VIII, arising from limitations imposed by the government on access
to foreign exchange for the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions, which is evidenced by the existence of external payments arrears accumulated prior to
October 4, 1985.
Article IV Consultations
Zambia is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle, subject to Decision No. 14747–
(10/96), as amended. The Executive Board concluded the last Article IV consultation on December
11, 2013.
FSAP Participation and ROSC
Zambia has participated in the financial sector assessment program (FSAP); an FSAP mission from
the Fund and the World Bank conducted a comprehensive external assessment of the financial
system April 30–May 15, 2002, and July 15–26, 2002. A mission from the Fund and the World Bank
conducted a follow up FSAP in November 2008.
The fiscal transparency module of a Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC)
assessing compliance with the IMF’s Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency—Declaration of
Principles was issued to the Executive Board on October 31, 2001. A ROSC data module was issued
to the Executive Board on January 18, 2005.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of March 31, 2015
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Issues with
source data and compilation affect most datasets, but are particularly problematic in fiscal reporting.
National accounts: Rebased GDP, 2010 from the previous benchmark year of 1994, was published in 2014.

Broadened coverage of the informal sector has significantly improved the quality of the national accounts.
As of yet, however, the rebased national accounts have only been extended beyond 2010 using the old
industry growth rates. Figures for 2011–13 may be subject to considerable revisions once ongoing
establishment surveys are completed and methodological enhancements are applied. The Central Statistics
Office is also planning to release quarterly GDP estimates, which will help to fill a gap in high frequency
indicators of economic activity. Beyond that, it will be important to continue improving the source data
and compilation procedures for regular GDP estimates including for household consumption and capital
formation.
Price statistics: The CPI broadly adheres to international methodological standards. The classification

system used for compilation closely follows the Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose.
A new CPI series with updated weights based on the latest household budget survey was started in
February 2012. An STA (AFS) ongoing project on introduction of producer price index (PPI) is expected to
enhance the procedures for measuring volume changes of GDP and its components.
Government finance statistics: The coverage of these data is limited to budgetary central government.

These data include intergovernmental transfers of about 2 percent of GDP to extra-budgetary, social
security, and local government units—the economic nature of these expenses are not known and all
sources of own revenue of these entities are excluded from the fiscal data. The authorities report monthly
budget releases data to AFR for operational use in a timely manner, but the data are often subject to
substantial revisions. The reconciliation of data on fiscal outturn in fiscal reports and government’s
accounts in monetary statistics requires significant improvement. Zambia last reported data to STA in
GFSM 2001 format for fiscal year 2011, including data on transactions in financial assets and liabilities.
Monetary statistics: There has in recent years been a noticeable improvement in the quality of monetary

accounts compiled and reported in accordance with the standardized report forms (SRFs) for the Bank of
Zambia (BoZ), other depository corporations (ODCs) and other financial corporations (OFC).
Balance of payments statistics: The data adequacy has improved in recent years. The BoZ compiles

balance of payments (BOP) and international investment position (IIP) statistics according to the Sixth
edition of Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6). BOP data are
compiled quarterly and IIP data annually. The BoZ has started conducting new services surveys in

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ZAMBIA

compliance with BPM6 which have contributed to the significant revision in the services series as well
as the fob valuation of exports and imports of goods. In addition, the capture of quarterly data
through the investment survey (relating to financial account and primary income) has contributed to
the improvement of the BOP data recently.
External and domestic debt statistics: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes.
Recent efforts, facilitated by technical assistance, have led to an improvement in the consolidation of
the debt databases, both in terms of external and domestic debt. Further work is underway in these
areas.
II. Data Standards and Quality

Zambia has participated in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since November 2002.
A Data ROSC Assessment was published in February 2005.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Statement by Ms. Chileshe Mpundu Kapwepwe, Executive Director for Zambia;
and Ms. Gillian Nkhata, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
May 20, 2015
1.
On behalf of the Zambian authorities, we thank staff for frank and productive consultations and a
thorough and incisive set of papers. The authorities had wide-ranging discussions with staff, which helped
pinpoint the main challenges and inform the policy agenda going forward, and they appreciate the continuing
engagement with the Fund. The authorities broadly agree with staff’s assessment of the Zambian economy,
although they have a more optimistic view on growth prospects, as well as some important qualifications to
convey to the Board regarding the policy mix and creating buffers to external shocks. The following elaborates
on some of these qualifications and provides further information on some recent developments.
Recent developments, risks and outlook
2.
After almost a decade of robust growth and macroeconomic stability, the Zambian economy is facing
increased challenges. The authorities and staff agree that the positive outcome over the past decade was a
result of both domestic and external factors. In particular, the authorities’ prudent macroeconomic management
and strong reforms were supported by exogenous factors, such as the sustained period of favorable copper
prices and improved investor sentiments, which helped increase FDI. Over the past year, the weight of
exogenous factors on fiscal efforts was evident when international commodity prices and the strengthening
dollar exerted increasing pressure not only on external sector performance, but also on debt sustainability,
inflation, mining production levels, and the pace of fiscal consolidation.
3.
While the Zambian authorities consider the staff report balanced overall, they believe that it
underplays the role of global economic developments in 2014, and their impact on fiscal performance in 2015.
In this regard, the authorities underscore the potential for a more favorable scenario for 2015, given the signs
of a more favorable external environment and the new mining taxation regime, which together with steadfast
implementation of reforms to improve the business environment will reinvigorate investor confidence, raise
copper production in the near future and boost growth more generally.
The fiscal stance and the overall policy mix
4.
The authorities remain committed to fiscal sustainability and have taken measures to contain the fiscal
deficit in 2015. Specifically, the authorities are undertaking measures to close the K18.0 billion deficit, which
include the sale of maize stocks by FRA, a reduction of spending on goods and services, which has already
been approved by Cabinet and the deferral of capital spending, and full cost recovery in fuel pump prices,
which should be achieved by July 2015, following a first increase on May 13, 2015.
5.
On taxation, while cognizant of the need to strengthen revenue mobilization, the Zambian authorities
emphasize the need to be mindful of the political economy and the often cited issue of policy consistency. The
authorities are of the view that there is limited scope to raise taxes in the near-term, and it would be difficult to
do so midway through the year. Regarding VAT refunds, the authorities are actively working to eliminate the
backlogs caused by the tightening of documentation requirements, including through a streamlining of
administrative procedures.

6.
Regarding the overall policy mix, the Zambian authorities are faced with the challenge of tightening
fiscal policy, while promoting growth and creating space for priority infrastructure and social spending, in an
unfavorable global climate. In recent months, the policy response has relied more on monetary policy, given
the need to avoid excessive volatility in the kwacha, after the rapid depreciation in the first quarter of 2015.
However, the authorities remain committed to implementing the fiscal adjustment measures discussed with
staff, and to continue rebalancing the policy mix and rebuilding fiscal buffers. They consider these measures
critical to build resilience against heightened vulnerabilities.
7.
As regards financing, staff has expressed some concern about external borrowing. However, given the
limited size of the domestic capital market, the higher cost of domestic borrowing, and the need to crowd-in
the private sector, the Zambian authorities consider that external financing will need to remain among the
financing options.
Mining tax regime
8.
The direct contribution of the mining sector to government revenues (royalties, corporate income tax)
has increased with higher copper production and prices, although it remains low, at just over 2 percent of GDP
to government revenue, while the sector accounts for 30 percent of GDP. With increasing copper production,
higher sector value-added and prices, the expectations for a higher contribution have risen, which prompted the
government to introduce changes to the mining fiscal regime in the 2015 budget. From a system comprising a
uniform royalty rate (6 percent), corporate income tax and a variable income tax, the regime was switched to a
royalty only system, with differentiated rates for underground mines (8 percent) and open cast mines
(20 percent).
9.
The change to a royalty only regime would have provided a more predictable source of income, and
raised total revenue by an estimated 1 percent of GDP. However, the introduction of the regime coincided with
falling commodity prices, resulting in a greater burden on the mining sector and risks to growth that could not
have been anticipated. The announcement of the regime led to suspension of investment plans in some mines,
while others were placed in “care and maintenance” status.
10.
The authorities recognize that the new regime, which will take effect in July, will have negative
implications for this year’s budget, but they also note that, over the medium-term, the regime should attract
greater investment in the sector and boost copper production. The decision in April to readjust the regime was
largely motivated by concerns about growth in the face of these adverse external developments. Cabinet has
approved the revision of the tax structure and the Income Tax Act will be duly amended.
Monetary policy and the removal of interest rate caps
11.
As regards monetary and exchange rate policies, the Zambian authorities remain committed to
maintaining exchange rate flexibility. They also intend to continue rebuilding international reserves to reach at
least four months of import coverage in the medium term. In addition, the Bank of Zambia recently tightened
monetary policy to reduce the liquidity constraints in the banking system and stabilize the currency. The Bank
of Zambia stands ready to tighten monetary policy further, should circumstances warrant. Following the
introduction of a policy rate in 2012, the authorities are continuing to build the structures necessary for a
successful transition from reserve money targeting to using the policy rate for monetary purposes.

The Zambian authorities agree with staff that interest rate caps on commercial bank lending may have
become a binding constraint on credit to SMEs, given rising treasury bill rates. The authorities are actively
working with the World Bank to complete analytical work to inform the policy direction.
Reducing external vulnerabilities
13.
It is clear that Zambia is facing significant external challenges following the recent period of declining
copper prices and production, which underscores the need to strengthen buffers to cushion the economy
against external shocks. The authorities agree with staff on the assessment of the challenges. They also agree
that the planned fiscal adjustment will play an important role in relieving pressure on the current account
balance, as will exchange rate flexibility. As mentioned above, clarity on mining tax regime will help attract
FDI and portfolio inflows and support reserve build-up. There will be a need to diversify the export base,
including by alleviating supply side constraints related to infrastructure, quality of goods and other factors.
This is an area where there is scope for further collaboration with the Fund and Bank.
14.
Regarding the exchange rate, the staff report concludes that the kwacha is over-valued, which suggests
that further depreciation would be needed. While the authorities welcome staff’s attention to using a broader
set of indicators for the exchange assessment, they consider that given the divergence with the ERER
assessment and the uncertainties about data quality and methodology, the interpretation of the EBA-Lite results
may warrant greater caution.
Conclusion
15.
I could not conclude without reiterating the strong commitment of the Zambian authorities to prudent
fiscal and monetary policies, sustained debt management practices and deeper structural reforms to boost
competitiveness, promote inclusive growth and accelerate poverty reduction.
