United States: 2008 Article IV Consultation—Staff Report; Staff Supplement; and
Public Information Notice on the Executive Board Discussion
Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. In the context of the 2008 Article IV consultation with the United States
the following documents have been released and are included in this package:
•

The staff report for the 2008 Article IV consultation, prepared by a staff team of the IMF,
following discussions that ended on June 17, 2008, with the officials of the United States on
economic developments and policies. Based on information available at the time of these
discussions, the staff report was completed on July 2, 2008. The views expressed in the staff
report are those of the staff team and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Executive
Board of the IMF.

•

A staff supplement of July 18, 2008, updating information on recent developments.

Focus. This report centers on the analysis, implications, and policy responses related to
the serious stresses in U.S. housing and financial markets. Other long-standing Article IV
issues, e.g., trade, aid, and anti-money laundering, are summarized in Table 1.
Assessment. The economy has shown remarkable resilience to headwinds from housing,
the financial sector and oil prices through the second quarter, but activity is expected to
remain weak in 2008, with a slow recovery in 2009 as hits to balance sheets are worked
out. Still, the shock is unprecedented and uncertainty over prospects for house prices—
key to the outlook—is large. External adjustment is in train, with the external deficit and
the dollar falling toward a level consistent with medium-term fundamentals.
Policy advice. The staff report advocates to:
• Keep monetary policy on hold but be ready to raise rates in light of inflation risks.
• Avoid repeated generalized fiscal stimulus, and instead let the stimulus package work,
with any needed further actions targeted at root problems in housing and banking.
• Avoid excess house price falls by expanding mortgage guarantee programs to catalyze
voluntary writedowns, as proposed in Congress, but with further incentives for lenders.
• Prepare contingency measures in the financial sector—for example, with the Treasury
stepping in to support market liquidity with longer-term asset swaps.
• Reform financial regulation—although detailed recommendations require further
analysis, including in next year’s Financial Sector Assessment Program, the process
could begin by considering tightening liquidity and capital requirements and bringing
large investment bank holding companies under Fed umbrella supervision.
Authorities’ position. The flexibility of the U.S. economy, and the rapid policy response,
should prompt a faster recovery than in the staff baseline. Additional stimulus is not
contemplated, while further action on housing or banking risks impeding needed
adjustment and aggravating moral hazard. Reform of financial regulation is a priority.
Analytical work. Underpinning the report are several background studies, focusing on the
aftermath of housing booms and busts, house price dynamics, macrofinancial linkages,
banking spillovers, and corporate balance sheets (see summaries in Selected Issues).
Staff. The team comprised (at times) Ranjit Teja (Head), Tamim Bayoumi, Marcello
Estevão, Ravi Balakrishnan, Vladimir Klyuev, Koshy Mathai, Hui Tong (WHD); Ashok
Bhatia, Christian Capuano, John Kiff, Paul Mills (MCM), and Jean-Jacques Hallaert
(PDR). Mr. Singh (WHD) and Ms. Lundsager (Executive Director) joined meetings with
senior officials, and with Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke on June 16–17, led
on the Fund side by Managing Director Strauss-Kahn and FDMD Lipsky.

Financial supervision and regulation, more than monetary policy, failed to
rein in lending excesses, the reversal of which is reverberating around the world.
With the U.S. economy recovering slowly from the 2001 recession, the Fed delayed
raising policy rates until 2004, boosting spending and—through a relatively steep yield
curve—prompting a major switch to adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs). While the

eventual rate increase slowed most parts of final demand, the housing boom, fueled by
low initial (“teaser”) mortgage interest rates, continued to boost construction and hold
down household savings. Importantly, a fragmented regulatory system did not recognize
the implications of the financial system becoming over-leveraged, while outdated rules
failed to constrain imprudent mortgage lending. Delinquency and foreclosure rates are
now rising on all ARMs, particularly subprime ones, but banks face more widespread
problems. Higher spreads and a slowing economy are exposing other underwriting
lapses—e.g., in auto, credit card, and commercial real estate loans. Elevated spreads in
money and bond markets have been transmitted to financial centers around the world,
reflecting the central role of the United States in the global financial system (Box 1). As a
result, growth is now slowing in many industrial countries, although it has so far
remained robust in emerging markets.

II. BALANCE SHEET STRAINS
A. Housing and Households
5.
After an unsustainable run up, house
prices are now falling sharply across the
country. With the dispersion of house price
changes tightening progressively, it is clear that
the housing boom and bust is a national
phenomenon, even if some areas have been
harder hit. House-price inflation at the national
level peaked in 2005, and prices are now
declining. Office of Federal Housing Enterprise
Oversight (OFHEO) purchase-only prices, which
have a wide geographic coverage but include
only safer (conforming) mortgages, peaked in

April 2007 and have fallen 4½ percent to date. By contrast, the Case-Shiller 10-city
index, which covers only major urban areas but all types of sales (including those
financed by subprime and jumbo loans) started to fall in mid-2006 and is already
18 percent below its peak. On the latter measure, prices fell by almost 10 percent from
December through April and futures markets project a further 15–20 percent fall,
suggesting continuing strong pressure on house prices, especially in previously hot
markets such as California and Florida.
Box 1. International Spillovers
The tightening in U.S. financial conditions has
been transmitted rapidly abroad. Global money
market premiums, bond market spreads, and
equity risk premiums have moved in tandem with
their U.S. analogues. With estimated aggregate
losses of European banks similar to their U.S.
counterparts, lending standards have risen
significantly in Europe and, to a somewhat lesser
extent, in Japan.
The current U.S. slowdown is likely to result in
significant aftershocks in other industrial
countries. The size of the U.S. economy and
dominance of its financial markets create
international spillovers through trade, commodity
prices, and global financial markets. Desk analysis
suggests that a 1 percent fall in U.S. activity
gradually lowers real GDP in other industrial
countries by some ½ percent after a year or so.
The bulk of this effect comes through financial
linkages, with smaller effects through trade and
commodity prices.
While slowing activity and dollar depreciation
are curbing U.S. imports, buoyant commodity
prices are supporting activity in producer
countries. Trade links are strongest for NAFTA
partners—Canada and Mexico—whose economies
are highly dependent on U.S. activity, especially
manufacturing, while support from commodity
prices is more important in other cases.

A number of countries with pegs or limited flexibility against the dollar are finding that they are
importing a more relaxed monetary stance than is appropriate for them. These countries, which
are already facing considerable inflationary pressure, would in the normal course have sought to raise
interest rates but have only limited room to do so, given their exchange rate regimes.

6.
Falling house prices could be taking on a life of their own, as the supply
overhang is exacerbated by reduced incentives to buy and higher foreclosures. While
the size and sources of pressure on house prices vary by region, staff background analysis
suggests that the inventory-sales ratio and foreclosure starts are good predictors of
national house price movements, with the gap between current and estimated equilibrium
prices playing only a limited role (Selected Issues, Chapter 1). In fact, expectations of
further price declines and credit constraints are choking sales (as buyers wait for lower
prices), while a rising wave of foreclosures is adding inventory and diminishing values of
neighboring houses (each foreclosure is estimated to lower the prices of other homes
within one-eighth of a mile by 1 percent).
7.
With housing assets and mortgage debt at near-record ratios to disposable
income, household balance sheets are particularly exposed to house-price declines.
The staff baseline forecast assumes that

expected to reduce consumption by
7 cents, with about half the reduction in the first year. This is at the upper end of
estimated wealth and collateral effects, reflecting borrowers’ growing access to home
equity over time.
8.
Spending has weakened on eroding wealth, declining employment, high oil
prices, and credit constraints (Figure 3). Employment has fallen by ¼ percent since
December even as food and energy hikes have boosted prices by almost one percent.
These pressures on real incomes, along with financial strains, are eroding consumer
confidence, with some measures down to levels last seen in the early 1980s. As a result,
real consumption, which accounts for 70 percent of GDP, slowed to a crawl in early 2008
(versus a trend growth rate of 3½ percent a year over the last decade). Consumption
jumped in May and likely stayed high in June, reflecting the temporary stimulus from tax
rebates that raised disposable incomes by around 5 percent in May–June.

The shock to U.S. financial markets hit an overleveraged system dependent
on market liquidity (Figure 4). The asset boom from mid-2004 to mid-2007 came

price of risk low, investors are now shunning
complex asset-backed securities, tightening investment criteria, and forcing the system
back to a more overt “originate-to-hold” mode. In essence, there has been a rapid and
involuntary return to intermediation through bank balance sheets.
10.
Loan losses add to the need for more capital to support overextended balance
sheets. Estimates from the Spring 2008 Global Financial Stability Report, using
prevailing market prices, put losses at near $1 trillion globally and $220–260 billion for
U.S. banks—over one-third of the equity of the ten major commercial and investment
banking groups. Of this, some $160 billion in U.S. losses have already been recognized,
reflecting deep discounts on assets such as mortgage-backed collateralized debt
obligations previously believed to be secure. If illiquidity has pushed market prices well
below underlying values, realized losses could be smaller than priced in, and the financial
sector could stabilize faster than projected. However, with house prices falling and the
credit cycle tending to lag the slowdown in activity, bank losses could just as likely
overshoot current market assumptions.
11.
Reflecting their high leverage and reliance on wholesale funding, pressures
have been heaviest on the largest banks. Liquidity problems initially stemmed from
uncertainty about the location of losses and short-term funding needs and, with collateral
requirements tightening, lenders started shunning weaker institutions. In early March, the
Fed facilitated the acquisition of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase after it experienced a
wholesale funding run, with access to even secured borrowing against high-quality
collateral drying up. Immediately afterwards, the Fed widened its discount window to the
remaining primary dealers (including, importantly, major investment banks), which
calmed systemic concerns and lowered credit default swap spreads of the major

institutions. However, as observed by Chairman Bernanke, financial conditions remain
far from normal. Credit default and interbank spreads remain high, suggesting continuing
solvency/liquidity concerns.
12.
In response to strains on capital, commercial and investment banks are
tightening loan standards, cutting costs, and raising new equity. The Fed’s Senior
Loan Officer Opinion Survey—a strong predictor of future activity—suggests that loan
conditions are tightening at rates similar to those seen in the credit crunch of the early
1990s. With falling turnover constraining fee and trading income, the financial sector has
shed almost 120,000 jobs since the beginning of 2007, canceled equity buybacks, and
lowered dividends. Major U.S. banks have raised an impressive $125 billion in new
capital, initially from sovereign wealth funds and now other investors. However, the size
of continuing problems is illustrated by Citigroup’s announcement that it will divest a
quarter of its assets ($500 billion) even after raising over $40 billion in new capital.

III. MACROFINANCIAL LINKAGES
14.
The major risk is that house prices fall well below equilibrium, generating
self-reinforcing cycles and further macroeconomic disruption (Figure 6). Declines in
house prices are increasing financial market stress directly through losses on mortgages
and mortgage-backed securities, and indirectly through delinquencies as consumption and
construction spending slows. Strains on bank capital are resulting in a rapid tightening of
bank lending standards, which in turn are threatening to restrict access to mortgages,
consumer credit, and new corporate loans—thus putting further downward pressure on
spending, incomes, house prices, and wealth. Meanwhile, weak activity and rising
defaults are keeping up credit spreads and depressing issuance of asset-backed securities.

To assess these interactions, staff have developed two alternative tools to

Weak credit and household spending are hurting firms, but the impact is
being cushioned by strong corporate balance sheets and external demand (Figure 7).
With many firms holding substantial cash buffers, the path of business investment is
expected to be driven primarily by the growth slowdown, although credit constraints are

The slow recovery, relative to the consensus forecast, reflects the impact on
households of the credit crunch and falling wealth. The current episode is in contrast
to previous downturns, where business spending was the key driver of the cycle.
Households have fewer ways to respond to financial and collateral strains than firms—
staff analysis suggests that consumption is much more dependent on access to bank
lending and collateral than is business investment. With falling house prices reducing
collateral for personal borrowing even as losses tighten bank lending standards, credit
constraints are likely to build gradually, and household spending and income growth are
projected to remain relatively sluggish through the first half of 2009. Thus, the eventual
recovery is slower than is typical of the United States but faster than suggested by
international and U.S. regional evidence on housing busts (Selected Issues, Chapter 5),
reflecting economic flexibility, the rapid policy response, and support from external
demand. The consensus forecast, by contrast, sees a much more typical V-shaped
recovery starting in the second half of this year as fiscal and monetary stimulus kicks in.

Potential deviations from this path are large, given the unprecedented nature
of the shocks. While risks to growth are balanced, those for inflation are modestly to the
upside, reflecting uncertainties about commodity prices and passthrough. With spending
surprisingly resilient even as forward-looking indicators such as weakening consumer
confidence and tightening bank lending standards, the range of plausible outcomes is
extremely wide, as shown in the fan charts of potential outcomes (Figure 8). Upside and
downside scenarios approximating the tenth and ninetieth percentiles of possible
outcomes illustrate the main uncertainties:

rate in mid-2009 before settling back as the Fed rapidly tightens to combat
inflationary pressures.

20.
The authorities expect an outcome more similar to the staff’s upside scenario
than the baseline path. There was agreement about the qualitative factors that have been
shaping the economy’s path, but the authorities consider the baseline’s financial and
housing conditions overly pessimistic. In particular, Treasury officials emphasize the
flexible and diversified nature of the U.S. economy, and the support to activity from
strong corporate balance sheets, external demand, and macroeconomic stimulus—which
they expect to help the economy recover in the second half of 2008. These different
views shaped the policy discussions.
V. MACROECONOMIC POLICY RESPONSES
A. Monetary Accommodation
21.
Having eased rapidly, monetary policy settings are now consistent with a
robust response to downside risks to growth (Figure 9). From mid-2006 through late
2007 Fed policy was mildly restrictive as core inflation remained above the upper end of
its implicit comfort zone, mainly reflecting delayed increases in owner-equivalent rent,
which had stayed remarkably low during the housing boom. The Fed subsequently
responded rapidly to recessionary risks cutting rates by 325 basis points in less than five
months. The real federal funds rate is now below zero (even using core CPI inflation), as
well as below settings implied by standard Taylor rules, although the impact is being
dampened by widening spreads and tighter lending standards. In addition, a relatively flat
bank-yield curve is limiting the support from low policy rates to banks’ profits from
maturity transformation.
22.
While inflation concerns are on the rise, the staff forecast of further
economic weakness and a slow recovery suggest that policy should remain on hold.
Concerns about activity would need to be much more pronounced to justify a more
accommodative stance. On the other hand, although surging commodity prices have lifted
headline inflation and near-term expectations, medium-term inflation expectations have
remained relatively anchored, while wages and unit labor costs are slowing with activity.
The case for a preemptive hike in policy rates, as markets now anticipate, is therefore
unclear. That said, given the costs of reversing high expectations once they become
entrenched, policy will need to be especially alert to the possible need to withdraw
stimulus quickly as the economic recovery gains traction.
23.
U.S. biofuels subsidies added to the boom in corn and soybean prices, but the
role of monetary policy in the recent commodity surge is more controversial. With
high fuel prices providing strong incentives to produce biofuels, the subsidy has become
in essence a simple transfer to producers, and staff see a suspension as sensible. U.S.
officials do not think that subsidies have contributed much to food inflation and pointed
out that suspension would anyway be difficult, since Congress deleted a proposed safety

valve clause that would have allowed such adjustment. On monetary policy, as discussed
in the April World Economic Outlook, staff analysis suggests that lower U.S. interest
rates and a weaker dollar are playing a significant role in surging world commodity
prices. Fed officials, however, are skeptical about such an impact of monetary policy,
noting that there is little evidence of a rise in commodity inventories or of a stable
relationship between commodity prices and real interest rates.
24.
In the wake of the housing bubble, the role of asset prices in monetary policy
bears reexamination. In staff’s view, it remains doubtful that policymakers can identify
unsustainable asset price booms with sufficient confidence to justify strong offsetting
interest rate moves. However, the fact of two asset-price busts in this decade with
prolonged macroeconomic consequences underlines the dangers of inaction. Thus, given
the potential for asset booms to turn into economic busts and lead to a rapid loosening of
policy, further consideration should be given to allowing monetary—and regulatory—
policy to lean against the wind, i.e., tightening policy by more than implied by just the
short-term impact on activity and inflation. Fed officials acknowledge the importance of
the issue, but thought it too early to draw policy conclusions from the current episode.
B. Fiscal Support
25.
While there is room for temporary stimulus and automatic stabilizers,
significant medium- and long-term challenges remain (Figure 10). The general
government deficit shrank to 2¾ percent of GDP, and the federal fiscal deficit to
1¼ percent of GDP in 2007 as nonsecurity discretionary spending was restricted and
capital gains revenues were buoyed by the credit boom. Automatic stabilizers as growth
slows will be enhanced as capital gains receipts reverse, although the impact on private
spending is likely to be limited as the lower tax liabilities mainly accrue to high-saving
households. The usual procyclical cut in spending by state and local governments from
balanced budget constraints also may be exacerbated by financial sector problems.
26.
Fiscal stimulus is providing well-timed support to activity, more than
offsetting short-term strains on income and borrowing. The stimulus package of over
1 percent of GDP mainly comprises tax rebates that will largely go to low- and middleincome individuals. This targeting will help offset the fact that temporary stimulus tends
to generate a smaller boost to demand than a permanent change. Experience from the
2001 tax cuts suggests that about half of the transfer will be spent in the spring and
summer (part of which will leak away on imports), while the support to business
spending from accelerated investment depreciation also in the package is likely to be
limited.
27.
In staff’s view, were further fiscal action needed, public finances should
provide temporary support to housing and financial sectors at the root of problems.
The experience of Japan in the 1990s suggests that repeated packages in the face of rea

estate and banking problems have diminishing benefits to economic activity, while
loosening medium-term fiscal discipline—an important point to bear in mind given the
huge U.S. long-run fiscal problem. This implies that if any further fiscal interventions are
needed they could more productively focus on limiting short-term risks to house prices
and bank lending. Reactions of officials varied, with some noting that targeted spending
packages could delay needed adjustment in housing and asset prices and be perceived as
“bailing out” reckless behavior. However, others observed that if a much more negative
scenario materializes, there could be a role for some limited measures.

3/ Calendar year, on a national accounts basis. The projections use Fund staff budget and economic assumptions.

28.
While the focus on a balanced federal budget by 2013 is encouraging,
significant medium-term pressures are being obscured by unrealistic budget plans.
Medium-term balanced budget plans have different emphases: the Administration
assumes that non-security discretionary spending will fall in nominal terms, and Congress
assumes that most of the 2001/03 tax cuts—equivalent to 1¼ percent of GDP—will
expire. More importantly, both Administration and Congressional budget plans include
no war funding authority beyond FY2009. Nor do they make any allowance for the costs
of annual overrides of legislation that tightens criteria for the alternative minimum tax
and reduces compensation to Medicare providers, which the Congressional Budget Office
estimates are also worth 1¼ percent of GDP by FY2013. In addition, despite

27
Administration efforts, little progress has been made in Congress on reforming
unsustainable pension and health entitlement programs.
29.
Thus, staff project the general government deficit in 2013 will remain at
around 2¾ percent of GDP, assuming that the 2001/03 tax cuts are extended. As
proposed in previous consultations, staff view the more ambitious medium-term target of
balance excluding the social security surplus as an appropriate goal to complement
needed reform of unaffordable entitlement programs. This suggests a need for further
consolidation of over 3 percentage points of GDP by 2013 as well as major entitlement
reform. Officials explained that the Administration’s policy is to keep real spending
outside security and entitlements constant, which would contribute to a balanced budget,
and agreed that progress on reforming entitlement programs is crucial to reducing the
main fiscal problem of huge long-term unfunded liabilities.
C. Housing Support
30.
Housing support has been helpfully expanded (Table 2). Senior officials
agreed that house prices falling below equilibrium is a key risk to the economy. Thus, in
addition to supporting efforts to liquefy the market for securitized mortgages through
swaps and purchases, the Administration has supported a widening set of schemes to
encourage lenders to avoid foreclosures. The HOPE NOW alliance has encouraged
voluntary workouts and the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Secure program has
provided FHA loan guarantees to borrowers who are delinquent as a result of ARM resets
and some other criteria.
31.
To prevent a damaging overadjustment in house prices, staff favor further
expanding the scope of the government’s mortgage guarantee program. Congress is
likely to pass a bill supporting voluntary mortgage writedowns by allowing the FHA to
guarantee up to $300 billion of loans (2 percent of GDP)—provided that the borrower
qualifies and that the new mortgages are at a significant discount to current appraised
value. The latter is important, because price declines are estimated to have already left
5–10 percent of homeowners with negative equity (i.e., with houses worth less than
mortgage debt), which reduces incentives to service debt. The legislation also includes
regulatory reform of government-sponsored enterprises as well as FHA modernization,
measures long-sought by both the Administration and the staff. While views vary, and
full agreement between Congress and the Administration has yet to be reached, most
officials believed that the final package would likely be targeted enough to limit
undesirable side-effects (e.g., strategic borrower defaults in order to extract concessions).
Correspondingly, a number of observers thought the scheme may be “too little, too late”
(too tightly defined to have a significant impact on the foreclosure problem, and taking
too long before the FHA gears up to the task).

28
32.
In staff’s view, a scheme with greater creditor incentives could better limit
macroeconomic risks without significantly adding moral hazard. Issuing “negative
equity warrants” that allow the creditor to share profits from future sales could expand
the scope of the current scheme, which runs the risk of limited take-up by lenders. In
addition, bankruptcy reform allowing judges to “cram down” reduced mortgage principal
on primary residences—as is already allowed for other houses and all other debt—would
provide further incentives for creditors to participate. This is particularly important where
writedowns are complicated by second lien holders (some 40 percent of subprime and
Alt-A mortgages) and by servicers of securitized assets (some 75 percent of mortgages
originated in 2007 were securitized). Both actors have limited incentives to pursue loan
modifications that crystallize losses upfront. While allowing courts such discretion could
raise borrowing costs to homeowners, it could also encourage better risk management by
lenders, and recent evidence suggests that the effect on mortgage costs through moral
hazard is likely to be small.
33.
Officials emphasize that the Administration is responding flexibly to housing
woes, but that moral hazard concerns constrain policy options. In their view, the
focus of policies should be on helping homeowners who had bought the “right” house
(i.e., a fundamentally affordable one) with the “wrong” loan (i.e., with low teaser rates
subject to sharp jumps). Accordingly, the Administration supports FHA modernization
that would provide more leeway in risk-based pricing of guarantees, and is wary of rigid
rules for FHA mortgage support. The Administration also opposes bankruptcy reform on
the grounds that abrogation of contracts would curtail future mortgage lending.

appropriate to use a government agency for
any future assumption of assets so as to make transparent the risks to the public purse.

29
35.
In the face of illiquid markets, the Fed gradually widened access to its
liquidity facilities and in time reduced systemic risks (Table 3). Conventional open
market operations proved inadequate as counterparties and collateral were too narrowly
defined for the unusually strained market circumstances, while stigma limited the use of
the discount window. In response, the Fed steadily widened its eligibility criteria for
institutions and instruments, increased the maturity of its operations, and lowered its
penalty spreads. The process culminated in a facility accepting investment grade assetbacked securities from depositories and—in a striking departure from past practice—
from primary dealers, including major investment banks. While calming market concerns
about systemic risks, the extension of Fed lending to investment banks implies a
reexamination of the rationale for prudential oversight.
36.
Notwithstanding moral hazard concerns, were the market instability of last
March to recur, staff see a role for longer liquidity facilities. Despite the large capital
enhancements and investment banks’ access to Fed loans, such market instability could
recur—in which case wider-ranging options for improving the certainty of future market
liquidity should be considered. In particular, significantly extending the length of existing
swaps of mortgage-backed securities for Treasuries using the government’s balance
sheet, as in the United Kingdom, could limit disruption from further market illiquidity.
As banks would retain the capital gains and losses on their collateral, the fiscal cost
should be limited. Moreover, by giving financial institutions more time to strengthen their
balance sheets, such a scheme would facilitate an orderly deleveraging process. Officials
observed that the length of swap facilities had been extended as part of the response to
financial problems, and that further extension was not contemplated at this time.
37.
In staff’s view, any further emergency asset operations should be made by
the Treasury rather than via proxies that can obscure potential costs. In addition to
the Fed’s taking on an exposure of $29 billion of Bear Stearns’ assets, nearly $300 billion
(2 percent of GDP) of secured loans have been made by the Federal Home Loan Banks to
mortgage lenders over the past year. More indirectly, the already-light capital
requirements for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been loosened further even though
they bear the system’s largest exposures to housing-related credit risk. Moreover, recent
increases in size limits on conforming mortgages that Fannie or Freddie may purchase
reinforce perceptions of an implicit government guarantee of these privately-owned
enterprises. Officials view the lifting of Fannie and Freddie’s capital surcharge
requirements as response to their improved accounting practices rather than forbearance.
However, authorities agreed on the importance of a tighter regulatory regime for these
government-sponsored enterprises, as proposed in housing legislation now in Congress.
38.
The Fed is well-placed to expand on its existing role as a stability regulator
that internalizes systemic risks. This reflects its supervisory powers over bank holding
companies and knowledge of market conditions, including counterparty risk
concentrations. The Fed is already contributing to improved market infrastructure, e.g.,

30
for the netting and settlement of derivative positions. Officials recognize the importance
of a systemic supervisor and, pending a thorough overhaul of the system, are
strengthening arrangements between the Fed and the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) on oversight of major investment banks.
VI. FINANCIAL REGULATION
39.
A key medium-term challenge for policymakers will be to restore confidence
in segments of U.S. financial markets, most notably for securitized products. While
recognition of the limits of financial engineering has led to a dramatic fall in issuance of
structured assets, securitization is likely to recover eventually given its benefits, but with
simpler and more transparent instruments. The financial boom also exposed weaknesses
from excessively procyclical financial lending, limited consumer protection in the
mortgage origination process, and poor incentives within the securitization chain. Private
sector actors will address many of these problems, but financial market turmoil has added
urgency to the need to improve the fragmented U.S. regulatory system. While specific
reforms warrant further consideration, including through the Fund’s Financial Sector
Assessment Program starting next year, the staff team initiated a preliminary discussion
of the key issues.
A. Bank and Securities Regulation
40.
The Treasury blueprint, which sensibly emphasizes regulatory consolidation,
is a useful starting point for reform. As discussed in last year’s staff report, regulatory
fragmentation and turf battles slow decision-making, blur lines of responsibility, and
permit regulatory arbitrage. The Treasury proposes an objectives-based system, with:
(1) a prudential supervisor covering depositories and insurance companies; (2) a business
conduct regulator for investor and consumer protection; and (3) the Fed as a market
stability regulator. However, the blueprint does not address who should regulate
investment banks or government-sponsored enterprises. In addition, staff and Fed
officials view it as important that, in developing a macro-prudential framework, the Fed
retains supervisory powers to ensure it interacts closely with the system it is overseeing.
41.
The extension of the financial safety net after Bear Stearns justifies stronger
oversight of major investment banks and of liquidity management by all banks. One
medium-term option would be to put all systemic financial intermediaries under a single
set of regulations and regulator—e.g., by extending umbrella Fed supervision to cover
major investment bank and thrift holding companies and also the main governmentsponsored housing enterprises. In addition, persistent market pressures suggest liquidity
cushions at these institutions, and at commercial bank holding companies, should be
managed and supervised more conservatively at the group level, with contingency
funding plans that factor-in interruptions of secured financing. Fed officials were

31
sympathetic to the thrust of these views, some of which echo public remarks by the New
York Fed president.
42.
A tighter focus could also be placed on adequate capital coverage during
booms. International efforts through the Financial Stability Forum, the Fund, and the
Basel Committee are revisiting capital and liquidity risks, including the use of ratings and
treatment of off-balance sheet affiliates. Officials also emphasized the role of the U.S.
leverage ratio, which uses the unweighted value of assets—but currently excludes offbalance sheet items—in potentially limiting procyclical lending. Staff discussed other
counter-cyclical capital requirements, such as dynamic provisioning already used in
Spain, and officials confirmed the general issue was being considered. Some regulators
felt fair value accounting rules for hard-to-value assets could be used more flexibly, but
most observed that investors remain strongly in favor of fair value accounting’s increased
transparency. With market sentiment still delicate, staff agree with the Treasury’s view
that the issue should be revisited only after financial conditions have normalized.
43.
A Financial Sector Assessment Program, scheduled to start in late 2009, will
provide the Fund an opportunity to contribute to the U.S. regulatory debate. Serious
consideration of major regulatory reforms will probably have to wait until after the
November 2008 election and will likely be a long process. Reforming the regulatory
system has been difficult in the past, and the Treasury blueprint already faces resistance.
B. Business Conduct Regulation
44.
Staff support creating a business conduct regulator with responsibilities for
consumer and investor protection, as discussed in last year’s report. The Treasury
blueprint appropriately suggests merging the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, whose responsibilities often overlap, and moving responsibility for
mortgage consumer protection from the Fed to this new body.
45.
In the wake of the housing bust, public attention has focused on the extension
of inappropriate loans to unsophisticated borrowers. Provisions under the Home
Ownership and Equity Protection Act, the most relevant federal law, did not apply to the
vast majority of subprime loans because their rates did not trip unrealistically high
interest rate triggers, while enforcement often relied on state regulators. Stricter
prudential guidance to banks on nontraditional and subprime mortgage lending was
delayed by the need for agreement across five federal agencies. Finally, borrowers who
were provided with misleading loan information generally have little redress, particularly
when the originator has gone out of business.
46.
Legislation can allow higher national standards to be enforced through
federal courts. Given the macroeconomic costs coming from imprudent mortgage loans,
the Fed is appropriately proposing that subprime mortgage lenders be required to ensure
that borrowers can afford the full cost of the loan (not simply low initial rates), to verify a

32
borrower’s income and assets, to ensure local taxes and other costs are placed in escrow
accounts, and to limit pre-payment penalties. Also, legislation before Congress rightly
triggers federal regulation of mortgage brokers if state supervision is insufficient. Finally,
the issue of legal recourse if originators go out of business could be addressed through
capped liability for bundlers (see ¶49).
C. Securitization
47.
Recent events have highlighted the need to improve incentives in the
originate-to-distribute lending model. In a typical mortgage securitization chain, a
nonbank originator sells loans to a bundler—generally an investment or commercial
bank. The bundler pools the loans into trusts funded by mortgage-backed securities. The
trusts pay servicers to collect payments from borrowers and to deal with delinquencies
and defaults. Rating agencies are paid to assess the quality of the securities, and
“monoline” bond insurers provide insurance against payment shortfalls. Incentives broke
down as investors became overly reliant on ratings, while originators and bundlers—who
were best placed to assess underlying risks—had few incentives to maintain loan quality.
48.
As discussed in the Spring 2008 Global Financial Stability Report, capital
charges and ratings transparency of structured credit products could be improved.
The Basel committee is revisiting capital charges for off-balance sheet activities, while
stronger safeguards against conflicts of interest between advice on structuring products
and eventual ratings has been suggested by the International Organization of Securities
Commissions. More generally, greater transparency throughout the rating process would
allow more effective exercise of due diligence by investors. Newly proposed rules from
the SEC are strong first steps, and are expected to be followed by measures to limit
references to external credit ratings in bank and securities regulation.
49.
Holding bundlers of securitized assets partially legally liable for the assets
they create is another possible way of improving securitization incentives. With
securitization having increased specialization in finance, the rightful place for quality
control in the securitization chain, arguably, is the assembly line. The impact of
alternative levels of liability on loans can be examined as some U.S. states and cities have
rules assigning capped legal liability to bundlers for “predatory” loans within securitized
pools. Academic studies suggest that providing some liability for bundlers improves
monitoring of loan quality and standards of loan originators although unlimited assignee
liability shuts down the securitization process completely (see IMF working paper
WP/07/188). Officials recognize the faulty incentives in the securitization process, but
could not commit to specific remedies at this point.
VII. EXTERNAL ADJUSTMENT AND THE DOLLAR
50.
Recent dollar depreciation has moved the dollar significantly closer to
medium-term equilibrium (Figure 11). The U.S. current account deficit rose to a record

of around 6 percent of GDP in 2005 and 2006 despite gradual depreciation since 2002.
This partly reflected strong activity over the housing boom that was supported by
heightened foreign demand for U.S. bonds, including mortgage-backed securities.
Subsequently, despite a substantially higher oil import bill, this process has gone into
reverse, with the current account narrowing rapidly to 5 percent of GDP in the wake of
dollar depreciation, slowing domestic demand, and falling foreign net purchases of
private U.S. bonds. At current exchange rates, the current account deficit is projected to
fall to a more manageable level of just under 4 percent of GDP by 2013, still a bit above
the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals.
51.
Financial turmoil has reduced capital inflows, contributing to recent dollar
depreciation. The dollar lost about 10 percent of its trade-weighted value between mid2007 and March 2008 before rallying somewhat more recently. Officials view this
depreciation as a continuation of the trend initiated in early 2002, reflecting fundamentals
such as relative cyclical positions and interest rate differentials. While accepting that
these factors play a role, staff see the rapid improvement of the current account as also
reflecting capital account developments, notably the sharp reduction in foreign demand
for private bonds as a result of financial turmoil: virtually all of the decline in the capital
account surplus has fallen on private

bonds.
52.
Multilateral dollar depreciation
has lowered a key global
vulnerability—the U.S. external
deficit—but the benefit has been
diminished by lop-sided bilateral
currency movements. In particular, the
depreciation of the dollar has generally
been larger against freely-floating
currencies, such as the euro, rather than
against less flexible currencies associated
with large external surpluses, such as the
renminbi. As a result of these bilateral
movements, significant international
exchange rate and trade tensions remain.

53.
This underlines the importance of implementing the strategy agreed during
the Multilateral Consultation to combat external imbalances. To maintain growth, the
strategy sees the amelioration of global current account imbalances requiring the
rebalancing of demand across key countries, not just in the United States. Given shortterm economic weakness in the United States, it makes sense to defer progress toward the

35
medium-term objective of a balanced U.S. budget. On the other policy goals set out in the
Multilateral Consultation, the U.S. authorities have proposed the following steps, the first
three of which still require Congressional action:
•

Reforming the budget process to contain spending growth. This year’s budget again
proposes earmark reform and requests the legislative line-item veto.

•

Entitlement reform. The budget again proposes reform of Social Security and a health
insurance deduction, plus new initiatives to restructure health insurance markets.

•

Further tax incentives to support private saving. The FY2009 Budget again proposes
schemes to expand incentives for saving, including Lifetime Savings Accounts.

•

Enhancing energy efficiency. Congress has passed tighter fuel efficiency standards,
with ethanol subsidies also reducing consumption of gasoline.

•

Pro-growth, open investment policies. The Administration has reiterated that it is
committed to policies that make the United States attractive to foreign investment.

•

Capital market competitiveness. The Treasury’s Blueprint suggests an improved
regulatory structure for the long term and a number of intermediate steps.

54.
Staff now consider the dollar closer to the level implied by medium-term
fundamentals, although still somewhat on the strong side. Estimates of the
equilibrium rate vary significantly. As of early-June, the Fund’s Consultative Group on
Exchange Rates’ exchange rate equation suggests slight undervaluation, its comparison
with medium-term saving-investment fundamentals suggests a modest overvaluation, and
its calculation based on stabilizing the path of net foreign assets as a ratio to GDP implies
a 15 percent overvaluation. These differences across the methodologies have been
apparent for some time. However, long-term trends in U.S. trade flows and net foreign
assets tend to narrow this range, without materially changing the staff’s overall
assessment (Box 2). Adjusting for these factors suggest that all three methodologies
imply modest dollar overvaluation of 0-10 percent in real effective terms. While not
taking a position on the level of the dollar, U.S. officials noted that the dollar had moved
in line with fundamentals, including interest rate differentials and relative output.

36

Box 2. Special Considerations in the Assessment of the Dollar
The trend switch in U.S. trade toward low-cost producers may mean conventional real
effective exchange rate measures overstate the dollar weakness. The basic point is that,

Results suggest that, using the mid-1990s as a base, the dollar may be 10 percent more
appreciated than implied by the Fed’s standard real effective exchange rate index.
Furthermore, using WARP indices improves the fit and stability of trade volume equations.
On the other hand, the U.S. net foreign asset position has fallen much less than
cumulative current account deficits—implying lower depreciation to stabilize net debt.

37
VIII. STAFF APPRAISAL
55.
Despite impressive resilience, the United States faces a difficult situation as
the housing bust weakens household demand and worsens credit conditions. The
staff’s baseline forecast envisages extremely low growth of GDP in 2008 (Q4/Q4)
followed by gradual recovery in 2009. Although inflation expectations have ticked up on
surging commodity prices, price pressures should be contained as commodity prices peak
and economic slack rises. The outlook crucially hinges on the evolution of house prices,
and the dynamic interaction of financial sector and housing cycles. Thus, there are large
uncertainties around any projection and policy response to this first national-level
housing bust in at least 40 years.
56.
Monetary policy should stay on hold for now, while being prepared to raise
rates as recovery becomes established. With the real fed funds rate already negative
(even using core CPI inflation), monetary policy is already consistent with a robust
response to recession risks. Meanwhile, although wage demands remain moderate,
elevated headline inflation may have already started seeping into near-term inflation
expectations. Given the high cost of reversing such expectations once they become
entrenched, the bias going forward should be toward a decisive tightening once recovery
is established and financial conditions ease further.
57.
Fiscal stimulus is providing support to activity at a critical time, but
medium-and long-term fiscal challenges limit the room for further initiatives. The
fiscal stimulus package was relatively well targeted toward those who are most likely to
spend the money, and its rapid passage in Congress has ensured its benefits are timely.
While automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate, in the face of significant
medium-term fiscal challenges, any needed further government support should focus on
using balance sheets to support housing and financial markets. A more ambitious
medium-term target of balance excluding the social security surplus as well as major
entitlement reform remain key to restoring fiscal sustainability.
58.
Given the risks, the government should be prepared to widen support for
housing and, if serious dislocations reappear, in financial markets. It is true that
policies need to be mindful of moral hazard, that the housing sector is already the
recipient of large tax subsidies, and that house prices still need to adjust down. Still, there
is a clear risk that prices could fall significantly below equilibrium, with painful
economic consequences. Given that house prices are falling rapidly and the inventorysales ratio is at a near-record high, there is a role for public policy to overcome
coordination difficulties by using FHA guarantees to encourage lenders to make
voluntary write-downs on mortgage principal to new, more affordable loans. Ideally, such
legislation would provide additional incentives for lenders to participate. If major
systemic financial disruptions recur, the government could support market stability by

38
significantly extending the term of asset swaps, as has been done with Treasury backing
in the United Kingdom.
59.
Financial regulation could be consolidated and specialized, and liquidity and
capital requirements strengthened, including for off-balance sheet lending. The
housing boom revealed multiple weaknesses in financial regulation and supervision.
While private sector responses will plug some of the gaps, the Treasury blueprint, which
includes many proposals highlighted in last year’s report, provides a sensible basis for
comprehensive reform. Pending further analysis, including under the Financial Sector
Assessment Program, reform options could include reducing the procyclicality of bank
lending (e.g., by augmenting risk-based capital ratios) and bringing the oversight of
major investment banks and government-sponsored enterprises closer to that of
commercial bank holding companies. Finally, with liquidity having emerged as a major
and under-emphasized risk, draft recommendations from the Basel Committee will need
to be implemented swiftly, taking into account U.S.-specific considerations.
60.
Dollar depreciation has moved U.S. competitiveness closer to medium-term
fundamentals, but tensions remain in the pattern of bilateral adjustment. The
narrowing of the U.S. external deficit has been a welcome global development. However,
bilateral rate adjustments have not corresponded to the existing pattern of imbalances,
with larger changes against freely-floating currencies (such as the euro) than against
currencies of countries with large current account surpluses. Thus, the reduction in the
tensions in the international exchange rate and trade system has been more limited than
suggested by the trend in the dollar’s real effective rate. This emphasizes the importance
of multilateral efforts to reduce global current account imbalances.
61.

It is proposed to hold the next Article IV Consultation on a 12-month cycle.

A single, unified regulator should be established. State regulation
results in higher costs, regulatory arbitrage, and politically-driven
interference in local insurance markets.
Reduce tax disincentives to overfunding DB plans to bolster
cushions during market downturns; the Public Benefit Guaranty
Corporation (PBGC) should set risk-based premia; 'automatic'
enrollment in employer-sponsored DC plans should be facilitated.
Concern that the PBGC recently adopted a riskier investment
strategy moving away from matching assets and liabilities.
Areas for improvement include, inter alia: (i) strengthening
customer due diligence; (ii) making corporate ownership
information more readily available; and (iii) extending AML/CFT
requirements to certain designated nonfinancial businesses and
professions.

The adequacy of savings for retirement
could be improved: many defined-benefit
(DB) plans remain underfunded, and weak
incentives hamper employee enrollment in
defined-contribution (DC) plans.

As noted in the September 2006 AML/CFT
ROSC, the AML/CFT regime has
strengthened significantly, but there remain
areas where compliance with FATF
recommendations could be tighter.

ILCs are, in essence, state-chartered commercial banks, and are
insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). All
commercial bank holding companies should be subject to the same
consolidated supervision provisions.

U.S. ODA should be increased, in line with G-8 commitments to
increase aid to Africa, the Millennium Challenge Account, and
HIV/AIDS and malaria initiatives.

Proliferation of U.S. preferential trade agreements could
undermine the multilateral fabric of world trade unless the
agreements include open-access clauses and simple rules of origin.

Staff Position

Regulation of the insurance sector is
entirely in the hands of state Insurance
Commissioners, with little federal
oversight.

Financial Policy
There are concerns about the supervisory
level-playing field with regard to industrial
finance companies (ILCs). Unlike owners
of commercial banks, owners of ILCs are
not subject to consolidated supervision
under the Bank Holding Company Act.

Official development assistance (ODA) as a
percent of GDP is lower in the U.S. than in
most other industrial countries.

Trade Policy and Foreign Aid
There are concerns about U.S. leadership in
advancing global trade liberalization.

Issue

Authorities’ Position

The September 2006 AML/CFT ROSC noted not only strong
overall progress since the last mutual evaluation in 1997, but
also satisfactory compliance with the FATF
recommendations on enhanced due diligence for
correspondent banking relationships and requirements for
money remittance services.

The Pension Protection Act (PPA) of 2006 generally
implemented changes reflecting these suggestions, including
provisions that are expected to encourage more employers to
adopt auto enrollment.

The Administration has suggested the need for a stronger
federal role in insurance regulation. The Treasury Blueprint
for a Modernized Financial Regulatory Structure
recommends an optional federal charter for insurers.

The FDIC imposed a moratorium on applications for deposit
insurance by ILCs that ended in January 2008. The FDIC will
process ILC applications and impose conditions and
safeguards on ILC parents on a case-by-case basis. The
degree of supervision necessary for nonfinancial corporate
owners of ILCs remains an open issue.

The U.S. government is on track to meet its G8 commitment
to double aid to Africa, and, more broadly, remains the
largest bilateral donor. Authorities do not subscribe to an
ODA-as-percent of GDP target; rather, they emphasize aid
effectiveness and development impact.

U.S. free trade agreements contain elements that complement
and advance the multilateral trade agenda, and include rules
of origin regimes that are simple and efficient to administer
and operate.

The absence of a financial stability report
(FSR).

Monetary Policy
Improvements in the Fed's communications
strategy would bolster its ability to comply
with the dual mandate of price stability and
full employment.

Revenue reform

Fiscal Policy
Entitlement growth makes the long-term
fiscal position unsustainable.

There are concerns about the impact of
Basel II implementation on minimum
capital floors and that it may engender
procyclical lending.

Issue

As in many other industrialized countries, publication of an FSR
could improve markets' understanding of U.S. financial sector
risks and vulnerabilities and, potentially, facilitate greater
coordination amongst regulators.

Quantifying the Fed's long-term inflation objective might help
further anchor expectations. Recent increase in detail provided on
economic projections is welcome, but more could be done.

With budget deficits projected to rise despite a squeeze in nondefense discretionary spending, revenue increases need to be
considered in the medium term. Consumption taxes, energy or
carbon taxes, and elimination of unlimited tax deductions for
employers' health insurance and mortgage interest would improve
efficiency.

Linking Medicare contributions to income would be helpful, but
not sufficient, and assumed reduction in provider payments is
unrealistic. Systemic reform, with emphasis on the effectiveness
of medical spending and better targeting, is necessary. Progressive
indexation of Social Security benefits is a promising approach.
More ambitious medium-term consolidation would help alleviate
long-term pressure.

Staff supports implementation of Basel II as a modern risksensitive capital standard. However, it acknowledges concerns
about the potential impact on minimum capital floors and thus
supports the cautious and methodical approach to implementing
the new framework, especially in light of lessons to be learned
from the recent financial crisis.

Staff Position

Authorities’ Position

Although the Federal Reserve publishes a range of
information that is relevant to the analysis of financial
stability, including in its semiannual monetary policy report,
it does not currently publish a separate financial stability
report.

The FOMC has not specified a numerical inflation target or
range to quantify its price stability objective. Given the
irreversibility of increased flow of information from the Fed
to the public, changes in communications strategy are best
introduced gradually.

Federal revenue as a share of GDP is projected to exceed its
historical average throughout most of the next decade even if
the growth-enhancing 2001/03 tax cuts are made permanent,
as advocated by the Administration. There is little political
support for efficiency-improving tax reform.

The essential mechanics involved with reforming Social
Security are well understood; it is now a question of the
political will to undertake reform. The problems with
Medicare and Medicaid cost growth are intrinsically linked to
overall health care cost growth, and thus solutions are more
difficult. Administration emphasizes market-based and
consumer-driven solutions to lowering the rate of health care
cost growth and the rate of Medicare/Medicaid cost growth.

Banking regulators have taken a cautious approach to
implementation. The final rule issued in November 2007
specified a parallel run for at least a year, before three
transitional years with maximum reductions in risk-weighted
capital. Banks would also continue to be subject to the U.S.
leverage ratio and prompt corrective action requirements.

Table 2. United States: Measures to Support the Housing Market—Selected Actions and Proposals
Administration’s actions
The FHASecure program has extended eligibility for Federal Housing Administration (FHA)
guarantees to delinquent home owners if late payment was caused by a rate reset, and it is planned to
also allow FHA insurance on loans to borrowers who have missed up to three payments for other
reasons, provided the lender is willing to write down the principal sufficiently below the current
appraised value of the house. The Administration was also instrumental in setting up HOPE NOW—
an alliance of mortgage servicers aimed at
reaching distressed home owners and finding

Congressional Housing Package Provisions
Federal Housing Administration expansion
Congressional draft legislation envisages the FHA providing guarantees for troubled mortgages over
three years. To qualify, the principal of the modified loan would have to be written down to no more
than 90 percent of the current appraised value of the house; a 3 percent loan loss reserve must be
established; origination and closing costs for the new loan up to 2 percent would be paid by existing
mortgage holders; and all other claims must be extinguished. The refinanced borrower would pay an
exit fee in the future upon selling or refinancing the property, and share a declining fraction of home
price appreciation with the FHA. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the program
would help about 400,000 borrowers and cost around $700 million, which would be covered by
temporarily diverting GSE contributions from the affordable housing funds.
Federal Housing Administration modernization
Legislation would permanently increase FHA loan guarantee limits, extend their maximum term,
allow more flexibility in underwriting criteria, reduce minimum down-payments, and permit greater
flexibility to charge fees to reflect differences in credit risk across borrowers.
Government-Sponsored Enterprise overhaul
An independent supervisor with broad safety and soundness powers would oversee Freddie Mac,
Fannie Mae, and the Federal Home Loan Banks. The GSEs’ conforming loan limits in high cost areas
would be raised permanently to the smaller of 175 percent of the national limit ($729,750 currently) or
125 percent of the local median home price (House bill), or to the smaller of 150 percent of the
national limit or the local median home price (Senate bill). (The Economic Stimulus Act has raised the
limits temporarily until the end of this year). Part of GSE profits would finance newly established
affordable housing funds.

1/ Staff projections are based on the Administration's estimates adjusted for: differences in macroeconomic projections;
staff estimates of the costs of the war on terror; staff estimates of the cost of the stimulus package; some additional
nonsecurity discretionary expenditure; additional Medicare spending; and continued AMT relief beyond FY2008.
PRAs are also assumed not to be introduced.
2/ As a percent of potential GDP, based on proposed measures, under IMF staff's economic
assumptions. Also incorporates CBO adjustments for one-off items.
3/ Calendar year, on a national accounts basis. The projections use Fund staff budget and economic assumptions.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
ε = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with a rising GDP deflator.
3/ Line includes the impact of exchange rate changes.
4/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
5/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the net foreign asset ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
UNITED STATES
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation—Supplement on
Government-Sponsored Enterprises
Prepared by the Western Hemisphere Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Anoop Singh and Adnan Mazarei
July 18, 2008
Recent problems at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac illustrate that the dynamic interactions
between the financial sector and housing cycles highlighted in the staff report, and the knock
on effects on overall activity, have yet to fully play out. As such, the thrust of the staff
appraisal remains unchanged.
1.
Recent severe market pressures forced a rescue of Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac, including access to Fed loans and a request to Congress for direct government
support. The dramatic loss in confidence in the two main housing government-sponsored
enterprises (GSEs) was triggered by reports suggesting that accounting rule changes could
take around $75 billion off Fannie and Freddie’s capital. Whatever the merits of the analysis,
the market response reflects underlying concerns over the GSEs’ capital cushions in the face
of falling house prices—not subprime mortgages—and political pressure to increase their
exposure to the housing bust. These come on top of long-standing concerns about an
inadequate regulatory regime. On July 13 the Treasury proposed to eliminate the existing
$4½ billion cap on its lending authority to the GSEs and to gain permission to buy equity. In
the interim, the Fed’s balance sheet is now available through collateralized borrowing to
provide a liquidity backstop to calm market fears.
2.
As with Bear Stearns, the final
outcome of the weekend rescue is likely to
be that equity holders lose money but debt
holders will be protected. The GSEs’ equity
prices fell by 80 percent in the week before
the announcement and—with naked short
selling of their securities suspended—remain
around this level. Auctions of GSE bonds,
however, are proceeding smoothly and their
spread over Treasuries is stable. With markets
concluding that the implicit government
guarantee of debt is real, the GSEs should
continue to function fairly normally.

With banks also being pressured
by housing woes, the deterioration in
overall financial conditions is broadly
consistent with the staff’s financial
forecast. Reflecting these pressures, a retail
deposit run on IndyMac bank, a large
Californian mortgage specialist, led to its
intervention by federal regulators—the third
biggest depository failure in U.S. history.
The CDS spreads of large commercial and
investment banks have also widened
significantly, with those of Lehman Brothers
and Wachovia close to or above levels at the
time of the Bear Stearns crisis. More
generally, interbank spreads remain elevated,
the yield curve has steepened, and the highyield spread has widened close to the levels
typical of a recession.

issuance of preferred equity that dilutes
current shareholders. Passing the improved regulatory regime—including receivership—
already in the proposed housing bill should also be a priority, as discussed in the staff report.
Consideration of this bill has been delayed to allow inclusion of requested provisions for the
government to provide direct support to the GSEs.
5.
The long-term role of Fannie and Freddie will need to be rethought, with staff
contributing via next year’s Financial Sector Assessment Program. The tension has
always been that cheap funding from the assumed government guarantee allowed the GSEs
to benefit their shareholders by expanding their portfolios while exposing taxpayers to risk.
One approach would be to break them into entities small enough to be allowed to fail,
removing their special charters and the presumption of government backing. Alternatively,
Chairman Bernanke has suggested that they could be kept in their current form—presumably
with strict prudential oversight and portfolio limits to constrain their benefit from cheap
funding. In any case, as discussed in the staff report, they should be regulated like private
institutions to ensure supervisory consistency.

3
Box 1. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac: A Primer
These GSEs have long been seen as “too big to fail”—they hold or guarantee about half
of U.S. residential mortgages, their securities widely serve as collateral, and their
derivatives activity is extensive (see Figure).
Congress created these GSEs to support reliable and affordable mortgage financing,
limiting their guarantees to conforming mortgages (with ceilings on size and risk).
With their private ownership and public mission involving Congressional oversight,
markets have long assumed that they enjoy an implicit government guarantee, although
the U.S. authorities have consistently denied this. The belief stems from their size and
unique charters that include credit lines from the Treasury, privileged bank regulatory
treatment of their bonds, and a weak supervisor with only conservatorship (going concern)
not receivership (closure) authority.
Fannie and Freddie, which are highly leveraged, bear the largest exposures to U.S.
housing-related credit risk. Their combined balance-sheet size was about $1½ trillion at
end-2007 and the GSEs

requirements, their equity capital to total assets has generally stood at 3-4 percent, similar
to that at the large U.S. investment banks, but about half of comparable ratios at
U.S. commercial banks.
In addition to credit risk, the two enterprises also have large exposures to market
risk and play a systemic role in derivatives markets. The mortgage guarantees pose
credit and reputational risk, while the investment portfolios run the gamut of credit,
interest rate, prepayment, and pricing risk. They are also key players in the OTC interest
rate derivatives markets as they seek to hedge interest rate and prepayment risks using
swaps and options on swaps (swaptions).
Reflecting their privileged position, the two GSEs were able until recently to raise
equity capital cheaply and to produce high returns for their shareholders. The
implicit guarantee kept the borrowing cost just above that on Treasury securities, even as
the low capital requirement allowed the GSEs to boost their portfolios. Large exposure to
mortgages and a thin capital cushion is at the root of market concerns about GSE solvency
as the housing crisis has led to a rise in defaults, including on prime mortgages.

Systemic risks from the GSEs have long been a well understood problem and
key policy issue, but political consensus in Congress has been elusive. The Treasury, Fed,
and Fund have repeatedly emphasized the topic over many years (Box 2).
Box 2. Staff’s Analysis of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
Staff reports since 2003 have consistently stressed that, in view of Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac’s systemic importance, there is a need to monitor closely their risk
management and accounting practices and reform their regulation. More specifically:
•

Size of portfolios. Staff have supported proposals by the Treasury and the Fed to
cap these enterprises’ portfolios, to restore their focus on securitization of
conforming mortgages, and to limit their special status, to discourage the market
perception of an implicit government guarantee of their liabilities.

•

Interest and mortgage prepayment risk. Staff have also repeatedly observed that
the growth of these institutions has concentrated interest rate and mortgage
prepayment risk, with the attendant hedging operations also leading to
concentration in some derivative markets.

•

Overhauling the supervisory arrangement. The staff have strongly backed
Treasury proposals to create a new regulator with full powers to set risk-based
capital requirements, to design stress tests, and to place a housing GSE into
receivership in the event of a financial insolvency.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with the
United States
On July 23, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the United States. 1
Background
Problems in the housing and financial markets over the past year have combined to slow the
U.S. economy substantially. As the residential investment downturn accelerated and national
indices of house prices started falling, mortgage defaults rose sharply, and bank losses
mounted. Increased uncertainty about counterparty creditworthiness triggered a full-blown
liquidity and credit crisis late last summer, and credit spreads widened. As banks’ balance
sheets deteriorated, lending standards that had supported the earlier housing boom were
rapidly tightened, and a deleveraging cycle began, impairing the extension of credit to the real
economy. With consumption and construction weakening in the face of falling house prices,
higher oil prices, and tighter credit, the economy has increasingly been supported by net
exports. Headline inflation, as well as near-term inflation expectations, have been pushed up
recently by surging commodity prices, but growing slack has for now kept a lid on core inflation
and wage demands.
Policymakers have responded aggressively to these developments. The Fed cut the federal
funds rate target by 325 basis points over just eight months, facilitated JP Morgan’s takeover of
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the [Managing Director], as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

Bear Stearns in March, and introduced a variety of innovative liquidity instruments. These
actions have brought greater liquidity and smoother functioning of financial markets, but overall
financial conditions have continued to tighten in the face of higher lending standards, falling
asset prices, and higher risk spreads. Fiscal policy too has been responsive, with a stimulus
package consisting of targeted tax rebates and investment incentives enacted in January. The
rebate checks began to arrive at households in late April, providing timely support to the
economy.
The international and regional U.S. experience with housing busts suggests that the associated
recovery is often slow. With the effects of earlier financial tightening yet to feed fully through the
real economy, real GDP growth is likely to remain below potential through mid-2009. Significant
uncertainty, however, surrounds this forecast, given the unprecedented nature of the shocks
that have hit the U.S. economy. Indeed, many other forecasters view the substantial policy
stimulus and rapid raising of bank capital as being likely to ease financial conditions faster than
expected in the staff’s baseline, suggesting a recovery could start in the second half of 2008.
The turmoil unveiled many weaknesses in the current system of financial regulation and
supervision in the United States. The “originate-to-distribute” model has gone into reverse, and
assets have returned to banks’ balance sheets, straining bank capital at a time when lax
mortgage underwriting standards have resulted in substantial losses. The authorities have
outlined a blueprint for financial regulatory reform that is a solid starting point for discussion.
The current account deficit has receded from its peak in 2006 on the back of a weakening dollar
and robust foreign activity, despite pressures from surging oil prices. At unchanged real
exchange rates, the current account deficit is expected to narrow over the medium term. Staff
analysis suggests that the dollar is closer to its medium-term equilibrium level, although still on
the strong side.
The federal fiscal deficit narrowed substantially in recent years, falling to just above 1 percent of
GDP in FY 2007. The growth slowdown and stimulus package are expected to lead to a marked
increase in deficits over the next two years, which should then return to about 2 percent of GDP
over the medium term. The Administration and Congress share the goal of balancing the budget
by FY 2012 but neither outlines a complete plan for achieving the goal, as no provision is made
for war-funding authority beyond FY2009, costs of overriding tighter criteria for the alternative
minimum tax, or realistic compensation for Medicare providers.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. Directors noted that the U.S.
economy and financial system are confronting significant challenges, with understandable
concerns about their implications for the global economy. The housing correction and the
broader financial sector turmoil of recent months have weakened household demand and credit
conditions. With added headwinds from oil prices, the U.S. economy will be notably weaker but
still register positive growth in 2008, and will recover only gradually in 2009. Although short-term
inflation expectations have risen somewhat on surging commodity prices, price pressures are
expected to be contained as commodity prices peak and economic slack rises.

Directors observed that the U.S. economy has shown impressive resilience in the face of an
unprecedented confluence of shocks, and commended the authorities’ decisive and swift policy
response. In particular, they welcomed the carefully calibrated and targeted fiscal stimulus, the
significant easing of monetary policy, and the willingness to introduce innovative mechanisms to
support market liquidity. While not without risk, these measures have helped support economic
activity, and played an important role in stabilizing financial markets domestically and globally.
Looking ahead, Directors cautioned that large uncertainties remain, and that the outlook hinges
crucially on the evolution of house prices, and the dynamic interaction of financial sector and
housing cycles, which have still to play out fully. Directors therefore welcomed the authorities’
commitment to carefully monitor developments and continue to respond as necessary to
achieve sustainable noninflationary growth and financial stability over the medium term.
Directors generally agreed that monetary policy should stay on hold for now, unless economic
and financial conditions deteriorate further. With the real federal funds rate negative, monetary
policy is already positioned appropriately to respond to recession risks, although the impact is
being dampened by widening spreads and tighter lending standards. Wage demands remain
moderate, but there is a risk that elevated headline inflation may seep into inflation
expectations. Given the high cost of reversing such expectations once they become
entrenched, most Directors underscored that the bias should be toward a decisive tightening
once recovery is established and financial conditions ease. At the same time, Directors
acknowledged that the downside risks to growth still remain large, adding to the complexity of
monetary policy management at this juncture.
While fiscal stimulus is providing well-targeted support to aggregate demand at a critical time,
Directors underscored that medium-term fiscal challenges limit the room for further initiatives.
Automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate, and, in the face of looming fiscal challenges
that require medium-term fiscal consolidation and reform of unsustainable entitlement
programs, any further fiscal action—were it to become necessary—should focus on direct
support to housing and financial markets. Directors supported the recent federal backstop to
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, given the systemic importance of these government-sponsored
enterprises in financial and housing markets. They considered that improvements in the
regulatory regime of these agencies aimed at better risk management and stricter oversight
should also be implemented as a priority.
Directors generally suggested that the government should be prepared to widen support for
housing and, if serious dislocations reappear, for financial markets, while limiting the cost to the
government and minimizing moral hazard. Housing prices are continuing to fall, and there is a
risk that such prices could move significantly below equilibrium, with important macroeconomic
consequences. With house prices falling rapidly and the inventory-sales ratio at a near-record
high, there is a role for public policy to overcome coordination difficulties by using Federal
Housing Administration guarantees to encourage lenders to make voluntary write-downs on
mortgage principal to new, more affordable loans. Such legislation would ideally also provide
further incentives for lenders to participate. If major systemic financial disruptions recur, the
government could support bank liquidity by significantly extending the term of asset swaps.
While welcoming the recent regulatory and prudential reforms initiated by the authorities,

Directors considered that a comprehensive policy response to improve financial regulation could
include further consolidation and specialization of regulatory institutions, as well as
strengthening liquidity requirements and raising capital charges for off-balance sheet lending.
Directors emphasized that the housing boom has revealed multiple weaknesses in the current
regulatory system, including the inadequate consumer protection for mortgage borrowers and
perverse incentives in the securitization chain.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intentions to undertake comprehensive reform of the U.S.
regulatory model, and saw the Treasury Blueprint as a useful starting point. In addition, the
regulation and supervision of major investment banks and government-sponsored enterprises
should be improved, and some Directors saw merit in a more consolidated regulatory
structure—for example, by merging the oversight of investment banks and GSEs with that for
commercial bank holding companies—although the specific modalities for such improvements
remain under discussion. The point was made that regulation should yield the benefits of
broadened oversight of investment banks while preserving the dynamism and flexibility of the
sector. Regulatory reform could also include further measures to reduce the procyclicality of
bank lending by augmenting risk-based capital ratios with ancillary measures. Finally, with
liquidity having emerged as a major and under-emphasized risk, forthcoming recommendations
from the Basel Committee will also merit early implementation, taking into account U.S.-specific
nuances. Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to undertake a Financial Sector
Assessment Program with the Fund starting in 2009. Directors recognized the importance of
stronger market discipline, as a complement to regulatory actions.
Directors noted the staff assessment that the decline in the dollar’s real effective exchange rate
has moved U.S. competitiveness relatively close to medium-term fundamentals. A number of
Directors cautioned that tensions remain in the pattern of bilateral adjustment. In particular,
bilateral rate adjustments have not corresponded to the pattern of imbalances, with larger
changes against freely floating currencies such as the euro, rather than against currencies of
countries with large current account surpluses. Directors also reiterated the importance of
structural reforms in facilitating external adjustment across the main economic areas, as
envisaged during the Multilateral Consultation on global imbalances. They looked forward to
continued U.S. leadership in fostering a positive outcome to the Doha Round and in working
with partners to avoid protectionism in trade and finance.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's views
and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries)
concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member
countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex post
