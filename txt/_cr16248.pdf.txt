IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Djibouti
On December 4, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation discussions11 with Djibouti, and considered and endorsed the staff
appraisal without a meeting.2
Djibouti has been pursuing a strategy of developing infrastructure and its port facilities to foster
rapid growth and reduce poverty. Economic growth, driven by large investment projects,
continued its rapid pace in 2014. However, widespread poverty and unemployment persist.
Moreover, the high external debt suggests extremely limited scope for additional borrowing.

Aggregate investment reached 44 percent of GDP in 2014 and is expected to peak at 57 percent
in 2015–16. GDP growth is expected to rise from 6 percent in 2014 to about 6.5 percent in
2015–16 and to 7 percent in 2017–19. Inflation is projected at 3 percent in 2015 and about
3.5 percent in 2016–18 as the large infrastructure spending would increase the demand for
housing and services.

High public investment spending is exerting considerable fiscal and external debt pressures. The
fiscal deficit on commitment basis is projected to rise from 12.2 percent of GDP in 2014 to
16.5 percent in 2015, and decline to 11.4 percent in 2016, in tandem with the investment
expenditure profile. Reflecting high non-concessional borrowing, total public and publicly
guaranteed (PPG) debt reached 60.5 percent of GDP in 2014 and it is projected to continue rising
in the near term, peaking at 80 percent in 2017. The current account deficit would widen from
25.6 percent of GDP in 2014 to 31 percent in 2015, due to large capital goods imports, before
declining to 14 percent of GDP in 2017–19 after the completion of most of the large investment
projects. The deficit will be financed by loans and foreign direct investment (FDI).

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every
year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the
country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms
the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.
The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse of time procedure when the Board agrees that a proposal can be
considered without convening formal discussions.

Central bank gross foreign assets are projected to remain strong, permitting full currency board
coverage over the period 2015–20. Commercial banks’ loan portfolio has deteriorated with the
ratio of non-performing loans to total loans rising to more than 22 percent in June 2015.
Executive Board Assessment
Djibouti’s economic growth driven by the ambitious infrastructure investment program is
gathering pace. Staff calls on the authorities to strengthen public capacity to manage the
investment program, including capacity to evaluate and monitor investment projects. Staff
recommends prioritizing the proposed projects, based on absorptive capacity and resource
constraints, and conducting cost-benefit analyses before any project is undertaken. Expediting
the reform of public enterprises that will manage the large investment projects to improve their
efficiency and financial standing would ensure the projects’ commercial viability and reduce
contingent liabilities for the budget.
The non-concessional financing of the investment program is aggravating Djibouti’s high risk of
debt distress and poses risks to fiscal sustainability. Staff therefore urges the authorities to take
steps to ensure a sustainable fiscal and external debt path. To this end, staff exhorts the
authorities to be cautious with additional borrowing and limit non-concessional borrowing.
Equally important is enhancing debt management capacity, including the monitoring of
contingent liabilities, and improving coordination among government units responsible for
contracting, monitoring, and servicing debt.

Staff commends the authorities for organizing the successful June 2015 tax conference, with the
participation of all stakeholders, notably the private sector and civil society. Staff underscores
the need to design and implement comprehensive tax reform based on the conference
recommendations. Implementing a simple and transparent tax regime that reduces tax
exemptions and levels the playing field for all investors is crucial.

Staff expresses concern over the weaknesses in the banking sector, particularly the recent
increase in non-performing loans and decline in return on equity. Strengthening banking
supervision and adopting the measures needed to address the problems of banks in difficulty is a
priority. Moreover, staff notes that access to financial services remains low, despite the increase
in the number of banks. The authorities’ plans to establish a credit guarantee fund and develop
microfinance are a welcome development which needs to be expeditiously implemented to
promote financial inclusion. Also, reinforcing instruments to counter money laundering and the
financing of terrorism is essential. The currency board arrangement has served Djibouti well.
Consequently, competitiveness should be improved by reducing the cost of utilities and
developing human capital.

Staff commends the authorities for the adoption of the Accelerated Growth Strategy for
Promoting Employment, and recommends prioritizing projects that foster inclusive growth
through job-creation and poverty reduction. Enhanced measures to protect the poor are needed.
Finally, diversifying economic activity into more labor-intensive sectors such as fishing and
tourism would create employment and promote inclusive and stable growth.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 17, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context: Faced with scarcity of resources, Djibouti has pursued a strategy of developing
infrastructure to exploit its strategic geographic location so as to foster rapid growth,
reduce poverty and create much-needed jobs. Djibouti has had to resort to
non-concessional financing, which has raised its external debt. Reform is crucial to
generate the revenues needed to return to a sustainable external debt and fiscal path,
achieve higher growth, and reduce widespread poverty and unemployment.
Focus of the discussions: (i) Fiscal reform; (ii) managing the scaling-up of public
investment, especially the implications for debt sustainability; (iii) inclusive growth, job
creation and poverty reduction; and (iv) financial inclusion and stability.
Key policy recommendations:
(i) To increase revenues and ensure debt sustainability, develop a timetable to reform
the investment incentive framework and the overall tax regime, drawing on proposals
from the government-sponsored June 2015 tax conference.
(ii) Develop a strategy to reduce and manage the external debt burden; limit
non-concessional public or publicly guaranteed borrowing; tighten monitoring of
government contingent liabilities; and strengthen coordination among entities involved
in contracting external debt.
(iii) Ensure that investment spending is within absorption capacity and available
resources. Strengthen institutional capacity to manage investment projects, including by
reforming public enterprises that will manage the projects, manage the projects on a
commercial basis so that they can be profitable and generate the revenues needed to
service their debt. Finalize with the Ethiopian authorities the arrangement for jointly
managing the Djibouti-Addis Ababa railway project.
(iv) Lowering the cost of utilities, improving the business environment, and re-orienting
the educational curricula towards skills in demand, would promote economic
diversification, job creation, and poverty reduction.
(v) Monitor commercial banks’ loan portfolio and ensure that banks provision
adequately for nonperforming loans. Expedite the credit guarantee scheme for SMEs.

DESPITE STRONG INVESTMENT-DRIVEN GROWTH,
POVERTY AND UNEMPLOYMENT REMAIN
WIDESPREAD
1.
Economic activity continued to gather pace in 2014. Economic growth was estimated
at 6 percent in 2014, driven by large-scale investments in infrastructure and port facilities.
Aggregate investment reached 44.1 percent of GDP in 2014. Public investment spending was
about 20 percent of GDP ($320 million), mainly on the Djibouti-Addis Ababa railway project
which is expected to be operational in 2016 and on the pipeline that will transport water from
Ethiopia to Djibouti. The high investment resulted in a fiscal deficit (commitment basis) of
12.2 percent of GDP which was financed by external borrowing (8.9 percent of GDP) and the
drawdown of revenues from the partial privatization of the Djibouti port in 2013. Inflation
remained relatively low at 3 percent, mainly driven by tobacco and services price increases. The
current account deficit rose to 25.6 percent of GDP, driven by investment goods imports. Net
income from abroad rose from $84 million in 2013 to $94 million in 2014, reflecting the increase
in rent for the U.S. military base. Currency board coverage was 110 percent. Central bank gross
foreign assets fell from $410 million in 2013 to $381 million in 2014 (3.5 months of imports) as
privatization revenues were drawn down.

Unemployment Ages 15-24

2.
However, widespread poverty and unemployment persist. About 22 percent of the
population lives in extreme poverty and the unemployment rate is 48 percent. Recent high levels
of economic growth have been driven by capital-intensive investment in the ports and portrelated activities, with limited trickle-down

to finance is low, constraining the
emergence and growth of smaller enterprises. Only 20 percent of the adult population has access
to banking services and only 5 percent of formal-sector enterprises have access to bank
financing. The business environment has been challenging and has not created favorable
conditions for the expansion of the private sector. The challenges stem in part from high
production costs—in particular for electricity, communication and water—and a weak judicial
system.

3.
The external debt stock increased to 53.7 percent of GDP in 2014, from 48.4 percent
in 2013, driven by borrowing to finance infrastructure investment. Djibouti has been assessed to
remain at high risk of debt distress. The authorities stated that they have cleared all arrears to the
Paris Club creditors. Arrears to non-Paris Club creditors stood at $18.5 million (1 percent of GDP)
at end-August 2015 and were mainly due to Iran and India. The authorities indicated that they
are seeking debt rescheduling from these creditors.
4.
Commercial banks’ loan portfolio has been deteriorating. The non-performing
loans (NPLs) ratio has increased since 2011, with the pace accelerating, increasing recently from
18 percent at end-2014 to 22.5 percent at end-June 2015. Furthermore, provisions for nonperforming loans declined from 82 percent in 2012 to 52 percent in mid-2015. Similarly, return
on equity and return on assets have reached their lowest levels in 2014–15. This deterioration in
the NPLs is mainly concentrated in one bank and can be ascribed to excessive risk-taking as well
as weak oversight. However, the authorities imputed the deterioration to a rigorous
reclassification of loans and the bankruptcy of two oil companies that failed to repay their debt.
To address the situation, an understanding has been reached between the government and
other shareholders to recapitalize the bank. Regarding the rest of the banking sector, two small
banks are under liquidation. All other banks, but one, have met the new minimum capital
requirement. A new investment bank has been authorized to operate.
5.
The political climate is dominated by the presidential elections scheduled for
April 2016. It is expected that President Ismael Omar Guelleh, in office since 1999, will run for a
fourth term.
6.
Djibouti is experiencing a large influx of people fleeing the conflict in Yemen.
According to the UN and the Djibouti authorities, as of early October 2015, 28,389 people had
arrived in Djibouti since the conflict erupted in March 2015, of which 4,895 have been registered
as refugees by the UN; the remainder stay with relatives in Djibouti or are expected to relocate to
other countries. The international community provides the bulk of the assistance offered to
people fleeing the conflict. The Djibouti government indicated that as of end-August it had spent
$1.7 million on account of refugees from Yemen.
7.
Several recommendations of the 2014 Article IV consultation remain valid. These
include: (i) pursue fiscal consolidation to enhance fiscal sustainability; (ii) reform the investment
incentive system to increase revenues and level the playing field for enterprises; (iii) avoid
non-concessional financing to improve fiscal and debt sustainability; (iv) develop a strategy to
manage and reduce the external debt burden; (v) strengthen public investment and debt
management capacity; and (vi) promote economic diversification and structural transformation
by reducing utility costs, especially the high electricity tariffs, providing training in the skills
needed in the labor market, and strengthening contract enforcement.

AN ENCOURAGING OUTLOOK AMIDST GROWING
RISKS
8.
Economic activity is expected to accelerate in the coming years, driven by the
investment boom. GDP growth is projected at 6.5 percent in 2015 and 2016, rising to 7 percent in
2017–19. Aggregate investment is projected to peak at about 57 percent of GDP in 2015–16, before
declining to 30 percent in 2017–19.1 After peaking at 16.8 percent in 2015, the fiscal deficit is
projected to drop to less than 1 percent by 2019, with the completion of the ongoing investment
projects triggering a fall in public investment spending from 27.5 percent of GDP in 2015–16 to
11.3 percent in 2017–19. The debt stock is expected to peak at about 80 percent of GDP in 2017,
and decline thereafter as disbursements on loans for some infrastructure projects are completed.
The inflation rate is projected to stabilize at 3.5 percent in 2016–18. The current account deficit is
projected to peak at about 31 percent of GDP in 2015, declining to 14 percent of GDP in 2017–19.
Currency board cover is projected at 109 percent throughout 2015–19. Broad money and domestic
credit are expected to grow at about 10 percent and 16 percent a year respectively in 2015–19. An
agreement signed in June 2015 between Djibouti and China on the establishment of a Chinese naval
military base in Djibouti will yield rents of $20 million a year to government revenue.
9.
However, the medium-term outlook is exposed to considerable risks, subjecting the
baseline growth projections to a high degree of uncertainty. First, Djibouti’s dependence on
close trade links with Ethiopia creates risks. A growth slowdown or recession in Ethiopia—the main
client of Djibouti’s ports, which are the key engine of the economy—could reduce the use of the
ports, adversely affecting growth and fiscal revenues in Djibouti. This risk reinforces the need to
diversify economic activity in Djibouti to reduce dependence on a single sector catering largely to a
single client. Also, a shock to food production in Ethiopia would impact Djibouti directly which
imports the bulk of primary food products from Ethiopia. Second, a sharp slowdown in China, the
main source of funding for recent public investment projects, might affect the financing and
execution of some of the projects. Third, the risk of political instability in Djibouti could rise in the
run-up to the 2016 presidential elections. Fourth, further terrorist attacks in Djibouti—which is
exposed to spillovers from the conflict in Somalia—would undermine business confidence,
investment and economic activity. Fifth, delays in the implementation of investment projects could
increase the fiscal costs for projects for which loans have been disbursed.

Staff assumes that investment drives economic growth by inducing demand for goods and services. The related job
creation and business opportunities will also generate further income, which will also boost economic activity.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions focused on: (i) managing the scaling-up of public investment, especially the implications
for debt sustainability (ii) fiscal reform, drawing on the recommendations of the June 2015 tax
conference; (iii) promoting inclusive growth through poverty reduction and job creation; and
(iv) financial inclusion and stability. Selected issues papers have been prepared on fiscal reform,
financial inclusion, as well as investment, growth, and debt sustainability.

A. Managing the Scaling-Up of Public Investment, Especially the
Implications for Debt Sustainability
10.
Public capacity to manage the investment program requires strengthening. The
scaling-up of investment to unprecedented levels poses challenges for Djibouti’s limited public
management capacity. Staff urged the authorities to strengthen public capacity to evaluate and
monitor investment projects, and recommended that a cost-benefit analysis should be conducted
before any investment project is undertaken. Staff also proposed that the authorities prioritize the
execution of proposed projects, taking into account absorptive capacity and resource constraints.
Furthermore, staff encouraged the authorities to speed up plans to set up a committee to assess the
macroeconomic implications of the large public investment projects. In view of the accelerated
execution of the Djibouti-Addis Ababa railway project, staff urged the authorities to expedite the
institutional arrangement for managing the joint railway project with Ethiopia, including the cost
and revenue-sharing mechanism. Staff expressed concern over the limited progress on the
proposed public enterprise reform emphasizing the need to reform in particular enterprises such as
the water and electricity supply companies that will take over the operation of the large investment
projects, to ensure their commercial viability. Staff urged the authorities to adopt swiftly a
comprehensive public enterprise strategy that is supported by all the stakeholders.
11.
Public debt management capacity requires strengthening. Responsibility for planning,
monitoring, and negotiating external debt agreements is spread between the Ministry of Economy
and Finance, and the Ministry of Budget, and other government institutions , with some overlap and
no clear lines of subordination. The limited coordination among these entities undermines debt
management, which partly accounts for repeated arrears accumulation. Staff therefore urged the
authorities to urgently improve coordination among the government entities involved in debt
management.
12.
Reducing and managing the growing external debt is an urgent priority. The debt
sustainability analysis (DSA) results (see DSA report) reaffirm the high risk of external debt distress.
The present value of the debt-to-GDP and debt-to-export ratios as well as all other solvency and
liquidity ratios breach the relevant thresholds. The DSA suggests that borrowing space is extremely
limited, and any further non-concessional borrowing will exacerbate the already high risk of debt
distress. Staff therefore proposed that any public or publicly guaranteed borrowing should be
limited to projects with high rates of return. Staff recommended that the projects should be run on a

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DJIBOUTI

commercial basis so that they can be profitable and generate the revenues needed to service their
debt. Furthermore, staff stressed that: (i) the authorities should remain current on all debt service
obligations; (ii) debt service capacity should be integrated into the budget planning process; (iii) the
budget should provide for sufficient liquidity buffers to cover volatile debt service costs on variableinterest-rate debt and avoid accumulating arrears; and (iv) monitoring and management of
government contingent liabilities, including debt contracted by public enterprises without
government guarantees, should be tightened.
13.
Authorities’ views: The authorities acknowledged the need to strengthen public capacity to
manage the investment scaling-up, and underscored the importance of technical assistance to this
end. They also acknowledged the high risk of debt distress but pointed out that the investment
projects are vital for Djibouti’s development. The authorities are therefore of the view that, in the
absence of other financing options, external borrowing to finance the projects is justified. They
reiterated their confidence that the investment projects would be profitable in the longer run and
generate the revenues needed to service the associated loans. They nevertheless stated that to
alleviate the burden of the debt service, they have approached creditors to renegotiate the terms of
loans contracted for certain projects.

B. Fiscal Reform
14.
The present fiscal path appears unsustainable. To satisfy its inter-temporal budget
constraint without default, a government must achieve primary surpluses whose present value

should be sufficient to cover the present
(in percent of GDP)
value of debt service. For Djibouti, over

average, 6 percentage points of GDP a
year. Given the limited scope for domestic borrowing, the debt service requirements would have to
be met through continued foreign borrowing, if available. This raises the prospect of abrupt and
large adjustments to government spending or large tax hikes.
Sources: Staff projections

15.
Fiscal reform is needed to enhance fiscal sustainability and achieve inclusive growth.
Additional revenues will be needed to ensure that the government is able to meet its financial
obligations, which are growing rapidly as a result of the on-going debt-financed investment boom.
Projections suggest that, given widespread tax exemptions under the current tax regime, fiscal

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

DJIBOUTI

revenues would decline as a percent of GDP over the medium term.2 Djibouti’s growth strategy,
based on attracting foreign investment through generous tax concessions, is widely perceived to
have sacrificed fiscal revenue without generating commensurate benefits in terms of employment.
Furthermore, current fiscal policy could undermine pro-poor inclusive growth. Tax exemptions have
created an uneven playing field for investors, sidelining smaller domestic, typically labor-intensive
enterprises. Also, implicit subsidies on energy products through reduced taxes—which were
intended to cushion the impact of rising international prices—have resulted in forgone fiscal
revenues, while benefiting higher-income groups disproportionately. The fiscal situation could be
exacerbated by a reduction in aid inflows, which could lead to difficulties in funding planned
expenditures: about 10 percent of government expenditure was financed through grants in 2014,
and a further 23 percent through loans. In addition, delays in implementing public investment
projects for which loans have already been contracted would generate costs to the budget. This has
been the case for the water pipeline project which carries a 0.5 percent commitment fee on the
undisbursed loan amount. Large-scale external borrowing by public enterprises also poses
contingent liabilities to the budget. Lastly, an increase in global oil prices could generate fiscal costs
if the authorities do not adjust domestic prices.
16.
The government-sponsored June 2015 tax conference is a key step towards a
comprehensive reform of the tax regime. The conference launched a broad consultative debate
involving the tax administration, the business community, academia, and civil society on the main
pillars of tax reform. The guiding themes were: (i) simplifying the fiscal regime; (ii) enhancing fiscal
equity; (iii) improving tax efficiency; and (iv) securing fiscal revenues. The conference generated
support for reform and promising short, medium, and long-term reform proposals. During the
mission, in response to the authorities’ request for Fund technical assistance, an FAD expert worked
closely with the authorities to synthesize the conference recommendations. Below are the main
recommendations made by the expert, drawing on the wider set of conference recommendations.
Some recommendations with modest revenue implications might be introduced in the 2016 budget.
Staff urged the authorities to expedite the initiation of measures with stronger revenue prospects
since these would take longer to produce the expected revenues.


Reduce tax exemptions for the free zone. All new companies would be exempt from income tax
in the first ten years of operation, and subject to an income tax of 15 percent starting in the
11th year. Existing companies would be exempt from income tax in the first ten years of
operation, and subject to an income tax of 5 percent starting in the 11th year, 10 percent starting
in the 15th year, and 15 percent after 20 years. Enhance efforts to ensure that companies meet
their tax obligations including the requirement to submit income statements, and pay the
5 percent dividend tax introduced in 2015.

2

The decline in fiscal revenues as a percent of GDP is partly driven by a declining ratio to GDP of rents from the
military bases, which accounted for 13 percent of total revenues in 2012–14. The rents are exogenous to economic
activity. They determined by negotiation with governments of countries using the bases. Similarly, some other
revenue sources such as taxes from petroleum products are also exogenous to economic activity.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DJIBOUTI



Repeal the investment code, one of three channels through which tax concessions have been
granted. The other channels are the free zone, and discretionary exemptions granted by the
authorities. It is recommended that existing exemptions be honored and, starting in 2017, no
new exemption should be issued under the investment code.



Remove the domestic consumption tax on investment goods (and raw materials). This tax
penalizes investment because it is due at the time of investing, before the returns on investment
are realized, and without any refund in the event of a loss.



Raise the lump sum minimum tax from 1 percent to 1.5 percent. All enterprises (including those
benefiting from exemptions) are subject to this tax on their business turnover.



Increase the threshold for the tax on wages and salaries from DF 5,000 ($28) a month to
DF 50,000 ($280).



Set up a system of electronic tax filing and payment.

17.
Fiscal consolidation is imperative to return the economy to a sustainable fiscal and
debt path. Over the medium term, given the restraint already imposed on current spending and the
authorities’ determination to pursue their investment plans, there is little scope for cutting
aggregate spending. While information is insufficient for a full assessment of the likely quantum of
additional revenues from the new investment projects, much of the prospective additional revenues
are expected over the longer term. Thus, prospects for additional revenues from this source over the
medium term are limited. Scope does exist, however, for increasing tax revenues by broadening the
tax base, revising the investment incentive framework (discussed above), and strengthening tax
administration by reinforcing human resources and modernizing tax collection processes.
Furthermore, improving the performance of public enterprises would enhance their fiscal
contribution. Opening up the monopoly telecommunications sector could also generate revenue,
and improve efficiency, as experience from other countries shows. Ultimately, cutting investment
spending may be necessary to return the economy to a sustainable fiscal and external debt path.
18.
The fall in international oil prices offers an opportunity to introduce a market-based
pricing mechanism for energy products without increasing domestic prices. Implicit subsidies
on kerosene, gasoline and diesel in the form of a reduction of pre-existing tax rates were introduced
in the wake of the 2007–08 global financial crisis to cushion the impact of high international oil
prices on domestic consumers. The forgone revenues were estimated at about 2 percent of GDP in
2011. The authorities have kept domestic prices largely unchanged while international oil prices
have dropped by over 50 percent since the end of 2014, resulting in a de facto elimination of the
implicit subsidies. Staff advice has been to introduce a price adjustment mechanism that allows a full
pass-through of international prices together with safety nets to protect the welfare of the poor and
vulnerable population. During the mission, staff advised that the fall in international oil prices offers
an opportunity to introduce the market-based pricing mechanism without increasing domestic
prices.

19.
Strengthening fiscal and public financial management remains a priority. Several key
past staff recommendations are yet to be fully implemented. These include the transition to a
medium-term budget framework, and merging the VAT administration and that of other taxes into a
large tax payers’ unit which will administer all taxes for large taxpayers: VAT, income tax, etc. The
authorities have indicated that work with the large taxpayers’ unit is progressing. New staff are
being recruited and the unit is expected to be operational in 2016.
20.
Authorities’ views. The authorities acknowledged the need for a far-reaching tax reform to
return the economy to a sustainable fiscal and debt path, and foster inclusive growth. They indicated
their intention to start implementing the recommendations of the tax conference in the 2016
budget and highlighted the measures implemented to restrain public spending such as the hiring
freeze in the public service outside of the health and education sectors. The authorities reiterated
their willingness to revise the pricing formula for energy products to eliminate implicit subsidies, but
underlined the need to develop beforehand a registry of the poor and vulnerable population which
is required for the safety net program.

C. Promoting Inclusive Growth, Job Creation, and Poverty Reduction
21.
Eradicating widespread poverty and unemployment remains Djibouti’s fundamental
development challenge. In addition to a stable macroeconomic framework and fair tax regime, the
following reforms are critical:


Improving the business environment: Djibouti ranked 171st out of 189 countries on the World
Bank Doing Business Index 2016, reflecting a difficult business environment. A key priority is
reforming the judicial system to improve contract enforcement and property rights protection
and strengthen anti-corruption efforts.



Lowering the cost of utilities and improving the quality of service delivery: Improving the
supply of basic utilities and reducing their cost would stimulate investment and boost
competitiveness. Electricity tariffs are among the highest in the region, while
telecommunications costs are high and service quality relatively poor.



Investing in human capital: To equip Djibouti nationals for the job opportunities created by
the investment boom, reforms to the educational system and professional training are needed
to improve the match between the available skills and needs of the labor market.



Economic diversification into labor-intensive sectors like fishing and tourism would reduce the
risks associated with reliance on the ports while creating jobs and generating fiscal revenues.
The reforms proposed in this section would help promote diversification.



Social safety nets are needed to protect the poor and vulnerable population.



Encouraging small businesses. These tend to be labor-intensive, relying on domestic labor. Yet,
they have been disadvantaged by the current development strategy of according tax

concessions to attract foreign investment, and face additional obstacles, such as limited access

22.
The authorities launched in 2015 the Accelerated Growth Strategy for Promoting
Employment (SCAPE). The SCAPE, which encompasses ongoing public investment projects,
translates “Vision Djibouti 2035” into five-year rolling plans. Vision 2035, the authorities’ long-term
development vision, envisions Djibouti as Africa’s commercial and logistics hub, and aims to triple
per capita income by 2035. The SCAPE aims to enhance diversification of economic activity through
a wide range of projects, for which funding has been secured, including: (i) port and transportation
facilities: the ongoing Addis-Ababa Djibouti railway project, and construction of new ports and
expansion of existing ports; (ii) energy: a second electricity supply line with Ethiopia, a geothermal
project involving a consortium of seven donors, and construction of a new power plant close to
Djibouti-ville, the capital city (iii) water supply: the ongoing construction of a water pipeline between
Djibouti and Ethiopia, and a desalination plant funded with an EU grant. Funding for some of the
other projects is yet to be secured.

23.
The authorities have launched initiatives to protect the welfare of the poor. Some
16,400 low-income households are scheduled to receive allowances of DF 18,000 ($101) per quarter
over twelve months under a cash transfer program.3 The universal health insurance scheme, which
was initially limited to the public sector, has been extended more widely. Other support programs
include free vaccination for children from poor households, and allowances to university students
from outside the capital city.
24.
Authorities’ views. The authorities are aware of the challenges facing them in the area of
job creation and poverty reduction. They concurred with staff on the reform priorities and expressed
confidence that the ongoing investment projects would foster inclusive growth by generating jobs
and hence income, and meeting the basic needs of the population, such as access to water supply,
health facilities, and education.

D. Financial Inclusion and Stability
25.
Access to financial services remains low in Djibouti despite the increase in the number
of banks from four in 2006 to ten today. Less than 20 percent of the adult population possesses a
bank account. Some banks require a relatively large minimum deposit to open a bank account. Only
4 percent of adults could obtain a loan from a formal-sector financial institution in 2011, while
18 percent of adults had obtained credit from their circles of family or friends. Certain requirements
constrain access to credit such as the 2 percent tax for the registration of collateral for mortgage
loans, and another 2 percent tax for the release of collateral. Credit to small and medium enterprises
represents only 12 percent of total bank credit to enterprises. High-risk premia undermine financial
inclusion and development: Lending-deposit rate differentials exceed 10 percentage points. Djibouti
banks require high levels of collateralization: 228 percent of the loan amount, compared with
190 percent in other MENA countries and 179 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa. Such low levels of
financial inclusion in Djibouti suggest that the economy may be operating well below its potential
because productive activity by a large share of the population would be constrained by limited
access to financial services.
26.
Management problems have stymied the development of microfinance since its
emergence in 2008. The Caisse populaire d'Epargne et de Crédit, the leading microfinance
institution was under central bank receivership from 2012 to 2015 because of management
problems. This institution, with a membership of over 14,000 (about less than 3 percent of the adult
population), accounted for less than 0.12 percent of bank credit. Its lending interest rate was
26.8 percent a year, which is almost 10 percentage points higher than the average of commercial
banks’ rates. The microfinance institution did not pay interest on deposits.
27.
The central bank is pursuing measures to enhance financial inclusion and
development. It has set up a guarantee fund to facilitate access to finance for small companies and
established a Sharia Board for Islamic banking. It is also pursuing plans to modernize the payment

system, develop the electronic payment system, and modernize the credit information system, with
support from the World Bank.
28.

Developing the financial infrastructure is crucial for financial development:



The credit information system needs to be strengthened and developed. An effective
information system that enables real-time access to information on credit applications reduces
risks emanating from information asymmetries between lenders and borrowers.



Implementation of the credit guarantee fund for SMEs needs to be accelerated. The fund
would enable partial risk sharing, which should encourage financial institutions to lend to
perceived high-risk groups such as small businesses.



Technological innovation would promote financial inclusion. Mobile telephony—more than
half of the adult population are subscribers—can offer low-cost financial services relative to
traditional banking.

29.
The central bank’s banking supervision capacity and commercial banks’ risk
management capacity require strengthening to enhance financial stability, in light of the
expansion of the banking system and the high level of NPLs in commercial banks’ loan portfolio.
Rising NPLs in recent years combined with declining provisions to NPLs and banks’ profitability
suggest that the banking sector may be facing a deeper problem and therefore strengthened
banking supervision is required.
30.
Persistently high NPLs could undermine financial and economic stability. A continuing
deterioration in asset quality could adversely affect banks’ profitability and result in a tightening of
credit to the private sector. This would hurt economic activity at a time when banks are solicited to
support private sector development and economic diversification. The September 2015 follow-up
reserves management TA mission made concrete proposals to bolster central bank reserves
management. The ultimate aim of the proposals is to enhance central bank independence by
increasing its income from reserves. In recent years, low international interest rates have reduced
significantly central bank income from reserves. The proposals are focused on writing an investment
policy, drafting a framework for risk management, implementing a decision-making process for
reserves management, and strengthening institutional capacity through training.
31.
A review of mortgage procedures and conditions is warranted. The authorities should
consider reducing or eliminating the 2 percent tax for the registration of collateral for mortgage
loans and the other 2 percent tax for the release of collateral.
32.
Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed with staff on the need to improve access to
financial services for the majority of the population. They expect that the reformed Caisse populaire
d'Epargne et de Crédit, the main microfinance institution, and ongoing projects such as the
modernization of the credit information and payment systems, would play a key role in promoting
financial inclusion in Djibouti.

OTHER ISSUES
33.
The currency board arrangement has served Djibouti well and should be maintained. It
has helped instill confidence in the economy and improve predictability in managing international
transactions. Given that the currency board precludes exchange rate adjustment, competitiveness
should be pursued by reducing the high cost of utilities—electricity, telecommunications and water
supply—and improving human resource productivity through skills training.
34.
The medium-term outlook for the balance of payments will, among other things,
depend on commodity prices and the performance of the Ethiopian economy. Given the high
dependence on imports of food and fuel, changes in commodity prices could have significant
implications for the balance of payments, household welfare, and government finances. No major
changes are expected to the rents from the military bases, as the current contracts with the main
countries using the bases are valid for the coming years. The demand for port services by Ethiopia,
the principal client, is driven by the performance of the Ethiopian economy
35.
The authorities informed staff that there had not been any changes in Djibouti’s
exchange system and related legal framework since the last Article IV consultation. The
authorities also stated that since Djibouti’s last notification to the Fund pursuant to Decision
No. 144, security concerns had not caused them to impose any exchange measures.

STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
The ongoing debt-financed investment boom will boost economic growth, but also
aggravates Djibouti’s high risk of debt distress, raising concerns for fiscal sustainability. Deep,
wide-ranging reforms are critical to mitigate the risks and ensure the investment boom helps reduce
widespread poverty and creates a large number of jobs for Djibouti nationals.
37.
Public capacity to manage the investment scaling-up requires strengthening. It is
essential to strengthen public capacity to evaluate and monitor investment projects, prioritize
proposed projects based on absorptive capacity and resource constraints, and conduct cost-benefit
analysis before any project is undertaken. Coordination among the government entities involved in
debt management should be improved. Public enterprises that will manage the large investment
projects should be reformed to ensure their commercial viability and reduce contingent liability for
the budget.
38.
A well-defined arrangement for managing the Djibouti-Addis Ababa railway should be
finalized, given that the project is at an advanced stage. The arrangement should include finalizing
the agreement on the company that will manage the railway project between the two countries.
39.
Reducing and managing the growing external debt is an urgent priority. With Djibouti
already at high risk of debt distress, borrowing space is extremely limited. Public and publicly
guaranteed non-concessional borrowing should be limited. Debt service capacity should be

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DJIBOUTI

mainstreamed into the budget process, and the monitoring and management of government
contingent liabilities should be tightened.
40.
Fiscal reform is needed to enhance fiscal sustainability and inclusive growth. Additional
revenues will be needed to ensure the government is able to meet its financial obligations, which
are growing rapidly as a result of the ongoing debt-financed investment boom. Against this
background, a rapid implementation of a comprehensive tax reform on the basis of the
recommendations of the June 2015 Tax Conference is crucial. The goal should be to strive for a
simple and transparent tax regime that reduces tax exemptions and level the playing field between
onshore and offshore companies with the ultimate goal of promoting investment, economic growth,
and job creation.
41.
Staff urges the authorities to accelerate the reform of public enterprises. This reform is
critical as it would improve the financial situation and efficiency of these enterprises, boost their
capacity to manage the large investment projects, and reduce production costs for water and
energy.
42.
Other structural reforms are needed for poverty reduction and job creation. The
reforms should aim to improve the business environment, lower the cost of utilities and improve the
quality of service delivery, and equip Djibouti nationals with the skills needed to take the jobs
created by the investment boom.
43.
Financial stability. Staff exhorts the authorities to swiftly adopt and implement corrective
measures to address the problems of banks in difficulty. Reinforcing banking supervision and
putting in place appropriate bank resolution mechanisms would enhance the central bank ability to
address financial vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the central bank should also take the necessary
measures to strengthen its income position, based on the recommendations made by Fund
technical assistance, to improve its financial position and safeguard its independence.
44.
Access to financial services remains low in Djibouti despite the expansion of the
banking system. The establishment of the envisaged guarantee fund and a sustained development
of microfinance, together with the development of financial infrastructure and use of innovative
technology such as mobile banking, would foster financial inclusion.
45.
The currency board arrangement has served Djibouti well and should be maintained at
an unchanged parity, despite indications of real exchange rate overvaluation. It has helped
instill confidence in the economy and improve predictability in managing international transactions.
Competitiveness should be pursued by reducing the high cost of utilities and improving human
resource productivity through skills training.
46.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Djibouti be held on the
standard 12-month consultation cycle.

Appendix I. External Sector Assessment for Djibouti
The currency board arrangement should be maintained because it has helped instill confidence in
the economy and improve predictability in managing international transactions. There is some
empirical evidence of real exchange rate overvaluation. However, Djibouti’s imports of mainly basic
food and fuel products and exports of mainly port services are unlikely to be sensitive to real exchange
rate changes. External competitiveness should therefore be pursued by reducing the high cost of
utilities and improving the regulatory environment for business.
Assessing Djibouti’s current account is challenging because the economy has been
undergoing rapid change. The economy’s fundamentals are therefore likely to be changing. In
particular, the ongoing investment boom period represents an episode of exceptionally high
imports and investment. Djibouti’s current account deficit has been rising steadily from 13.7 percent
of GDP in 2011 to 25.6 percent in 2014. It is projected to peak at 31.4 percent in 2015, and then fall
to 14.9 percent in 2019. The large current account deficit is driven mainly by capital goods imports
associated with the mega investment projects. These have been financed directly by the associated
project loans.
Estimates based on the External Balance Assessment (EBA)-lite methodology suggest that the
real exchange rate is overvalued. The EBA-lite comprises three methods. The first two methods—
the EBA-lite CA and REER—provide regression-based estimates of current account and real effective
exchange rate norms and gaps for countries. Norms are the estimated levels of the current account
or (real effective exchange rate) based on underlying fundamentals. Gaps are the deviation of the
current account (or real

of GDP) expected to prevail in the medium term to the current account balance that would stabilize
the NFA/GDP ratio at a specified benchmark. The EBA-lite REER and external sustainability approach
suggest that the real effective exchange rate is overvalued by 39 percent and 45 percent
respectively. Data limitations preclude the application of the EBA-lite current account method to
Djibouti.
Staff’s view is that the sensitivity of the current account to real exchange rate fluctuations is
likely to be low. Domestic production of food or manufactured goods in Djibouti is minimal,
leaving the country highly dependent on imports: Fuel is entirely imported, and over 90 percent of
food consumed domestically is imported. The main sources of foreign exchange have little or no

Limited export diversification highlights the importance of maintaining adequate reserves to
cope with potential large scale shocks. Staff’s analysis, based on the reserve adequacy
methodology that accounts for costs and benefits of holding reserves, indicates that the optimal
level of reserves for Djibouti averages about 2.2 months of imports at end-2015. The analysis
assumes a cost of holding reserves of 6.15 percent which is consistent with the marginal product of
capital for Djibouti. This result appears to imply that the reserve coverage in Djibouti is above the
optimal level. However, under the currency board arrangement, Djibouti must maintain at least
100 percent reserve cover, which is equivalent to three months of imports.
The medium-term outlook for the balance of payments will depend on commodity prices and
the performance of the Ethiopian economy. Given the high dependence on imports of food and
fuel, changes in commodity prices could have significant implications for the balance of payments,
household welfare, and government finances—in the case of fuel which was subsidized until the
recent decline in international prices. China has already paid $20 million as rent for its military base
for 2015.No other major changes are expected to the rents from the military bases, as the current
contracts with the main countries using the bases are valid for the coming years. The demand for
port services by Ethiopia, the principal client, is driven by the performance of the Ethiopia economy

Appendix II. The Railway and Water Pipeline Projects
The railway project
The railway project involves the construction of a 756 km railway line, stretching from Addis Ababa,
the capital of Ethiopia, to Doraleh port in Djibouti. The Djibouti segment of the railway line costs
$550 million, for which a loan of about $492 million was contracted from EXIM Bank of China. The
Djibouti government will provide the remaining $58 million mainly from revenues from a partial
privatization of a state-owned port in 2013. Ethiopia is financing its own segment of the railway line.
Construction of the railway line is currently at an advanced stage and a trial run has already being
staged. The Djibouti authorities expect the railway to be operational in 2016. However, certain key
questions remain unanswered. First, the institutional arrangements for managing the project are yet
to be determined. Second, the source of energy that will be used to power the railway, and its
financing, remain unclear. Third, the arrangement for acquiring and paying for the locomotive to run
the train and the cars that will be used to transport goods and passengers, also remain unclear.
The authorities expect the project to reduce travel time, create jobs, and generate revenue through
increased port traffic; and transform Djibouti into the main port for landlocked South Sudan’s
imports and oil exports via Ethiopia. Staff view is that for the potential benefits to be realized, the
project should be well managed with a well-defined institutional arrangement for revenue sharing
with Ethiopia. Staff does not have the necessary data to quantify the possible positive
macroeconomic impact of the project.

The water pipeline projects
The project involves the construction of a pipeline between Djibouti and Ethiopia to permit the
importation of 100,000 cubic meters of water a day free of charge from Ethiopia. The total cost of
the project is $340 million for which a loan of about $322 million has been obtained from EXIM Bank
of China. The Djibouti government will provide the additional financing of 18 million. The current
daily demand for water in Djibouti-ville, the capital city, which is home to about 60 percent of the
national population, is estimated at 80,000 cubic meters a day. Information on the demand for the
entire country is unavailable. The current supply of water is estimated at 36,000 cubic meters a day.
Much of the current supply comes from underground sources which are of poor quality and are
being depleted. Water from other sources suitable for domestic use is virtually nonexistent. The daily
demand for Djibouti-ville is projected at 114,500 cubic meters in 2020 and 144,000 cubic meters in
2030. An estimated 50 percent of water supply is lost due to the dilapidated state of the distribution
network. A long delayed €46 million desalination project is expected to be initiated in 2015 and
completed by end-2017.
Staff believes that the water pipeline will generate large social benefits by reducing or eliminating
the shortfall in the demand for water remains a potential source of political unrest. The pipeline
could also induce investment that has been deterred by insufficient water supply. However,
politically difficult decisions will need to be taken for the project to operate on a sound financial
footing, and take over the servicing of the investment loan: water tariff increases and requiring

non-state actors—especially foreign military bases located in the country—to source water from
Djibouti’s state-owned water company instead of generating their own water supply. Furthermore,
the terms and institutional arrangements for accessing the water reserve will need to be clarified
with Ethiopia. Lastly, the state-owned water company that will take over the operation of the
pipeline and the servicing of the loan requires restructuring.

Safeguards assessment
The most recent safeguards assessment of the Banque Centrale de Djibouti (BCD) was completed in
2012. The assessment found that safeguards risks remained elevated. The main weakness related to:
fundamental gaps in governance and oversight arrangements; the absence of an internal audit
function; persistent non-compliance with statutory requirements; and limited transparency in the
financial reporting practices. Monitoring efforts since the assessment have been difficult and limited
progress has been made in addressing priority recommendations. The audited financial statements
for the last two years have not been shared with IMF staff nor published on the BCD website.
Further, the 2014 management letter on internal controls issued by the external auditors has not
been received by staff. Providing IMF staff with this information and timely publication of annual
financial statements is required under the safeguards policy.
Exchange arrangements
Djibouti has a currency board arrangement. The Djibouti franc is pegged to the U.S. dollar at the
rate of DF 177.721 = US$1. Djibouti is an Article VIII member and maintains an exchange system that
is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions.

Article IV consultation
The staff report for the 2014 Article IV consultation (IMF Country Report 15/338) was discussed by
the Executive Board on January 30, 2015.

FSAP participation
The FSAP, including the assessment of the AML-CFT framework, was approved by the Board in
June 2009. Key findings were (i) the banking sector does not appear to pose an immediate systemic
threat, but it is vulnerable to a deterioration of credit quality and interest rate movements; (ii) the
CBD’s regulatory and supervisory framework is rudimentary and not well-suited to handle the entry
of new banks; (iii) the CBD should introduce a reserve requirement and bolster its capacity to
provide emergency liquidity support, (iv) the CBD should, in cooperation with the banking
community, develop a comprehensive modernization strategy for the national payments system that
responds to the needs of the growing economy; (v) the assessment of AML/CFT noted
a combination of weak capacity to address ML/FT and multiple vulnerability factors. The CBD has
started to implement some of these recommendations. It has adopted measures to strengthen
banking supervision and regulation, including onsite and offsite bank inspections. Furthermore, the
CBD has reinforced prudential measures by increasing the minimum capital requirements and
reducing the single-borrower limit.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
General: Data provided to the Fund are broadly adequate for surveillance. There are, however, serious
shortcomings especially in the areas of national accounts and the balance of payments (BOP), and to
a lesser extent in the areas of external debt, and recently in fiscal data. Djibouti began participating
in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) in February 2012.
National accounts: The authorities do not compile national accounts data, mostly due to low
implementation capacity. An initiative has been launched to compile national accounts data. In the
first phase, GDP estimates have been generated for 2008–12. In the second phase, a system of
national accounts will be established. A population census was completed in 2009, followed by a
poverty survey in 2012–13. A poverty profile was subsequently developed. A budget-consumption
survey has been undertaken which should lead to the revision of the CPI basket weights from
January 2016.

DJIBOUTI

External sector: Substantial progress has been made in improving balance of payments statistics in
line with recommendations made by Fund’s TA missions over the past few years. However,
significant issues remain, which were highlighted by a June 2007 BOP mission. Problems were
identified in compiling trade statistics, coverage of direct investment transactions in the BOP, and
estimating workers’ remittances. Improvements could also be made to several items such as freight
transportation, investment income, transactions related to foreign military bases, and other
investment of private sector (use of IBS data). Despite the introduction of a new system for the
management of external debt in 2002, debt statistics continue to be provided irregularly and with a
delay. A technical assistance mission on external sector BOP has visited Djibouti in November 2011
to assist the authorities in improving the compilation of BOP and IIP statistics and in preparing an
effective transition from BPM5 to BPM6.
Government finance: Fiscal data are available on a monthly basis although with a substantial delay
(2 month lag). Moreover, these data do not cover a number of extra-budgetary accounts, including
three pension funds. Foreign-financed capital expenditure is reported regularly. Moreover,
additional efforts are needed to improve the compilation and coverage of fiscal data, particularly at
the institutional level, in order to fulfill the recommendations made by a government finance
statistics mission in 2001. The MOF is reporting neither annual data for dissemination in the GFS
Yearbook nor high-frequency data for publication in the International Finance Statistics (IFS). To
improve data collection and reporting, a macroeconomic unit has been set up in the MOF.
Monetary accounts: Monetary statistics are generally adequate and cover the central bank and the
aggregated balance sheet of all commercial banks. Djibouti received a monetary and financial
statistics TA missions in July 2015 on compiling monetary and financial statistics in accordance with
the Fund’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). Over this period, the CBD has
implemented some of the recommendations, in particular those concerning the establishment of a
sectorization of the economic entities of Djibouti. The remaining recommendations have not been
implemented mainly because of staffing constraints at the CBD.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By
Daniela Gressani and
Dhaneshwar Ghura (IMF)
and John Panzer (IDA)

Prepared by the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association

The current DSA Update confirms the high risk of external debt distress assigned by the
2014 DSA exercise. Acute solvency and liquidity risks are due to recently contracted and
expected external borrowing to fund public investment projects. Baseline projections of all
solvency indicators are significantly above the policy-dependent thresholds for the majority
of the projection period. Liquidity ratios also breach their thresholds in the medium term,
as debt servicing for investments come due.1
External debt ratios are most sensitive to a combined shock to GDP growth and non-debt
creating flows and to the tightening of the financing terms. Given its stability under the
currency board, the depreciation of the franc vis-à-vis the US dollar represents a tail risk
event. However, bilateral movement of the US dollar vis-à-vis other major currencies
composing Djibouti’s external debt (Kuwait dinar, euro and renminbi) could contribute to
sizeable valuation effects. Going forward, these valuation effects are expected to be
mitigated by the growing share of US dollar denominated debt. Tighter financing
conditions pose a risk to debt sustainability, given the significant share of debt with
variable interest rate and potential need for debt roll-over in the medium run.
Overall, the analysis suggests extremely limited scope for additional borrowing. Any
borrowing leading to additional service costs over the medium term should be avoided. The
authorities should adjust their fiscal strategy to reduce and manage the external debt
burden, including strengthening the coordination among government entities in charge of
contracting external debt.

1

Djibouti is classified as a ‘weak’ performer based on the average CPIA score in 2012–14 of 3.08. Indicative
thresholds for debt burden indicators are set at 30 percent for the present value (PV) of PPG external debt-toGDP ratio, 100 percent for the PV of PPG external debt-to-exports ratio, and 200 percent for the PV of PPG
external debt-to revenue ratio. Liquidity thresholds are 15 percent and 18 percent for the for the debt serviceto-exports and debt service-to-revenue ratios, respectively.

DJIBOUTI

BACKGROUND
1.
Total public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt increased to 60.5 percent by the end
of 2014, from 58.1 percent the year before. The increase has come from higher external
borrowing by the government to finance large public expenditures, mainly related to ongoing
infrastructure investments. While external public debt increased by US$65 million and its ratio to GDP
reached 52.5 percent by end-2014, domestic debt continued to contract, falling to 8 percent of GDP.
2.
The pace of debt accumulation is expected to accelerate further in the next three years
driven by large disbursements under existing and new external loans. In 2013 the government
contracted two large loans to finance the building of the Addis Ababa—Djibouti railway and a water
pipeline from Ethiopia for the amount of US$860 million. In the 2013–18 period, loan disbursements
are expected to reach a cumulative US$1.5-1.6 billion. The average grant element of new public
sector borrowing is expected to be around 9 percent in 2015, mainly on the account of nonconcessional terms on the railway loan.2 Once the disbursement of the railway project ends in 2016,
the grant element of new borrowing will pick up to 28 percent temporarily. By 2025, the grant
element is projected to gradually decline to 12 percent in line with the assumption of tightening
financial conditions for Djibouti in the longer-term.3

Under the assumption that the 6 month LIBOR rates will gradually increase to 3.85 percent by 2019, as

We assume a gradually increasing debt rollover starting from 2018 reaching US$280 bn by 2030, or 4 percent
of GDP and 10 percent of outstanding debt. Main bilateral creditors, in particular China (accounting for
50 percent of Djibouti’s total debt service in 2030), should allow debt rollover in the form new investment
projects. The interest rate on this new debt is projected at 4 percent.

3.
The major scale-up of infrastructure investments will contribute to a rapid
accumulation of external PPG debt and an elevated debt service burden in the coming years.
The external PPG debt-to-GDP ratio will peak at 80 percent in 2017, with the amount of external PPG
debt doubling from its 2013 level. As a result, debt service will increase to an annual US$200 million
after 2020, reaching 6 percent of GDP.
4.
Disbursements under the new loans also increase the share of US dollar in total
external debt. In 2013, approximately one-third of Djibouti’s external debt was denominated in US
dollar, followed by the Kuwait dinar (23 percent) and the euro (19 percent). Disbursements related to
the Ethiopia railway project increased the US dollar share to 41 percent in 2014. Together with the
Ethiopia water pipeline project, this share is expected to reach 60 percent in 2017, and remain above
50 percent through 2025. Under the currency board, a larger share of US dollar-denominated debt
would lower valuation effects associated with movements in the US dollar exchange rate.

As of August 2015, the stock of arrears (excluding technical arrears)4 on PPG external
debt declined to US$3 million (about 0.2 percent of GDP), from US$4.7 million at end-2014. By
February 2015, Djibouti cleared all its arrears to the Paris Club creditors according to the agreed
schedule. As regards the remaining arrears, the outstanding arrears to the Saudi Fund of US$2.1
million are expected to be repaid from the GCC grant secured in December 2013.

4

Djibouti’s technical arrears to Iran and India amounted to US$ 15.6 million. While the Djiboutian authorities
are engaged in discussions to facilitate the clearance of these arrears, so far no clear timeline has been set.

MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS
6.
The sharp increase of public investment is expected to accelerate economic
performance starting from 2014, but also to widen the fiscal and current account deficits in
the near term.


GDP growth is projected at 6.5 percent in 2015, and is expected to accelerate to 7 percent
in the medium term on the back of massive investments in port facilities, railways and
energy. We assume GDP growth to stabilize at 6 percent in the long term.



The current account gap is projected to exceed 25 percent of GDP in 2015 due to large
capital goods imports. The current account will stabilize below 15 percent from 2017
onwards. The non-interest current account deficit is projected at 11 percent in the longrun.



Net FDI inflow, mainly driven by the development of port-related activities, are projected
to fluctuate around 10 percent of GDP per annum, almost fully covering the non-interest
current account deficit beyond 2020.



Consumer price inflation is anticipated to accelerate to 3.5 percent till 2018, and stabilize at
3 percent in the longer run.



Effective interest rates on external debt are projected to remain around 2.5 percent in
2015-18. In line with the assumption of gradual tightening of financing conditions the cost
of external financing is expected to pick up in the long run reaching 3.9 percent by 2035.
We assume a variable LIBOR rate that would increase to 3.85 percent by 2019. In the
current DSA update the grant element of new public borrowings will jump from 10 percent
to close to 30 percent as the disbursement of the variable-rate railway loan ends and the
grant element is projected to gradually decline to 12 percent by 2025 in line with the
assumption of tightening financial conditions for Djibouti in the longer-term.

EXTERNAL DSA
7.
Under the baseline, total nominal public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt is
projected to reach 79.4 percent of GDP in 2017 with the present value of the debt-to-GDP
ratio peaking at 69 percent over the medium term.5 Similar to the previous DSA exercise, all
solvency indicators (the present value (PV) of external debt-to-GDP ratio, the PV debt-to-exports
ratio and PV of debt-to-revenues ratio) remain above the respective thresholds for the entire
5

Given limited information on private external debt stocks and flows simplified assumptions are made about
the evolution of the private external debt. These projected flows, together with capital grants, are behind the
negative residuals in the summary of the drivers of net changes in external debt.

projection period (Figure 1). This indicates the presence of significant solvency risks. The respective
thresholds of the debt service ratios are breached temporarily. During 2020-2030, the debt service
will amount to almost one-fifth of export revenues or one-quarter of fiscal revenues, implying also
high liquidity risks in the longer term.
8.
The updated DSA shows that an exchange rate depreciation and the combined shocks
are likely to have the most significant effect on debt ratios. The bound tests indicate that a onetime 30 percent nominal depreciation in 2015 would raise the PV of the external debt-to-GDP ratio
close to 100 percent and lead to prolonged breaches of the relative threshold. Combined shock may
push the PV of external debt -to-GDP ratio close to 80 percent for at least a few years.
9.
However, given the Djibouti franc’s exceptional stability under the currency board
(DF/USD exchange rate has been unchanged at 177.721 since 1973), the DSA exchange rate
stress scenario could be considered as a tail risk event. At the same time, the bilateral movement
of the US dollar exchange rate vis-à-vis other major currencies composing Djibouti’s debt (most
importantly the Kuwait dinar, euro and renminbi) could contribute to a sizeable variation in the value
of outstanding debt. Going forward, valuation effects are expected to be mitigated by the gradually
increasing share of US dollar denominated debt, which is expected to reach 60 percent in 2017, and
remain above 50 percent till 2025.
10.
The shock to new public sector financing on less favorable terms (200 basis points on
all new financing in 2015-2035) could be used as a proxy for the potential effect of higher
than expected floating rate on the railway loan in the medium term. Given that interests paid on
the railway project will account for 40 percent of total interest payments in the next five years, the
impact of tighter financing conditions would have a sizeable impact on external debt. Under this
shock the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio increases to 74 percent in 2017.

PUBLIC DSA
11.
The dynamics of the total public debt reflect the high share of external obligations as
domestic debt remains small (Table 2). Overall public debt is projected to increase from 60 percent
of GDP in 2014 to 83 percent in 2016 and remains well above the 38 percent benchmark for the next
10 years. Simulations under the baseline scenario show significantly lower debt levels as compared to
fixed primary balance and historical scenarios, which could be explained by (i) projected acceleration
of economic growth in the medium term; as well as (ii) expected improvement in the fiscal position
due to the unwinding of large public infrastructure projects, which is not captured by these
alternative scenarios. According to the stress tests, public debt indicators are most vulnerable to
exchange rate shock: a one-time 30 percent depreciation in 2014 leads to major increase in all key
ratios and has the most significant impact on debt service-to-revenue ratio.

DJIBOUTI

CONCLUSION
12.
Djibouti remains at a high risk of debt distress and both solvency and liquidity risks
increased significantly since the previous DSA. There are significant and protracted breaches of
thresholds for all the solvency ratios, i.e. the present values of the external debt-to-GDP, debt-toexports and debt-to-revenue ratios, under the baseline scenario. The DSA also indicates that Djibouti
will face liquidity pressures in the near future. Solvency and debt service indicators are sensitive to
most standardized stress tests, including the combined shock to GDP growth and non-debt creating
flows and to the higher cost of financing.
13.
The debt sustainability analysis suggests that the fiscal space is extremely limited.
Policy advice would be to minimize issuance of government debt guarantees and encourage private
participation in financing of investment projects. Projects should be run on a commercial basis so
that they can be profitable and generate the revenues needed to service their debt. Any PPG
borrowing that could lead to additional debt service costs over the medium term should be limited.
The authorities should develop a strategy to reduce and manage the external debt burden, including
strengthening the coordination among government entities in charge of contracting external debt.6
Deepening of domestic debt markets would also help to alleviate risks associated with the high level
of external indebtness.
14.
The authorities acknowledge the high risk attached to the current financing strategy.
They pointed out, however, that the investment projects are critical for Djibouti’s development and
that their strategy will be viable if it generates growth and crowds in sufficient FDI. The authorities are
therefore of the view that, in the absence of other financing options, external borrowing to finance
the projects is justified. They also acknowledged the need to strengthen public capacity to manage
the investment scaling-up, and underscored the importance of technical assistance to this end.

6

The World Bank and UNCTAD have provided training to the authorities in recent years on developing a
medium-term debt management strategy, focusing on capacity building and on the quantification of costs
and risks of alternative borrowing strategies, to lead eventually to a structured approach to future borrowing.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.
