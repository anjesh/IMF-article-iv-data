STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION,
FIFTH REVIEWS UNDER THE EXTENDED ARRANGEMENT
AND UNDER THE THREE-YEAR ARRANGEMENT UNDER
THE EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY, AND REQUESTS FOR
WAIVERS FOR NON-OBSERVANCE AND MODIFICATION OF
PERFORMANCE CRITERIA

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Context, outlook, and risks. After the 2009 crisis, policies have improved markedly,
backed by substantial foreign assistance. Notably, fiscal adjustment has reduced the
large budget imbalance, monetary policy has tamed inflation, and structural reforms
have spurred strong export expansion. These reforms led to impressive growth
in 2010–11, but activity decelerated in 2012, reflecting the slowdown in the EU. The
economy is highly exposed to further intensification of the euro area crisis via its
dependence on remittances, exports, and capital inflows.
Key challenges and policies. (i) Reach and maintain fiscal sustainability: the authorities
and staff agreed on measures to achieve the programmed fiscal adjustment by
end-2012 and maintain a sustainable position in the medium term; (ii) Stabilize inflation
near target: the current stance, which mitigates the demand slowdown, is consistent
with the central bank’s inflation target; (iii) Strengthen financial and external stability:
the authorities are applying remedial measures to the troubled state-controlled bank
and building up international reserves to cushion potential external shocks; (iv) Foster
investment- and export-oriented growth: structural reforms will continue to focus on
boosting competitiveness and improving the investment climate.
Program implementation. Most performance criteria (PCs), indicative targets, and
structural benchmarks for end-March were met. However, the PC on the budget deficit,
the indicative target on budget expenditure arrears, and the structural benchmark on
debt restructuring were missed. The authorities are requesting a waiver for nonobservance of the missed PC and modification of three end-September PCs owing to
macroeconomic updates.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.

After a severe recession in 2009, Moldova’s economy grew at an impressive pace

in 2010–11, supported by a strong reform program and a favorable external environment
(Figure 1, Table 1, Box 1). The cumulative 14 percent expansion was driven by buoyant private
demand, financed by external inflows and domestic credit, and booming exports, promoted by trade
liberalization, greater access to foreign markets, and new investment. The current account deficit
widened to 12.6 percent of GDP by end-2011, as the surging domestic demand drove up imports,
which eclipse exports in size. Core inflation stayed close to 5 percent, while rising food and energy
prices pushed headline inflation up to high single digits (Figure 3). The unemployment rate declined
to about 6¼ percent by end-2011, below its long-term average.
Box 1. Implementation of Past Fund Policy Recommendations
Macroeconomic policies and structural reforms have been mostly in line with the Fund’s
recommendations since the 2010 Article IV consultation, with four reviews completed so far under
the ECF/EFF-supported program. In particular, the fiscal adjustment needed to restore sustainability,
the appropriate monetary stance to keep inflation under control while supporting the recovery from
the 2009 recession, and structural reforms to enhance macroeconomic and financial stability and
promote export-led growth have generally been implemented, albeit the reduction of the large
energy sector arrears––a fiscal risk––remains work in progress. Political considerations and vested
interests have at times caused policy slippages and delayed implementation of structural reforms,
but these were generally addressed by appropriate corrective measures. Data provision is adequate
for surveillance, and Moldova subscribes to the SDDS (Informational Annex, section III).
2.

Economic activity slowed markedly in early 2012, reflecting the weakening external

environment and harsh weather conditions. Industrial production in the first quarter declined
from a year ago, while export growth to the EU dwindled. Domestic demand also subsided in line
with weakening remittances and capital inflows. As a result, GDP growth slowed to 1 percent y-o-y
in Q1 2012. Inflation decelerated rapidly to 4 percent in July, also due to declining food prices earlier
in the year. On the other hand, wages and credit growth remained resilient, and seasonally adjusted
unemployment declined further to 5¾ percent. Some manufacturing companies reported shortages
of skilled labor.
3.

The political situation has stabilized after the election of a President in March 2012,

but competition within the ruling coalition remains a risk to the reform agenda. The next
parliamentary elections are due in early 2015, providing a window of opportunity for implementing
much-needed structural reforms. However, economic policies remain susceptible to pressures from

PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAM
4.

The program is broadly on track, with corrective measures agreed to address some

slippages (SMEFP Tables 2 and 3). Most quantitative targets for end-March 2012 and relevant
structural benchmarks have been met. In particular, the Cabinet approved a mechanism to bring
commitments on agricultural subsidies in line with available funds, and Parliament has passed with a
slight delay legal amendments to continue the education sector reform. However, revenue shortfalls
caused the performance criterion on the budget deficit for end-March 2012 to be missed by
0.2 percent of GDP; the indicative target on government arrears for end-March was missed as well,
reflecting persisting problems in heating bill payments by the municipal administration of Chişinău;
and the structural benchmark on the long-overdue parliamentary passage of legal amendments to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

facilitate debt restructuring and speed up execution of collateral on bank loans was not met. Staff
and the authorities agreed on corrective measures to overcome these policy slippages.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
5.

The economy is expected to pick up in the near term. GDP is projected to grow by

3 percent in 2012, as the impact from the slowdown in the EU is partially offset by resilient
conditions in the CIS and the effect of the harsh winter on growth in Q1 dissipates. Growth should
recover further in 2013 and beyond, underpinned by strengthening in partner country activity,
investment in infrastructure, and increase in total factor productivity, albeit dampened by perennial
labor migration abroad. In the absence of new shocks, inflation would be anchored around the
National Bank of Moldova’s (NBM) target of 5 percent, but it could hug the lower limit of the target
band in the short run as energy prices are falling and the output gap turns negative (text table on p.
11). The authorities broadly concurred with this outlook, although the NBM expected downward
pressures on inflation, from both demand and supply factors, to persist into 2013.
6.

However, external factors pose serious downside risks (see Risk Assessment Matrix

below). Strong intensification of the euro area crisis would significantly depress growth mainly
through its impact on remittances, exports, and capital inflows, while delays in donor support could
open large balance of payments gaps. The financial sector is not directly exposed owing to modest
holdings of foreign assets and liabilities. Should an adverse scenario materialize, policies would need
to balance between immediate stabilization needs, demand support, and medium-term objectives
(Box 2).

Box 2. Spillovers from Adverse External Shocks and Policy Response
Strong intensification of the euro zone crisis could trigger a 2009-like recession in Moldova.1
Such a shock would affect Moldova’s very open economy mainly via a decline in the large
remittances, exports, and private external funding, suppressing domestic demand and GDP growth.
Trade and remittances from the commodity-exporting CIS economies, especially Russia, could
dampen the shock if commodity price levels are sustained. Direct spillover effects through financial
channels would be limited—the potential losses in foreign assets or outflows of foreign funding are
small relative to total assets and liquidity, capital, and foreign exchange buffers for the banking
sector as a whole. The decline in external inflows could heavily pressure the exchange rate, while
dwindling revenue would strain the fiscal position. Rising nonperforming loans, a bank credit crunch,
and a spike in lending interest rates would further plague the economy.
Under such an adverse scenario, facilitating an orderly exchange rate adjustment and
stabilizing the financial sector should receive immediate policy priority. Exchange rate policy
would need to balance the need for external adjustment on one hand with the risk of destabilizing
balance sheets and inflation on the other. To this end, NBM’s policy instruments—foreign exchange
intervention, reserve requirements, and swap operations—should be geared toward allowing an
orderly adjustment of the exchange rate while preventing its overshooting. Monetary and financial
sector policies should ensure sufficient liquidity and depositor confidence in the banking sector,
using interest rate, reserve requirements, liquidity loans to banks, and—if needed—strengthening of
deposit insurance.
Next, policy should focus on managing demand and public finances to stabilize the economy
without losing sight of medium-term objectives. As fiscal space is limited by financing
constraints, fiscal policy should let the automatic stabilizers work while maintaining the targeted
expenditure envelope supported by structural reforms. The budgeted significant expansion of public
investment would underpin growth and employment. Given the shallow domestic debt market,
some additional official resources may be needed to finance the resulting higher deficit. Monetary
policy could quickly ease in anticipation of the fall in inflation, while allowing substantial exchange
rate flexibility subject to the stability constraints outlined above. Enhanced bank supervision may
also be necessary, with early calls for raising bank capital should loan losses begin to overwhelm the
banks’ currently robust capital base.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
7.

In the short term, the main tasks for macroeconomic policies are to: (a) reach fiscal

sustainability in 2012 as planned; (b) calibrate monetary policy to stabilize inflation near target by
mitigating the slowdown in demand; (c) preserve financial stability; and (d) strengthen buffers
against external risks in view of the volatile international environment. In the medium term, the
challenge will be to consolidate fiscal sustainability as official assistance will diminish, continue the
transition to a market-based economy, and tap new sources of investment- and export-led growth.

A. Reaching and Sustaining Fiscal Sustainability
8.

Restoring fiscal sustainability this year—a key program goal—is within reach.

Procyclical policies prior to the global crisis opened up a substantial structural fiscal gap, covered
since 2009 by very large official support (Box 3). A key objective of the authorities’ IMF-supported
program is to restore fiscal sustainability by end-2012, defined as a return to a structural balance
that could be financed without recourse to exceptionally high official assistance. To this end, the
authorities have already brought the structural deficit excluding grants down from 7½ percent of
GDP in 2009 to 4¾ percent in 2011 with the support of comprehensive tax policy and expenditure
reforms without harming GDP growth. Further reforms aimed to bring this indicator to about
3½ percent of GDP in 2012, a level that could be sustained under the current level of official
assistance.
9.

However, revenue shortfalls and policy slippages in early 2012 put the programmed

adjustment at risk. Revenue in Q1 came significantly lower than expected, partly reflecting the
weaker economy, and partly due to legislative
loopholes and collection problems in VAT and
excises as well as tax deferrals granted to
agricultural producers. In addition, unbudgeted
commitments, including a delay in social assistance
reforms, and deferred external grants have
compromised the budget (SMEFP ¶7). Furthermore,
the Chişinău municipality approved a budget with
nearly double the originally planned deficit and
accumulated––rather than repaying––sizable
expenditure arrears. Together with the unfavorable impact of macroeconomic developments, these
slippages would have added 1.9 percent of GDP to the deficit in 2012 and about 1.3 percent of GDP
thereafter in the absence of corrective measures (table).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

10.

Discussions with the authorities focused on the challenge to complete the fiscal

adjustment without undermining growth in a slowing economy. The authorities reiterated their
commitment to the program’s fiscal adjustment objective and recognized the need to take
corrective measures. At the same time they viewed the cyclical slowdown, the disruption caused by
the introduction of new tax policies in 2012, and tax/customs administration issues at the origin of
the revenue underperformance. They also underlined the imperative for the new spending
commitments and the impracticality of fully halting spending related to the delayed grants. Staff
recognized the impact of cyclical factors and the need for some upfront spending on grantsupported projects, but emphasized the need not to lose sight of the objective to reach fiscal
sustainability in 2012, reinforced by the limited available financing.

Procyclical tax cuts and spending hikes prior to the global crisis opened up a large structural fiscal
gap by 2009, necessitating official financial assistance amounting to 13-14 percent of general

government expenditure. In 2010, the

and gradually raising public investment to
support growth. Nevertheless, the 2012
budget still relies on a substantial level of
0

external assistance, which is expected to
decline in the medium term (chart).
Going forward, three structural reforms are key for preserving fiscal sustainability in view of
declining official assistance while meeting the authorities’ public spending objectives. Reform
of the pension system that allows indexation of past earnings with inflation is necessary to stop the
sharp drop of the replacement rates and address old-age poverty. This reform needs to be
accompanied by an increase in the retirement age for women to make the increase in benefits
affordable. Public administration reform aimed at reducing the large number of municipalities would
lower operational costs and improve public service delivery by generating synergies. The expansion
of the ongoing education reform in general education to the whole sector, in close cooperation with
the World Bank, would improve quality and generate fiscal savings—even after recent reforms, the
oversized education sector still accounts for over 8 percent of GDP, significantly above the levels in
peer countries. These reforms could generate potential savings of about 2-3 percent of GDP.

The authorities’ amended 2012 budget puts the programmed fiscal consolidation back

on track, while accommodating cyclical revenue weakness and supporting important reforms.
The authorities and staff agreed on a three-pronged fiscal strategy to reach a structural deficit
broadly consistent with the program objectives without disrupting growth (SMEFP ¶7, 8):


Allowing full play of automatic stabilizers in response to the cyclical downturn, reflected in an
upward revision of the headline deficit target;



Putting in place a package of non-distortionary revenue measures, mostly focusing on closing
loopholes in the VAT and car registration regimes, higher license fees on gambling, and
increased efforts to combat tax evasion;



Preserving the budgeted expenditure envelope by retaining essential development expenditure
associated with delayed external grants, cancelling the planned wage increases for public
dignitaries, and overcoming delays in the social assistance reform to benefit from the already
planned savings.

Moreover, the Chişinău municipality has committed to amend its budget in line with the general
government fiscal target by adjusting current expenditure down, raising additional revenue to cover
new investment spending, and clearing its heating arrears by end-August 2012.

Preserving fiscal sustainability despite declining foreign assistance is the main

medium-term challenge (Box 3). The authorities appropriately plan to maintain the headline fiscal
deficit close to 1 percent of GDP over the medium term––a level that is consistent with regularly
available financing––thus reducing the structural deficit excluding grants at roughly the pace of
decline in grants (SMEFP ¶9). To this end, further rationalization of current expenditure and
strengthening of tax revenue to the tune of 1¾ and ½ percent of GDP respectively will be needed
to maintain space for capital outlays and targeted social assistance. The authorities broadly agreed
with staff that the measures should include closure of VAT loopholes, reforms of the pension system
to strengthen its insurance role while preserving its financial sustainability, and expansion of the
education sector reform in close cooperation with the World Bank (SMEFP ¶9, 10). Staff welcomed
the authorities’ plan to introduce a rule-based approach to budgeting in the context of a mediumterm budget framework to enhance fiscal discipline and transparency. However, recent sizable legal
claims for compensation from the state for past judicial errors represent a fiscal risk. The claims,
which are being currently reviewed by the authorities, could drain substantial budget resources in
the medium term, and, if they materialize, would necessitate additional effort on the revenue side.

B. Stabilizing Inflation and Developing the Inflation Targeting Framework
13.

The NBM’s aggressive easing of monetary policy was appropriate in view of rapidly

falling inflation and moderating activity. After some tightening in mid-2011, the NBM reversed
course and ratcheted down the base rate by 550 basis points between November 2011 and
February 2012. The authorities’ sharp reaction was motivated by the plummeting inflation outlook
(some 350 bps between August 2011 and February 2012) and the weak response of commercial
bank lending rates (chart below).
14.

Staff and the NBM agreed that a

35

Credit (12-mth flow, pct of GDP)

pause is warranted to assess the impact of
the monetary easing and the latest
economic developments. In staff’s view, the
current monetary stance appeared consistent
with the NBM’s 5 percent target in the
absence of further shocks. The authorities
saw significant risks that inflation would fall
well below its target over the policy-relevant

horizon. Hence they were disposed to relax
monetary policy further. However, they concurred that the enacted policy easing is still making its
way through the financial system—lending rates had inched down only slightly so far, banks held

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

large amounts of liquidity in reserve, while credit extension was holding steady (Table 4). It was
therefore agreed to refrain from further monetary policy action unless the downside risks to the
economic outlook materialize or demand-driven inflation pressures re-emerge.
15.

The conduct of monetary policy would benefit from improved communication with

the public and better calibration of responses to the nature of the shocks. Inflation targeting in
Moldova has contributed to reducing the rate and volatility of inflation since early 2010. That said,
monetary policy remains complicated by a relatively weak transmission mechanism and volatile food
and energy prices which make up nearly half of the CPI basket. The NBM has had at times to
respond aggressively to energy and food price shocks to anchor inflation expectations and
strengthen its reputation as an inflation targeter. However, to avoid excessive policy volatility, more
weight should be given to demand-driven core inflation trends in determining the policy stance and
in communications with the public. In case of supply shocks, staff recommended that the NBM
consider their likely pass-through to core inflation as a guide to adjusting the policy stance. The
NBM noted that they could not disregard persistent movements in headline inflation––the official
monetary policy target––but agreed that assigning higher weight to the outlook for core inflation
could help separate transitory from persistent supply shocks.

C. Preserving Financial Stability
16.

The banking sector is broadly sound, but developments at the majority state-owned

Banca de Economii (BEM) are a concern.

exception of BEM and Universalbank, the overall sound conditions in the banking sector are shared
by individual banks.
17.

Financial deepening has resumed, but action is needed to remove legal impediments.

Since mid-2010, healthy credit growth has resumed and the credit to GDP ratio has been slowly
rising (Table 4). While remaining mindful of credit’s effects on inflation and the current account
deficit, the authorities and staff concurred that credit growth can exceed nominal GDP growth by a
few percentage points to facilitate steady convergence toward credit’s estimated equilibrium level of
80-85 percent of GDP from 38 percent at end-2011. However, financial deepening is impeded by
significant legal constraints on the banks’ ability to restructure their NPLs out of court and execute
the associated collateral. The authorities have painstakingly prepared, with Fund TA, a
comprehensive package of legal amendments to address these problems. Staff welcomed the
authorities’ plan to swiftly implement this long-overdue reform (SMEFP ¶15).
18.

The serious situation at BEM needs to be promptly addressed. Risky lending practices

and poor governance have significantly weakened BEM’s asset portfolio and necessitated a large
increase in provisions, bringing its capital adequacy ratio below the statutory minimum. Conflicts
between shareholders, lack of coordination between regulatory institutions, and controversial
judicial decisions have permitted the problem to fester. The bank, which accounts for about
13 percent of total assets in the banking sector and holds the largest number of individual deposits,
requires urgent measures to repair its balance sheet and improve risk management. Drawing from
MCM TA work, staff recommended decisive strengthening of the bank’s management, including risk
management capacity to ensure sound lending practices and continuing close oversight by the NBM
(SMEFP ¶13). Subsequently, the newly elected Board of Directors has replaced the bank’s
management and is preparing further measures, including sales of foreclosed collateral, loan
restructuring, and––after all other avenues are explored––possible recapitalization, to rehabilitate
the bank. Staff encouraged the authorities to seek minimization of the cost to the public purse.
19.

The events at BEM and previous legally dubious takeover attempts of Moldovan banks

call for improving the judicial system and achieving greater transparency of bank ownership.
The authorities agreed that a speedy passage of the prepared (with assistance from LEG) legal
amendments to facilitate disclosure of bank owners, to introduce fit and proper criteria for financial
institutions’ directors and senior management and a more effective sanctioning regime, together
with swift judicial reform, are essential to mitigate similar problems in the future. (SMEFP ¶14).

D. Strengthening Buffers Against External Risks
20.

The real effective exchange rate (REER) is moderately overvalued (Box 5). Abundant

capital inflows have pushed the REER up by 16 percent since early 2010, leading to an estimated
overvaluation in the 5-15 percent range. The authorities and staff concurred that this does not pose
an immediate threat to external competitiveness––Moldova’s export market share has been rising
since mid-2010––and should gradually correct itself under the floating exchange rate regime.
21.

However, despite an improved business climate, the current account deficit is

expected to decline very gradually, remaining above its long-term equilibrium in the next few
years. The persistently large deficit reflects the availability of substantial external private and official
funds supporting investment well in excess of the low savings. The deficit is projected to narrow
gradually to about 9½ percent of GDP by 2017 and to its estimated equilibrium level of 6 percent in
the long run, owing to greater access to the EU market spurred by the forthcoming free trade
agreement, new export capacity, and higher public savings.
22.

The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) suggests continued low risk of public debt

distress, but vulnerabilities are on the rise (Appendix I). Public and publicly-guaranteed debt
decreased from 31 percent of GDP in 2009 to 28 percent in 2011 and is projected to continue
declining. However, private external debt remains high at about 44 percent of GDP, and is projected
to increase over the medium-term, with a rising share of short-term debt. Also, arrears of the
breakaway region of Transnistria to Moldovagaz for the natural gas from Russia supplied by
Gazprom continue to increase, surpassing US$3.1 billion.3
23.

In view of the large current account deficit and external risks, further reserve

accumulation is warranted. Given risks of sudden stops in capital inflows, staff recommended
keeping reserves over 85 percent of short-term debt for the time being (Box 4). The NBM concurred
that a build-up of reserves is warranted in the current environment, but were concerned that large
market purchases could hurt the credibility of the inflation targeting regime and destabilize the
exchange rate in case of weaker foreign exchange inflows. To minimize these risks, they decided to
accumulate reserves slowly, mopping up excess supply at the market exchange rate and noting that
financial deepening should reduce reliance on external short-term debt––and thus the need to
accumulate reserves––in the medium term.

The survey updates methodology each year and recalculates
the previous year ranking. The table shows new/old ranking.

Wide-ranging structural reforms implemented in 2010–11 have boosted Moldova’s
competitiveness and improved the business climate. Moldova advanced from rank 99 to 81 in
the World Bank’s “Doing Business” survey in 2011/12 and came second in its list of top reformers for
the year, albeit its ranking has only slightly improved according to the “Global Competitiveness
Index”. The accumulated stock of FDI equaled about half the country’s GDP in 2011, surpassing
many other economies in the region.
Further institutional reforms are necessary to attract new investments. The surveys suggest that
policy instability, corruption, hindered access to finance, difficulties in trading across borders, and
weak investment protection have become the most important hurdles to investment and growth.

A build-up of foreign reserves is warranted.
Reserves seem adequate based on the Fund’s composite measures, and they covered about
85 percent of short-term debt at remaining maturity at end-2011. However, the coverage is
projected to decrease rapidly over the medium-term without further action. Other measures which
look at the effects of shocks on the economy also suggest presently a less-than-optimal level to
withstand external shocks. Given the large share of trade credit in external debt and the presence of
recurrent arrears for energy imports, maintaining at least 85 percent coverage of short-term debt
would be needed to support external stability.

E. Raising Potential Growth, Fighting Poverty, and Reducing Fiscal Risks
24.

Far-reaching reforms have boosted competitiveness and tapped new growth sources.

Moldova’s main strategic tasks are to complete the transition to a market economy and accelerate
real convergence to average Eastern European income levels. For this purpose, a second,
investment- and export-led engine of growth is needed to supplement the traditional remittancesdriven demand channel. Since late 2009, Moldova has embarked on deep and wide-ranging reforms
in taxation, civil service, education, pension and social assistance, energy sector, external trade, and
business regulation. These reforms have boosted Moldova’s competitiveness, helping to attract new
investment to agriculture and manufacturing, which sustained cumulative export growth of over
50 percent in 2010–11 (Table 2).
25.

However, staff and the authorities agreed that important remaining hurdles to

investment need to be lifted. Better protection of property rights, a transparent and stable policy
environment, and more efficient trade and investment regime are essential to attract investors.
Steady implementation of the judicial and customs reforms is a priority to improve the business
climate and raise potential growth and incomes. Experience in other countries suggests that
concerted reform efforts in these areas can be effective in attracting FDI and raising living standards
within a few years (Selected Issues, Chapter II).
26.

The authorities plan to reduce the state’s presence in the economy further. Despite

employment concerns, privatization is often necessary to lower prices, improve service, and ensure
the financial viability of companies. In this context, staff welcomed the authorities’ plan to expand
the list of medium size companies subject to privatization, while actively pursuing divestiture of key
large companies, including the telecommunications operator Moldtelecom, the carrier Air Moldova,
and BEM (SMEFP ¶18).
27.

Poverty indicators have improved considerably in 2010–11. Rationalization of low-

priority budget spending opened space for an increase in targeted social assistance, allowing the
guaranteed minimum income to vulnerable households to rise by 21 percent in 2010–11. Despite
the 2009 recession, about half of the localized Millennium Development Goals for 2010 have been
reached (Table 8). The new National Development Strategy elaborated for 2012–20 aims to reduce
the poverty rate to less than 15 percent through faster growth and expanded coverage under the
targeted social assistance scheme (SMEFP ¶19-20).
28.

More efforts are needed to advance energy sector restructuring and reduce fiscal risks.

Noting mixed progress with firming payment discipline so far, including in Chişinău’s municipal

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

administration, staff welcomed the authorities’ plan to improve collections and strengthen
compliance with the established payment mechanism to prevent accumulation of future arrears
(SMEFP ¶17). Moreover, staff advised the authorities to implement the energy sector restructuring
strategy designed with the assistance of the World Bank that would reduce technological losses and
help resolve historic arrears (over 2 percent of GDP), which present a large fiscal risk.

PROGRAM ISSUES
29.

The program design and monitoring mechanism will remain broadly unchanged. The

review schedule and phasing of disbursements is outlined in SMEFP Table 1. The prior actions and
structural conditionality are summarized in SMEFP Table 3. To ensure that the program’s fiscal
objectives for 2012 will be reached, the 2012 budgets of the general government and the
municipality of Chişinău will be amended as prior actions (PAs). Moreover, to secure sufficient
revenue consistent with reaching and maintaining fiscal sustainability, PAs are set on the
parliamentary passage of legal amendments to tighten the car registration regime and to close VAT
loopholes, measures of critical importance to support the ongoing fiscal adjustment. The longoverdue parliamentary passage of legal amendments to facilitate debt restructuring between banks
and their debtors––crucial for financial development and twice-missed structural benchmark––is also
a PA. A new structural benchmark is proposed for the government approval of the medium-term
budget framework to support fiscal sustainability over the medium term. In response to changes in
the macroeconomic framework and to reflect the higher pace of reserve accumulation the
authorities are requesting modifications of the PCs on the budget deficit and the NBM’s net
international reserves and net domestic assets for September 2012. The related indicative targets
and adjustors for September and December 2012 are revised accordingly (SMEFP Table 2).

STAFF APPRAISAL
30.

Moldova enjoyed vigorous economic growth in 2010–11, supported by appropriate

macroeconomic policies and structural reforms. Implementation of the ECF/EFF-supported
program over that period has been strong.
31.

The economy is slowing down in 2012 due to weakening external conditions, with

serious downside risks. GDP is expected to grow by 3 percent in 2012, and inflation should settle
close to the NBM target of 5 percent. Economic deterioration in the EU could significantly depress
growth. However, with a lower structural fiscal deficit, improved monetary policy framework, and an
overall sound banking sector, Moldova is in a much better position to withstand shocks than
in 2009.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

32.

The amended 2012 budget puts fiscal consolidation back on track, while

accommodating cyclical effects and supporting important reforms. Strong corrective measures
have been taken to close tax loopholes and offset unbudgeted expenditure commitments that
emerged in early 2012. Continued improvements in tax and customs administration, and reforms in
the key areas of the pension system, education, and public administration will be needed to
maintain fiscal sustainability in the medium term as foreign assistance declines.
33.

The current monetary stance is consistent with the NBM’s inflation target, while the

conduct of monetary policy could be honed further. After the aggressive easing in early 2012,
the financial system has all it currently needs to support credit demand at advantageous interest
rates. Further policy changes could be warranted if the economic outlook deteriorates or demanddriven inflation pressures re-emerge. To avoid unnecessary policy volatility, more weight should be
given to demand-driven core inflation trends relative to supply shocks in determining the policy
stance and in communications with the public.
34.

The external position of the economy gives rise to some concerns. The large current

account deficit, rising short-term private debt, and external risks call for augmentation of the NBM’s
international reserves. The REER is moderately overvalued relative to underlying fundamentals,
although it is expected to self-correct gradually, in light of falling inflation, slowing capital inflows,
and a higher pace of reserve accumulation.
35.

Moldova’s financial system is stable overall, but the deteriorating situation at the

majority state-owned BEM must be promptly addressed. Banks have generally remained liquid,
well-capitalized, and profitable. Swift legislation amendments to facilitate owner disclosure
requirements and introduce fit and proper criteria for bank managers and board members would
further strengthen confidence in the banking system. However, urgent progress is needed to repair
BEM’s balance sheet and improve its risk management. The new management, the Board of
Directors, and the NBM should ensure that BEM cleans up its portfolio, quickly disposes of
foreclosed collateral, and ends its risky lending practices before seeking recapitalization.
36.

The authorities’ efforts to improve the business climate and promote exports have

been productive, but important challenges lie ahead. Wide-ranging structural reforms have
enhanced competitiveness and fostered investment. However, further improvements in several key
areas, including protection of property rights, a transparent and stable policy environment, effective
governance, and a reliable judicial system, are essential to attract investors.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

37.

A decisive energy sector reform should finally commence. The authorities should

persevere with establishing payment discipline among both households and public entities, and
implement their energy sector restructuring strategy to reduce losses and resolve historic arrears.
38.

Staff recommends completion of the fifth reviews and approval of the requests for a

waiver of non-observance of the end-March 2012 PC on the general government budget
deficit and modifications of the end-September 2012 PCs on the general government budget
deficit, the NBM’s net domestic assets, and net international reserves. Program implementation
has been generally good. The authorities maintain the commitment and the capacity to implement
their Fund-supported program. The slippages in early 2012 have been adequately addressed, and
the policies planned for the remainder of 2012 and beyond, including the requested new targets,
support the program’s objectives. The capacity to repay the Fund remains strong.
39.

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Moldova be held in accordance with

the Executive Board decision on consultation cycles.

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS (DSA)—UPDATE
The DSA update indicates that Moldova’s risk of debt distress remains low and overall public sector
debt dynamics are sustainable.1 That said, vulnerabilities have risen since the previous assessment.
1.

The worsening external environment led to a downward shift in key macroeconomic

projections in the near term compared to the previous assessment.2 The slowdown in global
growth, in particular, in the European Union, is expected to affect Moldova’s economy via trade,
remittances, and private capital flow channels, reducing projected GDP growth. However, the
relatively resilient domestic consumption is likely to result in more gradual adjustment in the current
account deficit over the medium term than previously expected.

2.

The debt dynamics are largely in line with previous projections. The public and publicly

guaranteed (PPG) debt stood at 27.8 percent of GDP as of end-2011 compared to 29.4 percent at
end-2010. The decline in the PPG debt-to-GDP ratio came on the back of brisk GDP growth,
relatively stable exchange rate, and restrained borrowing by the central government. Most of the
PPG debt was external and to multilateral creditors. The domestic PPG debt came at 6.8 percent of
GDP at end-2011, declining from 7.4 percent a year ago, as the budget deficit was financed primarily

The DSA update is conducted jointly by World Bank and Fund staffs in line with the Guidance Note on the
Application of the Joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries (January 2010).

from external sources. Over the medium- to long-term, the projections for government borrowing
are broadly unchanged.
3.

While the DSA framework indicates a low risk of public external debt distress, other

indicators suggest that vulnerabilities have risen lately. All external debt indicators remain well
below the thresholds under the standard bound tests and alternative scenarios. The public DSA
suggests that the overall public sector debt dynamics are sustainable unless there is a substantial
and prolonged adverse growth shock. Nevertheless, the authorities––both central and local
governments––should continue to be prudent with their borrowing strategy, given Moldova’s
limited debt-servicing capacity. In addition, a shift in the large private sector external debt
(45 percent of GDP) to shorter maturities, continuing rise in the already large stock of gas payment
arrears by the breakaway region of Transnistria,3 and substantial fiscal risks related to possible claims
on the budget for compensation for judicial errors/inaction pose risks to the debt position.

For an analysis of the impact of Transnistria’s debt on Moldova’s debt vulnerabilities, see IMF Country Report No.

1/ The public debt represents central government direct and guaranteed debt and National Bank of Moldova's borrowing from the IMF on the gross basis.
2/ Gross financing need is defined as the primary deficit plus debt service plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last period.
3/ Revenues excluding grants.
4/ Debt service is defined as the sum of interest and amortization of medium and long-term debt.
5/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

MOLDOVA: LETTER OF INTENT
Chişinău, August 31, 2012
Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street NW
Washington, DC 20431 USA
Dear Ms. Lagarde:
After expanding by 14 percent during 2010–11, the economy is going through a soft patch in 2012,
staunched by the slowdown in Europe. In the first half of the year, foreign and domestic trade,
industrial production, and remittances have decelerated markedly. Nonetheless, absent further
deterioration in the external environment, the economic expansion is set to continue and
macroeconomic stability remains intact, owing to the strengthened fiscal and external positions
achieved in the course of our IMF-supported program and our unwavering commitment to
economic reforms.
The program remains broadly on track despite some setbacks. In particular, weak tax revenue led to
overshooting of the end-March performance criterion on the general government budget deficit by
0.2 percent of GDP. The adoption of legal amendments facilitating debt restructuring in the financial
sector—a structural benchmark for end-March—has been delayed due to protracted public
discussions. And the indicative target on reducing general government expenditure arrears was
missed again by MDL 94 million due to underpayment of district heating bills by the Chişinău
municipality. All other quantitative performance criteria, indicative targets, and structural
benchmarks for end-March were met.
We will put in place urgent measures as prior actions to eliminate these slippages. Specifically, we
have amended the 2012 budget and adopted a package of measures to strengthen revenue and
offset unbudgeted expenditure commitments to meet the revised budget deficit target of
1.3 percent of GDP in 2012. The Chişinău municipality will amend its budget in line with this goal.
Alongside, Parliament has passed the legal amendments reforming the debt restructuring
framework. These measures and continued implementation of reforms in other program areas will
support our broader policy goals of improving the well-being of the population and reducing
poverty by maintaining macroeconomic stability and promoting sustainable growth.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

In consideration of our strong record of program implementation and the corrective actions
proposed below, we request the completion of the fifth reviews of the program supported by the
Extended Credit Facility and the Extended Fund Facility arrangements and the associated
disbursement of SDR 50 million. We request a waiver for non-observance of the end-March
performance criterion on the general government budget deficit. In addition, we request a
modification of the end-September performance criterion on the general government budget deficit
and the National Bank of Moldova’s (NBM) net international reserves and net domestic assets.
Discussions on the sixth program review, assessing performance based on end-September 2012
performance criteria and relevant structural benchmarks, are envisaged for November 2012.
We believe that the policies set forth in the attached Supplementary Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Policies (SMEFP) are adequate to achieve program objectives but will take any additional
measures that may become appropriate for this purpose. We will consult with the IMF on the
adoption of such additional measures in advance of revisions to the policies contained in the SMEFP,
in accordance with the Fund’s policies on such consultation. We will provide the Fund with the
information it requests for monitoring progress during program implementation. We will also
consult the Fund on our economic policies after the expiration of the arrangement, in line with Fund
policies on such consultations, while we have outstanding purchases in the upper credit tranches.
Sincerely yours,

Supplementary Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (SMEFP)

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

SUPPLEMENTARY MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC
AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
August 31, 2012
1.

The present document supplements and updates the Memoranda of Economic and Financial

Policies (MEFPs) signed by the authorities of the Republic of Moldova on January 14, 2010,
June 30, 2010, March 24, 2011, June 27, 2011, and January 12, 2012. It accounts for recent
macroeconomic developments and introduces policy adjustments, as well as additional policies
necessary to achieve the objectives of the program. We remain determined to meeting our
commitments made previously under the program.

I.
2.

Macroeconomic Developments and Outlook

The economy has cooled down in 2012, reflecting weaker external conditions and

adverse weather. In the first half of the year, growth of exports, retail sales, and remittances have
dropped to single digits while the industrial and agricultural production and transport services
declined, in part owing to a cold winter and drought in the summer. With weak activity in the EU
partially counterbalanced by resilient growth in the CIS, real GDP growth is expected at 3 percent
in 2012 before bouncing back next year. However, downside risks persist, stemming from the
uncertain outlook in Europe.
3.

The current account deficit remains elevated but should gradually adjust as reforms

bear fruit. Slowdown of exports and remittances has so far been more pronounced than the
deceleration of domestic demand, maintaining the current account deficit at around 12 percent of
GDP. In the medium term, the deficit should narrow to 9½ percent of GDP on the back of sustained
reform and export promotion efforts, recovery of external demand, and increased access to EU and
CIS markets. Nevertheless, the trend toward appreciation of the real exchange rate should be
monitored carefully.
4.

Inflation declined and is likely to remain low. A cooling economy and relative stability of

food and energy prices have halved the inflation rate since end-2011 to 4 percent in July. Barring
new supply shocks, inflation is expected to remain within the National Bank of Moldova’s (NBM)
target range, stabilized by the recent monetary policy loosening and a gradual recovery of domestic
demand.

5.

The financial sector remains strong although recent decline in asset quality in the

majority state-owned Banca de Economii (BEM) is troubling. Even though the nonperforming
loans (NPL) ratio has increased to 15.3 percent in June 2012—mostly reflecting methodological
changes and the rise in the BEM’s NPLs—the sector remains well capitalized and liquid, and credit
growth net of write-offs stayed healthy at 16 percent. Meanwhile, liquidation of the Universalbank
has proceeded well with most household deposits already paid out. The implementation of remedial
actions prescribed by the NBM to strengthen the BEM’s balance sheet will be important to maintain
stability.

Revised Policy Framework for 2012–13

We are committed to continuing with our reform agenda under the IMF-supported

program to maintain macroeconomic stability and boost the economy’s growth potential. To
this end, our policy efforts will focus on completing the fiscal adjustment, maintaining low and
stable inflation, solidifying financial stability, increasing transparency in the banking system,
strengthening the debt restructuring and contingency planning frameworks, and promoting
structural reforms in education, health care, energy, and privatization, while improving the business
climate.

A. Fiscal Policy
7.

We will adopt policy measures to cap the 2012 budget deficit at 1.3 percent of GDP

and sustain a sound fiscal position in 2013. This target accommodates the impact of a slowing
economy on revenue and allows uninterrupted implementation of important structural reforms,
while remaining consistent with our objective to return to fiscal sustainability, enabling the budget
to finance essential expenditure without exceptional external aid. Weak value added tax (VAT) and
excise revenue and expected delays in grant receipts have opened a projected end-year revenue
shortfall of over MDL 900 million (1 percent of GDP). Furthermore, various recent expenditure
initiatives proposed by both the central government and the Chişinău municipality are worth
MDL 800 million (0.9 percent of GDP). These developments call for compensating measures worth
MDL 1.3 billion (1.5 percent of GDP) to reach the modified deficit target. We plan to fill this gap with
measures strengthening revenue by 0.5 percent of GDP and reducing non-critical expenditure by
1 percent of GDP, and Parliament passed an amended 2012 budget on July 11, 2012 as a prior
action. Moreover, we adopted measures to ensure sustainability of the budget framework and
prevent resurgence of fiscal slippages in 2013. Specifically:

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA



We will streamline the VAT regime and eliminate loopholes this year and beyond: (i) VAT on
agricultural output will be raised from 8 to 20 percent, with the additional proceeds rebated to
producers, as of January 1, 2013; (ii) this rebate will not apply to processed goods; (iii) VAT on
natural gas will be raised from 6 to 8 percent effective January 1, 2013, reducing the number of
VAT rates to facilitate tax administration; (iv) we will amend Article 4 (18) of the Law No. 1417XIII on Enacting Chapter III of the Tax Code with a view to tighten eligibility requirements—
based on a Government-approved list of organizations—for VAT exemption under this article,
effective January 1, 2013. Corresponding legal amendments have been adopted in July 2012 as a
prior action.



The car registration regime has been tightened to prevent avoidance of excises and other
applicable fees, which should raise MDL 125 million in 2012 alone. A temporary suspension of
the 7-year age limit until November 1, 2012 has been provided for the existing stock of cars with
foreign registration owned by Moldovan residents to register in Moldova. For cars older than
7 years, the excise payable upon registration has been raised in proportion to the age of the car
(by 5 percent for each year above seven relative to the existing rate, but capped at 35 percent).
In addition, from 2013 we will raise the age limit on used cars that can be registered in Moldova
from 7 to 10 years, and the excise for cars older than 7 years will be raised in proportion to their
age as well. Corresponding legislative amendments have been passed as a prior action in
July 2012. From November 1, 2012, we will introduce a new road toll system of the vignette type
for cars with foreign registration entering Moldova, with parliamentary passage of the necessary
legislation by October 15, 2012 (structural benchmark).



We have increased license fees for gambling by 60 percent in July 2012. We will also index with
the post-2008 cumulative inflation the license fees for imports and sales of tobacco and alcohol,
as well as for several other activities. These measures are projected to raise budget revenue by
MDL 40 million.



In addition, on June 13, 2012 we adopted a government decision that will pave the way for the
issuance of at least two new telecom licenses providing access to wide frequency bands (4G). This
will bring about MDL 300 million to the budget in 2012.



Budget expenditure will be re-aligned with the revised revenue outlook. In particular, we will
restrain expenditure tied to the delayed grants (by MDL 260 million) and cancel the planned
wage increase for public dignitaries and identify additional wage bill savings (a total of MDL
100 million). These measures will be complemented by other structural reforms, including in
education, social assistance, and health care (a total of MDL 360 million).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA



The Chişinău municipality is going to adopt an amended 2012 budget with a deficit of no more
than MDL 252 million (prior action). The budget will reflect adjusted local taxes and fees to raise
MDL 65 million in 2012 and eliminate heating arrears by end-August 2012.



The recently adopted Law 87 that established fiscal responsibility for judicial errors and delays
has generated large claims. To address this threat to fiscal sustainability, the tax code was
amended in July to assign the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) the responsibility to review the claims for
accuracy and appeal those of them that appear unjustified or exaggerated.

8.

Furthermore, we will intensify our tax and customs administration efforts to safeguard

fiscal revenue. In particular:


The Director of the Customs Service, in consultation with the MoE and MoF, issued an order in late
May 2012 to (i) improve customs clearance procedures to reduce discretion of customs officers
and the time spent by vehicles crossing the border; (ii) authorize access to warehouses based on
economic needs and only for economic agents with good compliance record; (iii) intensify inland control and inspections to monitor the final destination of imported products and reduce
misclassification; and (iv) better monitor free economic zones’ imports, production, exports, reexports, and unjustified buildup of inventories to identify and correct inconsistencies.



Domestic revenue administration will be strengthened along several dimensions. From
July 1, 2012, we have begun expanding the general electronic invoices register to all eligible
businesses and banning the right to VAT credit for invoices not generated through the register.
This will allow real-time monitoring of transactions and immediate corrective actions. Starting
from end-September 2012, we will begin publishing aggregated tax audit results in mass media,
thus raising general public awareness about fraud and sanctions. With the compliance plan for
large taxpayers finalized and the risks identified, the large taxpayers office has placed the 40
riskiest large taxpayers under permanent monitoring since July 1, 2012. We have also extended
the measures envisaged under the compliance program to large taxpayers and businesses in
agricultural products processing from end-August 2012.

9.

Maintaining fiscal sustainability will anchor our medium-term plans. In this context, by

end-September 2012 we will adopt a medium-term budget framework (MTBF) for 2013–15 with a
budget deficit target gradually declining from its 2012 level of 1¼ percent of GDP despite falling
external grants (structural benchmark). This will be achieved mainly by reducing current
expenditure, with the wage bill and spending on goods and services capped at 9½ and 8¾ percent
of GDP respectively, creating space for capital expenditure to remain around 6 percent of GDP in
6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

line with improved implementation capacity. General government revenue relative to GDP will
decline broadly in line with the declining external grants, with strengthening domestic revenue,
notably consumption and real estate taxes, offsetting the projected reduction in nontax revenue. In
this context, VAT loopholes will continue to be closed and excise rates adjusted in line with our EU
integration agenda, while key social and health insurance contribution rates will be maintained at
current levels with the contribution base broadened by eliminating privileges and exemptions.
10.

Meanwhile, we will implement a number of structural reforms underpinning our fiscal

strategy:


A new fiscal responsibility framework will introduce a rule-based approach to budgeting,
enhancing fiscal discipline, and improving transparency. These principles form the cornerstone
of a new law on public finance to be adopted by Parliament by end-September 2012.



In close cooperation with the World Bank, we will continue to implement our education sector
reform. Recent adoption of related legal amendments (¶19 of SMEFP dated March 24, 2011) will
allow the reform to continue with optimization and quality improvement. To preserve safe and
adequate access to education, we will make maintenance of the school bus routes a priority for
the Road Fund in 2012–13.



Alongside, a government decision formalizing wage bill and employment ceilings in the budget
sector has been adopted by end-May 2012.



Raising efficiency of public investment will be critical to promote growth. By endSeptember 2012, in consultation with IMF staff, the government will approve a new mechanism
for allocating capital expenditure based on projects’ viability, economic growth potential, and
capacity for implementation. The new mechanism will be applied starting 2013.



Other structural reforms rationalizing the use of health care will proceed as planned. Specifically,
the mechanism for sick leave benefits will be further improved by: (i) assigning coverage of the
first three days of sick leave by the employers from July 1, 2012; (ii) extending the coverage by
the employers to five days from 2013.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
11.

The NBM’s current monetary policy stance is appropriate in the context of stable

inflation and moderating economic activity. The inflation outlook over the policy-relevant

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

horizon is consistent with the NBM’s target, warranting a pause to assess the impact of the recent
sizable policy easing that is still making its way through the financial system. Further monetary
policy adjustment would be necessary only if the economic outlook deteriorates or demand-driven
inflation pressures re-emerge. In case of supply shocks, the NBM will consider their size and likely
duration before adjusting its policy stance to minimize second-round effects. At the same time, the
high current account deficit and rising external debt, combined with the declining official aid, imply
the need for augmentation of NBM’s foreign exchange reserves. The NBM will seek to accomplish
this objective at times of ample supply of foreign currency on the market and in a manner consistent
with the inflation targeting framework. The revised end-September performance criterion on net
international reserves is consistent with this goal.
12.

Furthermore, by end-2012 we expect to adopt legal amendments to the central bank

law to increase its independence in line with international best practice and enhance the
mechanisms of internal control over NBM’s corporate governance.

C. Financial Sector Policy
13.

Continued deterioration of the financial situation at BEM amid a struggle for control

between shareholders needs to be promptly addressed. In this context:


On June 11, 2012, the MoJ issued an opinion on the legality of recent transactions involving BEM
shares and proposed a strategy to address the uncovered irregularities and prevent their
recurrence in the future.



In late June 2012, the Ministry of Finance and the NBM agreed on a Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) regarding issues of timely information exchange, making the BEM’s newly
elected Board of Directors operational, and improving the bank’s risk management.



The government, as a representative of the majority shareholder, will take decisive actions to
strengthen BEM’s management capacity and lending practices and bring the bank’s capital back
to the minimum required level.



The NBM will continue to monitor closely the implementation of the remedial measures
imposed on BEM and will share with IMF staff a progress report on the bank’s financial condition
by end-September 2012.

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA



Meanwhile, we will continue to work on a strategy to prepare the bank for privatization in due
course.

14.

In parallel, we will move swiftly to improve the transparency of our banking system.

Recent legal disputes over ownership in several banks were enabled by nontransparent ownership in
banks which creates risks of money laundering, tax evasion, and reputational concerns for the entire
banking system. To this end, by end-May 2012 the NBM—in consultation with IMF staff—will finalize
and submit to the government draft legal amendments seeking to ensure full transparency and
disclosure of ultimate controllers in banks. We plan to secure Parliamentary adoption by endJune 2012 (existing structural benchmark). The new requirements will be applied to existing
shareholders with a limited transition period. In this context, we will explore the possibility of
(i) lowering the shareholding threshold in bank ownership above which fit and proper examination is
required and (ii) prohibiting any transfer of bank shares without prior approval of the NBM.
15.

The long-overdue measures strengthening the debt restructuring framework were

adopted in July. The legal amendments to enhance the speed and predictability of collateral
execution by banks and strengthen their incentives and ability to restructure nonperforming loans
(¶15 of SMEFP of June 30, 2010) were passed by Parliament in July 2012 (prior action). Alongside,
Parliament also passed a law revising the insolvency framework. We are working to finalize the
contingency planning framework (¶16-18 of SMEFP dated March 24, 2011).
16.

We will continue to improve the financial sector supervision and regulation

framework. To this end, the Financial Stability Committee (FSC) will establish a subcommittee to
examine technical financial sector issues and propose decisions to the FSC. The subcommittee will
be chaired by the Ministry of Finance with the NBM performing the secretariat function. Moreover,
the NBM and the NCFM, as well as other FSC members, will ensure proper information exchange
and coordination, as per the MoU signed in 2011.

D. Structural Reforms
17.

We will continue to strive for timely payment of current bills in the energy sector. With

a renewed commitment to eliminate arrears to the heating sector by the Chişinău municipality (¶7),
we will aim to have all bills from the previous heating season settled before end-October 2012. To
this effect, the existing Memorandum of Understanding on repayment of arrears in the energy
sector signed by the Chişinău municipality and the main companies of the sector was amended on

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

August 8, 2012 to strengthen incentives for compliance with the agreed payment schedule,
including execution of court orders to recover arrears and penalties. In this context, the Chişinău
municipality will deposit in an escrow account half of its receipts from taxes shared with the central
government (about MDL 25 million per month); money from this account can only be used to repay
the municipality’s arrears to Termocom. Furthermore, the Chişinău municipality, as the main
shareholder in Termocom, will continue to prohibit Termocom from contracting new bank loans.
Alongside, we will continue to work closely with the World Bank on restructuring the energy sector.
18.

We will keep up our efforts to reduce the state’s presence in the economy. A

Government decision expanding the list of companies subject to inclusion in regular privatization
auctions by 59 names was adopted in July 2012. In 2012 we aim to launch the privatization of 60
companies and other public assets, as well as initiate 15 public-private partnerships. Owing to the
delay in the privatization advisory work at Moldtelecom, the Ministry of Economy will propose a
roadmap for introducing private participation in the company and implementing accompanying
sector reforms by end-September 2012. In the context of our accession to the common aviation
space with the EU, we are in the process of incorporating Air Moldova amid continuing search for
potential investors.
19.

We are committed to completing the transition to the system of targeted means-

tested social assistance this year. To this end, we have abolished the existing system of categorybased (nominative) compensations. Moreover, by end-October 2012, we will revise the eligibility
criteria (proxies) for Ajutor Social—in close cooperation with the World Bank—to improve targeting
and coverage within the funds available for social assistance in the approved 2012 budget (MDL
766 million). In parallel, we will speed up our efforts to expand enrollment. Finally, the Ministry of
Labor and Social Protection in cooperation with the World Bank is expected to complete its analysis
and approve an action plan to put other benefits and social payments on a means-tested basis by
end-2012.
20.

To boost economic growth and promote poverty reduction, we have adopted a new

medium-term National Development Strategy (2012–20). The new strategy—based on input
from government institutions and development partners—was adopted by Parliament in July 2012.
It outlines seven priority areas for reforms and development: education, access to financing, road
infrastructure, business regulation, energy efficiency, justice system, and social insurance. We

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

understand that having an approved strategy in place is a necessary condition for the completion of
the last review of the IMF-supported program.

E. Program Monitoring
21.

The program will be monitored through semi-annual reviews, prior actions,

quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets, and structural benchmarks. The
phasing of purchases under the arrangement and the review schedule are set out in Table 1 of this
memorandum. The list of the quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets remains as set
in ¶2 of the Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) dated January 12, 2012. We are
requesting a waiver for the missed performance criterion on the overall cash deficit of the general
government for end-March 2012 on the basis of our proposed corrective actions. We are also
requesting modifications of the performance criteria for the overall cash deficit of the general
government and the NBM’s net international reserves (NIR) and net domestic assets (NDA) for
end-September 2012, to reflect changes in the macroeconomic outlook for 2012 (Table 2). The prior
actions for completion of the fifth review, along with existing and proposed new structural
benchmarks are listed in Table 3.

Safeguards Assessments:

Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the National Bank of Moldova (NBM) is subject to
an assessment with respect to the ECF/EFF arrangements approved on January 29, 2010. The
assessment completed on June 3, 2010 updated the findings of the 2006 safeguards assessment. It
concluded that recommendations of the 2006 safeguards assessment have been implemented. The

2

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

updated safeguards assessment provided a set of recommendations focused on mitigating new
risks and further strengthening the NBM safeguards framework.
VIII.

Exchange Arrangements:

Moldova has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4, of the Fund’s Articles of
Agreement. Its exchange system remains free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current
international transactions.
Moldova’s exchange rate regime is classified as “floating”. The NBM intervenes in the domestic
foreign exchange interbank market in order to smooth out sharp exchange rate fluctuations of the
Moldovan leu against the dollar. At the same time, the NBM interventions are not aimed at
changing the trend of the exchange rate determined by the market. The NBM publishes the
information on its interventions.
The official exchange rate of the Moldovan leu to the U.S. dollar announced by the NBM is
determined as the weighted average of daily noncash market transactions performed on the
interbank and intrabank market. The NBM quotes exchange rates of the leu for other currencies on
the basis of the leu-U.S. dollar rate and the cross-rate between the U.S. dollar and these currencies.

Article IV Consultations:

The previous Article IV consultation was concluded on July 16, 2010 (Country Report No. 10/234).

ANNEX II: MOLDOVA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD
BANK GROUP
(As of June 18, 2012)

A. The World Bank Group Strategy
1.

The Moldova Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY09–12 (extended to FY13) was

prepared during a time of political and economic uncertainty. The CPS aims at assisting the country
in improving competitiveness and laying the foundations for inclusive economic growth. The Bank
worked closely with the Government and other development partners in support of two pillars of
the National Development Strategy (NDS) 2008–11: (i) enhancing economic competitiveness; and
(ii) developing human resources, enhancing employment, and promoting social inclusion. To
effectively support these two pillars, the Bank’s strategy included a third pillar and crosscutting
priority: (iii) improving governance and addressing corruption, including improved public sector
efficiency and effectiveness. The choice of pillars has been guided by the Government’s own
development strategy, client perspectives, the lessons learned from the previous CAS, and the Bank
understanding of Moldova’s development challenges. These priorities also remain relevant in the
context of the recently developed National Development Strategy—Moldova 2020. The CPS
envisaged annual commitments of approximately US$45–50 million (depending on IDA’s
performance-based allocation system), and the IDA-15 lending envelope of US$161 million,
including an additional US$ 20 million received in FY11, which has been fully committed for existing
projects.
2.

The Bank Group’s program of support for Moldova capitalizes on those areas where the

Bank has a comparative advantage for optimal impact and it tries to be strategic in its engagement,
not only in terms of where to direct IDA resources but also in terms of how to best leverage its own
internal partnerships. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) complements IDA’s efforts in
private sector development by focusing in particular on the financial sector, SMEs, agribusiness,
healthcare and infrastructure modernization. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)
currently has two active projects in Moldova.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 5

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

B. IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
3.

IDA’s partnership with the IMF in Moldova’s development strategy has been strong over the

past few years. The Bank, together with the IMF and other development partners, prepared Policy
Notes on key economic and social challenges to address the impact of the crisis. The Notes were
instrumental in the preparation of the Economic Stabilization and Recovery Program for 2009–11.
Bank and IMF staff have executed joint work and have continued to carry out joint missions at least
twice a year for macroeconomic policy dialogue with the Government. The IMF is taking the lead on
macroeconomic issues, while IDA takes the lead on structural and social issues. In a number of areas
where the mandates of the two institutions overlap, such as public finance, the work is being closely
coordinated to ensure that consistent advice is provided to the authorities. The existence of an IMF
program has been an important input for the determination of the adequacy of the macroeconomic
policy framework.

Areas in which the World Bank leads
4.

The Bank’s dialogue by the end of this CPS has stressed the importance of improving the

competitiveness and thereby increase the volume of Moldovan exports, especially in EU markets.
Our budget support operation seeks to reduce administrative burden of business regulation; reduce
non-tariff barriers to trade; gradual harmonization of product standards with the EU standards;
improved legal framework for insolvency, reduce overlap inspections; fewer anti-competitive
practices; increased competitiveness of Moldovan agro-food export products; more competition in
telecommunications sector; reduced cost of and increased access to credit for credit worthy SMEs;
greater use of remittances in financial intermediation and development of capital markets. In
addition to budgetary support, the World Bank scaled up financing to a series of existing and
successful operations in order to mitigate the impact of the economic downturn and help a speedier
recovery.
5.

In the social and health areas, the Moldova Social Investment Fund 2 (MSIF2) was scaled up

to prepare a public works program, which provided job opportunities to the unemployed, while also
building desperately needed community infrastructure. Also, during the economic crisis, the Global
Food Crisis Response helped to protect and improve the health and nutritional status of vulnerable
populations. This was achieved through interventions to decrease the nutritional vulnerability of
pregnant women, lactating mothers and young children, and provision of temporary cash transfers

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

to social institutions for the elderly, children and people with mental and physical disabilities.
Additional financing was provided to the Health Services and Social Assistance Project to improve
the efficiency and viability of the primary health sector. The Strengthening Social Safety Net
results-based operation will seek to improve the efficiency and equity of social assistance through a
fiscally sustainable expansion and strengthening of the targeted Ajutor Social Program.
6.

In education, the ongoing Quality Education in Rural Areas Project (ending in FY13)

supports the Government's education program to enhance the quality of teaching and learning,
increase access and equity, improve the efficiency in public spending for education, and strengthen
education planning and monitoring. A new Education Reform Project, currently under preparation,
will provide much-needed support to important reform efforts intended to increase the efficiency of
the general education sector, while simultaneously improving the quality and relevance of education
to meet the demands of the modern economy. The Bank’s support will also address the potential
risks of such reforms, including of increased drop outs and marginalization of minority groups or the
poorest, through a monitoring and evaluation scheme that tracks students to gauge the impact of
reforms.
7.

In the area of competitiveness, additional financing was added to the Competitiveness

Enhancement Project (CEP) to facilitate the growth of an export-oriented real sector with: (i) a line of
credit through qualified commercial banks to support investment and working capital needs of
exporting enterprises; and (ii) expanded matching grant scheme to assist enterprises with upgrading
their labor skills and management practices, and introducing new products.
8.

In the area of rural and agricultural development, the Rural Investment and Services

Project 2 (RISP2) was scaled up primarily to add financing to the existing and well-performing line of
credit to rural entrepreneurs for farm and off-farm activities. Access to credit is an important
constraint to economic activity in Moldova and the situation has worsened due to the global crisis.
The RISP2 line of credit helped mitigate the impact of the crisis. The recently approved Agricultural
Competitiveness Project is set to enhance the competitiveness of the agro-food sector by supporting
the modernization of the food safety management system, facilitating market access for farmers,
and mainstreaming agro-environmental and sustainable land management practices.
9.

In public sector management, the World Bank manages a multi-donor Trust Fund to

support the Government’s efforts to reform the Central Public Administration. The Bank also

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 7

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

supports the development of the Government’s Public Financial Management System through a new
information system, as well as technical assistance in support of internal controls and audit.
10.

With regard to infrastructure development, the Bank is concentrating on upgrading basic

utility services impacting the population at large and the poor in particular. The recently completed
Energy 2 Project was scaled up to provide heating systems to public institutions, reduce losses in
electricity transmission and distribution networks. The National Water Supply and Sanitation Project
is aimed at: (i) improving the coverage, quality, efficiency, and sustainability of water and sanitation
services in selected urban and rural communities; and (ii) enhancing the capacity of Ministry for
Construction and Territorial Development (MCTD) to prepare and supervise the implementation of
investment program and to provide technical assistance to the operating Apa Canals. The
Bank-financed Governance E-Transformation Project is looking at opportunities to use ICT as a tool
for improving governance and tackling corruption.
11.

During this CPS period a number of interventions have helped address climate change

vulnerabilities by reducing environmental degradation, specifically soil conservation, community
forestry development, pollutant management, emissions reduction, and agricultural
pollution-related activities. With the recently completed Energy 2 Project and follow-up Energy
Efficiency TA, the Bank will help Moldova increase its energy efficiency. Water resources
management and adaptation to increasing water shortages and an increasing risk of flooding is
likely to be a key issue in the long run to mitigate climate risks. The Disaster and Climate Risk
Management Project will help address this through improved hydro-meteorological services and
preparedness.

Areas of shared responsibility
12.

Macroeconomic development. The Bank’s team cooperates closely with the IMF in the

process of implementation of the 2011 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM). The Bank and the
IMF jointly prepared a high level retreat in October 2009 to discuss current economic situation and
the best options of crisis response with the whole cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Moldova.
These eventually led to new financing programs of both institutions concluded with the government
and a very successful Consultative Group meeting of Development partners held on March 24, 2010
in Brussels. Development partners expressed their strong support for the Government’s strategies
elaborated based on the consultations with the IMF and the WB and indicated financial support

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

totaling US$2.6 billion over the next four years, of which 30 percent was in budgetary and balance of
payments support. The dialogue between the IMF, WB and the key government officials on the
drivers of economic growth and growth strategy of Moldova in general was continued during the
last IMF mission on May 3–17, 2012.
13.

Public expenditure management. The Bank is going to support the dialogue between the

IMF and the Government on the 2012 budget. In this context, a policy note was prepared by the
World Bank Staff that analyzes capital public expenditures and its management in more detail and
provided some advice on how capital investment management can be improved.
14.

Debt management. The Joint IMF/WB team provided to the Ministry of Finance of Moldova

technical assistance on the Medium-Term Debt Strategy drafted in October 2009. The follow-up
technical assistance mission of Bank and Fund teams with the aim of preparing a Debt Management
Reform Plan visited Moldova in May–June 2011. Currently, authorities are implementing their reform
plan based on the WB/IMF team advice.

ANNEX III: MOLDOVA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of August 23, 2012)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General:
Economic and financial data provided to the Fund are generally adequate for surveillance and
program monitoring. Over the last several years, with technical assistance from the Fund the
authorities have improved statistics in several areas, including national accounts, fiscal and
monetary data, consumer prices, external trade and balance of payments.
National Accounts:
National accounts statistics are prepared by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) according to
the 1993 SNA methodology. Estimates do not include the Transnistria region for which data have
not been collected since 1991. GDP is estimated from the production and the expenditure sides,
annually and quarterly. The data are prepared in current and constant (previous year) prices, and
annual data are revised—in two stages—as updated information becomes available. However,
the quarterly data often remain unadjusted, thus limiting their consistency with the revised
annual data.
Price statistics:
The NBS publishes monthly data on CPI and PPI and began publications of the core CPI
from 2010. The weights of the CPI basket are subject to annual review and adjustment in line
with the shifts in consumer basket.
Government finance statistics:
Government finance statistics are compiled on cash basis, in broad compliance with the
recommendations of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 1986 (GFSM 1986). With the
support of Fund TA, the authorities are working on introducing accrual-based fiscal accounting
and implementing the GFSM 2001 from 2013. Full implementation of the GFSM 2001 can take
several years and requires significant strengthening of the detailed balance sheet breakdowns
and underlying accounting systems.
Monetary statistics:
Monetary and financial statistics are broadly in line with international statistical standards and of
a generally good quality. The NBM compiles and submits monetary data using Standardized
Report Forms (SRFs). Monetary data are reported by the NBM on a regular basis and are being
published in the IFS Supplement.
External sector statistics:
The compilation methodology follows the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual.
Besides the balance of payments statistics, Moldova disseminates quarterly international
investment position and external debt statistics. Data on international reserves and foreign
currency liquidity are disseminated monthly.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Moldova subscribed to the SDDS in May 2006. A data ROSC report was published in
Participation in the GDDS began in
March 2006.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 1, 2012

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Moldova
On September 28, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Moldova and endorsed the staff
appraisal without a meeting.1
Background
Moldova’s economy grew by an impressive 14 percent cumulatively in 2010–11, spurred by
booming exports and domestic demand, recovering external inflows, and improved policies.
Since January 2010, the authorities’ efforts to restore fiscal, external, and financial
sustainability and promote growth were supported by two arrangements with the IMF: the
Extended Credit Facility and the Extended Fund Facility, amounting in total to SDR 369.6
million (US$562.5 million at present). Five reviews have been completed so far, releasing
SDR 320 million to support the balance of payments.
Economic activity slowed markedly in early 2012 due to weakening external conditions and
harsh weather conditions, driving real GDP growth down to 0.8 percent in H1 2012 relative
to a year ago. The slowdown was reflected in dwindling exports to the EU and domestic
demand in line with weakening remittances. The economy is expected to pick up in the
second half of the year, supported by resilient conditions in the CIS and investment in
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

infrastructure. However, a severe drought that has hit Moldova over the summer and a
deterioration of conditions in the EU could dampen this outlook. Twelve-month inflation
decelerated to 4.4 percent in August, and is expected to remain anchored around the
National Bank of Moldova (NBM) target of 5 percent during the remainder of 2012
and 2013.
Fiscal consolidation in 2010–11 has been strong, bringing the fiscal deficit down to
2.4 percent of GDP at end-2011. However, revenue shortfalls, due partly to the slowing
economy and partly to increased losses from tax loopholes and collection problems, and
new spending commitments have slowed down fiscal adjustment. The authorities have
implemented corrective measures to safeguard the program’s fiscal consolidation objective
in the context of the fifth program reviews.
Monetary policy was eased aggressively in late 2011 and early 2012 in response to the
rapidly falling inflation, supporting credit growth and thus cushioning the slowing economic
activity.
The banking sector is sound overall. Banks have remained generally liquid, well-capitalized,
and profitable, although their nonperforming loans (NPLs) have risen somewhat as the
economy slowed. The euro area debt crisis has had little direct effect on the financial
system owing to limited links with banks in affected countries. However, risky lending
practices and poor governance have significantly weakened the asset portfolio of the statecontrolled Banca de Economii and necessitated a large increase in provisions. The bank,
which accounts for about 13 percent of total assets in the banking sector, requires urgent
measures to repair its balance sheet.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2012 Article IV consultation with the Republic of Moldova, Executive
Directors endorsed staff’s appraisal, as follows:
Moldova enjoyed vigorous economic growth in 2010–11, supported by appropriate
macroeconomic policies and structural reforms. Implementation of the ECF/EFF-supported
program over that period has been strong.
The economy is slowing down in 2012 due to weakening external conditions, with serious
downside risks. GDP is expected to grow by 3 percent in 2012, and inflation should settle
close to the NBM target of 5 percent. Economic deterioration in the EU could significantly
depress growth. However, with a lower structural fiscal deficit, improved monetary policy
framework, and an overall sound banking sector, Moldova is in a much better position to
withstand shocks than in 2009.

3

The amended 2012 budget puts fiscal consolidation back on track, while accommodating
cyclical effects and supporting important reforms. Strong corrective measures have been
taken to close tax loopholes and offset unbudgeted expenditure commitments that
emerged in early 2012. Continued improvements in tax and customs administration, and
reforms in the key areas of the pension system, education, and public administration will be
needed to maintain fiscal sustainability in the medium term as foreign assistance declines.
The current monetary stance is consistent with the NBM’s inflation target, while the conduct
of monetary policy could be honed further. After the aggressive easing in early 2012, the
financial system has all it currently needs to support credit demand at advantageous
interest rates. Further policy changes could be warranted if the economic outlook
deteriorates or demand-driven inflation pressures re-emerge. To avoid unnecessary policy
volatility, more weight should be given to demand-driven core inflation trends relative to
supply shocks in determining the policy stance and in communications with the public.
The external position of the economy gives rise to some concerns. The large current
account deficit, rising short-term private debt, and external risks call for augmentation of the
NBM’s international reserves. The real effective exchange rate is moderately overvalued
relative to underlying fundamentals, although it is expected to self-correct gradually, in light
of falling inflation, slowing capital inflows, and a higher pace of reserve accumulation.
Moldova’s financial system is stable overall, but the deteriorating situation at the majority
state-owned Banca de Economii (BEM) must be promptly addressed. Banks have
generally remained liquid, well-capitalized, and profitable. Swift legislation amendments to
facilitate owner disclosure requirements and introduce fit and proper criteria for bank
managers and board members would further strengthen confidence in the banking system.
However, urgent progress is needed to repair BEM’s balance sheet and improve its risk
management. The new management, the Board of Directors, and the NBM should ensure
that BEM cleans up its portfolio, quickly disposes of foreclosed collateral, and ends its risky
lending practices before seeking recapitalization.
The authorities’ efforts to improve the business climate and promote exports have been
productive, but important challenges lie ahead. Wide-ranging structural reforms have
enhanced competitiveness and fostered investment. However, further improvements in
several key areas, including protection of property rights, a transparent and stable policy
environment, effective governance, and a reliable judicial system, are essential to attract
investors.
A decisive energy sector reform should finally commence. The authorities should persevere
with establishing payment discipline among both households and public entities, and
implement their energy sector restructuring strategy to reduce losses and resolve historic
arrears.

4

Staff recommends completion of the fifth reviews and approval of the requests for a waiver
of non-observance of the end-March 2012 performance criterion (PC) on the general
government budget deficit and modifications of the end-September 2012 PCs on the
general government budget deficit, the NBM’s net domestic assets, and net international
reserves. Program implementation has been generally good. The authorities maintain the
commitment and the capacity to implement their Fund-supported program. The slippages in
early 2012 have been adequately addressed, and the policies planned for the remainder of
2012 and beyond, including the requested new targets, support the program’s objectives.
The capacity to repay the Fund remains strong.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 2, 2012

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Completes Fifth Reviews Under the Extended Credit Facility and
the Extended Fund Facility Arrangements with Moldova, Approves US$77.0 Million in
Disbursements
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on September 28, 2012
completed the fifth reviews of Moldova's economic performance under the Extended Credit
Facility (ECF) and the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangements. The Board's decision
was taken on a lapse of time basis.1
The blended financing arrangements under the ECF and the EFF for an amount equivalent to
SDR 369.6 million (about US$569.4 million) were approved on January 29, 2010 (see Press
Release No. 10/21). The completion of the fifth reviews makes an amount equivalent to SDR
50 million (about US$77.0 million) immediately available for the authorities.
In completing the reviews, the Executive Board approved the authorities’ requests for a
waiver of non-observance of the end-March 2012 PC on the general government budget
deficit and modifications of the end-September 2012 PCs on the general government budget
deficit, the National Bank of Moldova’s (NBM) net domestic assets, and net international
reserves.
Economic activity slowed markedly in early 2012 due to weakening external environment
and harsh weather conditions, driving real GDP growth down to 0.8 percent in H1 2012
relative to a year ago. The slowdown was reflected in dwindling exports to the EU and
domestic demand in line with weakening remittances. The economy is expected to pick up in
the second half of the year, supported by resilient conditions in the CIS and investment in
infrastructure. However, a severe drought that has hit Moldova over the summer and a
deterioration of conditions in the EU could dampen this outlook. Twelve-month inflation
decelerated to 4.4 percent in August, and is expected to remain anchored around the NBM
target of 5 percent during the remainder of 2012 and 2013.

The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse of time procedure when it is agreed by the
Board that a proposal can be considered without convening formal discussions.

2
Fiscal consolidation in 2010–11 has been strong, bringing the fiscal deficit down to 2.4
percent of GDP at end-2011. However, revenue shortfalls, due partly to the slowing
economy and partly to increased losses from tax loopholes and collection problems, and new
spending commitments have slowed down fiscal adjustment. The authorities have
implemented corrective measures to safeguard the program’s fiscal consolidation objective
in the context of the fifth program reviews.
Monetary policy was eased aggressively in late 2011 and early 2012 in response to the
rapidly falling inflation, supporting credit growth and thus cushioning the slowing economic
activity.
The banking sector is sound overall. Banks have remained generally liquid, well-capitalized,
and profitable, although their nonperforming loans (NPLs) have risen somewhat as the
economy slowed. The euro area debt crisis has had little direct effect on the financial system
owing to limited links with banks in affected countries. However, risky lending practices and
poor governance have significantly weakened the asset portfolio of the state-controlled
Banca de Economii and necessitated a large increase in provisions. The bank, which
accounts for about 13 percent of total assets in the banking sector, requires urgent measures
to repair its balance sheet.
