BOLIVIA
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2008 Article IV Consultation with Bolivia
Approved by José Fajgenbaum and Alan MacArthur
December 11, 2008
•

Discussions. Article IV consultation discussions were held in La Paz during September 16–26
and November 3–5 with, among others: finance minister Arce, planning minister Villegas,
central bank presidents Garrón (in September) and Loza (in November), and representatives of
the financial sector. The mission teams comprised Messrs. Furtado (head), Sosa, Valencia, and
Vesperoni (resident representative) (all WHD); Cortavarria-Checkley (MCM); and
Tolosa (SPR).

•

Political setting. Following a protracted period of political tensions, agreement was reached on
holding a national referendum on a new constitution, to be held on January 25, 2009. However,
the political environment remains very complex in light of entrenched regional and social
polarization. If the new constitution is approved as expected, early presidential elections will be
held in December 2009; President Evo Morales will be allowed to run for a new full term
through 2014.

•

Economic setting. The current global crisis will affect Bolivia mainly through declines in
commodity prices given its very limited integration with international capital markets. While
macroeconomic performance has been supported by booming hydrocarbons and mining exports
in recent years, real GDP growth is projected to decline to 4 percent in 2009 and the fiscal and
external current accounts to shift into small deficits as export earnings decline.

•

Key policy recommendations. As inflation remains in the double digits despite a recent
deceleration in food prices, there is a need for a more active monetary policy. To guard against a
further deterioration in the external environment and ensure intergenerational sharing of
hydrocarbons wealth beyond its depletion point, the authorities need to restore a fiscal surplus of
at least 3 percent of GDP over the medium-term. To underpin medium-term growth, steps are
needed to reduce remaining financial sector vulnerabilities and to improve the investment
climate.

•

Fund relations. Bolivia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, sections 2, 3, and 4. The
exchange system is free of restrictions on current international payments and transfers, and there
are no significant controls on capital flows. The last Article IV consultation was concluded on
July 13, 2007. The latest Fund arrangement expired on March 31, 2006.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

In recent years, Bolivia experienced an export boom led by hydrocarbons and
mining. The positive external shock supported an improvement in the growth
performance and a strengthening of the external and fiscal positions, but inflation has
accelerated and investment—despite a recent pickup—has remained low in the context of
persistent political tensions.

•

The current global crisis affects Bolivia mainly through declines in commodity
prices and remittances. Given the adverse external environment, GDP growth will slow
markedly in 2009 while the fiscal and external current accounts would shift into deficits.
At the same time, further reductions in food prices would help lower inflation.

•

The overall fiscal position is projected to shift from a surplus of 3.5 percent of
GDP in 2008 to a deficit of 0.5 percent in 2009. In the event of a further
deterioration in exports and related fiscal revenue, the authorities would implement
cuts in government capital expenditure—where they see scope for streamlining while
preserving critical investments and social spending.

•

A more active monetary policy would help speed up the decline in inflation to the
single digits. The central bank is encouraged to conduct open market operations in a
manner consistent with bringing about higher interest rates on non-indexed bonds, which
are negative in real terms. This would also help eliminate incentives for indexation.

•

While the financial sector appears to be stable and highly liquid, efforts to reduce
vulnerabilities should continue. The staff welcomes plans to fully adopt international
accounting standards and the ongoing efforts to improve risk management practices in
banks. The authorities are encouraged to introduce prudential regulations to mitigate
credit risks from dollarization and market risk.

•

The exchange rate of the Boliviano is broadly appropriate. While standard estimates
suggest a mild overvaluation, and indeed the current account deficit could be significant
in 2009, the outlook points to a subsequent improvement in the external current account.
Looking forward, greater exchange rate flexibility would help absorb possible external
shocks, such as those stemming from adverse movements in commodity prices.

•

For the medium term, the authorities need to target a reduction in the nonhydrocarbons deficit by about 3½ percentage points of GDP. This would reduce
dependency on volatile export-based revenue and lead to greater inter-generational equity
in the use of hydrocarbons wealth. The authorities could consider, in this context, a
gradual reduction of explicit and implicit hydrocarbons subsidies while using part of the
resulting fiscal savings to protect vulnerable groups. In addition, there is scope to further
strengthen Bolivia’s fiscal position through well-designed structural reforms.

•

Improving the investment climate remains a top priority for Bolivia, as its private
investment rate remains significantly below the levels observed in the past decade and
well below the regional average.

4
I. ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SETTING
1.
In recent years, Bolivia experienced an export boom led by the hydrocarbons
and mining sectors, which supported an improvement in the growth performance and a
strengthening of the external and fiscal positions, but inflation accelerated and
investment remained low in the context of persistent political tensions. The rise in export
prices through mid-2008 led to exceptionally high external current account surpluses and
reserve accumulation. Changes in the hydrocarbons taxation regime in 2005-06 further
boosted fiscal revenue, shifting the public sector accounts from deficits into substantial
surpluses. External surpluses fueled demand pressures, which—combined with increases in
food prices—caused inflation to rise to double digits in 2007-08. As part of its policy
response, the central bank gradually allowed the Boliviano to appreciate, which contributed
to a significant reduction in deposit dollarization. However, despite the predominantly
positive trends, the adverse investment climate resulting from political tensions and lingering
uncertainty about property rights has contributed to keep private investment rates among the
lowest in the region.
2.
As Bolivia’s integration with international capital markets is very limited, the
current global crisis affects Bolivia mainly through declines in commodity prices and
remittances. Capital inflows have been negligible for many years, except for FDI in
hydrocarbons and mining, thereby largely insulating Bolivia’s financial system from the
external turmoil. However, current trends in commodity prices will have a major impact on
export receipts and related fiscal revenue—starting in 2009, because of the lagged response
of contractual gas export prices.
3.
Following a protracted period of rising political polarization, tensions have eased
significantly in recent weeks. The tensions revolved around constitutional reform, and in
particular around presidential re-election rules, regional autonomy, and proposed constraints
to the size of private land holdings. The draft constitution passed by the national assembly in
December 2007 was strongly resisted by opposition forces, which until recently impeded
congressional approval of the referendum that is required for the new constitution to take
effect. Following an agreement between the government and the opposition on critical
issues—notably, that the president can be re-elected only once, and that the cap on land size
does not affect existing holdings—such a referendum was finally approved by Congress, and
is now scheduled for January 25, 2009. If the new constitution is approved, early general
elections would be held in December 2009.
4.
While the authorities’ macroeconomic policy actions have been broadly in line in
with past Fund advice, the complex political environment has posed challenges on other
fronts. Regarding macroeconomic policies, a fiscal surplus has been maintained and greater
flexibility has been exercised in exchange rate policy in the face of strong appreciating
pressures. On the structural front, however, a number of past Fund recommendations remain
pending (as discussed in Section II).

5
II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
5.
As the discussions took place in the context of a major slowdown of the global
economy and turnaround in commodity prices, they focused on key developments in
2008 and on the policies needed to buttress the fiscal position and reduce financial
sector vulnerabilities. Regarding developments in 2008, there was consensus that high rates
of monetary growth had compounded the impact of food price inflation, although the
authorities also emphasized exogenous factors (speculative and political) as contributors to
Bolivia’s inflation developments. Regarding the outlook, sharp changes are likely to occur in
the fiscal and external current accounts, both of which—according to staff projections—
would shift into deficits in 2009, for the first time in several years. The discussions covered,
in addition to the baseline scenario (reflecting then available WEO projections), a more
adverse alternative scenario, consistent with a 25 percent lower path for oil prices relative to
the baseline (somewhat more pessimistic than the current WEO projections). In the period
ahead, macroeconomic policy management will benefit from Bolivia’s high level of reserves,
which provides a buffer against disorderly adjustments. Moreover, fiscal measures and
financial sector reforms would reduce the downside risks to the baseline medium-term
scenario and enhance the economy’s resilience to adverse external shocks.
A. Developments in 2008
6.
In 2008, strong hydrocarbons and mining exports has continued to support
Bolivia’s growth performance as well as its fiscal and external positions. Real GDP
growth has picked up to an estimated 5.9 percent (from an average of 4.7 percent in 200607), boosted in part by the start of production at a large mining project (Table 1). The
external current account has recorded a surplus of 11 percent of GDP, and central bank
reserves have risen to historical highs. The combined public sector1 has also remained in
surplus, benefiting from continued high export-based revenues.
7.
The external developments and associated partial monetization of the increase in
reserves have contributed to double-digit inflation, which peaked in mid-year and has
since eased somewhat. Following an increase to 17 percent in the first half of 2008, twelvemonth inflation has declined and is now projected at 12 percent for the year. While the earlier
increase was driven partly by food inflation, external developments generated significant
demand pressures, compounding the effects of the supply shock (Box 1). The role of excess
aggregate demand in the inflationary process is evidenced by increases in non-food inflation.
The deceleration in recent months reflects moderation in food prices, slower monetary
expansion, as reserves stabilized, a modest appreciation of Boliviano, and substantial
depreciations of trading partners’ currencies.

Box 1. Main Inflation Drivers
Preliminary empirical evidence confirms that, while supply shocks have been critical, domestic factors have
been important drivers of inflation in Bolivia.
•

A first empirical approach involved estimating a general equilibrium model with forward-looking
features. Using quarterly Bolivian data for

•

A second approach addressed the analysis of inflation using VAR’s. Under this alternative, a Bayesian
VAR was estimated with the same sample, but assumed a money-based monetary policy framework—closer
to Bolivia’s actual monetary regime—and used the stock of currency as the measure of money supply.
Similarly, preliminary simulations yield that 22 percent of the variability in inflation is explained by changes
in the currency stock, whereas domestic demand shocks contribute 7 percent. Both approaches thus suggest
that domestic factors account for an important fraction of the variability of inflation.

8.
Bolivia’s overall fiscal position has improved in 2008, benefiting from high
hydrocarbons-based revenue (Tables 2 and 3). The overall fiscal surplus is estimated to
rise to 3.5 percent of GDP (from 2.6 percent of GDP in 2007), reflecting in part a strong
increase in the surplus of the state energy company YPFB, which benefited from high natural
gas export prices and the incorporation of activities such as refining and distribution,

previously carried out by private sector enterprises.2 However, the non-hydrocarbon deficit3
has risen to an estimated 8.5 percent of GDP—reflecting, inter alia, outlays on new social
programs and higher fuel subsidies. Net public debt has continued to fall, with the overall
fiscal surplus reflected in rising public sector deposits at the central bank.
9.
Booming hydrocarbon and mining exports, together with high remittance
inflows, led to a record-high current account surplus and large reserve accumulation,
with major pressures on monetary/exchange rate policy during the first three quarters
of 2008. In the period through September, the central bank stepped up open market
operations, mainly through greater placement of indexed instruments. However, foreign
exchange inflows were only partially sterilized, so that monetary expansion remained strong.
Meanwhile, the authorities continued to implement small nominal upward adjustments to the
exchange rate under the crawling peg regime. Since September, central bank reserves have
declined somewhat, in part as a result of lower foreign exchange inflows and greater demand
for foreign assets, resulting in a significant slowdown of monetary expansion. As a result, the
growth rates of broad money and currency in circulation declined somewhat to, respectively,
24 percent and 35 percent for the year as a whole (Tables 4 and 5). During the last three
months, the exchange rate has been stable, following about three years of gradual nominal
increases. In real effective terms, the Boliviano has appreciated markedly over the past year,
reflecting mainly the high inflation in Bolivia and significant currency depreciations in
trading partners.

B. Outlook for 2009
11.
The baseline staff projections5 suggest that the negative terms of trade shock
from lower energy and mining prices, as well as an expected decline in remittances, will
slow GDP growth markedly in 2009—to 4 percent (from 6 percent in 2008)—while the
fiscal and external current accounts would shift into small deficits. At the same time,
further reductions in food prices would contribute to a decline in the twelve-month inflation
rate to about 8 percent by end-2009. While the baseline scenario suggests that current
fiscal/monetary policies, as well as the exchange rate level, are sustainable, Bolivia’s outlook
is highly sensitive to developments in export prices, and their further weakening could give
rise to significant financing needs and undermine external and fiscal sustainability. The
authorities envisaged somewhat higher export prices and real GDP growth than suggested by
the staff’s baseline projections, and expected that fiscal and external current account deficits
could be averted.

4

The delinquency indicator for restructured loans is about 30 percent and the repayment schedule of some of
them reportedly includes larger installments toward their maturity.

5

The baseline projections are consistent with the October 2008 WEO vintage.

the baseline assumptions, this would
imply an overall surplus in the order of 3 percent of GDP (somewhat lower than the average
of the last three years). Such an adjustment would reduce dependency on volatile exportbased revenue6 and lead to greater inter-generational equity in the use of hydrocarbons
wealth.

6

As shown in the chart, a further large drop in oil prices could push the fiscal deficit to as high as around
6 percent of GDP, which would give rise to serious financing difficulties and undermine fiscal sustainability.

10
13.
To strengthen the fiscal position, the authorities may need to consider a
reduction of explicit and implicit hydrocarbons subsidies7—projected at about
1 percent and 4 percent of GDP, respectively, in 2009—while using part of the
substantial resulting fiscal savings to protect vulnerable groups.8 This is particularly
relevant since there is consensus that these subsidies are inefficient, give rise to smuggling,
and discourage investment and energy conservation. The authorities are keenly aware of
these distortions and of their fiscal cost, and are considering policies to address them. The
mission also recommended wage and pension restraint9 and a rigorous prioritization of
investment projects.
Box 2. Structural Fiscal Issues
The authorities concurred with the thrust of the mission’s recommendations on fiscal reform.
However, they indicated that progress was likely to be limited until the ongoing constitutional reform
process is completed.

•

Tax reform. There is a need for measures aimed at simplifying the tax system and improving its
efficiency and equity. In line with previous IMF technical assistance, the mission recommended
eliminating the transactions tax and the complementary tax to the VAT (RC-IVA). The associated
revenue loss (about 2½ percent of GDP) could be more than offset by an increase in the VAT rate
(currently 13 percent), the closing of loopholes in the corporate income tax, and the transfer of
special regime (such as simplified regimes for small taxpayers and free trade zone regimes)
taxpayers to the regular tax regime. Appropriate turnover thresholds would need to be added to the
VAT and the corporate income tax, below which taxpayers would be exempt from the VAT and
liable to presumptive taxation only under the corporate income tax.

•

Intergovernmental relations. Also in line with previous Fund technical assistance recommendations,
the mission emphasized the need to better balance expenditure allocations and resources available at
each level of government, rationalize the transfer system, and strengthen controls over sub national
borrowing.

•

Budget process. Adoption of the draft Budget Framework Law prepared in 2005 would contribute
importantly to strengthening the budget process.

7

Implicit subsidies are associated with the longstanding freeze on domestically produced crude oil price at
US$27 per barrel, which provides the basis for maintaining very low administered prices for petroleum products
in the domestic market. These policies depress the base for the corporate profit tax and for excise taxes.

8

For example, through targeted food and urban transportation subsidies, as highlighted in FAD’s 2004 PSIA
report.

9

A pension reform proposal has been submitted by the government, and is currently with the relevant
committee in Congress, which would include a fully-funded minimum pension benefit. Such a minimum
pension would be paid in addition to the transfer scheme for persons over age 60 created in 2007, the Renta
Dignidad.

11
Monetary and exchange rate policy
14.
The mission argued for a more active monetary policy to reinforce the
downward trend in inflation. While lower food prices will facilitate progress towards price
stability, inflation is still high, and real interest rates remain negative on non-indexed central
bank instruments. The mission recommended conducting open market operations in a way
consistent with bringing about higher interest rates on non-indexed bonds, which would not
only have an impact on inflation but also reduce the incentives for dollarization and
indexation.10 While accepting the thrust of the staff’s views, the authorities argued that
supply-side factors (such as speculation and road blockades) had played a key role in fueling
inflation, and that their reversal would also contribute to the disinflation process.
15.
The external current account, which has recorded large surpluses over the last
three years, is projected to move into a deficit of 0.5 percent of GDP in 2009 (Table 6).
The value of exports is projected to decline by 23 percent in 2009, to US$4.7 billion,
reflecting mainly lower export prices. In addition, manufactured exports to the United States
will be affected by the recent suspension of trade preferences under the Andean Trade
Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA), and remittances are projected to decline by
about 10 percent, reflecting recessionary conditions in developed countries. Nonetheless, the
overall balance of payments will remain in surplus as continued FDI would more than cover
the current account deficit.
16.
Against this background, the mission discussed with the authorities the
appropriateness of Bolivia’s exchange rate level and degree of flexibility of its exchange
rate regime.11 While the Boliviano is mildly overvalued according to CGER estimates (Box 3),
it would appear to be broadly appropriate given the high degree of uncertainty associated with
such estimates. Regarding the exchange rate regime, the mission noted that the inflationary
pressures associated with large reserve accumulation prior to the decline in export prices had
underscored the need for greater exchange rate flexibility, which could be in the form of
greater and/or more frequent adjustments under the exiting crawling peg. Looking forward,
such flexibility would help absorb negative external shocks, like further declines in
commodity prices, while intervention in the foreign exchange market could be used to
forestall disruptive exchange rate adjustments.

10

Academic work—for example, “Addicted to Dollars” (NBER Working Paper 10015, 2003) by Reinhart C.
and K. Rogoff—supports the view that a high degree of dollarization does not pose an insurmountable obstacle
to monetary control or to disinflation.

11

Central bank staff conducts significant analytical work on equilibrium exchange rate issues.

12
Alternative scenario
17.
In anticipation of downward revisions to the WEO oil baseline, the mission
developed an alternative scenario in which oil prices are 25 percent lower than in the
baseline (Table 7). In such a scenario—which has become more relevant given downward
revisions to the WEO baseline since

front. Specifically, the authorities
indicated that, if oil prices were to display a sustained gap vis-à-vis the baseline path, they
would compensate for lower revenue through cuts in government capital expenditure—where
they see scope for streamlining while preserving critical investments and social spending.
Staff concurred with such an approach.
Box 3. Exchange Rate Assessment
Staff estimates based on CGER methodologies suggest that the Boliviano could be mildly overvalued following
the recent sharp changes in commodity prices and in trading partners’ currencies.

•

The macroeconomic balance approach (MB) suggests an overvaluation of 8 percent. The underlying
current account balance—i.e., that which would prevail under current real exchange rates once temporary
factors have dissipated—is estimated to be a surplus of 1.8 percent of GDP, much lower than in 2008
because of the recent reduction in the terms of trade. Meanwhile, an estimation of the current account
norm for Bolivia yielded 3.4 percent, using the same parameters as those in the CGER exercise.

•

The equilibrium exchange rate approach (ERER) suggests the Boliviano could be overvalued by
7 percent. Econometric evidence points to a long-run relationship between the real exchange rate and
terms of trade, public consumption, productivity, FDI, and the net foreign assets of the banking system
(NFA). Until recently, the Boliviano was undervalued, but the observed real effective exchange rate has
rapidly risen, while the equilibrium real exchange rate has fallen because the effect of declining terms of
trade more than offset that of the prior increase in NFA.

•

The external sustainability also suggests an overvaluation of 10 percent. Bolivia would need a current
account surplus of 4 percent of GDP to stabilize its net foreign asset position, compared with the
estimated underlying current account surplus of 1.8 percent of GDP. The exchange rate adjustment
required to close the gap would be about 10 percent.

13
C. Financial Sector Issues
18.
The financial system in Bolivia continues to be broadly unaffected by the
ongoing global financial turmoil. While deposits fell in September by about
US$160 million (2.5 percent of the total), this could be attributed to political tensions as
deposits have since stabilized. Furthermore, there are no signs that the small existing
international credit lines are being curtailed or cancelled. The recent drawdown in central
bank reserves appears to reflect a portfolio shift on the part of the financial and nonfinancial
private sectors to rebuild their dollar positions—which had been reduced in response to
previous currency appreciation trends. Nonetheless, NIR still represent 120 percent of
financial system deposits.
19.
While dollarization declined
markedly in recent years, the slight
increase in the share of dollar deposits in
recent months suggests that a reversal of
that process could be taking place. A fullblown re-dollarization is not expected, but
the risk of such a development would be
particularly high in the event of a sharp
depreciation of the currency.

The authorities concurred with the
thrust of the mission’s recommendations to enhance on financial sector soundness.
Specifically:

2008

•

Efforts to reduce vulnerabilities need to continue, even if the financial sector
appears to be stable and highly liquid. The mission welcomed plans to fully adopt
IAS by January 2010 and the ongoing efforts to improve risk management practices
in banks, including countercyclical loan-loss provisioning. The mission recommended
ensuring that new regulations on subordinated debt, foreign exchange exposures, and
the use of general provisions as tier II capital do not depart from international best
practices. It also stressed the need for prudential regulations to mitigate credit risks
from dollarization and market risk, as dollar-denominated loans represent about
70 percent of bank credit. In addition, there is scope to improve further the
assessment of risk management procedures on household lending. The supervisory
agency was encouraged to continue assessing, in the field, the sufficiency of all
financial institutions’ loan provisioning and solvency.

•

Addressing some pending legal, prudential, and institutional issues would
contribute to reducing potential vulnerabilities. This would include: (a) the
creation, in due course, of a deposit insurance scheme; (b) amendments to the
legislation governing corporate bankruptcy/restructuring; and (c) strengthening

14
further the Financial Intelligence Unit (in particular staffing) and anti-money
laundering legislation.12
•

The authorities are considering the possibility of conducting an FSAP update in
early 2010.
D. Supply Side and Social Issues

21.
The mission suggested that improving the investment climate was a top priority
for Bolivia, as private investment remains significantly below the levels displayed in the
past decade, which has contributed to growth rates below the regional average.
Investment picked up in 2008, but the increase was concentrated on residential investment
and the completion of a large mining project. In May 2008, the government expropriated the
shares needed to regain control over five companies in the hydrocarbons sector, and
intervened the telecommunications company ENTEL, which have triggered demands for
international arbitration from the affected investors. More recently, the government
announced plans to recover control over the three electricity generation companies. The
mission suggested the importance of pursuing actions on the nationalization front through
mutually agreeable arrangements with the concerned private parties.

While acknowledging the desirability of higher rates of private investment, the
authorities emphasized that their development strategy ascribes a leading role to public
sector investment. In their view, the private sector will, in due course, take advantage of
investment opportunities that are expected to arise from major infrastructure improvements.
12

Bolivia’s progress in implementing the FATF 40+9 Recommendations against money laundering and the
financing of terrorism was recently discussed at the last Plenary meetings of GAFISUD (the FATF-style
regional body for South America). The related progress report noted a recent progress in Bolivia’s political
commitment to fight these crimes. As a result, no counter-measures or sanctions were applied.

15
23.
The authorities emphasized the importance of ongoing efforts to reduce poverty.
These include, most notably, transfer schemes targeted at youth and the elderly. The mission
welcomed these initiatives and underscored the need for more timely data to better assess
progress in poverty reduction.13
E. Medium-Term Outlook
24.

The key elements of the baseline medium-term macroeconomic scenario are:

•

Growth. Real GDP growth is projected to slow to around 3½ percent toward the end
of the projection period (2012-13) as mining output stabilizes following the
completion of a large project. The authorities noted that growth could be sustained in
the vicinity of 6 percent if account were taken of envisioned investments and
production increases in the hydrocarbons sector, which would enable a substantial
boost to natural gas exports to Argentina in the context of the 2006 bilateral
agreement. While recognizing their potential effects, staff has not been incorporated
these elements in the projections because the related investment plans and financing
arrangements have not yet been fleshed out. Moreover, the envisaged increase in
natural gas exports to Argentina is contingent on the construction of a pipeline in that
country.

•

Investment. The assumed growth rate is consistent with private investment picking up
from the 2008 level, reflecting mainly the start of a new large mining project (El
Mutun), which is projected to add on average about 1 percent of GDP a year to
private investment levels over the five-year period beginning in 2009.

•

External current account. The current account balance would return to surplus in
2010, benefiting from a projected recovery in hydrocarbon prices and higher export
volumes to Argentina (based on greater utilization of the already existing pipeline
capacity).

•

Fiscal position. The overall fiscal position would shift to small surpluses in 2010-11
but subsequently move back to small deficits, as hydrocarbons-based revenue
declines in relation to GDP due to stable export volumes.

•

Inflation. Inflation, which is projected to drop to single digits in 2009, in line with
projected declines in food prices, would decline further over the medium term as the
external sector is not expected to be a source of liquidity pressures.

13

The latest poverty indicators date from 2006 and show stable poverty levels at 60 percent.

16
25.
In the alternative medium-term scenario, the external current account and the
overall fiscal deficits would narrow somewhat in 2010, reflecting mainly the assumed higher
natural gas export volumes to Argentina. Following a small decline in 2009, central bank
reserves would rise gradually, to US$8.8 billion by 2013 (compared with US$12.5 billion in
the baseline scenario).

Debt sustainability
26.
Longer-term projections beyond the baseline medium-term scenario suggest that
Bolivia’s public and external debts are likely to remain sustainable. However, standard
stress tests suggest that the debt ratio would rise in the event of severe exogenous shocks.14
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
27.
Strong hydrocarbons and mining exports continued to support Bolivia’s growth
performance as well as its fiscal and external positions. In 2008, real GDP growth picked
up, the external current account surplus remained very large, and international reserves
reached record levels. The combined public sector balance remained in surplus, benefiting
from continued high export-based revenues. The currency strengthened, which contributed to
a further significant reduction in deposit dollarization.
28.
The high rates of monetary expansion prevailing until recently have contributed
importantly to double-digit inflation. While food inflation has also been an important
factor, the role of domestic demand in the inflationary process that peaked in mid-2008 was
evidenced by increases in non-food inflation. The decline in inflation in recent months is a
welcome development that reflects not only moderation in food prices but also slower
monetary growth and the effect of a substantial real appreciation of the currency.
14

See accompanying external and public debt sustainability analysis.

17
29.
In view of the major changes in the external environment and outlook, the key
policy challenge has shifted from containing inflation to maintaining a sound fiscal
position and external stability. While Bolivia’s financial system continues to be broadly
unaffected by the global financial turmoil, the major decline in the terms of trade from lower
energy and mining prices, as well as an expected decline in remittances, are projected to slow
GDP growth markedly in 2009, and to push both the fiscal and external current accounts into
deficits. The staff’s baseline scenario suggests that current fiscal and monetary policies are
still appropriate while the exchange rate remains competitive. However, Bolivia’s outlook is
highly sensitive to developments in export prices, and their further weakening could give rise
to significant financing needs and call for a strengthening of policies to ensure external and
fiscal sustainability.
30.
In the event of a deterioration in exports and related fiscal revenue, the first line
of defense in the policy adjustment should be on the fiscal front. Staff welcomes the
authorities’ approach, which includes cuts in government capital expenditure—where there is
scope for streamlining—while preserving social spending. Moreover, given the need to
reduce dependency on volatile export-based revenue and ensure intergenerational sharing of
hydrocarbon wealth, the authorities need to target a reduction in the non-hydrocarbons fiscal
deficit over the medium term—in the order of 3½ percent of GDP. To this end, the
authorities could consider a gradual reduction of explicit and implicit hydrocarbons subsidies
while using part of the resulting fiscal savings to protect vulnerable groups. This is
particularly relevant since there is consensus that these subsidies are inefficient, give rise to
smuggling, and discourage investment and energy conservation. Meanwhile, it will be of
paramount importance to exercise wage and pension restraint, and a rigorous prioritization of
investment projects.
31.
In addition, there is scope to further strengthen Bolivia’s fiscal position through
well-designed structural reforms. First, the tax system could be modified to simplify it and
improve its efficiency and equity. To this end, the staff suggests eliminating the transactions
tax and the complementary tax to the VAT, while increasing the VAT rate, closing loopholes
in the corporate income tax, and transferring special regime taxpayers to the regular tax
regime. At the same time, it would be important to rationalize intergovernmental relations,
and in particular better balance expenditure allocations and available resources at each level
of government. In addition, Bolivia would benefit from improving the budget process, a
blueprint for which is available in the draft Budget Framework Law prepared back in 2005.
32.
A more active monetary policy would help speed up the decline in inflation,
currently in the double digits. The central bank is encouraged to conduct open market
operations in a manner consistent with bringing about higher interest rates on non-indexed
bonds, which are negative in real terms, and thereby eliminate the incentive for indexation.
Higher real interest rates and lower inflation would also help consolidate the reduction in
dollarization achieved in recent years.

18
33.
The exchange rate of the Boliviano is broadly appropriate. While standard estimates
suggest a mild overvaluation, and indeed the current account deficit could be significant in
2009, the outlook points to a subsequent improvement in the external current account.
Regarding the exchange rate regime, the inflationary process—associated in part, until
recently, with large unsterilized intervention—has highlighted the need for greater exchange
rate flexibility. Looking forward, greater flexibility would help to minimize deviations from
the real equilibrium exchange rate, as well as to absorb possible negative external shocks
stemming from adverse movements in commodity prices.
34.
While the financial sector appears to be stable and highly liquid, efforts to
reduce vulnerabilities should continue. The staff welcomes plans to fully adopt
international accounting standards and the ongoing efforts to improve risk management
practices in banks. The authorities are encouraged to introduce prudential regulations to
mitigate credit risks from dollarization and market risk. In addition, addressing some pending
legal, prudential, and institutional issues may also contribute to reducing potential
vulnerabilities. Priorities in this area are establishing a deposit insurance scheme; adopting
legislation governing corporate bankruptcy/restructuring; and strengthening further the
Financial Intelligence Unit and legislation on anti-money laundering.
35.
Improving the investment climate remains a top priority for Bolivia, as its
private investment rate remains significantly below the levels observed in the past
decade and well below the regional average. The investment climate, which stands to gain
from the recent easing in political tensions, would also benefit from restraint with regard to
nationalizations—which should be pursued, as far as possible, through mutually agreeable
arrangements with the concerned private parties.
36.
Bolivia’s data provision to the Fund has some shortcomings, but is broadly
adequate for surveillance.
37.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Bolivia be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

ANNEX 1. SUMMARY OF ANNEXES
The full annexes to this report may be viewed in CyberDocs on the Fund’s intranet and on the
secure extranet for Executive Directors and member country officials.
Fund relations
As of November 30, 2008, Bolivia did not have any outstanding purchases or loans. The latest
SBA expired on March 31, 2006. The last Article IV consultation was completed by the
Executive Board on July 13, 2007 (IMF Country Report No. 07/248). Bolivia has received
wide-ranging TA in recent years. An update safeguards assessment was completed in 2004.
This assessment confirmed that measures had been implemented to address all previously
identified vulnerabilities, except for those requiring a change in the central bank law.
Currently, the Central Bank of Bolivia is not subject to the policy. Mr. Esteban Vesperoni has
been the IMF resident representative since February 2006.
Relations with the World Bank Group
The World Bank’s support to Bolivia under the Interim Strategy Note (ISN) approved in
November 2006 concluded in June 2008. The World Bank and the Government are negotiating
a new strategy in order to continue and deepen the Bank’s long-term support to Bolivia’s
development priorities. Preliminary discussions focused on extreme poverty eradication.
Lending under the last ISN included only IDA resources, which financed 11 investment
projects, with disbursements of US$140 millions over the last two years. The Bank’s current
portfolio in Bolivia comprises eleven projects under implementation, with total commitments
of US$272.8 million of which US$196.2 million remain undisbursed.
Relations with the Inter-American Development Bank
As of November 30, 2008, Bolivia’s outstanding debt to the IDB was approximately
US$530.0 millions with undisbursed approved funds for US$460.0 millions. New IDB lending
to Bolivia will be following newly adopted operational guidelines for concessional funds
under the Fund of Special Operations performance-based allocation system. The Bank’s 2008
operative program contains a portfolio of sovereign guaranteed operations of 6 loans for a total
amount of US$105.0 millions for the year, concentrated in water, housing and agricultural
productivity sectors. Seven additional loans for US$130.0 millions have been identified and
are already in the Bank’s lending pipeline for the 2008-2009 cycles.
Statistical issues
Data provision to the Fund has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. A
data ROSC mission in early 2007 confirmed advances in recent years, and reiterated the
existence of shortcomings that might hamper the formulation of appropriate policies. Bolivia
has participated in the GDDS since November 2000 and plans to subscribe to the SDDS are at
an advanced stage.

VIII. Safeguards Assessment. Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Central
Bank of Bolivia (CBB) was subject to an assessment with respect to the April 2, 2003 Standby Arrangement (SBA). A safeguards assessment was completed on June 27, 2003, and
while no systemic risks with the CBB’s safeguards were identified, uncertainties were
expressed about the de facto lack of operational independence and program monetary data.
An update assessment was completed on September 27, 2004 in conjunction with an

4
augmentation of the SBA. This assessment confirmed that measures had been implemented
to address all previously identified vulnerabilities, except for those requiring a change in the
central bank law. Currently, CBB is not subject to the policy.
IX. Exchange Arrangement. The Bolivian currency is the Boliviano and the exchange rate
regime is a crawling peg. The central bank holds a daily foreign exchange auction, accepting
all bids that are at least equal to the central bank’s minimum price. If acceptable bids exceed
the amount offered for auction, the lowest acceptable bids are prorated so as to exhaust the
amount offered. The minimum price is adjusted from time to time in light of the evaluation
of Bolivia’s real exchange rate with respect to Bolivia’s key trading partners. On November
30, 2008, the official selling rate was US$7.07 per U.S. dollar.
X. Article IV Consultation. The last Article IV consultation was completed by the
Executive Board on July 13, 2007 (IMF Country Report No. 07/248). Bolivia is on a standard
12-month consultation cycle.

APPENDIX 2. BOLIVIA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK1
1.
Based on preliminary conversations with the Government, the World Bank
Group has begun the preparation of a new strategy that will conduct the Bank’s
support to Bolivia in the upcoming years. The Interim Strategy Note (ISN) approved in
November 2006 allowed supporting to Bolivia during FY07 and FY08. This support included
lending operations, trust funds, analytical work and technical assistance in areas where the
Bank and the Government agreed upon: enhancing good governance and transparency;
fostering jobs through growth; and providing better services to the poor. This strategy
concluded in June 2008, thus the World Bank and the Government have begun conversations
to define areas and instruments that will be included in the new strategy in order to continue
and deepen the Bank’s long-term support to Bolivia’s development priorities. Preliminary
discussions focused on extreme poverty eradication.
2.
The World Bank’s portfolio in Bolivia comprises 11 investment projects for a
total amount of US$272.8 million of which US$196.2 million remain undisbursed. Under
the last ISN, all IDA14 resources allocated to Bolivia (US$140 million) were committed in
eight investment projects approved over the last two years. Out of the 11 projects, three were
approved under the FY04-05 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), seven were conceived
under the last ISN, and one was incorporated at the Government’s request to address the
impacts of flooding caused by the natural disasters of El Niño and La Niña. The portfolio,
entirely financed with IDA resources, includes the following projects:

Additionally, the World Bank program includes Trust Funds and Global
Programs. The Bank is currently managing five grants amounting to $8.7 million, which
support institutional strengthening and project preparation and execution. These include:
Global Partnership on Output Based Aid ($5.2 million), GAIN Global Food Fortification
($2.6 million), Strengthening of the Deputies Chamber Finance Commission ($0.2 million),
Capacity Building to Support Carbon Finance Transactions ($0.5 million), and Strengthening
Donor Aid Coordination ($0.1 million).
4.

Under the last ISN, the World Bank concluded the following studies:

•

Policies for Increasing Firms’ Formality and Productivity that assesses productivity
constraints faced by Bolivian firms and policies to encourage their formalization and
productivity. This study triggered an additional piece of work that assesses the
informality among women entrepreneurs.

•

Two phases of the Programmatic Social Protection Study that presents a diagnosis on
poverty, vulnerability and exclusion, an assessment of existing social protection
programs, the involvement of sub-national governments and communities in the
provision of social services, an in-depth analysis of financing to the sector and the
urban dimension of social protection. The study provides recommendations for the
design and implementation of the Government’s Social Protection Strategy. This
study contributed to the design of the Investing in Children and Youth Project.

•

Strengthening Competitiveness for Export Diversification and Inclusive Growth that
evaluates the trade policy and its effects on non-traditional exports.

•

Operational Review of the Fondo de Inversión Productiva y Social that evaluates the
core capabilities and operational and organizational elements required for the agency
to successfully fulfill its mandate.

5.
While the preparation of the new strategy takes place, the Bank and the
Government have decided to advance in the design of two investment projects that were
in the pipeline, as well as in the development of economic and sector works. The
Government and the Bank agreed on postponing three projects originally included in the last
ISN – Job Creation and Competitiveness, Building Government Monitoring and Evaluation
Systems, and Strengthening State Efficiency and Transparency. Two of these projects have
advanced in their preparation, in close coordination with the Government (Job Creation and
Competitiveness and Building Government M&E Systems). Moreover, an additional
financing for the Rural Alliances Project is under consideration. In terms of analytical and
advisory activities, studies on municipal services and finances, and on food inflation are
currently being prepared to be delivered in FY09.

7
APPENDIX 3. BOLIVIA: RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK 1
6.
As of November 30, 2008, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) had
approved loans to Bolivia amounting to US$4.11 billion, with disbursements totaling
US$3.34 billion. Bolivia’s outstanding debt to the IDB was approximately
US$530.0 millions with undisbursed approved funds for US$460.0 millions. Differently from
what happened in the first half of the decade, net cash flows to the country were negative
during 2006 and 2007, a trend expected to continue during 2008. In the recent past the IDB
financial engagement with the country included successive debt relief agreements, first under
HIPC initiative, and then under it’s own initiative following the MDRI. The last round of
debt relief wrote off a total of US$741.1 million in principal payments and US$307.3 millions of
future interest payments, generating an estimated annual fiscal space of more than US$18.0
millions on average.
7.
The IDB is implementing new criteria of allocation of concessional lending.
Consistent with the application of the Debt Sustainability Framework and after the last round
of debt relief, new IDB lending to Bolivia will be following newly adopted operational
guidelines for concessional funds under the Fund of Special Operations performance-based
allocation system. Parallel lending operations, modality that features differential combination
between ordinary and concessional funding, will be enacted as the preferred lending
instrument up to 2015. During the 2007-2008 transitional period, the concessional element of
the blend will amount 37% of an estimated annual allocation of US$74.3 millions.
8.
Under the 2008-2010 Bank’s country strategy with Bolivia, the government and
the IDB have agreed on keeping sustainable poverty reduction as main objective of
their strategic engagement. In pursuit of this objective, the Bank has aligned its actions
with those contained by Bolivia’s National Development Plan in order to achieve a grater
degree of coordination among international cooperation entities acting in Bolivia, while
better targeting priority areas in the poverty reduction action plan. Four main strategic areas
are proposed under the new strategy: (i) productivity, competitiveness and productive
infrastructure, to promote economic growth consistent with poverty reduction targets;
(ii) water, sanitation and social development to target high-poverty municipalities;
(iii) building opportunities for the majority and development with identity to enhance the
participation of the bottom tiers of the income distribution; and (iv) institutional
strengthening of the state at both national and sub-national levels, to achieve higher
efficiency of the public sector while promoting the decentralization process.
9.
As of November 30, 2008 the portfolio of executing sovereign guaranteed
operations in Bolivia consists of 28 loans totaling US$826.0 millions, of which 45% has
already been disbursed. The current executing portfolio supports mostly water and
1

Prepared by IDB staff.

8
sanitation, education, health, infrastructure and productivity interventions. The undisbursed
sovereign portfolio is concentrated (53%) in the transportation sector. The non-sovereign
guaranteed executing portfolio consists of 3 loans totaling US$114.0 millions, of which
81.6% has already been disbursed. Seven additional loans for US$130.0 millions have been
identified and are in the Bank’s lending pipeline.
10.
The conditions for the strategy’s implementation remain complex, with
important institutional, social and political definitions yet to be clarified thus
representing direct and indirect risks to the fulfillment of the strategy objectives.
Widespread economic reform reorientation, macroeconomic and financial stability,
vulnerability in front of changing external conditions and natural disasters risks also pose
indirect challenges to the implementation scenarios of the Bank’s strategy. In the prospective
risk assessment of the new strategy, weak policy implementation and institutional capacity
has been identified as additional risk factors to be mitigated in the implementation of the
Bank’s strategic program with Bolivia.

9
APPENDIX 4. BOLIVIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision to the Fund has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
A data ROSC mission in early 2007 confirmed advances in recent years, and reiterated the
existence of data shortcomings that may hamper the formulation of appropriate policies.
Bolivia has participated in the GDDS since November 2000 and plans to subscribe to the
SDDS are at an advanced stage.
I. REAL SECTOR
•

National accounts. The National Institute of Statistics (INE) has begun a thorough
revision of the national accounts statistics, including the updating of the base year
(currently dating from 1990) and an intensified implementation of the System of
National Accounts 1993 (SNA 1993). The National Accounts Directorate (NAD) is in
the process of compiling a set of integrated economic accounts by institutional sectors
and sub sectors. The IMF Statistics Department has provided technical assistance to
INE on the ongoing revision of Bolivia’s national accounts.

•

Labor market. The quality of the household and employment surveys has
deteriorated in the last few years, due mainly to financial constraints. The quarterly
employment survey was discontinued in 2003, leading to a lack of quarterly
information on unemployment, employment and wages.

•

Prices. In April 2008, INE released a revamped consumer price index (CPI) covering
the nine largest cities and based on expenditure weights derived from a 2003/04
household budget survey. Industrial producer price indices and external trade unit
values are compiled by INE, but are in need of revision as regards concepts and
definitions consistent with SNA 1993, as well as treatment of seasonal products,
missing items, quality changes, and introduction of new products.
II. FISCAL SECTOR

•

The Ministry of Finance (MoF) provides timely information on operations for
the consolidated general government (central government and decentralized
entities), public enterprises and the central bank. The MoF also provides annual
data to STA on the operations of the consolidated central government, and regional
and local governments for publication in Government Finance Statistics Yearbook.
However, these data do not cover all operations of decentralized agencies and
operations channeled through special funds. The ongoing implementation of a
comprehensive financial management system, with funding from the IDB, will help
ensure proper monitoring of public sector financial operations including local debt
and social spending.

10
III. EXTERNAL SECTOR
•

The classification of accounts is broadly in accordance with the fifth edition of
the Balance of Payments Manual. Although quarterly balance of payments data are
available before the end of the year, these data are submitted to STA only once a year.
The BCB also provides monthly trade data to the Fund for publication in
International Financial Statistics (IFS) upon request, Fund staff has access to more
detailed and timely balance of payments and external debt data.

•

The authorities have disseminated on the World Bank QEDS website gross
liabilities of short and long-term private debt. There have been some
improvements in the coverage of private capital flows and positions since the foreign
direct investment survey was undertaken in 2007 by the central bank. However, as
noted by the January 2007 Data ROSC mission, the coverage of certain services and
financial transactions in the balance of payments needs to be expanded.

•

Although not yet an SDDS subscriber, Bolivia is disseminating the Data Template on
International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity. STA has extended an
invitation to Bolivia to disseminate its Reserves Template on the Fund’s website.
IV. MONETARY SECTOR

•

Coverage, sectorization, and timeliness of monetary statistics are in line with the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. Monetary data are based on the balance
sheets of the central bank, commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loans
associations, and private investment funds. The survey has been expanded to cover
the investment funds managing societies (SAFIS). The BCB has also started
compiling a monthly survey on the other financial corporations, with data from
pension funds, insurance corporations, Nacional Financiera Boliviana (NAFIBO),
and Fondo de Desarrollo del Sistema Financiero (FONDESIF). This survey will help
improve the quarterly flow of funds accounts currently compiled by the BCB.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
BOLIVIA
External and Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the staff of the International Monetary Fund1
Approved by Jose Fajgenbaum and Alan MacArthur
December 11, 2008
Following MDRI debt relief, the sustainability of Bolivia’s public debt has continued to
improve as a result of overall fiscal surpluses. Debt ratios continue to display ample margins
with respect to risk thresholds, and are expected to decline further under baseline policies.
Given the predominantly long maturities of remaining stocks of both domestic and foreign
debt, debt service is projected to remain low. The path of debt ratios would reach an
inflexion point and take on an upward trend under standard stress tests, but would remain
within manageable bounds over the medium- and long run.
Background
1.
Bolivia’s gross public debt (domestic and external) decreased significantly over
the last two years, benefiting from fiscal surpluses following the MDRI. The gross public
debt-to-GDP ratio—35 percent in 2008—is projected to decline further to 23 percent by
2013, and to 16 percent in 2027. Similarly, the NPV of public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected
to decline from 33 percent in 2008 to 16 percent during the DSA’s projection period.
Moreover, with the accumulation of deposits of the nonfinancial public sector in the financial
system—amounting to about 18 percent of GDP at present—the solvency of the public sector
measured by the net public debt (i.e., gross debt minus those deposits) has improved even
more significantly. On account of declining gross debt, net debt ratios would reach very low
levels during the projection period.
Baseline scenario
2.

The main assumptions of the baseline scenario for the period 2008–27 are:

•

Average annual real GDP growth: 4.2 percent until 2013, on account of
implementation of already identified mining projects, declining to 4 percent during
2014–27.

1

Since Bolivia is an IDA blend country, this DSA was not conducted jointly with the World Bank.

2
•

Average deflator inflation: 6.7 percent per year until 2013, in line with the latest
medium-term staff projections, and would decline further to 4 percent over the long
term.

•

Export and import growth: in line with the medium-term staff projections and the
assumption of 7½ percent growth beyond 2013. The latter would imply stable import
and export ratios to GDP over the long term.

•

FDI: in line with expected investments for the hydrocarbons and mining sectors.

•

Financing strategy: commercial debt is expected to remain nil, with CAF expected to
remain as the main source of financing.

•

Average concessionality of the public sector borrowing: projected to evolve, in the
medium-term, according to the pipeline of official loans. Over the longer run,
concessionality is expected to decrease gradually.

3.
Given the above assumptions, Bolivia’s external debt is expected to remain
sustainable throughout the projection period. After a projected small deficit in 2009, the
fiscal position would remain close to balance in the period 2010-2013, with an average
overall surplus of about 0.1 percent of GDP. Afterwards, the fiscal position would weaken
gradually, mainly reflecting lower hydrocarbons-based revenues in relation to GDP, reaching
a deficit of about 1 percent of GDP by the end of the projection period. Under the baseline
outlook, Bolivia’s indebtedness and debt service levels would remain very manageable.
Specifically, the total stock of external debt (public and private) is projected to fall to about
16 percent of GDP by 2013, and to stabilize around 5½ percent of GDP by 2027.
Consequently, Bolivia’s risk of debt distress is very low2—an assessment that would holds
even under significant stress tests.
Stress tests
4.
Standard stress tests suggests that Bolivia’s low external indebtedness is resilient
to severe exogenous shocks. Under the most extreme stress test—a combined shock to debt
concessionality, GDP growth, export growth, and external inflation—the ratio of the NPV of
debt to GDP deteriorates significantly but eventually stabilizes. In all cases, it would remain
below risky levels. Flow indicators also remain manageable under all stress tests.

2

The World Bank’s three-year average IDA Resource Allocation Index (IRAI) classifies Bolivia as a medium
performer with respect to the overall quality of its macroeconomic policies and the related risk thresholds on
NPV of debt-to-GDP and debt-to-exports ratios (40 percent and 150 percent, respectively) leave the country’s
current levels with significant safety margins.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
3/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
4/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For proj. also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
5/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
6/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the NPV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

surpluses. It is assumed that this would translate into larger reserve accumulation as opposed to a reduction
in gross debt

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 29, 2009

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with Bolivia
On January 14, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Bolivia.1
Background

In recent years, Bolivia experienced an export boom led by the hydrocarbons and mining
sectors, which supported an improvement in the growth performance and a strengthening of the
external and fiscal positions, but inflation accelerated and investment remained low in the
context of persistent political tensions. The rise in export prices through mid-2008 led to
exceptionally high external current account surpluses and reserve accumulation. Changes in
the hydrocarbons taxation regime in 2005-06 further boosted fiscal revenue, shifting the public
sector accounts from deficits into substantial surpluses. Increases in food prices combined with
external surpluses that fueled demand pressures, caused inflation to rise to double digits in
2007-08. As part of its policy response, the central bank gradually allowed the Boliviano to
appreciate, which contributed to a significant reduction in deposit dollarization. However,
despite the predominantly positive trends, private investment rates remain among the lowest in
the region.
In 2008, strong hydrocarbons and mining exports have continued to support Bolivia’s growth
performance as well as its fiscal and external positions. Real GDP growth has picked up to an
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

estimated 5.9 percent (from an average of 4.7 percent in 2006-07), boosted in part by the start
of production at a large mining project. The external current account has recorded a surplus of
11 percent of GDP, and central bank reserves have risen to historical highs. The combined
public sector has also remained in surplus, benefiting from continued high export-based
revenues.
Following an increase of inflation to 17 percent in the first half of 2008, twelve-month inflation
declined to 12 percent at the end of the year. While the earlier increase was driven partly by
food inflation, external developments generated demand pressures, compounding the effects of
the supply shock. The external developments and associated partial monetization of the
increase in reserves have contributed to double-digit inflation, which peaked in mid-year and
has since eased somewhat. The role of excess aggregate demand in the inflationary process is
evidenced by increases in non-food inflation. The deceleration in recent months reflects
moderation in food prices, slower monetary expansion as reserves stabilized, a modest
appreciation of the Boliviano, and substantial depreciations of trading partners’ currencies.
Bolivia’s overall fiscal position has improved in 2008, benefiting from high hydrocarbons-based
revenue. The overall fiscal surplus is estimated to rise to 3.5 percent of GDP (from 2.6 percent
of GDP in 2007), reflecting in part a strong increase in the surplus of the state energy company
YPFB, which benefited from high natural gas export prices and the incorporation of activities
such as refining and distribution, previously carried out by private sector enterprises. However,
the non-hydrocarbon deficit has risen to an estimated 8.5 percent of GDP—reflecting, among
other things, outlays on new social programs and higher fuel subsidies. Net public debt has
continued to fall, with the overall fiscal surplus reflected in rising public sector deposits at the
central bank.
Booming hydrocarbon and mining exports, together with high remittance inflows, led to a
record-high current account surplus and large reserve accumulation, with major pressures on
monetary/exchange rate policy during the first three quarters of 2008. In the period through
September, the central bank stepped up open market operations, mainly through greater
placement of indexed instruments. However, foreign exchange inflows were only partially
sterilized, so that monetary expansion remained strong. Meanwhile, the authorities continued to
implement small nominal upward adjustments to the exchange rate under the crawling peg
regime. Since September, central bank reserves have declined somewhat, in part as a result of
lower foreign exchange inflows and greater demand for foreign assets, resulting in a significant
slowdown of monetary expansion. As a result, the growth rates of broad money and currency in
circulation declined somewhat to, respectively, 24 percent and 35 percent for the year as a
whole. During the last three months, the exchange rate has been stable, following about three
years of gradual nominal increases. In real effective terms, the Boliviano has appreciated
markedly over the past year, reflecting mainly the high inflation in Bolivia and significant
currency depreciations in trading partners.

3

The banking system appears to be stable and liquid, although some vulnerable areas require
special attention. Mainly reflecting sluggish demand in the context of political uncertainties,
credit to the private sector has continued to expand at a very low pace, contributing to high
levels of bank liquidity. Bank capitalization stands at 14 percent, and nonperforming loans have
fallen to 5 percent of total loans. However, the level of restructured loans (about 9 percent of
total loans or 40 percent of equity) still raises concerns. In addition, the system remains
exposed to exchange-rate-induced credit risk, as loan dollarization remains high.
As Bolivia’s integration with international capital markets is very limited, the current global crisis
affects Bolivia mainly through declines in commodity prices and remittances. Capital inflows
have been negligible for many years, except for foreign direct investment (FDI) in hydrocarbons
and mining, thereby largely insulating Bolivia’s financial system from the external turmoil.
However, current trends in commodity prices will have a major impact on export receipts and
related fiscal revenue—starting in 2009, because of the lagged response of contractual gas
export prices.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that strong hydrocarbons and mining exports have continued to
support Bolivia’s growth and macroeconomic performance. In 2008, real GDP growth picked up,
the external current account surplus remained large, and international reserves reached record
levels. The combined public sector balance remained in surplus, benefiting from continued high
export-based revenues. The currency strengthened, which contributed to a further significant
reduction in deposit dollarization.
Directors noted that risks to Bolivia’s outlook have increased because of the sharp deterioration
of the global economic environment. Lower energy and mineral prices and an expected decline
in remittances could slow GDP growth and push both the fiscal and external current accounts
into deficits. Key policy challenges for the authorities will be to maintain sound fiscal and
external positions, to consolidate the decline in inflation observed in recent months, and to
reduce widespread poverty through increased investment.
Directors stressed that the increase in risks to the outlook requires a proactive fiscal response.
They welcomed the authorities’ fiscal strategy, which includes cuts in lower-priority capital
expenditure while preserving social spending. To reduce dependency on volatile export-based
revenue and ensure inter-generational sharing of hydrocarbon wealth, Directors saw a need to
target a reduction in the non-hydrocarbons fiscal deficit over the medium term. They
encouraged the authorities to seize the opportunity of declining oil prices to reduce gradually
hydrocarbons subsidies, while using part of the resulting fiscal savings to protect vulnerable

4
groups. Appropriate wage restraint, and a rigorous prioritization of investment projects will also
be important.
Directors emphasized the importance of well-designed structural reforms for further
strengthening Bolivia’s fiscal position. They considered that the tax system could be simplified
to improve its efficiency and equity, including through streamlining the value added tax
framework and closing loopholes in the corporate income tax. They noted the need to better
balance expenditure allocations and available resources at each level of government, and to
improve the budget process.
While recognizing the role of supply shocks in raising inflationary pressures, most Directors saw
merit in a more active monetary policy to help speed up the decline in inflation to single digits. In
particular, they encouraged the central bank to conduct open market operations in a manner
consistent with bringing about positive real interest rates on non-indexed bonds, and thereby
eliminate the incentive for indexation. Higher real interest rates and lower inflation would also
help consolidate the reduction in dollarization achieved in recent years. A few Directors
cautioned against proposals that could affect the independence of the central bank.
Executive Directors considered the real effective exchange rate level to be broadly appropriate.
Many Directors believed that greater exchange rate flexibility, supported by an appropriate
monetary policy framework, would help absorb possible negative external shocks stemming
from adverse movements in commodity prices. A few Directors, however, noted that greater
flexibility in the current environment could rekindle inflationary pressures and risk reversing the
de-dollarization trend of recent years.
Directors noted that Bolivia’s financial sector appears to be stable and highly liquid, and is
unaffected by the global financial crisis. Nonetheless, efforts to reduce vulnerabilities need to
continue. Directors welcomed plans to fully adopt international accounting standards and the
ongoing efforts to improve risk management practices in banks. They encouraged the
authorities to introduce prudential regulations that mitigate market risks and credit risks from
dollarization. Other pending reforms to be addressed include the introduction of a deposit
insurance scheme, the adoption of legislation governing corporate bankruptcy and restructuring.
A few Directors called for the strengthening of the anti-money laundering regime. Directors
supported the proposed FSAP update in 2010.
Directors stressed the importance of improving the investment climate—including constructive
negotiations with investors in disputed contracts—as Bolivia’s private investment rate remains
significantly below the levels observed in the past decade and well below the regional average.
This will be the key to fostering broad-based economic growth and reducing poverty.

and Victor Hugo De la Barra, Advisor to Executive Director
January 14, 2009
The Bolivian authorities thank the staff for their assessment of Bolivia’s current situation
and for the policies suggested. The authorities also wish to underscore the commendable
efforts of the mission staff, which are highly appreciated.
Background and Overview
1.
Since the last Article IV Consultation, Bolivia has shown a satisfactory
performance. Growth in 2008 reached more than 6 percent and foreign direct investment
increased vis-à-vis 2006 and 2007. On the supply side, the main drivers were mining,
construction, and hydrocarbons. Agriculture was affected by adverse climate conditions
during the first quarter, but its growth recovered to 2.4 percent after being negative in
2007. The agricultural production frontier was extended in 2008. On the demand side,
domestic consumption and investment supported such growth. Inflation in 2008 was
almost similar to 2007 (around 11.7 percent) after reaching 17.3 percent by mid-year.
2.
Fiscal performance was very positive in 2008, supported by additional income
from the tax and royalty structure on hydrocarbons, approved in 2005, and the 2008 tax
reform for the mining sector. The fiscal authorities managed to obtain a surplus in the
last three years, which will allow fiscal room to overcome the effects from the current
global slowdown.
3.
The balance of payments and capital flows have been strong. Capital good
imports increased more than 43 percent, enhancing the production capacity for the
incoming years. Exports increased to $6.1 billion and the trade surplus was $1.1 billion,
as a result of a positive international environment -reflected in higher prices- as well as
increases in quantum, especially in the mining sector. This trend led to a historic level of
international reserves of $7.8 billion (around 45 percent of GDP in 2008 while in 2005
they were approximately 21 percent).
4.
Nevertheless, the authorities recognize that the country will not be immune to this
global financial and economic downturn. Therefore, they are ready to apply the
necessary stimulus to boost the economy and offset the negative effects from such a
crisis. They consider that GDP for 2009 will be greater than projected in the staff report
(5 percent compared to 4 percent), since public investment will be used as a stimulus for
the economy. The authorities envisage $1,850 million in public investment (around 9.8
percent of GDP), as budgeted, along with an increase in private investment. Public
investment may be even greater if Congress authorizes the state oil company,
Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB), to borrow $1 billion from the
Central Bank of Bolivia (CBB).

5.
The political situation in Bolivia has stabilized. A referendum for the approval of
the New Constitution is scheduled for late January 2009, after the agreement reached in
October 2008 between the government and the opposition parties regarding controversial
issues related to land tenure, local government autonomy, and presidential re-election.
Fiscal Policy
6.
Improved tax collection and control over expenditure led to a surplus of more
than 6 percent of GDP in 20081. This outcome surpassed the projected surplus in the
2008 budget and contributed to reducing inflationary pressures, even though expenses for
health care, education, and infrastructure were expanded. Social expenditure was
increased through conditional cash-transfers such as the Bono Juancito Pinto and the
Renta Dignidad granted to elementary school students and to the elderly, respectively.
The former reached 1.6 million students and the latter 676,000 people above the age of
60, which combined represent 23 percent of the population. Through these benefits
poverty level has been reduced to 60 percent from 64 percent before 2007. The
authorities are not comfortable with such a high level of poverty and they intend to
reduce it further. To this end, the authorities are preparing an Extreme Poverty
Eradication Plan which will be put into action in 2009. In 2008, additional resources to
municipalities in poor regions were available for targeted projects.
7.
To boost fiscal revenue, the Tax Code for the mining sector was modified. Thus,
rates were streamlined and differentiated levies were introduced depending on the type of
product and the export prices. This policy allowed producing regions to benefit more
from royalties and taxes. Surtaxes on mining and hydrocarbons were suppressed
altogether.
8.
The 2009 budget envisages a small surplus. In this vein, wages in the public
sector will only be increased for teachers, health workers, and police officers, given the
need to be at level with the rest of the salaries in the economy. Likewise, in light of the
potential decline in fiscal revenue, the amount of yearly social benefits created in 20062008 (Bono Juancito Pinto and Renta Dignidad) will not be increased as planned.
9.
The non-oil revenue, has increased from 68 percent of the tax revenue in 2007 to
70 percent in 2008, which means that budget oil-revenue dependency is gradually
diminishing in Bolivia, and—most importantly—that declining oil prices will affect
Bolivia’s fiscal revenue less severely. This is particularly important since the National
Treasury has more constraints for expenditure than sub-national governments due to the
1

In Tables 3 and 4 of the Staff Report, nationalization costs and transfers to the Bank of Productive
Development are registered above the line while the authorities register them below the line. These
different approaches, as well as different GDP and exchange rate projections, result in diverse figures for
the fiscal balance in 2008 and 2009.

3
fact that the Hydrocarbons Law’s allocation of oil revenue favors the latter over the
National Treasury. Even the state oil company—which now operates the entire oil
network— has a variable intake percentage while sub-national governments have a fixed
intake percentage.
10.
The authorities are well aware of the level and effects of fuel subsidies and the
need to eliminate them. This issue was raised by the authorities during the Article IV
Consultation discussions, ahead of the staff’s recommendation. In fact, the authorities
have been working to find ways to reduce such subsidies as a means to release resources
for social expenditure but before proceeding to eliminate them, a well-targeted safety net
must be put in place to avoid negatively affecting the poor. The authorities envisage that
this priority could be addressed after the approval of the New Constitution.
11.
Public investment will be allocated mainly in infrastructure and public enterprises
to supply paper, milk, cement, sugar, and food. The authorities expect private investment
in Bolivia will follow as a consequence of the impulse of public investment. The
authorities are aware of the need to continue with fiscal consolidation efforts. Hence,
they have taken decisive actions to improve the quality of expenditures in the medium
term ─particularly those aimed at poverty reduction─ as well as to identify priorities that
enable targeting high-social return. The authorities continue implementing administrative
adjustments that improve the efficiency of the tax-collecting agencies dealing with
customs and domestic taxes. The implementation of reform of taxation in other sectors,
such as the informal commerce, is under evaluation and the authorities expect to apply it
gradually over the medium term.
12.
The reform of the pension system is underway. The authorities are fully aware of
the need to preserve macroeconomic stability while finding means to aid affiliates to
overcome rigidities that impede them to retire with the minimum pension, even though
they have reached retirement age. These rigidities were not addressed by the pension
system reform implemented in 1997. The draft law for this reform was presented to
Congress and has been approved by the House of Representatives. The authorities note
that this reform creates a complimentary pension system with a minimum pension
benefit, fully-funded through contributions from high-income affiliates. Since the current
defined-contribution pension funds will not be modified, there will be no additional fiscal
cost.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
13.
The authorities stress that inflation was mainly driven by supply shocks
(especially natural disasters that affected agricultural output), imported inflation, partial
monetization of foreign flows, and expectations. The latter were exacerbated by
speculative operations which were politically handled by private entrepreneurs with
market power in key products such as edible oil, rice, beef, and chicken, in order to

4
politically undermine the current administration. Additionally, road blockades disrupted
the normal supply of products.
14.
The staff calls for a more active monetary policy to curb inflation; however, at
this stage, the authorities prefer a more cautious policy stance considering the uncertain
effects of the global slowdown in the Bolivian economy. The authorities believe that
inflation is set to recede due to diminishing political tension, as well as lower
international food prices. Indeed, food items were the main drivers of the head-line
inflation. Thus, the authorities will remain vigilant to ensure macroeconomic stability.
15.
In any context, the monetary policy will continue to attain lower inflation rates
through Open Market Operations (OMOs), analyzing the global financial crisis and its
effects on the Bolivian economy. In 2008, the Central Bank of Bolivia (CBB) absorbed
liquidity through non-indexed and indexed domestic currency instruments and by
lengthening maturities, while up to 2006, mostly short-term foreign currency
denominated securities were available for OMOs, given the high level of dollarization.
The CBB also implemented OMOs for non-financial institutions and citizens, which
again displays the authorities’ commitment to reduce inflation. Increased placements in
local currency mitigate debt-management risks, and serve as a means to reduce financial
dollarization. The CBB authorities will continue to closely coordinate financial
programming with the Ministry of Finance; in fact a Memo of Understanding between
these institutions is in place. By December 2008, the CBB had raised rates on nonindexed instruments, but financial institutions did not change their rates for banking
deposits in domestic currency. Nonetheless, real interest rates on CBB securities have
been positive since the third quarter of 2008, vis-à-vis the relevant expected inflation rate.
16.
The staff report mentions that 22 percent of inflation could be explained by
changes in money stock; however, the authorities emphasize that due consideration must
be given to changes in the currency composition of asset-holders’ portfolio towards a
preference for domestic currency, promoted by the appreciation of the Boliviano
(dedollarization). Indeed, the authorities stress that there was an amount of dollar
banknotes already circulating in the Bolivian economy2 that never went through the
financial system, which were converted in domestic currency, driving an endogenous
increase in international reserves as well as the base money.
17.
The exchange rate regime (crawling peg) also contributed to offsetting the trend
in reserve money, through appreciation up to early October 2008. The appreciation of the
exchange rate in 2008 caused a substantial decrease in dollarization, especially in
banking deposits, reaching a low of 50 percent and also helped to control inflationary
pressures. The authorities intend to avoid a reversal of the dedollarization.
2

It is worth noting that in Bolivia, dollar banknotes used to be -and still are- a generalized means of
payment, which quantity is extremely hard to determine.

5
18.
Regarding the exchange rate level, the CBB considers that the real exchange rate
is in equilibrium, supported by a positive stance both in the fiscal and the balance of
payments positions since 2006. Therefore, they believe that the exchange rate level is
appropriate, backed by a strong level of international reserves ($7.8 billion). In addition,
they are convinced that the current level is consistent with the prevailing internal and
external equilibrium. The CBB believes that a label of overvaluation backed by uncertain
staff’s calculations may generate depreciation expectations that will negatively affect the
economy. The authorities will continue using the crawling peg regime. Nevertheless,
determining the necessary exchange rate adjustment is particularly complex in the case of
Bolivia, since inflation expectations are extremely sensitive to exchange rate
depreciation, particularly in the context of the current international financial turmoil. The
authorities will exercise greater flexibility, as needed, to avoid undermining the external
stability but also preventing inflationary pressures.
Financial Developments
19.
Bolivia’s financial system remained stable in 2008. Nonperforming loans were
reduced, provisions increased, and profitability also improved. Banking deposits grew 27
percent while credit increased by 17 percent in 2008. Credit to the private sector is
expected to increase in 2009 as a result of political stability and the fiscal stimulus to the
economy through public investment. Liquidity risk at this stage is low, even for foreigncurrency denominated deposits, since the CBB is prepared to provide enough resources to
the financial system. As the staff rightly points out, its international reserves cover 120
percent of bank deposits.
20.
Despite these achievements, the authorities are aware of the remaining
vulnerabilities in certain entities of the banking system and close supervision will be
applied. Bolivia’s financial system has been relatively insulated from the global financial
crisis, but the risk aversion from investors could pose challenges over time as the global
crisis evolves. The Superintendency of Banks (SB) is conducting stress tests, which were
available for the supervised entities in order for them prepare action plans in case risk
factors materialize. Moreover, the CBB and the SB are engaged in preparing joint
contingency plans. Credit risk regulations are serving well, but the authorities are aware
that credit risk related to exchange rate may be an issue for those who borrowed in
foreign currency but generate revenues in domestic currency. The SB is preparing
prudential regulations to deal with this risk, including changes in the provision regime.
The SB is also working on the 2003 FSAP recommendations and has expressed its
willingness to undergo a FSAP in 2010.
Development Policy and Structural Reforms
21.
Foreign investment expanded in 2008 and it is expected to grow further in 2009.
Mining and hydrocarbons are still key sectors in the Bolivian economy. The public

6
policy applied in these sectors, as well as in telecommunications, sought to correct severe
biases and distortions of the privatization contracts signed between 1993 and 1996. The
change in the government’s relationship with foreign companies made it possible to
implement new programs to address the need to help the poor, while preserving fiscal
stability. This policy has only been applied in strategic economic sectors. Amicable
arrangements are always pursued to buy the targeted enterprises, but controversies may
arise. The government intends to continue on the same path along with fiscal discipline
and pro-poor and pro-growth development policies.
22.
Although the public sector led investment in the last two years, the authorities are
aware that private investment is important to growth and job creation, thus they
emphasize that public investment in other economic sectors will be complementary. In
this vein, the government supports the enlargement of small and medium-sized
companies, facilitating them credit access. These sectors are labor intensive and their
expansion would help reduce unemployment, the major cause of poverty. In addition,
the government is engaged in obtaining access to foreign markets for non-traditional
exports to off-set the effects of the suspension of trade preferences with the United States.
