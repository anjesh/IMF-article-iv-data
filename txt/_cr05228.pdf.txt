Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2004 Article IV Consultation with Angola
Approved by Sharmini Coorey and Juha Kähkönen
February 22, 2005
•

Discussions were held in Luanda during July 6-20, 2004, and November 3-5, 2004. The mission teams
met with Mr. Jaime, Deputy Prime Minister; Mr. de Morais, Minister of Finance; Mr. Mauricio, Governor
of the National Bank of Angola; other ministers and senior government officials; executives of the
national oil and diamond companies (Sonangol and Endiama); Mr. Samakuva, President of UNITA; and
representatives from the banking, oil, and commercial sectors and civil society.

•

The mission teams, which worked closely with overlapping World Bank, MFD, and ICM missions,
included Mr. Shields (head), Mr. Pastor, Mr. Torrez, and Ms. Mendez (all AFR), Mr. Ronci (PDR),
Ms. Rivas (STA), and Mr. Gasha (MFD).

•

The 2003 Article IV Consultation with Angola was concluded on July 25, 2003. Directors urged the
authorities to strengthen efforts toward increasing transparency and tackling corruption; deepen their
political commitment to economic and structural reform; and develop a medium-term macroeconomic
framework. They recommended that the fiscal deficit should be reduced by strengthening non-oil tax
revenues and restricting overall spending, while spending should be redirected toward social services and
infrastructure.

•

Under IMF Article VIII, Angola continues to maintain an exchange restriction in the form of limits on
the remittances of dividends and profits from foreign investments that do not exceed US$100,000. This is
applied under Article 9.3 of Private Investment Law No. 11/03 of May 13, 2003. Angola also maintains
the following exchange restrictions under the transitional arrangements of IMF Article XIV, Section 2:
limits on the availability of foreign exchange for certain invisible transactions, such as travel, medical, and
educational allowances; and limits on unrequited transfers to nonresidents.

•

Angola’s statistical system is very weak. The lack of timely, accurate, and comprehensive data for all
economic sectors, except the monetary sector, hampers the formulation of appropriate policies and the
effectiveness of Fund surveillance.

•

Relations with the Fund are described in Appendix I. Relations with the World Bank are described in
Appendix II. Statistical issues are addressed in Appendix III.

•

Recent economic developments have been relatively favorable, but poverty is chronic. Economic
activity strengthened in 2004 as oil production recovered. Inflation, although still very high, has been
declining since mid-2003, reflecting improvements in monetary control, a declining fiscal deficit, smaller
central bank operating deficits, and substantial market intervention, largely in foreign currency. The
nominal exchange rate has been relatively stable since September 2003. Nearly one-third of the
population, displaced by the civil war, has returned home.

-4EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The economic outlook for Angola has been transformed by the peace agreement of April 4,
2002, and by increasing government revenues from oil. Since the end of violent conflict, about
4 million displaced persons have returned to their communities. Oil production, which currently
accounts for about half of GDP, is expected to double to 2 million barrels per day by 2007. Large
diamond deposits and considerable natural resources in agriculture, timber, and fishing also remain to
be exploited
GDP grew strongly in 2004, largely reflecting rising oil production, and is expected to grow at
an annual average rate of 18 percent during 2005–2007. However, poverty remains deeply
entrenched.
Inflation has declined substantially since mid-2003, to 31 percent in December 2004, following a
major change in macroeconomic policy implementation, which has largely stabilized the
nominal exchange rate. The policy has involved active absorption of domestic liquidity by central
bank intervention in foreign currency to support a tightening in monetary policy and improvements in
fiscal control.
Initial estimates indicate a substantial decline in the fiscal deficit between 2003 and 2004,
reflecting the rise in oil prices, reductions in fuel subsidies, and lower spending in real terms on
goods and services. Unification of the budget and publication of information on oil revenues have
improved the transparency of fiscal operations, but data remain unreliable.
Progress on structural reform and policies to reduce poverty has been limited. Noncompetitive
practices, privileged access, and costly bureaucratic procedures hamper the growth of the non-oil
private sector and contribute to high margins in domestic prices. Public spending is high in relation to
national income, but with limited provision for the social sectors. The PRSP has not yet been
finalized.
The authorities’ draft budget for 2005 seeks to consolidate progress toward macroeconomic
stability by targeting a further reduction in inflation during 2005 to 15 percent. Angola remains
vulnerable as a result of heavy external borrowing by the public sector and low international reserves.
However, if oil prices remain above their long-term trend, vulnerabilities should lessen substantially
and macroeconomic prospects would improve.
Sustained progress in three areas would help Angola achieve its medium-term potential. First,
macroeconomic policy management should be strengthened with a view to achieving sustainable low
inflation. This will require fiscal discipline to avoid procyclical spending as oil prices vary. Second,
further fundamental improvements need to be secured in transparency in relation to fiscal operations,
including revenues from oil and other natural resources, and in removing conflicts of interest in the
national oil and diamond companies. Third, for the private sector to develop, structural measures are
required to improve competition and contract enforcement.

The staff is continuing discussions on a possible staff-monitored program that would
help establish a track record of performance, with a view to eventually moving to a
Fund-supported arrangement.

-5I. INTRODUCTION AND KEY ISSUES
1.
Angola has been largely at peace since the Luena agreement of April 4, 2002.
About 4 million displaced persons have returned to their communities, including most former
combatants from UNITA,1 whose representatives have continued to serve in the government
of President José Eduardo dos Santos. A new draft constitution is being prepared. National
elections are provisionally scheduled for 2006.
2.
Implementation of the recommendations made by Directors at the conclusion of
previous Article IV Consultation has been promising in some critical areas, but less so
in others. Improvements in fiscal transparency and monetary control during 2003–04 have
underpinned a tightening in monetary conditions and contributed to substantially lower
inflation. However, the authorities have made limited progress in shifting the composition of
public spending, tackling corruption, speeding up structural reform, developing a mediumterm macroeconomic framework, or phasing out costly commercial foreign currency loans.
The first PRSP has not yet been finalized.
3.
The authorities remain interested in an SMP in the hope that it could be
followed by use of Fund resources. A Fund-supported program could, in turn, trigger
international financial support, including a rescheduling of Angola’s external debt in the
context of a Paris Club agreement.
4.
Angola has a promising future, but faces considerable short-term and structural
problems. Oil production is expected to double to over 2 million barrels per day by 2007;
large diamond deposits and considerable natural resources in agriculture, timber, and fishing
remain to be exploited; and the population density is currently very low. However,
agricultural production and the physical infrastructure have been decimated by the civil war;
most of the population is living below the official poverty line;2 and the government’s large
workforce, ambitious investment program, and heavy debt-servicing commitments will keep
public spending high.
5.
This report focuses on four key issues: (i) strengthening macroeconomic
management and achieving sustained low inflation; (ii) reducing short-term external
vulnerability; (iii) improving transparency, particularly with respect to oil resources and the
activities of the national oil company, Sonangol; and (iv) preparing the ground for a
restoration of public services and a favorable agricultural and commercial environment.

The FAO has projected that cereal output will be in excess of 700,000 tons in 2004. Before the civil war,
cereal production averaged about 560,000 tons for a population of less than half its current size.

It is estimated that 80 percent of the road network is in extremely poor condition; only a small part of the rail
network is currently open; electricity distribution is limited and unreliable; and only a third of the population
has access to safe water. Landmines are a continued impediment to activity.

According to the staff’s initial estimates, the fiscal deficit declined substantially

on the government of fuel subsidies was alleviated by two large step increases in the retail
prices of petroleum products, taking gasoline prices from about US$ 0.44 in April 2004 to
about US$1.50 a gallon by November 2004.
9.
Although unification of the budget, together with increased information about
oil revenues, has significantly improved fiscal transparency, considerable uncertainty
still surrounds the fiscal estimates. The independent oil diagnostic study, published by the
government in May 2004, was unable to achieve a full reconciliation of recorded oil revenue
payments in 2000 and no analysis has yet been done for subsequent years.6 Coverage of data
from the new financial management and information system (SIGFE) has been incomplete.
Moreover, the government has only limited information on the quasi-fiscal activities of the
national oil company, Sonangol (see Box).
10.
Reduced reliance on the domestic banking sector (and particularly the central
bank) to fund the public sector
has contributed to a sharp fall in
the growth rate of the monetary
aggregates (Tables 3 and 4).
Reserve money growth fell from
160 percent in the 12 months before

-8reserve money can be attributed primarily to net foreign currency intervention in this period,
estimated at about US$1.2 billion, using proceeds from external borrowing and higher sales
of government securities. Domestic open market operations—which started with the
introduction of central bank bills in 1999―were strengthened from July 2003 through the
introduction of treasury bills with maturities of between 28 and 182 days. Longer-term bonds
(two- to seven-year) were also issued to clear arrears of US$274 million to domestic
suppliers. As the domestic debt market deepened, commercial banks developed new
instruments, including repurchase agreements and bankers’ acceptances7

Box. Oil: Production and Government Revenues
Oil output, currently about 1 million barrels per day (bpd), accounts for about half of GDP. Receipts from oil sales
exceeded US$13 billion in 2004, of which about US$5.6 billion accrued to the government through tax revenue and its
rights under production sharing agreements to a proportion of oil output (“profit oil”).
Oil production has grown by over one third since 2001 and is expected to reach 2 million bpd by 2007 with growth
coming mainly from deep and ultra-deep water production blocks, including blocks 14, 15, and 17 (Figure A). Over US$4
billion was invested in 2003-04 by international oil companies.

Two different regimes characterize the
fiscal system in the oil industry. About 40
percent of production (primarily in the
older onshore and shallow water blocks in
Cabinda) falls under a tax and royalty
regime. This provides income to the
government through production taxes
(royalties), transaction taxes, and income
taxes. The remaining 60 percent is extracted
under Production Sharing Agreements
(PSAs), under which oil companies are able
to retain a fraction of oil (cost oil) to
recover investment and other costs. The
remaining portion (profit oil) is shared
between the companies and the
government. Oil companies pay income
taxes on their share of profit oil.

Government’s share of total oil receipts declined from 52 percent in 2001 to 41 percent in 2004 (Figure B). This
partly reflected a shift in the composition of production toward new blocks, where companies are able to deduct high
investment costs, a trend which is expected to continue for several years (see “Selected Issues’ section on oil revenues).
However, the government’s share has even been declining in mature blocks, where—despite some necessary
reinvestment—amortization costs are unlikely to be as large.
Despite important recent improvements

The national assembly has recently considered legislation to consolidate existing oil tax provisions. A law has also
been drafted to require oil companies to route their export revenues through domestic rather than international banks.

After a widening of the external current account deficit in 2003, because of
higher imports of goods, and of services related to investments in the oil sector, Angola
moved into significant surplus
in 2004 as oil prices rose (Table

Angola continued to negotiate debt-restructuring deals outside the Paris Club, including with Germany and
Poland in 2003 and Portugal in 2004 (at an estimated cash cost of US$750 million, drawn from the US$2.35
billion oil-backed loan). A settlement with Russia was reported to have been concluded in 1997. Debt
negotiations are currently taking place with Hungary and Bulgaria.

Limited progress has been made on structural reform. The state continues to exert
a heavy influence in many sectors, while companies with privileged access dominate the
small private sector and noncompetitive practices are extensive. Privatization appears to have
stalled. The implications of a new land law are disputed, with commentators skeptical that its
provisions will resolve land use issues fairly or help smallholders have access to collateral.
The national diamond company, Endiama, continues to exercise both regulatory and
commercial functions. While some controls on the marketing of diamonds have been eased,
there is limited transparency concerning the supervision and taxation of the formal sector or
of the granting of rights for diamond extraction.10 Meanwhile, activities in the informal
sector, employing perhaps a quarter of a million people, have been subject to heavy
restriction.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
15.
Discussions focused on policy implementation and governance under three
broad themes.

10

•

How can Angola best sustain recent macroeconomic progress in the short term
against the background of still high inflation, sizeable overall public spending, and an
urgent need for spending on basic services and infrastructure?

•

How should Angola manage uncertain and volatile oil revenues?

•

How can the authorities prepare for a rapid resumption of private sector growth and
restore the livelihood of poor agricultural smallholders, who make up the majority of
the population?

See “Selected Issues” SM/05/69; 2/25/05, Section II

- 12 -

A. Macroeconomic Framework
16.
Reflecting large planned increases in oil production, and a sustained postconflict recovery in other sectors, GDP growth is projected to average 18 percent per
year in 2005–2007. This will provide an excellent opportunity to strengthen Angola’s fiscal
and external positions. However, the planned increases in capital spending, high debt
servicing commitments, and relatively low international reserves, together with uncertainty
about oil prices, may still leave the economy vulnerable to external shocks in the short
term.11
17.
The authorities underscored their commitment to achieving macroeconomic
stability. In the government economic program for 2005–06, the authorities project a
reduction in inflation to 15 percent during 2005 and to 10 percent during 2006. The staff
welcomed the authorities’ commitment and suggested that a swifter decline in the inflation
rate would more quickly increase domestic confidence and protect the living standards of the
poor. For a given inflation target, lower fiscal deficits would ease the pressure on real interest
rates and the real exchange rate, allow room for more private sector activity, and reduce the
external vulnerability of the economy.
Fiscal policy
18.
Staff project a fiscal surplus of about 4 percent of GDP in 2005, on the basis of
the authorities’ prudent formulation of the 2005 budget and Angolan oil prices of
US$39 per barrel. The budget was designed to restrict the current deficit of the central
government to levels consistent with only limited recourse to domestic finance at a
conservative oil price (US$26.5 per barrel); any revenues in excess of those budgeted would
be placed, in the first instance, in a foreign currency oil reserve account. In line with the
budget’s expenditure ceilings, staff projects a reduction in current spending in real terms in
2005. While the public sector workforce is planned to increase by about 12 percent,
reflecting recruitment of an additional 60,000 education and health workers, spending on
goods and services will be cut sharply and subsidies will be reduced; the authorities are
committed to increasing the retail prices of gasoline and other oil products to levels sufficient
to cover ex-refinery prices, local costs and margins, and duties. Staff projects a strong
increase in capital spending in real terms, but assumes a substantial shortfall compared with
the ceilings in the budget, which imply a more than doubling of outlays; the authorities
indicated that expected constraints in domestic capacity and arranging external financing
would limit the speed at which projects could be authorized. The projected fiscal surplus, and
an assumed rundown in the government’s foreign currency deposits, is expected to be
sufficient to finance Angola’s extensive amortization commitments during 2005 without
recourse to new external borrowing.
11

The staff’s medium-term projections are based on the interim WEO projections for oil prices, which imply
that the average price for Angolan oil will rise from US$36.4 per barrel in 2004 to US$39.2 per barrel in 2005,
and then decline steadily to US$33.2 in 2009 (Table 1).

- 13 -

19.
Staff pointed out that a sharper fiscal adjustment would provide room for the
authorities to seek a more rapid reduction in monetary growth rates and hence a more
ambitious inflation objective in the short term. This would still leave scope for an increase
in public spending in real terms given the strong increase in GDP growth. Staff noted that
this scenario would reduce Angola’s vulnerability to shifts in the oil price. It would also limit
the real appreciation of the exchange rate from rising government spending and, together
with structural measures to strengthen the private sector (see below), would improve the
climate for private investment.
20.
The authorities were reluctant to trim public expenditure because of pressing
needs to restore the country’s infrastructure and provide social services. The staff
agreed that priority should be given to these sectors, but noted that, with government
spending already very high (over 40 percent of GDP, or US$ 8 billion, in 2004), social sector
spending could be raised substantially by reallocating expenditure within the total
expenditure envelope. Measures could include eradicating “ghost” workers on the
government payroll, cutting back on unessential military and administrative personnel, and
improving procurement procedures. Tax revenues could also be increased through improved
collection procedures, fewer customs exemptions, and a review of tax rates.
21.
Staff noted that the government’s conservative approach to projecting oil
revenues in the budget could form a useful basis on which the construct a medium-term
framework for fiscal policy. Revenue in such a framework would be evaluated at a longterm oil price, rather than current actual prices or short-term projections. The appropriate
level of public spending would then be determined by the need to secure a medium-term
target for the overall balance (at the long-term oil price). Such an approach would reduce
cyclicality in spending and provide protection against future financing shortfalls. As in the
government’s budget strategy, any excess of actual oil revenues, above the level evaluated at
the long-term oil price, would initially be saved as part of the foreign exchange reserves, or
perhaps be used to substitute for external borrowings, to clear arrears, or to amortize debt.
Conversely, however, given the economy’s current external vulnerability, any cumulated
shortfalls of revenue might need to be offset fairly quickly through fiscal adjustments.
Decisions about the appropriate proportion of the balance to leave in the reserves, or perhaps
whether to use the resources to finance capital at high expected relative rates of return, would
be determined in future budgets.

- 14 -

22.
In staff’s medium-term projections, the overall fiscal balance is projected at a
small deficit in 2006-09 when revenue is evaluated at the long-term oil price (Text Table
3). However, since

23.
With regard to fiscal management, the authorities accepted the urgent need to
implement many of the improvements identified in the World Bank’s Public
Expenditure Management and Financial Review and by other external advisers. They
were optimistic that fiscal monitoring will be considerably improved once the SIGFE system
becomes operationally effective (now planned for the second quarter of 2005) and a fiscal
programming unit is established, with the support of USAID, in the Ministry of Finance.
These developments would permit real-time tracking of all revenue and non-interest
spending commitments and payments, apart from those associated with the oil sector. Staff
stressed the importance of quickly bringing Sonangol’s revenue payments and quasi-fiscal
spending within these arrangements.
Monetary and exchange rate policy
24.
The authorities and the staff differed somewhat in their interpretation of the
“hard kwanza” policy. The authorities argued that the relative stability in the nominal
exchange rate had been a consequence rather than a target of their successful stabilization
efforts: foreign exchange intervention had been largely passive, reflecting previous staff
advice that government receipts in foreign currency should immediately be sold to the
market. The staff clarified that this advice related specifically to sales of foreign currency

39 percent in subsequent years.

revenue from the oil sector in advance of government domestic spending (“ex ante
sterilization”), rather than to foreign currency intervention funded by external borrowing.
Staff noted that, while the hard kwanza policy had been effective in lowering inflation, it had
depended on expensive oil-backed loans to provide the foreign currency necessary to control
monetary aggregates while keeping the exchange rate broadly stable. Staff agreed that
Angola should not adopt a formal fixed exchange rate given its low level of reserves and
uncertainty regarding oil prices. A flexibly managed money-based stabilization program,
based on a tight fiscal stance, would better suit its circumstances.
25.
The authorities indicated that, during 2005, monetary policy would be directed
primarily toward ensuring that growth in the monetary aggregates would be consistent
with consumer price inflation of 15 percent or less. To strengthen monetary control,
efforts would be made to extend the range of domestic debt instruments, and, while no
commitment was made on foreign exchange rate intervention, no exchange rate target was
envisaged. Staff suggested that future losses by the central bank should be avoided and that
consideration could be given to recapitalizing the bank.
26.
In the light of concern that the domestic economy currently receives little direct
benefit from the oil sector, the authorities composed a draft law requiring foreign oil
companies to deposit the bulk of their export receipts initially in banks licensed in Angola.
The proposal encountered strong resistance from the oil companies. The staff cautioned that
the annual flows in question are several times greater than the banking system’s current
deposit base and that the levels of bank charges, clearance times, and range of services
indicate weak competition. Noting recent high levels of excess liquidity in the banking
sector, staff suggested that macroeconomic and structural factors, and banks’ attitudes toward
risk, are more likely to explain the current low levels of credit extended to the private sector.
External prospects and policy
27.
The external current account is projected to remain in substantial surplus
(exceeding US$1 billion per year, equivalent to 4 percent of GDP) over the medium
term as a result of rising oil production and higher oil prices. Nevertheless, stress tests
indicate that Angola will remain vulnerable to external shocks for some years: at end-2004,
the ratio of the NPV of external debt to net exports14 was around 300 percent and
international reserves were relatively low.15 There is a risk that financing gaps could quickly
reemerge if, for example, the oil price were to fall quickly to its long-term level or below.
28.
Staff expressed concern about the new US$2.35 billion oil-backed loan from
commercial banks, given the improved external financing situation during 2004, and
14

Net exports are defined here as total exports less expenses related to oil production (imports of capital goods,
services, and profit remittances).
15

- 16 -

the advice of the Executive Board to phase out costly oil-backed commercial finance. In
particular, bearing in mind the low returns on foreign currency reserves, staff could see little
justification for drawing US$900 million from the facility in 2004 purely to finance future
fiscal deficits. The authorities indicated that they would not pursue further oil-backed
commercial loans. Procedures were discussed to facilitate access to alternative sources of
finance, including conventional foreign currency bond issues by the government. Staff also
noted that the authorities could usefully disclose all of the government’s external debt
operations.
29.
While the rising real exchange rate has reduced external competitiveness, the
authorities observed that its current high level mainly reflects Angola’s dependence on
oil, recent rises in oil prices, and the short-term impact of macroeconomic stabilization.
Given the current small size of Angola’s non-oil traded goods sector, the authorities consider
the impact of the real appreciation on overall private sector activity to be of secondary
importance relative to that of the economy’s deficient infrastructure. While agreeing that the
growing oil sector was likely to be creating upward pressure on Angola’s equilibrium real
exchange rate, the staff noted that heavy foreign exchange intervention, funded by
borrowing, and excessive fiscal deficits during 2003 and early 2004, had strengthened the
real exchange rate even further and contributed to the apparently non-competitive situation of
much of domestic agriculture as well as other non-oil private sector activity.
30.
Export tariffs have been eliminated, as the staff recommended during the last
Article IV Consultation, except for ivory, pearls, and animals. Import tariffs, which now
fall in six bands (2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 percent) declined, on average, from 17 to 14 percent
between 2002 and 2004. However, there are still special regimes for the petroleum and
mining sectors. Angola will be involved in negotiations to join the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) Free Trade Area during 2005 and will participate in
discussions on the European Union’s planned Economic Partnership arrangements in the
southern Africa group. Angola joined the integrated framework for trade-related technical
assistance in June 2004. A customs reform program is under way.
31.
Under IMF Article VIII, Angola continues to maintain an exchange restriction
in the form of limits on the remittances of dividends and profits from foreign
investments that do not exceed US$100,000.16 This is applied under Article 9.3 of Private
Investment Law No. 11/03 of May 13, 2003. The authorities gave no indication of their
intentions regarding this restriction. The staff does not recommend its approval
B. Transparency and Governance
32.
The authorities provided evidence of progress in increasing transparency. They
noted, in particular: the unification of the budget; the establishment of a single treasury
16

Restrictions" (EBD/04/140, 12/17/04, p. 6).

account at the National Bank of Angola (BNA); the publication of the oil diagnostic study;
the release of oil revenue data on the website of the Ministry of Finance; the conduct of
external audits of the 2003 financial statements of the BNA and Sonangol; and the
compilation of comprehensive data on external debt. Elsewhere, progress is under way.
Sonangol and the Ministry of Finance are reportedly close to signing a protocol on the
management, recording, and reconciliation of financial flows. An independent consultant
may soon be commissioned, with World Bank support, to work on updating and using the
revenue-forecasting model designed for the oil diagnostic study. Other recommendations of
the oil diagnostic study, such as transferring Sonangol’s role as government concessionaire to
the Ministry of Petroleum and establishing a unit to scrutinize Angola’s oil revenues, are
under consideration. The government has also indicated its interest in participating in the
Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative. Furthermore, Angola was the first country to
implement full certification of origin for diamond exports.
33.
Staff commended the advances that had been made in the presentation of fiscal
data and in auditing arrangements, and urged further efforts to strengthen governance
and transparency, especially with regard to oil revenue. Swift implementation of the main
recommendations of the oil diagnostic study, and specification of a timetable for meeting
other undertakings made by the authorities, would be important next steps.
•

Transfer of Sonangol’s functions as regulator and government concessionaire to other
agencies would permit Sonangol and its subsidiaries to pursue commercial activities
free of conflicts of interest that are perceived to inhibit competition and divert rents.

•

Establishment of a government oil revenue management unit, making active use of
the oil revenue model, and more independent auditing of oil companies, would
improve the authorities’ capacity to effectively monitor and project oil revenues and
confirm that oil taxes, “profit oil” allocations and other payments are being rigorously
assessed and remitted. Staff noted in this regard that limitations in current
arrangements with Sonangol inhibited effective control of a major part of government
revenue, as reflected in the time taken to provide staff with information on
Sonangol’s foreign currency accounts holding revenue due to the government.17

•

Transparency could also be considerably improved if Sonangol’s quasi-fiscal
activities were transferred to government and oil companies were allowed and
encouraged to publish details of their payments to the government.

34.
The staff also emphasized the need for transparency, and a clear and
independent regulatory framework, in the diamond, forestry and fishing sectors. Staff
noted that governance in the diamond sector would benefit from the separation of the
17

“profit oil” due under production sharing arrangements in excess of debt servicing requirements.

- 18 -

regulatory and licensing functions of Endiama from its commercial operations, and further
measures to liberalize diamond marketing, together with a stable legislative environment.
C. Structural Issues
35.
The staff noted widespread evidence of oligopolistic behavior and costly
bureaucratic procedures,18 including high and apparently rising margins on the
domestic prices of imported goods. The staff urged the authorities to adopt measures to
streamline bureaucracy, reduce corruption and privileged access to markets, and enhance
competition, including through contract enforcement. The authorities pointed out that they
had made a useful start in improving the tendering and auditing of public sector procurement
contracts, including by increasing staff levels at the Tribunal of Accounts.
36.
One conundrum facing Angola is how best to facilitate a recovery in commercial
agriculture. While improvements in transport infrastructure are desperately needed to
provide access to seeds and fertilizer, and to open up marketing opportunities, many
producers may be unable to compete with imported food at the current exchange rates once
road links have been fully restored. Nevertheless, given the risks of inefficiency and
corruption, the staff cautioned against renewed public sector involvement in providing inputs
or marketing. Assistance from the World Bank in this area could facilitate policy
formulation.
D. PRSP and Poverty Reduction
37.
Progress has been made in compiling the first PRSP, but consultation with civil
society has so far been limited, and implementation of policies to deal systematically
with poverty reduction appears slow. Support from international partners should enable the
authorities to complete critical sections of the PRSP that link poverty-reduction objectives to
specific budgetary proposals and ensure a consistent macroeconomic framework. These are
likely to imply a need for substantial changes in the composition of public expenditure.
38.
The authorities discussed possible proposals to limit the adverse impact on
consumers of future rises in the price of gasoline and other oil products, including
travel vouchers for civil servants and students. The staff suggested that assistance might
better be focused specifically on low-income users of public transport, particularly in the
Luanda area, and to poor households affected by higher distribution costs. The authorities
have welcomed plans by donors to study the social and poverty impact of the removal of oil
subsidies.

18

The World Bank report “The Cost of Doing Business”(September 2004) rated Angola as one of the least
conducive business climates in the world.

- 19 -

E. Discussions on a Possible Staff-Monitored Program
39.
The authorities, noting progress toward the requirements specified during the
2003 Article IV Consultation, confirmed their wish to move to an SMP as a possible
precursor to a Fund-supported program. These developments should help to obtain a
rescheduling of Angola’s external debt in the context of a Paris Club agreement, donor
support to finance the reconstruction of the economy, and an improved climate for other
borrowing. Staff agreed that considerable advances had been made on transparency and
publication of macroeconomic data, compilation of external debt data, consideration of oil
taxation issues, and coordination of fiscal and monetary policy. Key areas to be covered in
the formulation of an SMP would include, among other things: further steps in reporting
foreign currency balances and external debt commitments and in reconciling oil revenue
flows; a fleshed-out macroeconomic framework to support a further reduction in inflation
and the establishment of sustainable fiscal and external positions; a strategy for phasing out
Angola’s dependency on oil-backed loans; and arrangements to ensure regular data reporting
to enable the program to be effectively monitored.
F. Technical Assistance
40.
During 2003–04, technical assistance from IFIs, other bilateral and multilateral
institutions, and donors was directed both toward improving the compilation and
dissemination of macroeconomic statistics and helping to address policy issues. The IMF
fielded missions on public expenditure management; monetary policy and operations;
banking supervision; sovereign foreign currency bond issues; and statistics on the balance of
payments, government finance and debt, and (under the GDDS) consumer prices and national
accounts. With the assistance of Fund staff, the authorities hired advisers to help them
compile external debt data and government finance statistics.
G. Statistical Issues
41.
Angola’s statistical system remains weak. Monetary data and external debt data
have improved in recent years, but serious deficiencies remain in fiscal, external and real
sector statistics. Reflecting four staff visits in 2003–04, a work program is being
implemented to produce sound data on external debt, fiscal, and balance of payments
statistic. The authorities have recently provided data on the government’s international
investment position and official reserves. Nonetheless, the data need to be reconciled with
other sources of information.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
42.
Angola has made useful advances in macroeconomic management since the
peace settlement of April 2002. There has been a decisive break from the past record of
large fiscal and quasi-fiscal deficits, money creation, and high inflation. The unification of
the budget, the publication of oil revenue information, and the increased use of independent
external auditors have made government operations more transparent. Technical
improvements have been implemented in data collection, budgetary processes, and monetary

- 20 -

operations with the help of technical assistance supported by the international community.
The macroeconomic environment is beginning to stabilize.
43.
Angola has substantial medium-term potential, but faces daunting short-term
challenges. Average income levels in Angola could become among the highest in Africa as a
result of rising oil production, extensive diamond resources, and plentiful arable land.
However, the legacy of fiscal profligacy and corruption during Angola’s civil war includes
sizeable short-term external debt, a large public sector payroll, and state institutions that still
exercise overwhelming market power with limited accountability. The inflation rate remains
high. Poverty is chronic, with income levels of most of the population below US$2 a day;
health and social indicators are among the lowest in the world. Even to begin establishing a
business requires an unusually long series of bureaucratic steps and political connections.
44.
Sustained progress in three areas would help Angola achieve its medium-term
potential: macroeconomic management; transparency and other areas of governance;
and structural reform. First, a macroeconomic framework needs to be developed and
implemented to maintain low inflation, orient fiscal policy to the medium term, and limit
external vulnerability in the context of volatile oil prices. This will require firm establishment
of fiscal discipline, particularly to minimize procyclical spending as oil prices vary. Second,
given its vast natural wealth, Angola would benefit from greater transparency with regard to
revenues from oil and other resources, as well as fiscal operations. Third, structural reform
measures, particularly to improve competition, are needed to develop the non-oil private
sector, which encompasses the great majority of the population.
45.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ practice of budgeting on a conservative oil price
and suggests its extension to a medium-term framework that would promote fiscal
discipline and minimize the risk of procyclical spending. In this framework, government
spending would be set according to an assessment of the fiscal position based on a long-term
oil price. Any excess of actual oil revenues from prices above this level could be used—
within the normal budgetary process—to amortize debt, clear arrears, and reduce new
external borrowing, or could be saved as international reserves and eventually used to finance
productive capital programs. On the other hand, given the economy’s current external
vulnerability, any cumulated shortfalls of revenue might need to be offset fairly quickly
through fiscal adjustments.
46.
Staff supports the authorities’ goal to increase public spending on much-needed
infrastructure and to provide social services but, given the already high level of public
spending, would stress the need to reallocate from other spending. Fuel subsidies are
inefficient and regressive in Angola and staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to eliminate
these, with appropriate protection provided for low-income households. Staff encourages the
full and speedy implementation of the SIGFE management information system and
strengthening administrative capacity in order to improve the control and monitoring of
government expenditure. Fiscal transparency and monetary management would be improved
by transferring all government holdings of foreign exchange to the central bank, within
international reserves.

- 21 -

47.
The authorities’ commitment to lowering inflation is commendable and staff
would encourage a more ambitious inflation objective in the short term, achieved
through a flexibly managed money-based stabilization supported by fiscal restraint.
Achievement of ambitious inflation targets will directly assist the poor and help counter
further dollarization of the economy. While the “hard kwanza” policy has broken the
inflationary cycle, and policy would need to pay due regard to the exchange rate, Angola
should not adopt a formal exchange rate target, which would entail substantial risks in the
face of uncertain oil prices, weak fiscal control, and a low level of foreign exchange reserves.
To increase the effectiveness of monetary control, the authorities should extend the range of
domestic debt instruments. Further operating deficits of the central bank should be avoided
and consideration given to recapitalizing and restructuring the central bank.
48.
Improvements in governance and transparency in the management of its
considerable resource wealth are central to Angola’s achievement of its full potential.
Staff encourages the authorities to implement the main recommendations of the oil diagnostic
study and to consider comparable measures in the diamond sector. Key steps include the
transfer of Sonangol’s functions as regulator and government concessionaire to other
agencies; the establishment of a government oil revenue management unit; and more rigorous
reconciliation and analysis of tax payments and profit oil allocations by international oil
companies and Sonangol. In a similar vein, Endiama’s regulatory and licensing functions
could be separated from its commercial operations and diamond marketing liberalized
further.
49.
These improvements would also facilitate greater fiscal transparency.
Independent regulatory agencies and revenue management units would enable more
comprehensive data and assessments to be produced and published on a regular basis. The
replacement of Sonangol’s quasi-fiscal operations, including the servicing of oil-backed
loans and provision of subsidized fuel, by more conventional arrangements, would permit
more effective control and accountability within the budget.
50.
Over the medium term, the authorities might focus on ways of creating a
liberalized and competitive climate for private sector investment and growth.
Facilitating contract enforcement is key. The government could also formulate a systematic
program to reduce bureaucratic costs and delays and promote effective competition in the
private sector. In doing so, it would stimulate growth and employment in the non-oil sector
and also strengthen the potential for sustained poverty reduction. Finalization of the PRSP
would help formalize these processes.
51.
Agreement on a Fund staff-monitored program could help Angola establish a
track record of performance, which could prepare the ground for future use of Fund
resources and the provision of donor financial assistance, including debt rescheduling.
52.
It is recommended that the next Article IV Consultation mission with Angola take
place on the standard 12-month cycle.

Exchange Arrangements: Angola follows “managed floating with no pre-announced
path for the exchange rate”. The value of the kwanza has floated since the foreign exchange
market was liberalized on May 28, 1999. The parallel market rates remained, with some
exceptions, within a range of plus or minus 10 percent of the official rates through 2003.
There is a buying reference exchange rate and a selling reference exchange rate, both
calculated as a weighted average of all BNA transactions that took place during the previous
day.
During 1999, Angola removed most restrictions under Article VIII when exchange rate
transactions were liberalized and a new trade regime was approved. Angola maintains
exchange restrictions subject to approval under Article VIII in the form of limits on
remittances of profits and dividends from foreign investments that do not exceed
US$100,000. Angola continues to maintain the following exchange restrictions under the
transitional arrangements of Article XIV: limits on the availability of foreign exchange for
invisible transactions, such as travel, medical, or educational allowances; and limits on
unrequited transfers to foreign-based individuals and institutions. The limits on the
availability of foreign exchange for certain invisible transactions, such as travel, medical and
educational expenses, have lately been increased: individuals can buy up to US$5,000
without any documentation and up to US$10,000 with travel documents.

APPENDIX II

Angola: IMF-World Bank Relations
Partnership in Angola’s post-conflict recovery
1.
The Bank’s response to Angola’s post-conflict situation is anchored on a two-stage
support strategy. The first stage involved a Transitional Support Strategy (TSS), submitted to
the Board in March 2003. The Bank is now seeking approval for the next phase of assistance
under a new Interim Support Strategy (ISS), covering the period January 2005 through June
2006. The Interim Support Strategy is organized around three pillars: (i) intensifying
provision of pro-poor basic services and rehabilitated infrastructure; (ii) enhancing
governance and intensifying capacity development; and (iii) further preparing the ground for
broad-based pro-poor economic growth. The ISS will be submitted to the Bank’s Board of
Executive Directors in February 2005.
2.
The IMF is supporting Angola through policy advice and technical assistance. Two
staff-monitored programs were launched in 2000–01 but expired without establishing the
track record required for a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement. The
senior management of the Bretton Woods Institutions has indicated to the Angolan
authorities that financial support is contingent on the country’s establishing a track record,
possibly in the context of a new SMP.
3.
Bank and Fund staff members have worked very closely together on several issues of
strategic relevance for Angola, including public expenditure management and policy,
structural reforms, and monitoring of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) process.
Some examples of recent Bank-Fund collaboration are summarized in Table 1.
Bank Group strategy and lending operations
4.
The three pillars of the ISS are supported by a combination of financial and
nonfinancial instruments. The following new projects are to be actively considered.
•

EMRP: The Emergency Multisector Rehabilitation Program (EMRP) will be
financed in two phases, reflecting resource constraints in the final year of IDA-13.
Financing of US$51 million for the first phase in FY05 includes a grant equivalent to
US$25 million. A second phase, with financing of about US$150 million, is planned
for FY06. The EMRP will fund activities in rural development and social services
(US$66 million); rehabilitation and reconstruction of critical infrastructure
(US$124 million); sector development strategies and capacity development
(US$10 million); and management, monitoring, evaluation ($12 million). The Bank’s
US$200 million support to EMRP is part of Angola’s US$2 billion “Priority Phase
Rehabilitation and Reconstruction” program.

•

Health and Education Training Project: This project (FY06/07) would respond to
the pervasive deficits in health and education in post-conflict Angola and complement
the rapid buildup in social and physical infrastructure (such as educational and health
facilities) financed under other projects.

- 36 -

APPENDIX II

•

Rural Development Project: The proposed rural development project (FY06/07)
would build on Angola’s new agricultural strategy and might include diversification
to cash crops for export, and the development of smallholder agriculture for food
security, building on planned investments in seed multiplication and road and social
infrastructure under other projects.

•

Urban/Rural Water Project: The project would be designed to promote sustainable
water supply and sanitation operations in the most deprived urban and/or rural areas
chosen on the basis of the ability of the provincial governments to achieve agreedupon target policies. It would augment interventions planned under the EMRP.

5.
New nonlending services would focus on (i) advisory services for implementation of
the Angola’s ongoing economic program; (ii) analytical work to strengthen the knowledge
base of the authorities and the implementation of their ECP; and (iii) additional core
diagnostics necessary for the preparation of an effective longer-term program of Bank Group
support under a CAS. The key components are the following:
•

Country Economic Memorandum (CEM): Initiated under the TSS and having as its
theme “Growth with Equity,” the CEM will revolve around six main themes:
(i) medium-term macroeconomic and fiscal adjustment; (ii) macroeconomic
aspects of oil revenue management; (iii) the economics and governance of the
diamond sector; (iv) the growth-inequality-poverty relationship; (v) trade,
structural reforms, and private sector development; and (vi) rural development and
agricultural growth. In connection with the CEM, there will also be an assessment
of natural resource management and an environmental issues study on the social
impact of the elimination of oil, water, and electricity subsidies. The CEM will
incorporate an interim poverty assessment, using the limited household survey data
currently available for Angola, and a country social assessment.

•

Public Expenditure Review (PER): The PEMFAR (Public expenditure
Management and Financial Review)would be complemented by a PER that would
focus on: assessing Angola’s expenditure priorities across and within functions,
given resource constraints and distributional objectives; examining the link between
expenditure inputs and outcomes; and assessing the public sector’s institutional
arrangements (including political incentives). It would also provide suggestions for
reforming incentives and institutions as needed to improve the efficacy of public
spending.

•

Investment Climate Assessment (ICA): The objective of the ICA would be to
evaluate the investment climate in Angola in all its operational dimensions, and to
identify policies to strengthen the private sector. Results would feed into future
Bank Group operations and technical assistance. The ICA could also be used to
provide potential investors with information on the business environment.

- 37 -

APPENDIX II

•

Capacity Development Assessment: The Bank, in collaboration with other
donors, will promote a policy dialogue with the government and civil society on
how best to address the capacity building challenge. It will identify and engage
those elements of government and civil society that are concerned and
knowledgeable about the country’s deficits in collaboration with interested
donors.

•

Maximizing In-country and World Bank Group Support: Efforts will be made to
strengthen the Country Office’s fiduciary capacity (procurement and financial
management) and in-house technical capability (for example, dedicated rural and
other specialists).

6.
IFC is currently in negotiations for possible investments in the infrastructure, general
manufacturing, and private education sectors. In the oil sector, IFC will continue to seek to
identify projects that maximize local benefits and that can be used as entry points into the
sector. IFC also aims to play a role in promoting private participation in infrastructure
sectors, capital market development activities, and advisory services to the government in
privatization and structuring concessions. In addition, IFC will step up its activities that
provide technical assistance to entrepreneurs in the small and medium business sectors, with
a greater planned role for the newly restructured African Project Development Facility.
7.
MIGA’s guaranteed support for investments could become increasingly important in
Angola, given international perceptions of the political risks associated with the country.
Resolution by the authorities of two long-standing small investment disputes being
investigated by MIGA should help MIGA and the Angolan authorities be in a position to
tackle new opportunities.
8.
It is proposed to assess Angola’s performance against a set of general post-conflict
indicators, and a smaller number of specific indicators, based on actions initiated under the
TSS. These would support movement to a results-based CAS by the end of CY06. A likely
results matrix for the CAS could revolve around priorities set under the PRSP and emphasize
joint outcomes centering on continuing support to the authorities for medium- and long-term
development planning, transparent management of mineral and nonmineral resources for
growth and development, enhanced capacity development, rural development, and improved
access to basic services and infrastructure.
IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
9.
The IMF and World Bank staffs worked very closely in designing and monitoring the
two most recent SMPs (April–December 2000 and January–June 2001). After the latest SMP
expired in June 30, 2001, Bank and Fund staff members continued to work together on
various aspects of Angola’s economic reform process: structural and transparency-related
reforms, public expenditure management issues, the interim PRSP, and macroeconomic
stabilization. Bank staff joined an IMF staff visit to Angola in January 2003 to assess the
country’s macroeconomic situation in 2002 and also participated in the Article IV
Consultation missions of April 29–May 14, 2003, and of July 2004. The IMF Resident
Representative participated in important meetings during the Bank missions for the

APPENDIX II

- 38 -

PEMFAR for Angola in May 2002 and March 2003. Bank staff assisted in the preparation of
key IMF documents, such as staff reports and memoranda of economic and financial policies.
IMF staff also provided input into relevant World Bank documents: transitional support staff,
mission aide-mémoires, Project Appraisal Document/Technical Annex for Bank operations
for Angola, and concept papers for proposed Bank economic and sector work.

2003 a package of fiscal and
monetary measures, whose main
stated objective is to “contain
dollarization” of the Angolan
economy.

The Fund has provided advice to
the Angolan central bank on a
broad range of issues and the Bank
will provide further support to
central bank operations – including
RTGS– through the EMTA credit.

Other structural reforms

The lapsed SMPs contained several
structural reform initiatives, many
of which are still under way, albeit
at different stages of progress.

Bank and Fund staff worked
closely on the past two SMPs and
coauthored a note on price subsidy
reforms in Angola.

APPENDIX III

Angola: Statistical Issues
1.
Angola participates in a GDDS project for Lusophone African countries and receives
technical assistance in various statistical areas under the project. The authorities have
committed to use the GDDS as the framework to develop and improve the country’s
statistical system. Metadata for the macroeconomic sectors and socio-demographic indicators
are posted on the IMF’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB).
2.
Several technical assistance missions in 2003 and 2004 provided key advice to the
Angolan government on the compilation of macroeconomic statistics. As a result, work
programs were prepared on national accounts, prices, external debt, fiscal, and balance of
payments statistics. The target is to provide sound economic statistics to all users by mid2005. Support is being provided by the IMF, the World Bank, and USAID and includes the
hiring of local and foreign consultants. So far, progress has been slow in most areas. A threeweek regional national accounts course undertaken in Maputo, Mozambique, in the context
of the GDDS project, was attended by five compilers from the Angolan National Statistics
Institute (INE).
3.
National accounts and prices. The national accounts are of poor quality, with breaks
in time series and inconsistencies across sectors. Annual GDP at constant prices is estimated
at previous-year prices using tentative deflators. Official GDP estimates are produced only
by industry. There are no estimates of GDP by expenditure. Disaggregated data on
manufacturing production are rarely available, and data on agricultural production include
only rough estimates. A lack of statistical offices at the province level significantly constrains
the data coverage. Three IMF national accounts statistics missions have undertaken in the
context of the GDDS project in 2003–04. These missions evaluated the sources and statistical
techniques used in the compilation of the national accounts, made recommendations for
improvement, designed a strategy for implementing the System of National Accounts 1993,
provided training, and coordinated a technical assistance program with the World Bank in the
context of the Economic Management Capacity Building Project. The consumer price index
(CPI) is based on a basket of goods and services for which prices are collected in Luanda.
The CPI weights were revised in January 2002 based on a household survey conducted in
2001. There are no wholesale or producer price indices. Technical assistance in price
statistics from the INE of Portugal took place in August 2004.
4.
Money and banking statistics. The authorities introduced a new plan of accounts for
financial institutions in early 2001 and began to compile data on foreign assets and liabilities
in accordance with the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. These data will contribute
to a clearer sectorization of the economy and the proper classification of financial
instruments in the accounts of the central bank and the commercial banks. If implemented,
the recent recommendations of an external audit of the accounts of the central bank will
improve accounting procedures and the quality of the monetary data. Pending problems
include delays in compiling monetary statistics owing to weak accounting procedures in
state-owned banks. A recent monetary and financial statistics mission advised the authorities
to complete the derivation of the monetary survey from available on-line balance sheet data

- 40 -

APPENDIX III

for the commercial banks and the central bank balance sheet data. There is a need to
strengthen the central bank’s internal control procedures, particularly for external
transactions, and to follow a consistent approach on the valuation adjustment of foreign
currency-denominated accounts.
5.
Fiscal accounts. Although a system of accounts has been in place at the Ministry of
Finance for some time, it is not yet fully operational. In particular, relevant procedures and
mechanisms are often absent, incomplete, or inadequate. There are major problems in the
data, particularly in the timeliness and accuracy of oil revenues, grants, and expenditures. For
capital expenditure, the classification system provides little analytic insight, and coverage is
incomplete. Angola’s participation in the GDDS project aims at improving the quality and
timeliness of fiscal data. A government finance statistics mission took place in May-June
2003 and made many recommendations for improvement. The Ministry of Finance has
started publishing data on government revenues from the oil sector on its website
(www.minfin.gv.ao); this site includes other budget execution data, although data posted are
outdated and inconsistent with the timeliness indicated on metadata posted on the Fund’s
GDDS site. The government has included Sonangol’s quasi-fiscal expenditure in the revised
budget and budget execution data for 2003 as part of the implementation of the SIGFE.
Angola also receives active technical assistance from FAD and the World Bank.
6.
External sector. Following the recommendations of STA balance of payments
statistics missions in 2002, 2003, and 2004, the authorities have adopted the classification
outlined in the fifth edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual. With assistance from
the March–April 2004 mission, the BNA compiled a quarterly balance of payment statistics
for 2002 and preliminary quarterly estimates for 2003. This mission designed a simple
international transactions reporting system to capture individual BOP transactions that pass
through the banking system in Angola, to be used as a source for compiling balance of
payments statistics.
7.
In general, the pace of implementation of recommendations has been very slow, and
the balance of payments compilation remains continue to suffer from a number of
deficiencies. Problems include difficulties in collecting data on the operations of the oil
companies, on the overseas accounts of large enterprises, and on foreign direct investment
(FDI). Furthermore, import data are weak, and detail on services and income components is
lacking Essential details in the financial account are not reported, owing to problems with the
proper and complete recording of the public sector’s external debt transactions, particularly
the debt restructuring and debt forgiveness operations.
8.
With regard to external debt data, the authorities have continued making efforts to
improve data management, following the recommendations of a joint IMF-World Bank
diagnostic mission that visited Angola in early December 2003. Overall compilation of
external debt data has improved, and the discrepancies between stocks and flows have
virtually disappeared. Since February 2004, the National Bank of Angola has contacted most
bilateral official creditors to request information on Angola’s arrears and debt obligations to
start reconciling authorities’ and creditors’ debt data. The BNA has also addressed many

- 41 -

APPENDIX III

software and hardware computer problems that have plagued data compilation. The BNA has
been assisted by an external consultant from the Central Bank of Bolivia and has received
technical assistance from UNCTAD on debt management and financial analysis system
software. Nevertheless, there remain concerns on data quality. The flow of information
between the various government agencies needs to be considerably strengthened as there are
still discrepancies between debt reporting from various agencies. Also, the development and
retention of human resources need to be addressed to maintain and improve the quality of the
debt data compilation.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
March 4, 2005

1.
This statement provides additional information that has become available since the
circulation of the staff report. The information does not change the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
2.
The monetary aggregates expanded more strongly than expected in December,
2004. For the 12 months to end-December 2004, currency in circulation grew by 39 percent,
reserve money grew by 46 percent and broad money M3 grew by 59 percent. Corresponding
estimates in the staff report were 27 percent, 30 percent and 46 percent respectively. The
faster monetary growth seems to have been associated primarily with larger-than-expected
end-year withdrawals from government deposits, perhaps associated with a concentration of
payments for the clearance of domestic arrears.
3.
Preliminary data on central government revenue, expenditure and borrowing
for 2004 suggest that, while government expenditure on an accruals basis was lower
than estimated in the staff report, the cash fiscal deficit for 2004 was similar to staff’s
estimate. However, these data are still provisional and incomplete.
4.
Consumer prices increased by nearly 2 percent in January 2005, in line with
expectations. On a 12-month basis, the inflation rate fell marginally to 30 percent.
5.
Retail prices of petroleum products were increased in February and March 2005
by 11 percent and 6 percent, respectively. There have been four increases since May 2004.
The price of a gallon of gasoline is now about US$1.75.
6.
At end-February 2005, the Kwanza exchange rate was 87 to the U.S. dollar, a
depreciation of approximately 9 percent since end-February 2004.
7.
A staff mission to Luanda is tentatively scheduled for the end of March to
discuss a possible SMP.

Directors observed that the envisaged improvements in resource management will
facilitate greater fiscal transparency. It was also noted that the unification of the budget,
the publication of oil revenue information, and the increased use of independent auditors
have helped to establish a good basis for more reliable fiscal information. Directors were
of the view that further progress in macroeconomic management will require building on
these achievements to produce comprehensive and timely data, not only in the fiscal
area, but also, under the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), on the external
accounts and the real economy.
Directors urged the authorities to take steps to create a liberalized and competitive
climate in order to improve medium-term prospects for private sector investment and
growth. Facilitating contract enforcement will be one key element. Directors also
encouraged the government to formulate a systematic program to reduce bureaucratic
costs and delays and promote effective competition in the private sector.
They welcomed the recent elimination of export tariffs and reduction of import tariffs,
which should help improve competitiveness, and suggested that the privatization
process be accelerated.
Directors stressed that, despite the recent rapid economic expansion, poverty remains
widespread in Angola. They considered that poverty reduction efforts will be greatly
aided by a clearly-articulated and effective poverty reduction strategy, and looked
forward to the completion of the PRSP in the coming months. Directors suggested that
the PRSP be informed by a broad-based consultative process and include a mediumterm expenditure framework carefully linked to the overall budget plans.
Directors noted that an agreement on a Fund staff-monitored program can help Angola
establish a track record of performance, which can prepare the ground for future use of
Fund resources and the provision of donor financial assistance, including debt
rescheduling.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Angola
On March 4, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV Consultation with Angola.1
Background
Since the end of violent conflict in April 2002, about 4 million displaced Angolans have returned to
their communities, supported by a government-led initiative to provide emergency food aid and
humanitarian assistance, involving UN agencies and other donors. Nevertheless, poverty remains
widespread. Income is highly concentrated, and health and social indicators are poor, although
prevalence rates for HIV/AIDS are lower than in most of southern Africa. The physical infrastructure
has been largely destroyed. In addition, the legacy of civil conflict includes sizable short-term
external debt, a large public sector payroll, and state institutions that hold dominant positions in
critical areas of the economy with limited accountability.
GDP grew by 11 percent in 2004, following a slowdown in growth in 2003, largely reflecting the
profile of oil production, which now accounts for half of GDP. The economy outside the extractive
sector is currently estimated to be growing by about 9 percent. Despite extensive landmines and
devastated infrastructure, which continue to restrict the availability of seed and fertilizer and impede
marketing, agricultural production (largely by households) has recently begun to recover. The other
principal identified sources of growth are construction and services.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

Inflation has declined substantially, to a 12-month rate of 31 percent in December 2004, following a
major change in macroeconomic policy implementation in September 2003, known as the “hard
kwanza” policy, which has largely stabilized the nominal exchange rate. This has involved
liberalization of the foreign exchange market, and active absorption of domestic liquidity by central
bank sales of foreign currency, to support a tightening in monetary policy based on improvements in
fiscal control and domestic debt sales. The growth rate of reserve money fell from 160 percent in the
12 months to September 2003 to 19 percent one year later.
Initial estimates indicate a substantial decline in the fiscal deficit between 2003 and 2004, reflecting
the rise in oil prices, lower real spending on goods and services, and policies to reduce fuel
subsidies, which raised gasoline prices to about US$1.50 per gallon by November 2004.
After a widening of the external current account deficit in 2003, caused in part by higher imports and
services related to investments in the oil sector, Angola moved into significant surplus in 2004 as oil
prices rose. Nevertheless, heavy gross external borrowing equivalent to 12 percent a year was
undertaken by the public sector in 2003-04. A total of US$3.4 billion was raised from commercial
banks in oil-backed loans and over US$0.5 billion was drawn from bilateral oil-backed credit lines.
As a result, despite the substantial sales of foreign currency by the central bank, gross international
reserves are estimated to have increased from US$0.4 billion at end-2002 to about US$2.2 billion at
end-2004 (two months of imports), including an estimated US$660 million accumulated in foreign
currency accounts managed by Sonangol on behalf of the government. Angola’s external debt was
estimated at US$9.5 billion at end-June 2004 (equivalent to about 49 percent of GDP) including late
interest and arrears.

Important improvements have been made in the last two years in the fiscal accounts and the
transparency of oil transactions. However, the independent oil diagnostic study published by the
government in May 2004 indicated significant weakness in the governance of the oil sector,
mainly reflecting continuing conflicts of interest as Sonangol, which acts as government
concessionaire and regulator, is also a major operator in oil extraction and a provider of
services to the industry. Sonangol’s spending on behalf of the government also remains outside
effective central government control and monitoring. The national diamond company Endiama
also continues to act under conflicts of interest and, despite some reforms in the sector,
transparency remains very limited.
Progress on structural reform and the implementation of policies to deal systematically with
poverty reduction has been limited. The state continues to exercise a heavy influence in many
sectors. Noncompetitive practices, privileged access, and costly bureaucratic procedures
hamper the growth of the non-oil private sector and contribute to high margins in domestic
prices. The privatization process appears to have stalled. The draft Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP) distributed in December 2003 has not yet been finalized.
Angola’s statistical system remains weak.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the restoration of peace in Angola starting in April 2002
and commended the authorities for successfully tackling the ambitious post-war
humanitarian and resettlement program. Equally, Directors commended the authorities
for the improvements in macroeconomic management since the peace agreement.
Noting the sharp reduction in inflation over the past year, Directors observed that a
decisive break appears to have been made from the previous record of large fiscal and
quasi-fiscal deficits, money creation, and high inflation. They also welcomed the initial
steps to improve transparency, including budget unification, the increased use of
independent auditors, and strengthening of data collection.
Looking ahead, Directors observed that Angola has considerable medium-term potential
but faces substantial challenges. Directors agreed that Angola will be in a strong
position to achieve a high average income level and a sustainable fiscal and external
position if it carefully husbands the wealth from its abundant natural resources and
forcibly addresses the outstanding governance issues. In the short term, Angola will
need to address the challenges that reflect the legacy of many years of civil war—
widespread poverty and low human development indicators; a sizable short-term
external debt; a large public payroll; poor infrastructure; and the need to strengthen the
accountability of many state institutions.
Directors called for sustained progress in three priority areas to help Angola achieve its
medium-term potential: macroeconomic management; transparency and governance;
and structural reform. They noted, first, the importance of developing and implementing
a macroeconomic framework directed at the achievement and maintenance of low
inflation. This will require firm establishment of fiscal discipline, to orient fiscal policy to
the medium term in the face of uncertain oil revenues. Second, Directors underscored
that Angola should further strengthen transparency with regard to the management of its
vast oil and other resources, as well as fiscal operations in general. Third, Directors
emphasized the need for structural reform measures, focused on improving competition,
to develop the non-oil private sector, including agriculture.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ decision to formulate the 2005 budget on the basis
of a conservative oil price, and their indications that any additional revenues from higher
prices will be saved in the first instance in an oil reserve account. They urged the
authorities to build on these principles and develop an explicit and formalized mediumterm fiscal framework, which will promote fiscal discipline, provide a comprehensive
strategy for judicious investment of oil revenues, and minimize the risk of procyclical
spending as oil prices vary.
Directors supported the authorities’ goal of increasing public spending on much-needed
infrastructure and provision of social services. However, in light of the already high level
of public spending, some Directors recommended that the authorities should prioritize
reallocation from other spending, including from the large government payroll for
administrative and military personnel. Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to

-4-

eliminate fuel subsidies in Angola, noting that they are inefficient and regressive, and
stressed the importance of accompanying such measures with appropriate protection for
low-income households.
Directors highlighted the importance of further strengthening fiscal management,
through effective budget planning, monitoring, and control. In particular, they called for
the full and speedy operation of the SIGFE management information system, and the
strengthening of administrative capacity, noting the technical assistance offered in these
areas by the international community. More generally, Directors welcomed the
authorities’ intention to implement many of the recommendations for improving the
budgetary process made in the World Bank’s Public Expenditure Management and
Financial Review, including the application of conventional budgetary arrangements to
the remaining services provided by the national oil company, Sonangol.
Directors commended the authorities for their commitment to lowering inflation further in
2005-06. Nevertheless, and taking into consideration the current propitious fiscal climate
resulting from high oil revenues, some Directors encouraged the authorities to adopt
more explicitly ambitious inflation objectives in the short term. This will call for a flexibly
managed money-based stabilization, underpinned by fiscal restraint. Policy will need to
continue to pay due regard to the exchange rate, but most Directors advised against a
formal exchange rate target, as this can entail substantial risks in the face of uncertain
oil prices, uncertain fiscal control, and a low level of foreign exchange reserves.
Directors welcomed the slowing of monetary growth rates during 2004, secured in part
by the termination of the central government’s reliance on domestic finance.
Most Directors advised, nonetheless, against further external commercial borrowing by
the central government, particular in respect of oil-backed loans. Directors noted the
continuation of large operating deficits of the central bank and urged the authorities to
avoid further deficits. Several Directors recommended that the authorities consider
recapitalizing and restructuring the central bank. To increase the effectiveness of
monetary control, Directors suggested that the authorities continue to extend the range
of domestic debt instruments. Directors also noted that both monetary and fiscal
transparency and management will be improved by transferring all government holdings
of foreign exchange to the central bank, within international reserves.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to improving governance and
transparency in resource management. They strongly encouraged the authorities to
implement, as planned, the main recommendations of the oil diagnostic study, and to
consider comparable measures in the diamond sector. Key steps in this regard include
the transfer of Sonangol’s functions as regulator and government concessionaire to
other agencies, and establishing a government oil revenue management unit. In a
similar vein, Directors observed the advantages of separating regulatory and licensing
functions in the diamonds sector from Endiama’s commercial operations.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ interest in participating in the Extractive Industry
Transparency Initiative.

Statement by Peter J. Ngumbullu, Executive Director for Angola
and Gualberto Lima Campos, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
March 4, 2005
Introduction
1.
On behalf of the Angolan authorities, we would like to express gratitude to staff for
their work in conducting the Article IV consultation and for their ongoing constructive
engagement in Angola. The discussions have provided a valuable opportunity for the
authorities to take a critical look at their own macroeconomic policy framework and the
recommendations left by staff are helping the authorities in their efforts to address the
challenges facing the economy. The authorities would also like to express their appreciation
to Management for their commitment to Angola, as they view Mr. Kato’s recent visit to the
country, as a major step in the improvement of the dialogue with the Fund.
Background
2.
During the last four years, Angola has experienced a meaningful transformation of its
political, social and economic life, as the peace process has firmly consolidated, democracy
has decisively entrenched and the economy is vigorously recovering and expanding. The
government and UNITA, the former rebel party, have with commitment, successfully
implemented the Luena peace agreement of April 2002, whereby all 86,000 former rebel
combatants were either demobilized or incorporated into the national army and that UNITA
surrendered all weapons to the government. With peace effectively ingrained, the Angolan
government has, therefore, accomplished an ambitious humanitarian program of resettling
about 4,000,000 internally displaced people and around 450,000 refugees. UNITA is today
fully transformed into a civil political party for the happiness of the Angolan people who can
now enjoy the virtues and benefits of democracy. A national consensus has also emerged
regarding the holding of general elections in September 2006. The authorities’ attention is
now fully concentrated in the challenging tasks of improving the living standards of the
Angolan people and reconstructing and rehabilitating the destroyed and decayed
infrastructure.
Recent Economic and Social Developments
3.
Real GDP grew by an estimated 11 percent in 2004, mainly on account of increased
oil and diamond production and reconstruction activities. In the last four years real GDP has
experienced an average growth of 8 percent a year. Nevertheless, it is encouraging to observe
that in same period non-mining sector’s growth has been stronger than the mining sector
averaging almost 9 percent a year. Agriculture, commerce and construction have been the
most dynamic sectors representing the bulk of growth in the non-mining sector. The share of
the non-mining sectors in the GDP has, however, declined over time, and it is estimated
today to represent 43 percent, while the oil sector accounts for 52 percent and the diamond
sector represents 5 percent. As a result of the good economic performance, Angola’s GDP
per capita more than doubled since 2000 to about $1,000, and the country has, as a matter of
fact, emerged as the third economy in Sub-Saharan Africa in terms of global GDP.

-2Monetary and Fiscal Policy
4.
In September 2003 the authorities started implementing a new macroeconomic
program aimed at reducing inflation and stabilizing the economy. The results were quite
impressive, as for the first time in more than ten years annual inflation was below 70 percent
and was in accordance with the authorities’ initial projections. As at end-December 2004, the
12-month rate of inflation had declined to 31 percent and in January 2005 it had further fallen
below 30 percent. In addition, the nominal exchange rate had largely stabilized, as it
depreciated only by 9 percent during 2004 as compared to 35 percent in 2003 and 85 percent
in 2002. Nevertheless, dollarization continues to be high, as Angola continues to be
considered the highest dollarized economy in Africa and is among the most dollarized
economies in the world. However, signs of increased confidence in the national currency are
visible, as deposits in national currency, as a percentage of total deposits, have in 2004
increased to 44 from 34 and 26 respectively in 2003 and 2002, while symmetrically the part
of deposits in foreign currency have in 2004 decreased to 56 from 66 and 74 respectively in
2003 in 2002.
5.
Monetary developments were in line with the objectives of macroeconomic
stabilization, as growth of monetary aggregates decelerate mainly reflecting reduced reliance
on the banking sector to finance the public sector. In this connection, the authorities cleared
arrears of about $650 million to domestic suppliers through securitization and introduced
short and long-term treasury bills for open market operations. In addition, gross reserves, that
were substantially low in December 2002 increased more than 5 fold in December 2004,
representing three months of non-oil imports.
6.
Fiscal developments in 2004 were particularly characterized by increased spending on
social sectors in absolute and relative terms. In 2004 expenditure on social sectors
represented 20 percent of total expenditure as compared to 12 percent in 2003. In this
connection, the authorities’ efforts to rapidly extend primary school to the whole territory
were quite satisfactory as more than 30,000 new teachers were recruited and trained and
more than 1.5 million new pupils were enrolled. Other interventions conducted in the social
sector included the rehabilitation of numerous basic health services facilities and the
implementation of nationwide campaigns against malaria, measles and HIV/AIDS. In
addition, the authorities continued to firmly support the peace process and resettlement of
displaced people, through specific actions in favor of ex-UNITA combatants and their
families, and by intensifying landmine removal operations and bringing home most of the
refugees in neighboring countries. They have also initiated a variety of reconstruction and
rehabilitation activities including repair of bridges, roads, railways, power plants and urban
water systems.
7.
The overall fiscal deficit to GDP declined in 2004 to 4 percent from 7.1 percent and
9.4 percent respectively in 2003 and 2002. Although increased oil revenue derived from
higher prices and production has helped in reducing the fiscal deficit, the declining deficit
reflects the authorities’ determination to stabilize the economy and improved fiscal discipline
and reduction of price subsidies. Indeed, fiscal discipline has considerably improved
following the approval in 2003 of new budget legislation requiring all state revenues and

-3expenditures to be declared in the national budget. As a result, all quasi-fiscal operations
previously carried out by Sonangol and other expenditures executed outside the budget,
particularly those associated with the military sector, were terminated and are now fully
integrated in the national budget.
8.
Revenues continued to be dominated by oil taxes, which in 2004 represented about 30
percent of GDP and accounted for about 75 percent of total revenue. However, and despite a
dramatic boost in oil production in the last four years, the government’s share of total oil
receipts has declined from 52 percent to an estimated 43 percent in the same period,
reflecting mainly higher amortization costs in deep-water fields where the new production is
being extracted.
Structural Reforms
9.
In the last two years, the authorities have taken bold steps to improve fiscal
transparency and accountability. In this connection, they have already published the oil
diagnostic study and are committed to the implementation of the main recommendations of
the study. The authorities have also unified the budget and established a single treasury
account at the central bank and created an Auditing Court (Tribunal de Contas). Other
reforms include the conduct of external audits of the financial statements of the central bank
and Sonangol, and the strengthening of the external debt unit and the compilation of
comprehensive data on external debt. However, progress in implementing other structural
reforms remained limited by the continuous focus given by the authorities to the
consolidation of the peace process and by serious constrains in human and institutional
capacity. In 2003 and 2004 the authorities approved the new investment law, establishing the
principle of equal treatment between national and foreign investors and simplifying
administrative procedures for investment and profit repatriation, the law of tax incentives for
private investment and the creation of a Private Investment Agency. The authorities have also
approved a new land law, largely eliminated export tariffs, restructured import tariffs,
continued implementation of the customs modernization program, and prepared a draft law
requiring foreign oil companies to use the national banking system for the financial
transactions regarding their exports.
Economic Outlook for 2005 and the Medium Term
10.
The authorities are fully committed to stabilize the economy, accelerate the rebuilding
of the country and create conditions for sustainable growth and meaningful poverty
reduction. Based on these objectives, they have prepared a program for 2005-2006, which
targets a realistic reduction in inflation to 15 percent in 2005 and to 10 percent in 2006 and
encompasses appropriate fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies in line with the inflation
target.
11.
It is estimated that the fiscal deficit could reach 9 percent of GDP in 2005 due
essentially to the pressing need to restore the country’s infrastructure and improve social
services. In this connection, the 2005 budget encompasses a significant rise in capital
expenditure, which will increase to 13 percent of GDP from 5.8 percent in the previous year.

-4Social sector spending is also projected to increase to 23 percent of total spending, reflecting
in large part additional recruitment and training of education and health workers. In addition,
the authorities believe that they can not abruptly trim spending in administrative and military
sectors to compensate for the increase in other sectors as suggested by staff, as this would
contribute to increase unemployment and affect particularly the peace process, as the army
had to absorb part of UNITA combatants. Furthermore, the army has recently been called to
help the police to protect the borders, as large cohorts of illegal immigrants have been
entering the country with the objective of digging diamonds and the situation is gaining
alarming dimensions. Also, the authorities are of the view that training and other alternative
programs for non-essential military and administrative personnel need to be carefully set up
before laying them off.
12.
Nevertheless, even under these circumstances the authorities are committed to
improve fiscal management and expenditure control. In this regard, they intend to implement
most recommendations of the World Bank’s Public Expenditure Management and Financial
Review and have already started to gradually increase retail prices of oil derivatives to a level
that will be sufficient to cover production costs with the view of eliminating price subsidies
of fuel and utilities, which in 2004 accounted for 4.5 percent of GDP. They have also
prepared the budget based on a very conservative oil price (US$26.5 per barrel), which can
certainly help in reducing the projected fiscal deficit, as oil prices tend to stabilize at above
$40 per barrel.
13.
In the next three years, GDP is projected to grow at an average of 18 percent a year,
fueled by large increases of oil and diamond production. As a result, GDP per capita is
expected to double again by 2007 to about $2,000. However, the authorities are aware of the
challenges associated with the efficient and transparent management of the natural-resource
wealth, which calls for the need to create responsible mechanisms to manage these resources.
In this regard, they are committed to continue to take bold steps to improve transparency and
efficiency of the oil and diamond sectors and intend to implement in the medium-term the
main recommendations of the oil diagnostic study, particularly the separation of commercial
and concessionaire functions and the establishment of a oil revenue management unit, for
which the authorities are in the process of contracting technical assistance.
14.
The authorities are also aware that the perverse effects of the Dutch disease have
particularly in the last ten years, plagued the economy. They acknowledge that the economy
is becoming increasingly dependent on the oil sector and that production of tradable goods
particularly in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors is becoming uncompetitive. Against
this background, the authorities are aware that they need to pursue structural reform measures
and implement appropriate actions aimed at improving competitiveness and fostering
economic diversification and they believe that significant and appropriate investment in
human resources and infrastructure are key to achieve those objectives.
15.
Looking forward, the authorities are committed in pursuing the structural reform
agenda with the view of enhancing economic efficiency and competitiveness and improving
the business environment for private sector development. In this connection, they
acknowledge the need to streamline bureaucracy, reduce corruption and privileged access to

-5markets and enhance competition. They have recently set up a technical commission in
charge of reviewing and updating the economic legislation. The authorities intend also to
reinvigorate and speed up the privatization agenda, for which they plan to create an
independent Privatization Agency, and to approve the legal framework for setting up a stock
exchange market. They are also committed to strengthen governance and transparency in the
fiscal area particularly through the implementation of recommendations of the oil diagnostic
study and by start reviewing diamond sector practices. The authorities have recently
announced their interest in participating in the Extractive Industry Transparency Imitative.
16.
Financial needs to consolidate the peace process and reconstruct and rehabilitate the
war-ravaged country are enormous. However, the authorities continue to be constrained by
their inability to access sufficient concessional borrowing and virtually have no other
alternative than continue to secure oil-backed loans to meet these huge demands. They are
aware of the risks and unsustainability of such a policy, which considerably contributes to
increasing the stock of short-term debt, arising from short-term loans for financing of
projects of a long-term nature and are willing to phase out such a policy. They, meanwhile,
believe that such an effort would require the support of the donor community, including the
Fund and the World Bank. In these circumstances, and because reconstruction and
rehabilitation of infrastructure and improvement of social services can not be delayed, the
authorities have decided to negotiate on bilateral basis oil-backed credit lines with some
governments, with much better terms and conditions than previous commercial oil-backed
loans.
Concluding remarks
17.
Despite the increasing GDP per capita, the authorities are particularly concerned with
the high levels of poverty and inequality prevailing in the country. They acknowledge that
the three-decade armed conflict has considerably contributed to the continuous deterioration
of social indicators placing today Angola among the most vulnerable countries in terms of
human development index. Against this background, the authorities believe that the most
effective policy to fight poverty and inequality and achieve the Millennium Development
Goals is to provide more and better social services to the poor and invest on human capital
and social infrastructure. They are also persuaded that the PRSP is indeed a key instrument
for designing appropriate policies and defining priorities regarding poverty reduction. The
authorities have demonstrated full ownership during its preparation process and intend to
complete the document in 2005 for integration into the budgetary process.
18.
The process of reforming a post-conflict economy is long and the tasks ahead are
arduous and the capacities are limited. The authorities have already taken important steps to
consolidate the peace and stabilize the economy, and need support from the international
community to reconstruct the country’s infrastructure and to reform the economy to promote
growth, alleviate poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Only through
sustained international support, including from the Bretton Woods Institutions, the economic
opportunities, which Angola can offer to its people, can effectively begin to be realized soon.
To this end, the authorities would like to request the Fund to initiate, as soon as possible,
negotiations of a Staff Monitored Program that could lead to use of Fund resources and donor

-6financial assistance, including debt rescheduling. Finally, the authorities are of the view that
the policy and reform monitoring process in Angola needs to be bolstered by adequate
technical assistance from the Fund and the rest of the international community. We request
the Board to support these endeavors.
