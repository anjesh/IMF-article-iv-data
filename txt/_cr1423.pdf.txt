STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
December 23, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context. Macroeconomic and financial stability has been maintained despite the difficult
environment globally—especially in neighboring Greece—and recent domestic discord,
but growth remains tepid and unemployment high. Ambitious (and politically
challenging) reforms are needed to achieve Bulgaria’s objective of more rapid income
convergence with Europe.
Outlook and risks. Domestic demand is projected to recover gradually while exports
and foreign direct investment are expected to benefit from recovery in Europe. The
domestic social and political situation and continued uncertainty about the outlook for
external partners present downside risks.
Fiscal policy. The unchanged structural stance under the 2014 budget, which sets the
deficit close to national fiscal limits, strikes an appropriate balance given low projected
growth and a strong underlying fiscal position on the one hand and the importance of
maintaining fiscal credibility (particularly in the context of the currency board) on the
other. The budget is subject to implementation risk, especially as revenues may fall short
of target. The intended increase in capital spending should be accompanied by
appropriate project selection and monitoring procedures. Medium-term risks—in
particular related to pensions and state-owned enterprises—will need to be addressed.
Financial sector policies. The financial system remains well-capitalized and liquid, but
profitability is low. Gradual reduction of nonperforming loans through asset disposal will
be important to reduce asset price uncertainty and support future investment.
Structural policies. Progress in addressing institutional and broader structural gaps
(including those that contribute to corruption and cronyism) is needed to set the
foundation for stronger growth and job creation.
Previous IMF advice. Policy implementation has generally been consistent with IMF
recommendations. Prudent fiscal and supervisory policies have been pursued, allowing
macroeconomic and financial stability to be maintained. However, recent reforms to
strengthen the sustainability of the pension system have been reversed, and the bold
structural reforms needed to accelerate growth require new momentum.

CONTEXT: A NEED FOR GROWTH
1.
Bulgaria has effectively pursued policies to
support macroeconomic and financial stability for
over a decade, but income convergence with the
European Union (EU) has been slow. The
stabilization policies established in the second half of
the 1990s and firmly implemented since have
insulated Bulgaria well against shocks from the global
financial crisis, turmoil in neighboring Greece, and
recent domestic discord. However, Bulgaria remains
the poorest EU member, with income levels about
half the EU average. While this marks an
improvement in relative terms (up from one-third in
2002), using WEO data the gap in absolute incomes
has widened over the last decade.

protests prompted by a controversial appointment this summer.

3.
More ambitious and politically challenging reforms will be needed for Bulgaria to
increase the pace of convergence to European income levels. The authorities have rightly
emphasized the need to safeguard stability while developing a new paradigm for growth and job
creation that does not depend on the extraordinary inflows that characterized the pre-crisis period.
Adverse demographic changes, accelerated by emigration, add to the challenge. Progress will
require addressing long-standing institutional and broader structural rigidities to enhance domestic
competition, reinforce the rule of law, address infrastructure gaps, and strengthen human capital.

Growth in the aftermath of the global
financial crisis has remained low. Output has not
yet recovered to pre-crisis levels, and employment
has fallen by 13 percent from its peak (Figure 1).
Growth declined from 0.8 percent in 2012 to
0.2 percent in the first half of 2013 as domestic
uncertainties undermined demand, with unchanged
private consumption and a decline in investment
(Figure 2 and Tables 1–3). Good agricultural
performance, strong export growth (8.0 percent
year-on-year), and higher government spending
supported the economy. GDP began to recover in
the third quarter of 2013 to an estimated
1.5 percent year-on-year as exports continued to
perform well.

5.
Strong macroeconomic and financial sector policies have mitigated vulnerabilities
arising from the difficult external and domestic environment, but challenges remain:


The current account, which reached a deficit of 25 percent of GDP in 2007, is now registering a
small surplus, and reserves are comfortable with a reserve adequacy index of 129 (Table 1).
Financial inflows are moderate and stable, consisting mostly of FDI at about 3 percent of GDP a
year. The international investment position has improved in line with the fall in external debt
(Figure 3, Tables 4–5). The reduction in banks’ foreign liabilities has been gradual and is largely
driven by plentiful bank liquidity, resulting in a positive net foreign asset position for the first
time since 2006. Bulgaria was largely unaffected by the swings in capital flows to emerging
markets following concerns about tapering last summer, as its stock market capitalization and
domestic public debt are low, at about 10 percent of GDP each, and banks (three quarters of
which are subsidiaries of EU banks) are funded mainly by domestic deposits.1



The fiscal deficit fell to 0.5 percent of GDP in 2012, below the budgeted deficit of 1.3 percent of
GDP (Figure 4). However, this performance was largely due to lower-than-planned public
investment expenditure. Public debt, at 17.6 percent of GDP at end-2012, is the second lowest in
the EU and the debt sustainability analysis shows it well contained (Appendix I).

1

Inward spillovers occur more through trade with the euro zone (notably Germany and Italy) and neighboring
countries (particularly Romania and Turkey), and direct investment primarily from the European Union (also see
“Interconnectedness and Spillovers from the Euro Area to Bulgaria,” 2012 Staff Report, Annex I).

Inflation has been low and in line with that of trading partners in recent years (Figure 5).
Following reductions in administered electricity prices, inflation turned negative in the second
half of 2013. Credit growth, which peaked at 63 percent in 2007, has been flat in 2013.



Capitalization and liquidity of the financial sector are high (Figure 6). Although gross
nonperforming loans (NPLs)—a legacy from the boom period and subsequent crisis—amounted
to 17.2 percent of loans in September, coverage by provisions is comfortable at 72.7 percent.

Reductions in unemployment over
the last decade have been erased as a
result of the crisis. While employment
rose slightly in 2013, the
unemployment rate has not begun to
decline as more of the population
entered the workforce. Given that the
output gap is not large, most of the
unemployment is structural and
characterized by significant age,
gender, and regional disparities.2

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
6.
Output is projected to recover slowly. Domestic demand is projected to recover
gradually, and exports and foreign direct investment will benefit from recovery in Europe. Inflation is
projected to be positive but subdued in the short term and, given faster tradables sector
productivity and wage growth, slightly above that in the EU in the medium term. The current
account would return to a modest deficit in the medium term financed by FDI.
7.
Convergence to EU income levels over the coming decades requires accelerated
growth. In the baseline, GDP growth is projected to increase from ½ percent in 2013 to 3 percent in
the medium term, whereas the EU is projected to reach a growth rate of 2 percent by 2018—a
difference of 1 percentage point that implies only very gradual income convergence. Even with a
sustained growth differential of 2 percentage points, full income convergence would still take four
decades to be achieved.
8.

Staff’s views on risks are summarized in the Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM).



On the domestic side, the political situation remains strained, making needed structural reforms
all the more difficult, although Bulgaria’s track record suggests the risk of excessive fiscal
relaxation is low. In the financial sector, continued high levels of NPLs, while well provisioned,
imply a “collateral overhang” (bad loans backed by property that has not yet been seized and
sold) that may deter new investment because of the uncertainty this can create about underlying
asset values.



On the external side, uncertainty regarding the economic situation in Europe or other partners
may have adverse implications for trade and investment. External debt remains significant
(92.7 percent of GDP at mid 2013) but has been falling and presents limited rollover risks (see
Appendix I).



In view of the risks, discussed further in the policies section below, it is imperative to move
ahead with growth-enhancing reforms and reinforce defenses to support readiness to respond
to adverse shocks. The response to sizable adverse shocks would include utilization of automatic
stabilizers, as long as financing conditions permit.

9.
The authorities’ views on the outlook and risks were close to the staff’s. They saw
slightly more upside in the near term, with a stronger recovery in domestic demand; they also noted
that their baseline projections do not take into account the “South Stream” gas pipeline,
construction of which they expected to begin in 2014. They agreed on potential external downside
risks, but also noted that ongoing diversification of exports to emerging markets was helping reduce
their vulnerability to European shocks. Regarding the financial sector, they emphasized that buffers
were significant and NPLs did not pose stability concerns, but they agreed that various structural
constraints—including related to the legal system—had a negative effect on the pace of disposal of
seized collateral by banks.

POLICIES TO ACCELERATE GROWTH AND PRESERVE
STABILITY
10.
Thanks to its robust policy framework, Bulgaria has successfully withstood recent
challenges. Following tumultuous early transition years and the 1997 crisis, a period of stabilization
began with the establishment of the currency board and supporting policies, including low fiscal
deficits and debt, as well as conservative banking supervision. The robust macroeconomic
framework was instrumental in supporting growth and EU membership before the global financial
crisis (albeit with extraordinary inflows fueling a boom). Buffers built up during the pre-crisis period
helped to mitigate the worst effects of the crisis on growth, although unemployment increased
sharply.
11.
Looking forward, the authorities recognize the need to safeguard stability while
setting the conditions for accelerated growth and job creation. The authorities remain
committed to the policies that are needed to support the currency board—which introduced policy
predictability and controlled inflation—as the natural bridge to eventual euro adoption. At the same
time, they recognize the need for broader reforms to set the conditions for higher growth, lower
unemployment, and reduced incentives for migration.

A. Fiscal Policy: Safeguarding Consolidation and Improving Spending
Composition

After several years of consolidation, the fiscal deficit is projected to increase to
2 percent of GDP in 2013, and the structural deficit to 1 percent of GDP. About half of the

GDP (mostly comprising working balances and pledged funds), compared to a pre-crisis peak of
17 percent of GDP.
13.
The 2014 budget, consistent with national rules and EU objectives, targets a deficit of
1.8 percent of GDP, leaving the structural deficit little changed. Tax revenues are budgeted to
rise by about 1 percent of GDP, mainly through further administrative measures. A reversal of recent
pension reforms will take effect in July (Box 1). An increase in social protection spending has been
budgeted while operational expenditures are expected to be restrained. The new national

investment fund (0.6 percent of GDP) is expected to finance municipal investment following a
competitive bidding process overseen by the Council of Ministers. The government’s 2014–16 fiscal
framework implies a structural deficit of 1 percent of GDP, consistent with national rules and EU
objectives, with spending increases concentrated on investment.4

14.
The new public finance law that enters into force in 2014 (as well as EU legislation)
requires the government to set up an independent fiscal body. The fiscal council that is being
established consists of 5 members (including a chairperson) that will be elected by parliament, and
one administrative staff. Its mandate will include issuing opinions on the draft budget and budget
execution, the monitoring of fiscal rules, and the activation of corrective mechanisms and escape
clauses.
Policy Issues
15.
The fiscal impulse in 2013 and the neutral fiscal stance for 2014 are appropriate. Given
the unanticipated slowing of the economy in 2013, the discretionary fiscal impulse was fortuitous.
The composition of spending was improved through an increase in the share of investment

Bulgaria’s maximum structural deficit under the new public finance law and the EU medium-term objective is
1 percent of GDP (given that public debt is under 40 percent of GDP) on an accrual basis. National rules specify a
headline cash deficit ceiling of 2 percent of GDP (the annual difference between cash and accrual is small with an
average of 0.2 percent of GDP in recent years).

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BULGARIA

spending and greater absorption of EU funds, both particularly welcome given their positive
long-term growth effects.5 Increases in social protection spending beyond the pension increases
were limited and targeted. In 2014, keeping the structural deficit unchanged strikes an appropriate
balance between postponing consolidation given the modest projected growth and maintaining
fiscal credibility—particularly important in the context of the currency board—by observing
domestic deficit limits and EU objectives. There are, however, implementation risks with the 2014
budget. While the South Stream project provides potential revenue upside, revenues may
underperform if domestic demand or administrative reforms disappoint, or, as projected by staff,
inflation is subdued. In such a case and with the budgeted deficit already at or near deficit limits,
expenditures would need to be restrained and heightened spending pressures carefully managed to
meet the deficit target (see RAM). At the same time, it will be important to ensure efficiency and
transparency in management of the new public investment fund, and the independence of the new
fiscal council should be supported through adequate staff and resources.
16.
Fiscal buffers should be rebuilt over time by targeting a balanced structural budget
after 2016. This would allow a substantial liquidity buffer to be built up in the fiscal reserve in good
times and automatic stabilizers to work in the event of a shock. As discussed in last year’s Staff
Report, rebuilding the fiscal reserve by saving fiscal surpluses would bolster the defenses that
Bulgaria needs given shallow domestic financial markets, periodic closing of international markets,
intervention limitations inherent in its currency board, and prevailing risks.
17.
There is scope to improve the targeting and efficiency of social spending. While recent
studies suggest that social protection spending helped to mitigate the income effects of the crisis in
Bulgaria, they also point to relatively weak results in terms of poverty reduction, as well as
substantial inefficiencies, particularly in health-related spending. Given constrained fiscal space,
reforms should focus on improving the allocation of existing social protection spending, including to
provide room for greater social assistance spending, for which coverage is currently low.6
18.
Medium-term fiscal risks arise from the reversal of pension reform and from
contingent liabilities related to some state-owned enterprises. The recent pension reform
reversals, without compensatory measures, add to already substantial budgetary pressures from an
aging population, with adverse budgetary implications that are limited in the early years but
substantial over the longer term. The weak financial position of firms in the railroad sector and some
segments of the energy sector, which staff discussed with the World Bank, could represent
significant fiscal risks if not adequately addressed (Box 2). As suggested by the European
Commission, details on such contingencies should be provided in budget documents.

Box 2. Energy and Railroad Sectors
Energy. With the economy highly energy intensive, the state-owned vertically-integrated Bulgaria
Energy Holding (BEH) accounts for almost half of Bulgaria’s generating capacity. A large BEH
subsidiary, the National Electricity Company (NEK), faces financial difficulties given contractual
obligations to high purchase prices coupled with low administered prices.1 BEH has recently issued an
international bond to provide NEK with liquidity and NEK’s energy exports have been expanded.
Sustained efforts to address NEK’s situation, such as outlined by the World Bank, are needed to avoid
future impact on the government’s budget.
Railroads. Traffic has declined about 70 percent since the mid-1990s, and annual subsidies amount to
½ percent of GDP. The state railway operator defaulted in 2010 and is negotiating with its creditors. A
reform agreed with the World Bank and privatization efforts for the freight company are currently on
hold.

19.
The authorities underlined their continued commitment to fiscal stability. They are
committed to remaining within the 2 percent of GDP domestic deficit ceiling in 2014 and
maintaining a structural deficit of about 1 percent of GDP through 2016. They agreed that a return
to a balanced structural budget over time would be useful to help rebuild buffers. On spending
composition, they see the creation of the public investment fund as a way to increase investment at
the municipal level. They recognized the importance of pension sustainability and saw the halt in
increases to the retirement age as temporary. On social spending, the authorities aim to improve the
accessibility and effectiveness of social transfers and services, in particular for children and older
people, and acknowledged the need for more efficient health care spending.

B. Financial Sector: Maintaining Stability and Supporting the Recovery
Background
20.
The financial system remains stable and liquid, although profitability has declined.
Liquidity remained plentiful due to rising deposits and low credit demand. At the same time,
external liabilities of the banking system declined further to 16 percent of GDP compared to an
end-2008 peak of 27 percent, and banks’ net foreign assets reached a small surplus compared to a
peak deficit of 18 percent of GDP in 2008. IFRS provisioning for NPLs has affected profits, but capital
adequacy remains high with all banks meeting the minimum regulatory requirement of 12 percent
and system-wide capital at 16.9 percent of risk-weighted assets as of September 2013.
21.
NPLs have stabilized, but remain near their peak. As of September, 17.2 percent of loans
were classified as impaired (with most of them in excess of 180 days past due). Some banks have
recently been more proactive in resolving NPLs by claiming and removing associated collateral from
18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BULGARIA

their balance sheets, a process that is made difficult by a number of factors, including a depressed
real estate market and an ineffective and unpredictable insolvency framework (see RAM and Box 3).
Box 3. Resolving NPLs in Bulgaria
A strategy to gradually reduce the stock of NPLs will improve the investment environment and help
sustain the recovery while preserving stability. However, a number of constraints have limited progress:
With NPLs well provisioned, many banks see benefit in a “wait and see approach.” Banks report
that they expect collateral values to improve as the economy recovers and the current political
uncertainty is resolved.
The foreclosure process is marked by uncertainty about its cost, length, and outcome. This
uncertainty also contributes to the wait-and-see approach by banks.
Disincentives in the tax system for quick write offs. It is uncertain when losses can be recognized
for tax purposes.
Limited scope for market-based solutions. Like in many Eastern and Central European countries, the
market for distressed assets is underdeveloped, with limited experience with direct sales and
securitization.

22.
The EU Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV) that becomes effective in 2014 will
require supervisory changes. Capital–based (“specific”) provisions will need to be phased out and
the minimum capital adequacy requirements adapted to the new framework (Box 4).

Policy issues
23.
Recent efforts by some banks to address the stock of distressed assets and claim
associated collateral are steps in the right direction. Credit risk to regulatory capital is
substantially mitigated by the current dual provisioning scheme, and plentiful liquidity implies that
credit growth at present is not restricted by supply factors. Reduction of NPLs through asset
disposal and release of associated collateral will also be important to reduce the administrative and
legal costs to banks associated with managing these assets and, more broadly, to reduce asset price
uncertainty and support future investment.
24.
Recent improvements to the insolvency framework that limit the backdating of
insolvencies are welcome but further reforms are needed. Recommendations in last year’s Staff
Report remain valid, including the introduction of a fast-track court approval procedure for
pre-agreed reorganization plans and out-of-court debt restructuring guidelines, which in other
countries have facilitated speedy, cost-effective, and market-friendly settlements. The treatment of
loan losses in the tax system should be adjusted to remove potential disincentives to write offs.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Box 4. Transition to CRD IV
BNB supervisory authorities have maintained conservative capital buffers. Under IFRS, expected
losses from future events and forward looking considerations are not taken into account. However,
BNB supervisory authorities have complemented IFRS provisions with additional capital cushions
(“specific provisions”) calculated on an expected loss model and deducted from regulatory capital.
Specific provisions are a segregated part of capital that do not affect reported profits (unlike IFRS
provisions) but are excluded when computing regulatory capital.
Under CRD IV specific provisions will need to be phased out but the authorities are taking steps
to preserve appropriate buffers. In order to promote capital conservation, BNB supervisors plan to
use available national discretion under the CRD IV package. Specifically, the authorities will use the
flexibility under Pillar 1 of the Basel Accord to impose the maximum capital conservation and
systemic capital buffers on all banks. In addition, the BNB will use the national discretion afforded
under Pillar 2 to impose higher capital requirements on those institutions exhibiting a higher risk
profile.

25.
The authorities will maintain their conservative approach to bank supervision under
the new European framework. They view existing capital and liquidity buffers as critical to
maintaining stability. They intend to use available flexibility to maintain high capital adequacy
requirements and ensure conservative collateral valuation, which will be particularly important once
specific provisions are eliminated. They view NPLs as adequately provisioned to insulate against risks
to the stability of the system and recognize that their gradual reduction would be supported by
greater efficiencies in the legal system. The authorities do not intend to participate in the close
cooperation framework of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, noting the absence of liquidity and
solvency support as well as the lack of voting rights in the Governing

C. The Next Generation of Reforms
26.
Bulgaria ranks favorably versus comparators on
macro-policy outcomes but less so on other dimensions critical
to the well functioning of the economy. Bulgaria is comparable
to good performers in central Europe and the Baltics on fiscal and
country risk, and the income tax system is also seen as favorable in
competitiveness rankings. However, Bulgaria ranks much lower on
measures such as enforcing contracts, resolving insolvencies, and
some areas of red tape. More generally, the judicial system is
viewed as problematic, and corruption and cronyism as
widespread.

While labor market institutions and
regulations are generally flexible,
employment losses following the crisis were
large relative to comparators and to the fall
in GDP. Unemployment has disproportionately
affected the young and those in rural areas. One
important factor was the nature of employment
gains during the boom period. High demand for
low skilled labor came from the construction
and manufacturing sectors, but these sectors
were particularly hard hit by the crisis.
Infrastructure and education gaps also have
contributed to low productivity. The use of active
labor market policies, including training and
subsidized employment, has been relatively
limited but has recently increased.

and strengthen public confidence in the reform process. Improvements in infrastructure and human
capital as well as ease of doing business are necessary.7 At the same time, it will be critical to
confront corruption, rent-seeking behavior and institutional gaps which are hampering investment
and the efficiency of goods and factor markets. Key areas for reform include the judiciary as well as
the anti-monopoly and anti-corruption regimes.
29.
In addition, wider swaths of the population need to benefit from better opportunities.
Improved education and training, including for social groups that tend to be excluded (Roma), will
be important while greater absorption of EU funds, given the infrastructure component, could also
boost demand for low-skilled labor. Government actions that influence the cost of labor for the
lower skilled and young, and minimum wage differentiation by region and age, need to be carefully
weighed.
30.
The authorities agreed that growth-enhancing structural reforms—along with
continuation of stability-oriented policies—are critical. Reforms in the business environment, the
judiciary, and anti-monopoly regime were viewed as important, and they highlighted ongoing
efforts to reduce the administrative burden on businesses and improve public procurement.
Improvements in education and active labor market policies were also being pursued. The
authorities do not believe that a differentiated minimum wage would help reduce structural
unemployment, noting in particular broader structural constraints to investment and employment in
the hardest hit regions.

STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
After the crisis of 1997 that destroyed banks and decimated savings, policymakers
successfully established a robust policy framework tested under domestic and external
shocks. However, whereas in terms of economic stability Bulgaria is performing well, in other areas
performance lags. A strategy which complements continued macroeconomic and financial stability
with accelerated efforts on removing key structural impediments is needed to boost growth and
strengthen employment.
32.
Fiscal policy is maintaining an appropriate balance. The limited consolidation implied by
the 2014 budget is appropriate but there are implementation risks. The authorities should be
prepared to adjust spending to achieve the deficit target which is near domestic and EU limits. The
intended shift to capital spending is welcome but needs to be accompanied by appropriate project
selection procedures. Fiscal buffers should be rebuilt by targeting a balanced structural budget over
time. The additional spending pressures resulting from the recent reversal of pension reforms will
need to be addressed.

33.
The financial sector remains stable. The authorities’ intention to maintain financial sector
buffers under the new framework is appropriate. Recent steps taken by some banks to reduce NPLs
through asset disposal should be further encouraged to reduce asset price uncertainty and support
future investment. Steps taken by the authorities to preserve their conservative supervisory
approach in the changing European framework are appropriate.
34.
Structural policies require new impetus. A key issue is governance reform, including in the
judicial system and anti-corruption and anti-monopoly regimes, to help support the macroeconomic
performance and stability of the country over the medium term. EU funds should continue to be
absorbed rapidly and further improvements in education and training are needed to reduce labor
market rigidities.
35.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Bulgaria be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Appendix I. External and Public Debt Sustainability Analyses
1.
External debt peaked in 2009 and has since declined. With little change in public external debt
relative to GDP, the decline in gross external debt from 108 percent of GDP at end-2009 to 95 percent of
GDP at end-2012 was due to private sector
deleveraging. Half of this decline was due to banks,
where debt fell from 24 percent of GDP at end-2009
to 16 percent of GDP at end-2012. Excluding
inter-company lending, which is relatively stable,
external debt was 55 percent of GDP at end-2012,
and this was largely offset by international reserves.
Rollover risks in the nonbank private sector, which
did not materialize during the global financial crisis,
are contained by the moderate short-term exposure.
2.
The counterpart of the private sector
deleveraging was the reduction in the current
account deficit. The current account moved from a
deficit of 25 percent of GDP in 2007 and 9 percent of
GDP in 2009 to a (projected) surplus in 2013. Baseline medium-term balance of payments projections
indicate the current account returning to deficit, financed mainly by foreign direct investment flows.
3.
Gross external debt in the baseline projections declines further. It reaches around 72 percent
of GDP by 2018 primarily due to nominal GDP growth, with relatively little change in nominal external debt
(which falls by 3 percent from 2012 to 2018). In the historical DSA scenario the denominator effect on the
debt-to-GDP ratio is even stronger because historical growth is higher than projected growth (Figure 1 and
Table 1).
4.
The decline in external debt relative to the size of the economy appears well anchored.
Shocks applied to the interest rate, the growth rate and the current account deficit would shift the
trajectory of external debt relative to GDP upwards. However, in these scenarios the highest level of
external debt reached by 2017 is 86 percent of GDP, which would still imply declines in the ratio of external
debt to GDP in coming years.
5.
Public debt remains at very manageable levels. At around 20 percent of GDP in the baseline
projections, Bulgaria’s indebtedness remains low by international standards. In alternative scenarios, the
public debt ratio remains well contained (Figure 2 and Table 2). However, risks from unaccounted
contingent liabilities (and worse-than-assumed downside scenarios) could result in higher outcomes, as
could aging-related spending pressures following the recent reversal of pension reforms.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

IMF-WORLD BANK RELATIONS
A. Partnership in Bulgaria’s Development Strategy
1.
The World Bank has been leading the policy dialogue in structural and institutional
reforms aimed at Bulgaria’s successful EU integration and convergence. On May 17, 2011 the
Board of Directors discussed the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) of the Bank which outlined the
roadmap for the Bank’s country support for the period 2011–13. The CPS maintains a strong focus
on Bulgaria making the most of its EU membership. It aims to partner with Bulgaria in strengthening
national institutions and capacity to meet EU targets and in accelerating the absorption of EU grant
funds. The objective of the CPS is to support Bulgaria in strengthening institutions and policies to
achieve smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth. The CPS proposes a program dominated by
knowledge and advisory services complemented by a modest lending program. World Bank
knowledge and advisory services focus on policy reforms, sector strategies and strengthening
institutional capacity for increased EU funds absorption. The Bank continues to undertake
substantial knowledge and advisory services on policy reforms in select sectors and themes of
Bulgaria’s National Reform Program 2011–2015 such as innovation, education, business regulation,
transport, water, climate change, and social inclusion.

B. IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
2.
The Fund team led by Ms. Shannon (mission chief) meets regularly with the World
Bank Bulgaria team led by Mr. Markus Repnik (Country Manager for Bulgaria, the Czech
Republic and Slovakia), to discuss macro-critical structural reforms and to coordinate the two
teams’ work. The most recent meeting took place in November 2013.
3.
Bulgaria’s main macroeconomic challenges are to maintain stability and enhance
growth in a difficult external environment. Fiscal discipline and growth enhancing public
spending are key to supporting the currency board arrangement and improving growth prospects.
Continued prudent regulation and adequate capital buffers will help maintain financial system
stability in a changing supervisory framework in Europe, while improvements in the business climate
will facilitate more sustainable tradable-based growth.
4.
Based on this shared assessment, the teams identified six structural reform areas as
macro critical in view of their central role in achieving fiscal consolidation and enhancing growth.


4

EU funds absorption. Increased absorption of EU funds through improvements of
administrative capacity and upgrading planning, execution, and monitoring systems will play a
vital role in supporting growth and investment.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BULGARIA



Healthcare reform. Mispricing and other distorted incentives have created financing pressures
for the public health insurance fund, calling for a comprehensive reform focusing on efficiency
and quality of the system—including through rationalizing in-patient care.



Education reform. Building on past achievement, education reforms should focus on improving
results. The areas of reform include measures to enhance the quality of student learning and to
improve access to education.



Pension reform. Reforms to improve the financial performance and equity of the pension
system will be key to contain rising fiscal costs associated with aging and declining population.



Improving the environment for growth. Anchoring wage growth in productivity growth and
strengthening the business environment by improving the insolvency framework and reducing
the regulatory costs for doing business are called for. Furthermore, reforms in the judicial system
and anti-corruption and anti-monopoly regimes are necessary to underpin higher potential
growth.



Basic infrastructure and energy. Upgrading basic infrastructure and strengthening energy
governance, security of supply, and energy efficiency are a high priority to improve
competitiveness of the economy.

5.
The teams agreed that the Bank and the Fund share responsibility on financial sector
issues, revenue administration, and pension reforms, while the Bank will lead EU funds
absorption, basic infrastructure, business environment, health and education reforms, and
social inclusion. Both teams will keep the other apprised of upcoming missions and assessments.
World Bank country economists participated in the Article IV Consultations in September 2012 and
November 2013.

C. The World Bank Group Strategy and Lending Operations
6.
The Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Bulgaria, discussed by the Bank’s
Board on May 17, 2011, is anchored in Bulgaria’s National Reform Program to implement the
Europe 2020 Strategy and focused on three main pillars: (i) policy reforms for the National Reform
Program to implement Europe 2020 Strategy, (ii) strategies and institutions to accelerate EU funds
absorption, and (iii) complementing EU financing.1
7.
The active Bank portfolio in Bulgaria as of November 2013 consists of 3 operations at
the original loan amount of US$230.5 million equivalent. The World Bank’s lending program in
Bulgaria to date comprises 46 IBRD operations with a total original commitment of US$3,003 million
equivalent, consisting of 15 adjustment loans (US$1,725.8 million), 24 investment projects
(US$1,123 million), one debt reduction loan (US$125 million), four Bank-managed Global
Environmental Fund (GEF) grants, and two Bank-managed Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF) operations.
Of these 46 operations, 43 have been completed (of which 13 have been fully or partially cancelled
during implementation), and 3 operations are currently under implementation (Table 1).
8.
Economic and Sector Work. The World Bank country diagnostic work completed over the
last two years focuses on assessing the economic and fiscal impact of an aging population;
governance, quality assurance and financing of higher education; health sector reform;
programmatic crisis monitoring, and administrative barriers to private sector growth Recently
completed analytical work includes: Mitigating the Economic Impact of an Aging Population, Power
Sector Rapid Assessment, Health Sector Diagnosis. Strengthening Higher Education, Administrative
Barriers to Businesses at Municipal Level, and Alternative Dispute Resolution for Financial Services.
Three reimbursable advisory service (RAS) agreements for provision of World Bank advisory services
were signed in 2012 focusing on water supply and sanitation, innovation, and roads. Currently RAS
agreements in the field of health and irrigation are under preparation.
9.
As of November, 2013, the IFC had 37 projects (completed and ongoing) in Bulgaria
with total commitments of over US$895 million. The single biggest investment of IFC in the
country is in the field of renewable energy in the form of a loan for the construction of the largest
wind park in Bulgaria. IFC is also involved in the development of the Galata gas field near the Black
sea cost. In line with the IFC’s strategic goals for Bulgaria, IFC has supported a company investing in
agricultural land and promoting land consolidation. In the financial sector, IFC is supporting two
specialized SME banks; it established Bulgaria’s first micro-lending bank and has invested in a
venture fund, which is also targeting the SME sector. In other industries, IFC had contributed to key
manufacturing projects—it has supported the modernization and expansion of an electronics
producer, a large steel mill, and two glass processing plants. Some IFC projects entail an important
environmental component. One of the manufacturing plants, for example, is purchasing equipment

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance purposes. Bulgaria participates in the SDDS since 2003.
Real Sector
1.
The National Statistical Institute (NSI) is responsible for compiling national accounts,
based on a system consistent with the System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA 1993) and the
European System of Accounts 1995. GDP data by activity and expenditure categories are compiled
and reconciled within an annual supply and use framework. Government output and final
consumption are estimated on an accrual basis. Published national accounts include current and
capital accounts for the five main domestic sectors (general government and its sub-sectors,
financial corporations, non-financial corporations, nonprofit institutions serving households, and
households). The INS publishes financial accounts and balance sheets by institutional sectors and
sub-sectors on an annual basis.
2.
The NSI has compiled estimates of quarterly GDP by the production and expenditure
approaches in current and constant prices since 1994. The preliminary flash estimates of GDP
and its components by production and expenditure side are produced and disseminated 42–44 days
after the reference period, although persistent inconsistencies in the data have limited their usage.
The quarterly updates are disseminated 65 days after the end of the reference quarter with final
figures disseminated after approximately 5 quarters. The annual data are disseminated about 5
quarters after the end of the reference year. The estimates at constant prices, which follow
international standards, use chain-linked indices. Problems remain in the coverage of private sector
activities as well as regarding constant price estimates of capital formation and external trade,
although progress has been made in the development of export and import deflators. Recent IMF
TA advised on improving the seasonal adjustment procedure of quarterly GDP and volume
measures of taxes on products.
3.
Regarding price data, the NSI produces a domestic consumer price index (CPI), a
harmonized consumer price index (HICP) according to Eurostat methods, and a producer
price index (PPI). All are updated monthly. The CPI series begins in 1995, the PPI in 2000 and the
HICP in 2005 (for earlier years it is set equal to the CPI). The coverage of the consumer price indices
was extended, although they still exclude some important sectors, mainly owner-occupied housing
and health and life insurance. Since 2004, financial services are included. Work has started on
inclusion of owner-occupied housing in the HICP under a Eurostat project. The geographical
coverage of the index is restricted to 27 urban areas that account for an estimated 65 percent of
sales.
4.
The flow of customs data has improved significantly in recent years and a new system
for processing customs records is near completion. The development of export and import unit
value indices is progressing smoothly and additional support is expected from Eurostat in this area.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BULGARIA

The current indices are used as deflators for the import and export components of the national
accounts. Each month the Foreign Trade Statistics Department of the NSI is in contact with the BNB
to review data issues and ensure consistency between the NSI export and import data and the
balance of payments data.
5.
The national accounts data on employment and hours worked are compiled by the NSI
based on a Labor Force Survey and Enterprises’ survey on employment—“Quarterly survey on
employees, hours worked, wages and salaries, and other expenditures paid by the employers” and
“Annual enterprises survey on employment, wages and salaries, and other labor cost” are adjusted
according to the ESA95 methodology. The NSI current monthly and quarterly estimates are based
on the results from the quarterly sample survey of establishments – QLCS. The QLCS sample
includes 13000 private sector enterprises out of approximately 223000. The public sector enterprises
are covered exhaustively except for the schools and kindergartens for which from 2008 a sample is
drown as well. The NSI household labor force survey is an alternative source of data, but the
methodological discrepancies between household and establishment survey need to be taken into
account (especially regarding agricultural employment). Since the beginning of 2003 a quarterly
Labour force survey, providing average quarterly results, is implemented.
6.
The NSI also compiles and publishes quarterly wage data for various economic sectors.
The main shortcomings include: (i) under-reporting of private sector wages; and (ii) reporting of
average gross earnings only and not wages by occupation. Since 2002, a survey on earnings
(Structure of Earnings Survey – SES) is conducted every four years providing information about
average monthly and hourly earnings by economic activity, occupation, gender and education. The
household budget survey provides an alternative source of data for private sector wages.
7.
A Population Census was conducted in early 2011 and is a source for redesigning the
household surveys conducted by the NSI, particularly the household budget survey and the labor
force survey.
Government finance
8.
In recent years, following the recommendations of a combined STA/FAD mission and
within the framework of fiscal reporting requirements for EU accession, the authorities have
made significant progress on implementing accrual accounting for government, budgetary
and statistical systems. Consolidated data on a cash basis, covering general and central
government operations, are routinely reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook/Annual CD-ROM
and in IFS. In addition, quarterly accrual GFS data for the whole general government are reported for
publication in IFS, through Eurostat. The major part of the GFS data is compiled by NSI and the
transmissions to Eurostat are carried out by NSI. Since September 2008, the Ministry of Finance
(MOF) prepares and submits the SDDS indicators for the central government finances in the IMF’s
GFSM 2001 format. The same indicators are published on the MOF’s website on a monthly and
quarterly basis.

The Ministry of Finance prepares data on the execution of the consolidated
government budget on a monthly basis, following the national presentation. These data are
not according to GFS standards. Aggregate data on revenue, expenditure, balance of the general
government and composition of financing (in national formats) are published in the monthly bulletin
and posted on the MOF’s website, in addition to the GFSM 2001 data. Progress has been made in
presenting data on a disaggregated basis, including expenditure by functional classification. In
addition, a full economic classification of expenditure is now available, and the authorities have
provided such data on an annual basis back to 1998.
Money and banking statistics

The BNB reports monetary data for publication in IFS based on the ECB framework for the
collection and compilation of monetary data.
Balance of payments
11.
Bulgaria provides quarterly balance of payments (BOP) statistics for dissemination in
IFS on a timely basis. Yearly BOP data are disseminated in the Balance of Payments Statistics
Yearbook up to 2012. The BNB derives other sectors’ investment income data on reinvested
earnings (debit) from the annual direct investment surveys of the NSI, as well as through quarterly
surveys of the largest foreign-owned enterprises for preliminary estimates. Starting from 2002, data
series on freight were revised according to a new methodology introduced jointly by the BNB and
the NSI. Since joining the EU in January 2007, the trade data with EU countries are being collected
following the INTRASTAT system. Data for imports and exports of goods with non-EU member
states are based on SAD (Single Administrative Document) collected by Customs Agency while the
movement of goods within the EU is based on Intrastat declarations collected by the National
Revenue Agency.
Data Standards and Quality
12.
Bulgaria is subject to the statistical requirements and reporting standards of Eurostat
and the European Central Bank (ECB). Bulgaria subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS) since 2003, and the relevant metadata have been posted on the Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board. A data ROSC has been published in December 2003. The latest (2012)
annual observation report for Bulgaria is posted on the Fund’s website

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Bulgaria
On January 24, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Bulgaria.1
In the aftermath of the global financial crisis growth has remained low and unemployment
high. Real GDP growth is projected at about 0.5 percent in 2013 as domestic uncertainties
undermined demand but exports are performing well. Domestic demand is projected to
recover gradually, and exports and foreign direct investment (FDI) will benefit from recovery
in Europe, allowing real GDP growth to rise to about 1.6 percent in 2014. The current
account of the balance of payments is expected to be in surplus in 2013 but return to a
modest deficit in the medium term, financed by FDI. Inflation is projected to be subdued in
the short term, rising only from 0.4 percent in 2013 to 0.8 percent in 2014. With employment
beginning to grow, unemployment is projected to decline slightly in 2014 but remain high.
Strong macroeconomic and financial sector policies have mitigated vulnerabilities arising
from the difficult external and domestic environment. The fiscal deficit fell to 0.5 percent of
GDP in 2012 and public debt remained the second lowest in the EU. The reduction in banks’
foreign liabilities has been gradual and is largely driven by plentiful bank liquidity, resulting
in a positive net foreign asset position for the first time since 2006, and capitalization of the
financial sector is high. Although nonperforming loans (NPLs)—a legacy from the boom
period and subsequent crisis—amounted to 17.2 percent of loans in September, coverage by
provisions is comfortable at 72.7 percent.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
Convergence to EU income levels over the coming decades will require accelerated growth.
Bulgaria ranks favorably versus comparators on macro-policy outcomes but less so on other
dimensions critical to the well functioning of the economy. Bulgaria is comparable to good
performers in central Europe and the Baltics on fiscal and country risk, and the income tax
system is also seen as favorable in competitiveness rankings. However, Bulgaria ranks much
lower on measures such as enforcing contracts, resolving insolvencies, and some areas of red
tape. More generally, the judicial system is viewed as problematic, and corruption and
cronyism as widespread. These shortcomings will need to be addressed for Bulgaria to
unlock its growth potential.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for maintaining macroeconomic and
financial stability despite external and internal challenges. Nevertheless, growth remains
weak and unemployment is high. Directors emphasized the need to complement continued
prudent policies with accelerated and decisive efforts to address structural impediments to
higher growth, job creation, and a faster pace of income convergence with the European
Union.
Directors generally agreed that the structural fiscal stance under the 2014 budget, which sets
the deficit close to national limits under the fiscal rule, strikes an appropriate balance. While
the strong fiscal position provides some room to support growth, they underscored the
importance of maintaining credibility in the context of the currency board by observing
national and EU deficit rules. Fiscal buffers should be rebuilt over time by targeting a
balanced structural budget. In the event revenues fall short in the coming year, the authorities
should be prepared to adjust spending to achieve the deficit target. While welcoming the
intended increase in capital spending, Directors stressed the importance of appropriate
project selection and monitoring procedures under the new public investment fund. They
encouraged the authorities to improve the targeting and efficiency of social spending,
including on healthcare; to reinstate the needed pension reforms; and to address risks
associated with some state-owned enterprises.
Directors noted that the financial system is stable, well capitalized, and liquid, but that
profitability is low. They encouraged further steps to reduce nonperforming loans through
asset disposal in order to reduce asset price uncertainty in the market and support future
investment. Directors supported the efforts to preserve the conservative supervisory approach
under the new European framework.
2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any
qualifiers used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3

Directors emphasized that bold structural reforms are needed to lift growth, create jobs, and
enhance productivity. Policies should focus on improving the business climate and the
judicial system as well as anti-corruption and anti-monopoly regimes. Active labor market
policies, including further improvements in education and training will be important to
reduce labor market rigidities. Directors also encouraged continued efforts to ensure the rapid
and efficient absorption of EU funds.

Statement by Menno Snel, Executive Director for Bulgaria and
Tsvetan Manchev, Advisor to Executive Director
January 24, 2014
The Bulgarian authorities highly appreciate the informative and candid exchange of views
with the mission during the 2013 Article IV consultation, and thank staff for their appraisal.
They remain committed to prudent macroeconomic policies, and attentive to the Fund’s
advice and recommendations.
Despite the external headwinds and domestic challenges, Bulgaria maintains macroeconomic
and financial stability. Amid the uncertainty, the Currency Board Arrangement (CBA)
continues to be the cornerstone for domestic policymaking, together with stringent prudential
regulations and a strong underlying fiscal position. A new impetus for the structural reforms
will come from improving public confidence in the reform process and further strengthening
of the EU fund’s utilization.
The authorities’ near-term plan includes three main pillars: (1) increased attention to social
issues, thereby reducing the number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion through
better targeting and increased efficiency of social spending; (2) further reduction of external
and fiscal vulnerabilities through internal restructuring of the budget without deviating from
the new medium-term structural deficit target; and (3) maintaining a conservative approach
to bank supervision while implementing the new European Capital Requirements Directive
IV (CRD IV) framework.
We focus our remarks on (1) recent macroeconomic developments; (2) fiscal sustainability;
(3) the banking system; and (4) structural reforms.
Recent Macroeconomic Developments
The GDP dynamics in Q3 2013 suggested an acceleration of growth to 1.5 percent, which
compared favourably to the EU average growth during the same period (0.3 percent). Growth
was mainly boosted by exports, up by 9.6 percent. Even as demand from export-oriented
industries led to higher imports, up by 8.6 percent, net exports sustained their positive
contribution. Final consumption increased by 1.2 percent driven by the rise in public
spending. Consumer prices increased by 0.2 percent in October, thus breaking the
deflationary path, and the negative annual HICP decelerated to 1.1 percent. Short-term
indicators also confirm these early signs of recovery.
Labor productivity broke the negative trend observed in the previous quarter, and stepped up
by 1.6 percent yoy in real terms in Q3. The upward industrial productivity trend was the main
driver behind the quarterly reading, up by 4 percent (yoy). The seasonally adjusted
unemployment rate marginally decreased in Q3, but the trend reversed in October, and its
level remained unchanged in November (12.9 percent).

2
The current account balance recorded a surplus of more than €1.1 billion in January-October
(2.8 percent of GDP). It has been improving (in yoy terms) in most of the 2013 months,
mainly resulting from stronger export of goods. The cumulative trade deficit narrowed by
39.5 percent (yoy) in January-October. The current and capital account was positive for the
same period, amounting to €1.43 billion, and at the end of 2013 international reserves
reached €14.4 billion which covers more than 7 months of the import.
Fiscal Sustainability
Since the global crisis, the authorities have been facing the daunting task of striking the right
balance between fiscal consolidation and supporting economic growth. The protracted
slowdown and uncertainty in the Euro Area and the domestic discord in early 2013
necessitated a swift and firm political and policy response. While fully observing the
restrictions set by the new Fiscal Compact and domestic fiscal rules, in April 2013 the
caretaker government passed a small social assistance package of 0.05 percent of GDP.
Given the uncertainty it also proposed a marginal relaxation of the medium-term balance
target, and the 2013-2016 Convergence Program extended the path of fiscal consolidation
toward achieving Bulgaria’s MTO of a 0.5 percent structural deficit by one year, to 2017.
After the parliamentary elections in May 2013, the newly established parliamentary majority
has taken power with the firm ambition to spur growth, while preserving the sound
underlying fiscal position. Within the revised medium-term budgetary framework, in June,
the new government passed a second small social assistance package of additional
0.03 percent of GDP, and in August the Parliament revised the 2013 Budget Law which
provided an additional fiscal impulse of 0.7 percent of GDP. As a result, the fiscal deficit was
set to reach 2.0 percent of GDP. The budget implementation parameters as of end-November
and operational data for December outline an achievement of the revised fiscal targets for the
year. At the end of 2013 the fiscal reserve also remained well above the minimum threshold
set by the 2013 Budget Law.
The 2014 budget fully demonstrates the fiscal responsibility of the new government as well
as continuity in the fiscal policy. It remains consistent with national fiscal rules and the Fiscal
Compact. The budget envisages a deficit of 1.8 percent of GDP and a further decline to a
deficit of 1.1 percent of GDP by 2016. In structural terms the deficit in 2016 is expected to be
reduced to 1 percent of GDP which is in line with the MTO. Implementation of the new
Public Finance Law is underway, and the 2014 budgetary execution will be the first to fully
comply with the new rules. This year, however, the budget lays down taut and ambitious
reforms in the public finance management, while restraining administrative and operational
expenditures.
Within the budget envelop, the authorities aim at increasing the efficiency of capital spending
in small municipalities with otherwise low administrative capacity through the establishment
of a new special purpose investment fund (0.6 percent of GDP). A competitive bidding
process will be implemented under the direct control of the Council of Ministers. Concise
amendments in the existing administrative regulations have been adopted to increase
efficiency of the active labor market policies at both the national and regional levels. In line

3
with the staff advice, the authorities work on regulations to extend the coverage of the
targeted social assistance, and to implement more flexible eligibility thresholds.
To increase the predictability of the government finances and better anchor market
expectations, the new government continues to issue debt by priority denominated in
domestic currency and at fixed interest rates, as proposed by the Government Debt
Management Strategy for the period 2012-2014. The government also set more stringent
limitations to public sector enterprises and municipalities on taking new contingent liabilities.
In addition, the management of public enterprises has been recently strengthened, while the
government works on a new and more transparent framework for monitoring and control of
management’s appointment and performance.
The Banking System
The Central Bank of Bulgaria (BNB) remains committed to sustain and further develop the
capacity of the banking system and individual credit institutions to withstand shocks. The
authorities are vigilant and aware that since the global crisis has erupted the Bulgarian
banking system has been operating in a challenging low growth environment. The process of
deleveraging as seen in many EU banking systems did not affect the Bulgarian banking
system due to the on-going strong growth of local savings. The BNB continues its policy
from the pre-crisis period towards maintaining the accumulated capital and liquidity buffers
during the implementation of the new European CRD IV. The available opportunities under
the pillar 2 of the Basel Accord will also be explored in a flexible manner, by imposing the
maximum capital conservation and systemic capital buffers on all banks. Despite a cyclical
compression of profitability, the banking system remains stable, well capitalized and highly
liquid, and the same applies to individual banks. NPLs are reported in a conservative manner
and covered with an additionally created capital buffer.
The authorities remain committed to further develop the domestic insolvency framework in
line with the best international practices. As underlined by staff, the design and
implementation of an effective strategy for addressing the existing NPL stock in Bulgaria
remain seriously constrained by prevailing uncertainty and the current low stage of asset
market development. The authorities, however, focus on the good provisioning of NPLs and
acknowledge the benefits banks see in a “wait and see approach”. In the interim period, the
authorities will rely on conservative banking supervision. The BNB will continue to play a
supportive role to encourage a steady but gradual process of reducing distressed assets and
releasing the associated collateral that avoids unduly disturbing markets.
The authorities do not intend to participate in the close cooperation framework of the Single
Supervisory Mechanism, noting the absence of liquidity and solvency support as well as the
lack of voting rights in the Governing Council of the ECB for non euro area participants.
Meanwhile, Bulgaria remains fully engaged in the financial sector reform at the European
level.

4

Structural Reforms
The authorities remain committed to structural reforms. In compliance with the
recommendations from the European Commission and the IMF to strengthen education and
narrow skills mismatches, a new National Strategy for Lifelong Education has been adopted
at the beginning of 2014. The implementation of pension reforms has been postponed for one
year given the widespread discontent among the population about the perceived unfairness of
the existing package, but has not been reversed. The authorities have enhanced cooperation
with the interested stakeholders to reach an agreement in 2014 on the augmented package to
overturn the long-run deficit in the pension system.
