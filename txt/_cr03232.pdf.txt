IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with Trinidad and Tobago

On June 23, 2003, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Trinidad and Tobago.1
Background
Trinidad and Tobago recorded its ninth consecutive year of economic growth in 2002 despite the
global economic slowdown and the lingering negative impact on regional trading partners of the
September 11, 2001 attacks. Unemployment fell from 14 percent in 1998 to about 10 percent
in 2002, while inflation remained subdued. In March 2003, Standard & Poor’s upgraded Trinidad
and Tobago’s credit rating to BBB from BBB-.
Despite the government’s efforts to lower expenditures, the overall fiscal position of the central
government weakened somewhat in FY 2001/02 with an overall deficit of nearly 1½ percent of
GDP reflecting lower tax collections (by 4 percentage points of GDP) as a result of tax write-offs for
dry wells and higher than anticipated tax-deductible capital expenditures by a major oil company.
Reflecting a steady decline in the buoyancy of non-energy revenues, the non-energy fiscal deficit
of the central government widened to about 10 percent of non-energy GDP from 4 percent in 1998.
The overall deficit was mainly financed through domestic borrowing. A number of public
enterprises continued to depend on government transfers to service their debts, while some
continued to implement infrastructure projects on behalf of the central government.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed
during the June 23, 2003 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

At end-2002, the total public sector debt was 66 percent of GDP; of which guaranteed debt was
equivalent to 19 percent of GDP, and external debt 20 percent of GDP. The bulk of domestic debt
is held by commercial banks.
Monetary conditions eased in 2002 resulting in appreciable declines in interest rates. Reserve
requirements were lowered from 21 to18 percent during the course of the year. However, despite
declining borrowing costs, growth in private sector credit remained weak. This reflected the
economic slowdown exacerbated by increased uncertainty due to the political stalemate. The
central bank introduced a new liquidity management mechanism in May 2002, based on the
announcement of an overnight repo rate, with an initial rate of 5¾ percent. This rate was reduced
to 5¼ percent in August 2002, and has since remained unchanged.
The external current account weakened in 2002 to record a small deficit (¼ percent of GDP). This
partly reflected a continuing weak demand for manufactured exports as economic growth slowed in
the Caribbean. The overall balance of payments recorded a sharply smaller surplus of ¼ percent of
GDP (down from 5½ percent) as direct investment slowed. Gross official reserves cover remained
at around five months of imports.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors observed that Trinidad and Tobago has enjoyed an extended period of positive
growth, low inflation and a steady decline in unemployment. Directors commended the authorities
for their prudent management of the economy in recent years despite the global and regional
slowdown, but noted that challenges remain. These include the strengthening of the non-energy
fiscal and external balances and the improvement of the performance of public enterprises.
Directors viewed the effective use of prospective higher energy revenues as key to Trinidad and
Tobago’s future development and growth. They noted that the authorities’ plan to achieve
developed country status by 2020 through establishing a highly educated work force, and
strengthening infrastructure, is a commendable objective, but cautioned that the government needs
to tailor its spending in line with the country’s absorptive capacity. Specifically, they recommended
that the authorities take advantage of the higher-than-budgeted oil prices to raise the primary
surplus, and transfer part of it to a strengthened revenue stabilization fund (RSF), whose assets
could be invested abroad to generate income for future generations. Expenditures—particularly
permanent entitlements—should be kept under tight control given that increased revenues may not
be sustained. Directors supported higher spending on health, education and infrastructure, while
cautioning that adequate attention should be paid to the efficiency of such spending.
Looking ahead, Directors encouraged the authorities to give priority to developing a well articulated
medium-term macroeconomic framework underpinned by a three-year rolling budget. They urged
the government to target overall budget surpluses and avoid pro-cyclical fiscal policies, strengthen
efforts to reduce the non-energy fiscal deficit, and curtail tax exemptions. Directors welcomed the
creation of a unified revenue authority, which they saw as a major step in strengthening tax and
customs administration. Directors also noted that the planned reactivation and strengthening of the
RSF—to make it more transparent and flexible—should be an integral tool of prudent fiscal policy.
They recommended a comprehensive review of the country’s fiscal management entailing a public
expenditure review by the World Bank; a review of fiscal standards and codes; a revision of the
gas taxation regime in line with earlier Fund recommendations; and a review of the VAT.

Directors welcomed the system of pre-announced repo rates as a market benchmark. They noted
that a deepening of capital markets through additional public debt instruments would render repo
rates a more effective tool of liquidity management. In this regard, they also welcomed the newly
established Capital Markets Committee.
Directors observed that the managed float has helped to ensure low inflation and an orderly foreign
exchange market. Noting that external competitiveness appears adequate at this time, they
encouraged the authorities to monitor it closely, especially as the energy sector expands, to protect
growth prospects in the non-energy sector.
Directors welcomed Trinidad and Tobago’s role as a regional financial center, which warrants
heightened supervision, especially of the nonbank sector. They viewed the banking system as
sophisticated, dynamic and well capitalized, and noted that it does not appear to be exposed to the
weaknesses in the regional economies. However, they warned that the existing supervisory
framework for nonbank financial institutions needs further strengthening and, in this context,
welcomed ongoing moves to integrate the supervision of insurance companies and pension funds
with that of commercial banks, under the authority of the central bank. Directors welcomed the
authorities’ planned participation in the financial sector assessment program.
Directors welcomed recent steps to reinvigorate structural reforms and encouraged the authorities
to include pension reform in this agenda. In particular, the proposed restructuring of the sugar
company, CARONI, is a positive step. Directors urged the authorities to maintain the momentum of
the structural reform agenda, and to adhere to their announced divestment timetable. They also
encouraged the government to consider eliminating overlapping benefits of the national insurance
scheme with other public pension schemes. Efforts should focus on streamlining and harmonizing
the system of old age benefits and pensions, as well as the public sector pension scheme.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to further trade liberalization, and their decision to
participate in a pilot study to adopt transparency guidelines under the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative.
Directors welcomed the considerable progress made in the past year in developing an improved
methodology of compiling GDP and price data. They noted that in general, data are adequate for
surveillance purposes, although continued improvements in public sector statistics would be
needed. Directors encouraged Trinidad and Tobago to participate in the IMF’s general data
dissemination system.

Public Information Notices (PINs) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the
conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the
public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member
countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF's assessment of these policies; and (ii) following
policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board.
