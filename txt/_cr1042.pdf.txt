EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In 2009, the U.A.E. witnessed a significant slowdown in growth and strains in the banking
system as a result of the global financial crisis, the decline in oil prices, and the continuing
fallout from the bursting of the Dubai property bubble. The announcement in late November
that Dubai World (DW) would seek a standstill and the restructuring of part of its debt started
another round of ripple effects. The ramifications of the DW debt event will depend on the
scope and modalities of the debt restructuring, its impact on the financial sector, and the
strategy being developed by the Government of Dubai (GD) to put DW and possibly other
corporate entities on a viable economic and financial footing. Improved global conditions,
especially out of Asia, will fuel Dubai’s logistics and service sector. However, the correction
in the over-extended property and construction sector renders the overall outlook highly
uncertain. With foreign investor confidence shaken and international capital markets less
accessible, Abu Dhabi’s policy of selective support to Dubai will play an important role in
limiting contagion to the U.A.E. economy and the banking system.
The authorities


Responded to the global financial crisis in a comprehensive and prompt manner,
maintaining confidence in the banking system through various emergency liquidity
facilities, the guarantee of deposits, and measures to strengthen the banking sector;



Increased spending on strategic infrastructure projects, mainly in Abu Dhabi, to
reduce the contraction in construction activity, and provided support to quasi-public
entities and national banks;



After the debt announcement in November, reiterated that the debt of DW was not
guaranteed by the GD, announced that a corporate restructuring was being designed
in conjunction with the debt restructuring of part of DW liabilities, and initiated
insolvency law reform; and



Increased efforts to build statistical capacity.

Staff recommendations
At the Dubai level


For the debts of DW subject to restructuring, ensure a speedy, orderly, and
transparent process utilizing “best practices” for engaging creditors. The objective
should be to balance the viability (without government support) of these entities with
the need to limit contagion to the economy and the banking sector;

5


Communicate clearly on the viability of Dubai entities and the modalities of support
(including from Abu Dhabi). This is important to credibly signal which borrowings
are purely commercial and which are essentially governmental;



Increase transparency of economic and financial data, including financial accounts
and business strategies for government-related enterprises (GREs). Together with
improved corporate governance, these steps would contribute to rebuilding reputation
and creditworthiness and facilitate access of viable GREs to capital markets.

At the broader U.A.E. level


Articulate a contingency plan for the banking system to deal with the potential
deterioration in asset quality;



Design macroprudential tools to avert a resurgence of imbalances and discourage a
return of speculative behavior in the property sector;



Promote counter-cyclical bank solvency and liquidity buffers, with special attention
to systemically-important banks;



Coordinate the fiscal policies of the key emirates’ and federal governments;



Centralize debt management at the federal level to minimize risks, while allowing
emirate-level debt management offices to increase coordination of debt issuance by
their GREs;



Evaluate the medium-term fiscal implications of the scaling up in infrastructure
spending and the socioeconomic implications of the growing participation of skilled
foreigners in the labor force;



Put in place an appropriate corporate insolvency regime at the federal level to provide
a transparent framework for debt resolution; and



Continue efforts to develop statistical capacity at the federal level, including public
sector statistics and the compilation and publication of the International Investment
Position (IIP).

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The 2009 Article IV consultation discussions with the U.A.E. took place against
the backdrop of the global financial crisis and the announcement by DW in late November
that it would seek a standstill on some of its outstanding debt. After years of robust growth,
the U.A.E. economy appeared vulnerable. Signs of a slowdown were already emerging in
Dubai from the bursting of the property bubble in 2008. Abu Dhabi, with huge oil reserves
and very large external assets, borrowed to supplement its revenues and increased
expenditure significantly to maintain non-oil activity. However, the combination of
substantial short-term borrowing, a collapse of the local property market, and maturity
mismatches ultimately forced DW to seek a debt standstill as a prelude to a restructuring of
its debts.
2.
The crisis unfolded with differential impact on Abu Dhabi and Dubai. It
highlighted three key issues: (i) the contrast between growth based on hydrocarbon resources
and that based on nonhydrocarbon diversification funded by maturity-mismatched leverage;
(ii) the spillover effects and financial support structures in the federation; and (iii) the
volatility of markets in response to a lack of information disclosure and transparency. In
particular, the debt announcement undermined the widely held market perception of implicit
government support, including from Abu Dhabi.
3.
However, recent developments in Dubai, while material, should be viewed in the
wider perspective of the U.A.E. as a whole. Although the need to roll over part of Dubai’s
substantial external borrowing in the post-Lehman environment has highlighted the risk
embedded in the financing strategy of some Dubai entities, the U.A.E. has a net external
creditor position well in excess of 100 percent of GDP, among the largest in the Fund’s
membership (Text Table 1). This position is overwhelmingly with Abu Dhabi, especially as
concerns liquid unencumbered external assets, but several of Dubai’s GREs also have
accumulated substantial assets abroad (Annex).

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
A. Dubai Contracts and Abu Dhabi Expands
4.
The global recession, the bursting of the Dubai property bubble, and the postLehman shutdown of international capital markets hit simultaneously all of the
U.A.E.’s three growth engines in 2009. Oil receipts plummeted, global trade and logistics
contracted, and property development all but ground to a halt as incomes fell and property
prices plunged. A second bout of disruption arose when the government of Dubai announced
in late November 2009 that DW would seek a six-month standstill on repayments while some
$26 billion in debt was restructured. After three weeks of increasing tensions with creditors,
DW paid off the Nakheel bond on time, settling market nerves.
5.
The authorities responded decisively to contain strains in the banking system
and sustain economic activity. Abu Dhabi boosted the fiscal stance via equity injections and
loans to its GREs. The central bank deployed bank liquidity support facilities and lowered
interest rates. The federal government rolled out large scale recapitalization measures and
provided AED 50 billion term funding to the banks. Finally, the GD announced a support
package of $20 billion (half provided by the central bank and the other half by Abu Dhabi) to
finance the needs of Dubai’s GREs, and established the Dubai Financial Support Fund
(DFSF) to manage the support program.
6.
Notwithstanding the compensatory measures adopted by the authorities, overall
real GDP is estimated to have contracted by about ½ percent in 2009. After years of high
oil prices and production at full capacity, crude oil production averaged only 2.4 million
barrels per day in 2009, with hydrocarbon GDP declining by 6¼ percent. At the same time,
nonhydrocarbon growth, which had averaged 8 percent in the three previous years, is
estimated to have slowed to about 1 percent. This figure masks the diverging fortunes of
Abu Dhabi, where growth was sustained by public sector investment spending, and the
northern emirates (in particular Dubai and Sharjah), where economic activity fell owing to
the bursting of the property bubble1 and the contraction in world trade.2
7.
After peaking at about 12 percent in 2008, inflation declined to 1 percent in
2009, reflecting lower import prices (-10 percent in 2009) and a reduction in rents3 as an
increased share of rental contracts got renewed at the deflated market prices and new
buildings came on stream.
1

Dubai Land Department statistics show that residential prices fell by more than 50 percent between
September 2008 and September 2009. There are no official data on commercial real estate prices.
2

Overall, the 1 percentage point growth headline for non-oil real GDP for the U.A.E. as a whole is a weighted
average of 60 percent of Dubai and the northern emirates’ negative growth (-1 percent) and 40 percent of
Abu Dhabi’s strong positive growth (6 percent).
3

Rents, which represent almost 40 percent of the CPI basket, had fallen by 10 percent (y-o-y) in December 2009.
Over the medium term, CPI inflation is projected from import prices and the nontradable GDP deflator.

8
8.
The external current account balance is estimated to have shifted to a deficit of
2.7 percent of GDP in 2009, the first deficit in decades. As a result of OPEC-mandated
production cuts and lower prices, hydrocarbon export revenues dropped by about 45 percent
in 2009, while imports fell 22 percent owing to a sharp contraction in consumer goods imports
and despite the large investment projects supported by the government of Abu Dhabi.
9.
The reopening of capital markets in the second quarter of 2009 helped stabilize
financial account flows. The post-Lehman shut down of international capital markets and the
reversal of capital flows relating to speculation about a dirham appreciation, led to a large
deficit ($55 billion) in the financial account in 2008, resulting in a substantial drop in central
bank international reserves to $31 billion by year’s end. However, new external borrowing,
mainly by Abu Dhabi entities, helped stabilize the reserves by the end of 2009.
10.
Broad money growth slowed from 19 percent in 2008 to 10 percent in 2009. Credit
to the private sector was broadly flat in 2009 as demand weakened and commercial banks
adopted a much more cautious approach in response to the riskier environment. Credit was
therefore redirected towards public sector enterprises (35 percent growth in 2009), and banks
reconstituted their liquidity in the form of certificates of deposits (CDs) at the central bank.
11.
The consolidated fiscal position is estimated at a virtual balance in 2009,
following a surplus of 21 percent of GDP in 2008. Both oil and non-oil revenues fell owing
to the decline in oil prices and the slowdown in economic activity. At the same time, total
spending is estimated to have increased by 14 percent—a continuation of the expansionary
fiscal stance adopted in 2008—with capital outlays rising by about 20 percent. The
nonhydrocarbon deficit widened by about 7 percentage points to 34 percent of non-oil GDP
owing mainly to higher spending by the government of Abu Dhabi, which provided
substantial equity and loan (6¼ percent of GDP) to strategic Abu Dhabi GREs involved in
large projects. Dubai’s fiscal stance was mildly expansionary, reflecting the implementation
of large infrastructure projects (metro, airport, and roads).
B. The Dubai World Debt Situation and Ramifications
12.
Dubai’s economy is dominated by Dubai Inc., a web of commercial corporations,
financial institutions, and investment arms owned directly by the GD or the ruling
family under the umbrella of three major holding companies (Dubai Holding (DH), DW,
and the Investment Corporation of Dubai (ICD)). Each holding company includes several
property developers and is involved in assorted property ventures in Dubai and around the
world. Dubai Inc. entities borrowed extensively in 2004–08 to fund a major push into largescale commercial and residential property development. A significant increase in leverage
ensued, followed by a real estate price bubble. Since much of the debt had relatively short
maturities, and cash flows from property development would fully accrue with a longer
horizon, the risk from the maturity mismatch was always present; the collapse of local
property markets (due largely to a capacity glut in commercial and residential property) and
the global crisis highlighted these risks and accelerated the timing of their realization.

On November 25, 2009, the GD announced that DW and its two property
development subsidiaries (Nakheel Properties and Limitless World) would seek a
standstill on property-related debt until May 2010 to allow time for an orderly
restructuring. The standstill and restructuring was to affect $26 billion worth of bilateral
bank loans, syndicated loans, and bonds, including a Nakheel sukuk due to mature on
December 14 and guaranteed by DW.

14.
The November announcement came as a surprise to markets. The bursting of
Dubai’s real estate bubble in 2008, coupled with the global recession and financial market
crisis, had heightened investors’ concerns about Dubai’s ability to service its debt,
particularly in the case of highly-leveraged real estate enterprises. But in the several months
leading to November 25, Dubai entities had been able to roll over market debt falling due, the
GD had successfully issued a large sukuk, the value of Nakheel bonds had increased to above
par after trading at about 60 during the spring, and credit default swaps (CDS) spreads on
U.A.E. entities had tightened considerably.
15.
The announcement had a pronounced impact on Dubai’s perceived credit risk
as market participants could no longer assume an implicit sovereign guarantee

elevated for Dubai issuers.
16.
Global stock market reactions to the initial announcement were strong but brief,
with bank stocks most affected—especially for banks believed to be exposed to DW or other
firms with direct links to Dubai. The decline in stock prices also reflected global market
fragilities, low liquidity ahead of holidays in the U.S. and the Middle East, and end-of-year
effects.
17.
However, Abu Dhabi extended $10 billion to the GD to limit contagion to other
parts of the U.A.E.’s economy. $5 billion was provided through two Abu Dhabi banks and the
remainder will be included in Abu Dhabi’s 2010 budget. The GD used part of these resources
to repay in full the Nakheel 09 and announced that the remainder would be used to cover
payments to contractors, working capital, and interest expenses through end-April 2010,
conditional on a standstill agreement being reached between DW and its creditors. No
amounts for these various categories have yet been announced.

13
18.
Following the standstill announcement and the potential for litigation, the GD
approved a new insolvency regime aimed at facilitating an orderly and efficient
restructuring of DW debt (Box 1). The new regime reflects the GD's keenness to preserve
the rights of DW creditors and to enhance Dubai's role in the global economy by honoring all
contractual commitments with creditors.
19.
DW and its creditors are negotiating a standstill agreement. Since mid-December
there have been ongoing discussions between DW and its advisors and representatives of
more than 90 banks (U.A.E.-based and externally-based) regarding a formal standstill
agreement. A group of 7 large banks has formed a steering committee, a structure of
engagement consistent with international corporate debt restructuring. Although to date there
is no formal agreement, DW is continuing to pay interest on time and banks have been
informally rolling over loans. However, there is some urgency for this process—first a
standstill agreement, then a restructuring—to move forward since there are some debts that
will mature during the proposed standstill period. The restructuring could be affected by the
modalities of the treatment of debt owed to suppliers, to banks, and bonded debt.
C. The Outlook for 2010 and the Medium Term
20.
The fiscal and monetary policy mix will need to show adaptability over the
medium term in order to sustain a further diversification of the economy within a more
uncertain environment. In this regard, the federation will continue to benefit from its large
external creditor position, its excellent infrastructure and business conditions, and its prime
location between Europe and Asia.
21.
The staff’s baseline scenario envisages a further deceleration in non-oil growth
in 2010, followed by a gradual recovery thereafter. Dubai’s economic activity in 2010
will depend on global demand for Dubai goods and services, whether the property market
begins to recover (construction and property-related activity account for 25 percent of
Dubai’s GDP), and how protracted is the GRE debt restructuring. Given Dubai’s share in
U.A.E.’s non-oil GDP (above 50 percent) real GDP growth for the U.A.E. as a whole will be
low (about ½ percent), despite the authorities’ support packages and Abu Dhabi’s investment
projects that will help offset the contraction in Dubai.4 Growth would recover starting in
2011 owing to (i) higher activity in the oil and trade sectors in response to the recovery in
Asia; and (ii) an orderly restructuring of Dubai’s GREs. Medium-term nonhydrocarbon
growth is projected to average about 4½ percent a year over the medium term, or
4 percentage points lower than before the crisis, a reflection of less activity in Dubai’s
property sector and higher costs to access international capital markets. CPI inflation is
expected to reflect higher import prices and the impact of Abu Dhabi’s large investments in
infrastructure.
4

Projects already under construction are expected to represent $100 billion in 2010 (50 percent of NHGDP),
and up to $400 billion by 2015 (about 25 percent of non-oil GDP over that period).

14

Box 1. Dubai World Group–—Insolvency Framework
The Ruler of Dubai issued a decree effective December 13, 2009 (the “Decree”) to establish a special insolvency
regime to facilitate the reorganization and debt restructuring of Dubai World and its subsidiaries.1 According
to the GD, a special framework was considered necessary to support an orderly and efficient restructuring of these
companies mainly for three reasons. First, Dubai World, a company established pursuant to a decree issued by the
Ruler of Dubai, is not subject to any insolvency framework in the U.A.E., namely, the federal framework or the Dubai
International Financial Centre (DIFC) framework. Second, subjecting Dubai World and its subsidiaries (the “DW
Group”) that operate under several legal regimes within the U.A.E. to a unified system would minimize the potential
of applying different insolvency frameworks. Third, while the DIFC insolvency regime is generally regarded to be
broadly consistent with international standards, the federal insolvency framework has been rarely used and may not
be suitable for complex multi-creditor insolvency proceedings.
The Decree also establishes a special tribunal (“Tribunal”) to adjudicate disputes relating to debt restructuring
of the DW Group. The Decree gives the Tribunal the exclusive jurisdiction to decide all claims submitted against the
DW Group or any person (e.g., a member of the Board of Directors) relating to the debt restructuring of these
companies by applying specified insolvency legislation2 as well as “commercial custom, principles of justice, and
rules of righteousness and equity.” Under the Decree, the Tribunal consists of three internationally recognized
judges.3 All proceedings will be conducted in English and are open to the public. The Tribunal’s decisions, issued by
the majority votes of its judges, are final, irrevocable, and not subject to any appeal.
This new insolvency regime for the DW Group is generally viewed by creditors as a welcomed move towards
providing a legal backdrop for an orderly approach to debt restructuring. The regime, which is based on the
insolvency laws, rules and regulations of the DIFC (which are based on English insolvency law) with some
modifications, includes the following key features that could help facilitate debt restructuring while protecting
creditors’ rights: (i) providing for an automatic moratorium applicable to all creditors upon the filing of a notification
by DW or any of its subsidiaries stating its intention to make a proposal to its creditors for a voluntary arrangement;
(ii) allowing the Tribunal to cram down dissenting creditors when a voluntary arrangement is approved by two-thirds
in value of any class of creditors or equity interest holders; (iii) separately classifying secured creditors, unsecured
creditors, and equity interest holders for voting purposes and giving them the right to challenge a voluntary
arrangement if they believe the arrangement is unfairly prejudicial to them or wrongly entered into; (iv) according
priority repayment status to creditors that are willing to provide new financing during the voluntary arrangement
period subject to certain conditions; and (v) permitting the DW Group to assume or reject any contracts or unexpired
leases subject to the approval of the Tribunal. However, creditors of the DW Group also expressed the view that the
new regime fails to include certain features in line with international best practices such as set-offs and creditors’
right to seek relief from a moratorium under certain conditions.
It remains to be seen how the new insolvency framework will be applied and Tribunal decisions be enforced.
The limited experience with the DIFC insolvency framework provides little guidance on how the new law will be
applied in practice. In addition, it is unclear whether the Tribunal decisions will be recognized and enforced outside
the U.A.E., and whether the Tribunal has the power to enforce foreign judgments against the DW Group.

22.
Based on the WEO’s oil price projections, the overall fiscal position is projected
to return to a surplus of about 10 percent of GDP in 2010. Over the medium term, the
overall surplus will increase to about 15 percent of GDP, mainly due to a gradual increase in
non-oil revenues associated with the introduction of the VAT. Abu Dhabi is expected to
record sustained, large oil-driven surpluses over the medium term, while the GD would move
to a balance position as some large investment projects are completed.
23.
The fiscal policy stance will deviate from the sustainable path in the short term
in order to mitigate the impact of the downturn and support non-oil economic
diversification. Over the medium term, however, the gap is projected to close.5 In 2010, the
nonhydrocarbon deficit is projected to contract by about 4 percentage points, to 30 percent of
NHGDP, owing mainly to a slowdown in project implementation in Abu Dhabi, and to
improve over the medium term because Abu Dhabi is not expected to continue providing
support to its GREs.6
24.
The external current account is expected to shift to a surplus of about 7 percent
of GDP in 2010, and to increase gradually in subsequent years. In the financial account,
capital outflows would resume, reflecting official outward investment, but the Central Bank
of the United Arab Emirates’ (CBU) gross official reserves would increase steadily.
25.
The staff also prepared a downside scenario in which non-oil growth, oil prices,
and crude production remain at or below their depressed 2009 levels (0 percent, $62 per
barrel, and 2.4 mbpd, respectively). This scenario would correspond to low external demand,
especially from Asia, which would dampen the prospects for the oil, trade, and hospitality
engines and erode the external and fiscal positions. Under this scenario, problems in Dubai’s
property sector would contaminate Abu Dhabi and the balance sheets of: (i) nonproperty
corporates (lower earnings and no external financing); (ii) households (job losses for nonnationals; lower rental income for nationals); and (iii) commercial banks (lower earnings;
rising nonperforming loans (NPLs)). In addition, rising sovereign debt and contingent
liabilities would constrain fiscal policy, especially in Dubai; and the balance of payments and
fiscal positions would take longer to return to surplus.
26.
Downside risks could materialize if the Dubai debt restructuring were to
generate additional uncertainty. It is important that uncertainty be removed regarding the
financial viability of DW entities, the extent of implicit government guarantees to GREs, and
the insolvency regime. If uncertainties remain in these areas, ramifications could include

5

Development expenditure and transfers to GREs are excluded from the calculation of the fiscal deficit as it is
assumed that they yield a return on investment equal to the discount rate used in the calculation of annuities.

6

The rise and fall in the nonhydrocarbon deficit mostly reflects loans and equity from Abu Dhabi to its GREs.
As such, the timing of the impact on economic activity is uncertain because the outlays are not direct spending
by the government and can be used to allow GREs to borrow or to finance multiyear investment projects.

16
sustained lack of market access for even stronger Dubai entities and/or a more permanent
loss of confidence in Dubai as a reliable business location.
III. REPORT ON THE POLICY DISCUSSIONS
27.
The policy discussions focused on (i) the lessons of the global crisis for the U.A.E.
business model; (ii) the implications of recent events for the macroeconomic outlook,
including the banking system; and (iii) the Dubai debt situation and its potential spillovers
through real and financial channels. Particular attention was given the policy mix for
balanced and sustainable growth, the macroprudential lessons from the crisis for financial
stability policies, and the importance of transparency and disclosure for an orderly
restructuring of Dubai’s GREs.
A. The Dubai Model
28.
Even though Dubai has achieved an impressive degree of diversification and has
become a major trading and services regional hub, recent events call into question the
sustainability of enhancing growth through large-scaled and highly leveraged property
development. The Dubai authorities recognized that the recent events require a reassessment
of Dubai’s real estate sector to ensure the economic and financial viability of the emirate’s
corporate sector. As a result, over the medium term real growth was likely to be slower but
more sustainable than in the period preceding the crisis. The authorities were of the view that
Dubai had a top quality infrastructure, and that its hospitality, trade and logistics engines
should continue to benefit from Asia’s pull. Although the scope of the restructuring was still
being defined, the focus would be on refinancing the property sector.
B. Policy Mix on the Exit Path from the Crisis
29.
The authorities noted that their policy response had been successful in stabilizing
the economy. Countercyclical fiscal policy had played a key role in avoiding a major disruption
in economic activity, and the timely financial support provided by the CBU before the crisis had
prevented problems in the banking system. In addition, Abu Dhabi’s support of Dubai had
limited contagion to the economy and banking system during 2009.
30.
The exit path from the crisis, however, is fraught with uncertainties related to
developments in global liquidity, capital flows, and the possible implications of Dubai’s
debt restructuring. Prior to the announcement of the debt standstill, there were early indications
that global liquidity was again finding its way into the U.A.E.: (i) foreign buying on the equity
markets; (ii) deposit inflows from the Asia subcontinent and the Arabian Peninsula attracted by
higher interest rates; (iii) significant price gains for bonds issued by U.A.E. entities; and
(iv) signs of increasing prices for high-end Dubai properties. With developed economies
continuing to provide cheap liquidity to the global financial system, the authorities were facing
the possibility of having to manage renewed capital inflows.

17
31.
The debt standstill announcement raised concerns about a possible reversal of
capital flows, but the authorities indicated that they had not noticed any significant changes in
cross-border flows within the banking system following the announcement, and that so far
commercial banks had not made use of the new liquidity facility introduced by the CBU.
It cannot be ruled out, however, that the uncertainties associated with the process and outcomes
of corporate debt restructuring in Dubai could lead in the future to capital outflows.
32.
In this context, the policy mix should be mutually supportive and flexible enough
to tackle possible emerging tensions. Overheating could arise from the combination of the
expansionary fiscal policy and the limitations of monetary policy in slowing down capital
inflows. On the other hand, liquidity pressures arising from deposit withdrawals and capital
outflows could lead to a further tightening of credit conditions, with adverse effects on
economy activity.


Monetary policy: The authorities indicated that in case of renewed capital inflows
they would be prepared to sterilize partially the impact on the monetary and credit
aggregates by raising reserve requirements. In case of temporary pressures due to
deposit withdrawals and capital outflows, the central bank would be prepared to inject
liquidity through their various facilities. As a general point, however, the authorities
recognized the limitations of monetary policy in the context of an economy with a
fixed exchange rate and capital mobility, and indicated that the macroprudential
policies would also need to play an important role in dealing with potential pressures.



Fiscal policy: The authorities agreed on the need for fiscal policy to play a role in
moderating the impact of the crisis on economic activity, but stressed that it was
important to preserve fiscal sustainability and avoid excesses. They also noted the
challenges of coordinating the fiscal stance and debt management at the federal
level.7 They indicated that the establishment of a Fiscal Coordination Committee a
year ago, initiatives to develop multi-year rolling expenditure plans, and recent steps
to coordinate debt management between the federal government and the emirates
through the creation of debt management units would help improve coordination. As
a medium-term measure, the authorities stated that they had plans to adopt a VAT in
2012 in order to widen the tax base and reduce the dependency on hydrocarbon
revenues.
C. Dubai’s Debt Restructuring and Potential Spillovers

33.
The ramifications of the Dubai event are still unfolding, as it will take some time
for the GD to develop a strategy to restructure its GREs. The analysis is complicated by
the lack of information on DW’s and many Dubai GREs’ balance sheets and cash flows,
including asset valuation, nonfinancial debts, and bilateral bank loans. As a general point,

7

The emirates exercise autonomy over their own natural resources and fiscal policy.

18
external funding for Dubai GREs and private companies is likely to become more expensive
and limited at least until the property overhang is substantially absorbed.
34.
The Dubai authorities stressed that they were committed to working with
creditors in achieving an orderly and cooperative debt restructuring. They recognized
that the debt standstill announcement had created unnecessary uncertainty and market
tensions, and that there was scope to improve their communications strategy. They also
indicated that they were working on improving transparency and corporate governance. This
was regarded as important for viable companies to maintain access to international capital
markets. In addressing the transparency issue, however, it is clear that providing more
information would require some time given the complexity of DW’s corporate structure and
the web of its investments, as well as the need to develop an appropriate statistical
infrastructure.
35.
The authorities noted that the scope of the corporate restructuring and the debt
restructuring options were still being defined (Box 2). Restructuring would seek to ensure
economic and financial viability while protecting systemically-important entities. In this
regard, the authorities underlined that the entities whose debts were subject to restructuring
had valuable assets in their overall portfolios. So far the debt restructuring is limited to the
announced $22 billion, but the authorities recognized that other property GREs may have to
enter a similar process.
36.
The authorities emphasized that the crisis had encouraged greater cooperation
between the federal and emirates levels of government and between the emirates
themselves. Going forward, Abu Dhabi would continue to support Dubai in its efforts to
achieve a viable position. However, the Abu Dhabi authorities emphasized that Abu Dhabi
was not legally liable for DW debt and that any decision to extend support would be made on
a case-by-case basis. In this regard, they stressed that they did not want to create moral
hazard by supporting potentially nonviable corporations, but would provide support if
necessary to limit contagion to the U.A.E. economy and banking system.
37.
The spillover effects of the Dubai event on the GCC, the wider region, and
advanced economies appear manageable (Box 3). However, the event may have a lasting
impact on the availability and cost of external capital as creditors likely will further discount
notions of implicit guarantees in pricing quasi-sovereign and private risk.

19

Box 2. Considerations on Restructuring of State-Owned Entities
While there are widely accepted principles for sovereign and corporate debt restructurings, specific best
practices for the restructuring of state-owned entities are less clear. Nonetheless, an over-arching principle is
that such entities should be subject to the regular corporate insolvency law as far as possible. Since the
sovereign as shareholder will be involved in debt and operational restructuring of the state-owned entities, this
will affect the implementation of some of the principles and tools used in debt restructuring. The following
considerations are pertinent.


Transparency and predictability. Transparency and predictability play key roles in building strong
investor relations and reliable access to capital markets. There needs to be a clear line about the level of
support the state-owned entities enjoy from the sovereign. Corporate governance, transparency, financial
disclosure and audit standards need to be brought up to international standards such that the company and
investors are able to interact in a predictable and transparent manner. Restructuring plans should be
communicated clearly to the markets to anchor expectations about viability and credit worthiness and
reduce speculation.



Equal treatment of creditors. The process needs to be in line with best practices of equal treatment of
creditors, including nondiscrimination of foreign creditors. For instance, in restructuring negotiations, all
creditors should be consulted in a transparent, collaborative, and equitable manner. Such an open process
facilitates debt restructuring in a rapid and orderly way to arrive at a solution that minimizes disruption to
international trade and finance.



Importance of operational restructuring and corporate governance. Debt restructuring needs to be
accompanied with other measures to promote long-term corporate health and prevent future debt
restructurings. These measures include scaling/closing down nonviable businesses, asset sales, and
improvements in financial disclosure and audit standards. Cross country experience shows that even in
successful debt restructuring episodes, operational restructuring is often sluggish, slow, and inadequate.
Given their concerns over unemployment and public opinion, governments may be hesitant to down-size
or close nonviable businesses. Support mechanisms such as debt rollovers, guarantees, below market
interest rates and grace periods can become tools for propping up nonviable companies and postponing the
required operational restructuring.



Costs to sovereign’s balance sheet. The plan for government support (e.g. lending, establishment of
asset management companies, and recapitalizations) needs to be clearly laid out and fiscal costs and
contingent claims carefully evaluated to avoid excessive risks to the sovereign’s balance sheet. The
bailout of commercial entities which are not guaranteed should be minimized to avoid moral hazard and
burdening the sovereign’s balance sheet.

20

Box 3. Spillover Risks
The GCC: The main channel of transmission to the rest of the GCC would be through the balance sheets of banks
and other financial institutions. Although developments are still unfolding, available information so far indicates
that the impact is likely to be limited, assuming that the debt restructuring remains contained. From a countryspecific perspective, regional financial institutions exposures seem to be manageable, at least based on publiclyknown direct exposures. Since the source of the slowdown in the U.A.E. comes from the property development
sector and real estate prices, direct contagion (from Dubai-based entities operating in the GCC and foreign
corporates affected in Dubai) could result in a decline in construction-related activity in the region. The impact
through trade channels is likely to be limited: Dubai’s economy accounts for less than 10 percent of GCC GDP,
and intra-GCC trade is less than 10 percent of total GCC
U.A.E. Outward Remittances (2008),
as a share of receiver's GDP
trade.

Advanced economies: U.A.E.-originated foreign
investments, which are mostly directed to the
advanced economies, are likely to be scaled down as
the slowdown would force SWFs and corporates to
reduce their expansion abroad. In addition, the Dubai
restructuring could involve asset sales. The lack of
comprehensive data makes it difficult to assess banks’
exposure to DW and Dubai Inc., but available
information indicates that the impact is likely to be
limited. According to BIS data, the direct exposure of
international banks to the U.A.E. does not appear to
have systemic significance, although the indirect
effects are unknown.

The wider region: Indirect spillovers from cross-border
foreign direct investment and remittance flows could also
have an impact on the wider region, including the Indian
subcontinent. In the U.A.E., migrants represent around
3.5 million of residents, and outward remittances
amounted to $10 billion in 2008. Even though about
70 percent of these remittances accrue to India and
Pakistan, the most affected countries, in proportion to
GDP, would be Jordan, Bangladesh, and Egypt.

D. Financial System Stress Analysis
38.
The U.A.E. financial system entered
the global crisis exposed to a highly leveraged
economy. The system is bank-based and
focused on the domestic economy. Commercial
banks expanded credit very aggressively during
2004–08, generating about $100 billion of credit
above the underlying trend growth. Credit
growth was the fastest among emerging markets

by a good margin, and the capital base was disproportionately low for such growth (figure 4).
During this period, banks by and large did not retain sufficient profits to maintain capital
buffers, despite their exposure to an economy with significant leverage. Nevertheless, banks
remained highly rated throughout 2004–08, in part reflecting perceived support from
governments and in some cases government ownership. In addition, banks’ liabilities
(deposits and interbank loans) have been under 3-year blanket federal government guarantees
since September 2008.

The authorities quickly recognized the need to shore up bank capital as the global
financial crisis intensified. In the event, the average capital adequacy ratio of national banks
increased from 13 percent to 18 percent, mainly from government capital injections of
$16 billion. These measures validated the notion that U.A.E. banks operated with a strong
presumption of official support. The federal government also provided substantial term
deposits that were subsequently converted into tier 2 capital, conditional on the banks
increasing equity capital in the form of preferred shares subscribed by the emirati governments.
The tier 1 CAR is currently about 15 percent, while tier 2 CAR is about 3 percent.

22
40.
Prior to the DW announcement in November, the preemptive recapitalization of
the national banks appeared sufficient to handle significant contingencies (Box 4). Stress
tests showed that mainly the Dubai-based institutions would fall slightly below 12 percent
capital adequacy if loan losses were five times8 pre-crisis levels, and that all major banks
would stay above this minimum if losses were to increase three-fold. A five-fold increase in
loan losses would be equivalent to a 25 percent loss on the excess credit that built up during
the bubble period. If such contingencies were to materialize, additional capital of $3 billion
(about 1.3 percent of 2009 GDP) would be needed to keep all the banks above 12 percent
capital adequacy, the new regulatory minimum becoming effective in June 2010.

8

This level of stress is consistent with the recent experience of banking markets that were severely affected by
property bubbles (Dublin, Madrid, and the most distressed U.S. real estate markets). In the case of the U.A.E.,
under these assumptions, the ratio of nonperforming loans would increase to 10 percent on average, from about
2 percent before the crisis.

23
Box 4. Methodology and Calibration of Stress Test
Given the pervasiveness of real estate risk in the U.A.E., staff used balance sheet data from banks
operating in key bubble property markets of the United States, Spain, and Ireland to calibrate the test.1
Loan losses of banks operating in these comparators have increased four-fivefold in the two to three
years following the bubble bursting.2 This reflects a combination of: (i) the direct impact of bankruptcy
and layoffs in frontline sectors (construction, property development, and related services); (ii) the
indirect impact of job losses and corporate distress in sectors pulled down by the frontline (e.g., retail
trade, corporate and personal services); and (iii) expectation channels via consumer/business confidence
and the associated increase in precautionary saving, especially among South Asian expatriates.

Text table 4 summarizes the key results and provides methodological details and parameters.
_____________________
1/ Official data show that U.A.E. banks’ exposures to real estate declined in recent years, possibly reflecting the
increased importance of external financing of such activities. Regulation caps real estate lending at 20 percent of
deposits. As the indirect effects of bursting bubbles are powerful, using property exposure in a narrow sense would
be insufficient.
2/ The October 2009 GFSR expected loss rates of 2 percent for Asia, 5 percent for Europe, 7 percent for the U.K.
and 8 percent for U.S. banks.

41.
However, the DW debt situation has increased the need for additional capital as
these contingencies have become more likely to materialize.


The uncertainty created by the prospective debt restructuring implies that banks may
need material capital buffers above the regulatory minimum to maintain adequate

24
ratings for dealing with market counterparties. To illustrate, assuming that banks need
at least a 14 percent CAR, the additional capital needs would be about $6 billion or
2.7 percent of GDP.


The possibility of a principal haircut on the DW debt subject to the standstill cannot
be ruled out, an outcome which would have a significant effect on banks’
provisioning. As an illustration, staff estimates that the capital top up could reach
3.4 percent of GDP for a 25 percent haircut and 4.3 percent of GDP for a 50 percent
haircut of DW debt subject to the standstill.

42.
While the extra capital need appears manageable, the exercise underscores the
importance of contingency planning, supported by intensified supervision. The global
financial crisis is testing the CBU as a regulator, as it did with many other regulators. The
DW standstill has increased the potential for surprises and, consequently, the need for a more
pro-active supervisory approach and effective enforcement. The CBU could for example use
more systematically its power to block dividend distributions in the interest of building larger
capital buffers. There may also be a need to re-assess how exemptions to large exposure
limits are granted in the case of GREs. Finally, CBU inspections follow a traditional model
of rolling examinations of individual institutions, whereas the current situation suggests
the need for simultaneous cross-firm examinations of specific risks such as sectoral
concentration, name-lending, or deteriorating funding standards. In the latter case, the CBU’s
limited resources, including for off-site analysis, hinders such an approach.
43.
The authorities also agreed that macroprudential policies could be used in the
future to mitigate systemic risk by helping to slow down the formation of credit and
asset bubbles. This could be achieved through a menu of:


Counter-cyclical solvency measures: dynamic provisioning, lower dividend
distribution for fast expanding banks, higher capital charges for systemic banks;



Counter-cyclical liquidity measures: varying loan-to-stable funding ratios; reserve
requirements;



Systemically important U.A.E. banks could be encouraged to issue convertible debt
instruments (debt that converts into equity, subject to timing clauses or other
triggers), preferably in the international market, to supplement local regulatory
scrutiny with that of international investors.

44.
The authorities also indicated that they were looking at other options, such as
direct limits on corporate borrowing and bank credit growth, and measures to counter
renewed speculative pressures in the real estate sector, including:


More frequent and closer monitoring of bank lending practices related to this sector;

45.
The CBU is currently working on tightening the regulatory framework. It is in
consultations with banks on introducing a general provision for unclassified loans and
advances equal to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets,9 and on standardizing loan
classification across the industry on the 90-day past due practice used by the listed banks.
Regarding inspection, the CBU is focusing on enforcing provisioning standards more
uniformly. The CBU has also asked the banks exposed to troubled Saudi Arabia
conglomerates to increase provisioning immediately. The authorities also indicated they
would request that an FSAP update be conducted in late 2010.

E. Exchange Rate Assessment
46.
CGER approaches (equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER), macrobalance
(MB), and external sustainability (ES)) used to assess10 the level of the exchange rate
suggest that the U.A.E. dirham is broadly in line with fundamentals. Under the MB, the
projected medium-term current account surplus for the U.A.E. is close to the “norm” for oil
exporters. Under the ES, however, the projected current account surplus is lower than its
norm—the current account surplus that stabilizes per capita non-oil current account
deficits—suggesting that surpluses are below intergenerational equity needs. These results,
however, are subject to well-known estimation difficulties for oil-exporters and are very
sensitive to the assumptions used.11
47.
The authorities view the peg of the dirham to the U.S. dollar as appropriate.
They cited the composition and invoicing of trade, low consumer price inflation, and the
current similarity with the U.S. business cycle as relevant factors in favor of maintaining the
peg, at least in the medium term.

F. Structural Issues
48.
Labor markets. The development model and future growth prospects of the U.A.E.
continue to rely on imported labor that provides the workforce needed in an increasingly
diversified economy. The authorities noted that strengthening the skills mix of the labor force
was an important challenge as the economy moved away from construction as the major
engine of growth. They agreed that measures facilitating movement in the labor market or

10

Key variables include the fiscal balance, net foreign assets, and oil prices.
The current account norm under the ES is particularly sensitive to assumptions about population growth and
the real rate of return on investment.
11

2015

27
providing a minimum safety net for expatriate workers are likely to enhance the
attractiveness of the U.A.E. as a work place for qualified workers.
49.
Long-term financing. The growth model of the U.A.E. is likely to require access to
substantial long-term capital to continue to improve infrastructure and implement large
mega-projects. Domestic markets are unlikely to provide this kind of financing, which would
generate persistent funding gaps that in the past were filled by resorting to foreign borrowing of
relatively short maturities. The authorities noted the need to develop local debt markets and
indicated that various laws and regulations were being drafted to develop a treasury securities
market to help finance government development projects, as well as improving payment and
securities clearance and settlement systems.
50.
Data. The authorities recognized the need to strengthen the macroeconomic and
financial statistics in order to address the existing weaknesses that hamper economic
monitoring and policy formulation. To that end, an initiative to compile consolidated
government finance statistics at the federal level has started, some high frequency leading
indicators have been launched, and debt management units have been established at the
federal and emirate levels. The authorities have also adopted a new federal statistics law that
provides for (i) the establishment of an independent federal statistics bureau (the NBS), and
(ii) coordination between the federal and emirates levels for the collection, compilation, and
dissemination of data. The NBS was established in 2009 with a Board of Directors consisting
of representatives from all emirates to set the national statistics strategy. In addition, several
committees have been formed to coordinate data collection and agree on appropriate
methodologies. The NBS has indicated its intention to request Fund TA to help implement
the new federal framework.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
51.
In 2009 the U.A.E. economy was adversely affected by several shocks, including
the impact of the global financial crisis, lower oil prices, and the fallout from the bursting of
the Dubai property bubble. Against this backdrop, the authorities responded decisively to
maintain confidence in the financial system and boost aggregate demand through the
implementation of major infrastructure and strategic projects. The recent announcement by
DW that it would seek a standstill and restructuring of $22 billion of debt has raised new
important challenges. In addition to an expeditious restructuring, these include the need for
greater transparency, clearer demarcations between governments’ purely commercial and
other activities, and a much more prudent approach to project/investment evaluation and debt
management. As a result of these developments, in the coming years the economies of Dubai
and the U.A.E. are likely to grow at a slower (but more sustainable) pace than in the years
preceding the current crisis.

28
52.
It is essential for the government of Dubai to proceed with an orderly,
predictable, and cooperative approach to debt restructuring, ensuring inter-creditor
equity. In this connection, there is scope to improve the communications strategy and an
urgent need to enhance transparency and the disclosure of information. At a minimum,
financial statements and balance sheets of Dubai Inc. corporations should be published as for
listed corporations, and their operational relations with the government clarified. The
government should seek to avoid using continuing government support (direct or through
guarantees) that could make a restructuring easier to achieve but contribute to moral hazard
and weak credit appraisal going forward.
53.
In tandem with the debt restructuring, the Dubai authorities should move ahead
with the operational restructuring of the emirate’s GRE sector in order ensure its
economic and financial viability, without recourse to government guarantees. This will
require a thorough analysis of all the corporations, including those outside DW, to define the
scope of the restructuring; a careful reassessment of investment projects to avoid duplication,
increase synergies, and improve overall efficiency; and the development of a clear exit
strategy for nonviable businesses.
54.
There is also a need to articulate a contingency plan for the banking system in
order to deal with a potential deterioration in asset quality. The authorities have taken a
number of steps to strengthen commercial banks, but the DW standstill has increased the
need for further measures. There is evidence that NPLs have been increasing, and the
restructuring is likely to further impact corporate and household balance sheets. Particularly
close attention should be paid at the implications of reduced payments by real estate
developers and other companies to their suppliers because of the cascading effect and
possible repercussions for NPLs. In this context, the authorities should press ahead with their
plans to introduce a general loan provision, standardize loan classification, strengthen on-site
and off-site supervision, and enforce more uniform provisioning standards. In addition,
consideration should be given to further strengthening the banks’ capital, including by
converting the tier 2 capital already injected by the federal government into tier 1 capital. The
authorities’ intention to request that an FSAP update in be conducted in late 2010 is
welcome. In this context, staff recommends an assessment of corporate governance of banks
and other nonbank listed companies, a review of insolvency and creditor rights, and an
evaluation of the CBU’s crisis preparedness framework.
55.
The exit path from the global economic crisis will be fraught with uncertainties,
and the policy mix should be supportive and flexible enough to tackle emerging
tensions. Overheating could arise from the combination of the expansionary fiscal policy and
the limitations of monetary policy in slowing down a renewal of capital inflows, while
liquidity pressures could emerge if uncertainties were to trigger capital outflows or deposit
withdrawals. In this context, fiscal policy should continue to play a compensatory role to
sustain economic activity, and the central bank should stand ready to either sterilize liquidity,

29
including by increasing reserve requirements, or to inject it, if necessary, through the new
liquidity facility introduced after the standstill announcement.
56.
Given the limitations of monetary policy in an economy with capital mobility
and a fixed exchange rate regime, macroprudential policies are called to play an
important role over the medium term. Specific policies could include (i) counter-cyclical
solvency and liquidity measures and close monitoring of lending/funding practices, including
through targeted horizontal inspections across banks within a short time frame. Staff would
caution against the introduction of direct controls or credit limits because of their
distortionary effects and limited effectiveness in an open economy such as the U.A.E.
57.
The main spillover effects of the Dubai event are likely to include a slowdown of
foreign direct investment and project-related financing by Dubai to other countries in
the MENA region, and possibly reduced remittances to key emerging economies,
including India and Pakistan. More generally, investors will start to look more carefully at
implicit guarantees, and there will be a reassessment of quasi-sovereign commercial risks. In
this context, transparency and the timely provision of information on quasi-sovereign
commercial entities will be crucial for viable corporations to maintain access to international
markets.
58.
The efforts being made to strengthen policy coordination at the federal level
after the Dubai event should be intensified, while avoiding a duplication of activities
and institutions at the emirates level. Coordinating the fiscal stance at the federal level,
while reducing leverage through appropriate debt management, will be a challenge. In this
regard, the establishment of a Fiscal Coordination Committee, the development of multi-year
rolling expenditure plans, and the creation of debt units at the federal and emirates levels to
coordinate debt management are important steps in the right direction.
59.
The adoption of the Federal Statistics Law and the related establishment of the
NBS are important steps in developing statistical capacity at the federal level. Staff
encourages the authorities to develop an action plan encompassing the issuance of
implementing regulations (including the delineation of responsibilities among different
agencies compiling statistics) and a strengthening of the operational independence (from the
emirates) of the Board of Directors of the NBS. In that regard, an efficient collection of data,
the harmonization of methodologies, and funding for training and development could be
carried out more effectively by the NBS through branches in the emirates rather than by
establishing independent statistics departments in each emirate. Staff also welcomes the
initiative to compile consolidated government finance statistics and encourages the
authorities to press ahead with other measures envisaged in the GDDS action plans, such as
further developing the capacity to produce leading indicators and to collect and disseminate
data on the U.A.E.’s IIP.

30
60.
The peg of the dirham to the U.S. dollar remains appropriate. The composition
and invoicing of trade, low consumer inflation, and the similarities at this time with the
U.S. business cycle suggest that the near-term benefits of maintaining the peg outweigh the
costs of abandoning it.
61.
Prospects for growth in the U.A.E.’s increasingly diversified economy are
dependent on an ample supply of imported labor. An important challenge for the
authorities will be to strengthen the skills mix and establish incentives to further facilitate
labor mobility.
62.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

ANNEX. THE U.A.E. FEDERATION AND THE DUBAI DEBT SITUATION
1.
The U.A.E. is a federation of seven emirates formed in 1971. The Ruler of Abu
Dhabi is President of the Federation, and the Ruler of Dubai is Vice-President and Prime
Minister of the Federal Government (FG). The constitution gives each emirate autonomy
over its economic policies, laws, and natural resources. Some functions of government are
shared at the federal level, such as defense, foreign policy, and central banking. The FG’s
budget functions largely as a vehicle for transferring resources from Abu Dhabi and Dubai to
the other emirates in order to ensure that basic public goods and services (e.g., transportation,
health, and education) are of similar standards across the U.A.E. The richest emirates are
Abu Dhabi (50 percent of GDP), Dubai (30 percent), and Sharjah (8 percent). Sharjah City is
adjacent to Dubai City and fully integrated with it.

Jebel Ali Complex

2.
The Emirate of Abu Dhabi controls 95 percent of the U.A.E.’s hydrocarbon
wealth and has substantial external financial assets. Abu Dhabi (AD) is the world’s
5th largest exporter of crude oil and holds the 7th largest reserves of natural gas. Each AD
national has an imputed $50 million worth of below-ground hydrocarbon reserves, as well as
$600,000 of above-ground sovereign financial wealth. The AD Investment Authority (ADIA)

39
is among the world’s largest Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWF), valued at a minimum of two
times the AD GDP.112ADIA’s mandate since inception in 1977 is to invest overseas the
proceeds of AD’s hydrocarbon exports in a broadly neutral manner. ADIA’s portfolio is
globally diversified along the lines of Norway’s Government Pension Fund—Global.
3.
After decades of investing abroad, Abu Dhabi started only recently to invest its
hydrocarbon wealth into the local economy. Starting around 2007, AD deployed smaller
funds/sovereign wealth enterprises (SWE) with mandates to diversify the AD’s economy,
while keeping ADIA focused on investing abroad. The SWEs obtained equity and loans from
the AD government to finance massive investments into local infrastructure, real estate,
hospitality, advanced manufacturing, and supporting services. This new growth engine adds
significantly to AD’s traditional oil engine and to non-oil activity in the U.A.E. as a whole.
AD’s SWEs have also become significant issuers in the international capital markets.
4.
The Emirate of Dubai has historically been the most dynamic and integrated
internationally, following Singapore as a model. Dubai has been a trading port on the
Asia-Europe route since the 19th century—the Indian rupee was legal tender in Dubai before
WWII. The small Fateh oil field was discovered off-shore Dubai in the 1960s. Proceeds from
Fateh were invested locally, mainly to build the Jebel Ali Port complex which has since
become the world’s fourth largest seaport after Singapore. The complex also hosts Dubai
Aluminum, among the world’s largest smelters and another example of the diversification
drive of the 1970s. Emirates Airlines, Jumeirah (hotels), Emaar Properties, and Dubai Ports
World (DP World) were launched in the 1980s and 1990s with a view to further emulating
Singapore’s diversification success.
5.
A new diversification push into commercial and residential real estate came
around 2004 following the decision to allow foreigners to own property in designated areas.
By 2008, Dubai had become an attractive location for global companies serving the regional
market and for secondary/retirement homes of wealthy individuals living in an arc of
4-6 hours flight time to Dubai’s large airport. Accordingly, the economy now revolves
around two core growth engines: global hubbing (logistics, business services, and tourism)
and construction/property, with 90 percent of Dubai’s population being expatriates.
6.
Dubai Inc. dominates the economy of Dubai (Annex Box 1). Dubai Inc. is a
network of commercial companies and investment arms owned directly or related closely to
the Ruler of Dubai, his family, or the Government of Dubai (GD). At its simplest, Dubai Inc.
consists of three holding companies, Dubai Holding (owned by the Ruler), Dubai World, and
the Investment Corporation of Dubai (both owned by the GD). A few other companies are
owned jointly. Each holding is present in Dubai’s growth engines and this overlap has
112

ADIA does not disclose assets under management. Two times GDP is information provided by the AD
government to rating agencies. The Emirate of Abu Dhabi as sovereign issuer is rated AA or equivalent.

40
fostered competition as well as duplication. Each holding has choice assets with solid
earnings, as well as start-ups requiring large amounts of capital upfront, particularly in
property.213Dubai’s private companies are mostly owned by old merchant families. The
private sector is fairly small and dependent on Dubai Inc.’s business.
7.
Dubai Inc.’s three holding companies each have real estate businesses. These
businesses are mostly master developers of land granted to them by the GD. They sell
developed land plots further down the chain to local developers for marketing to retail
investors. They also build and manage properties themselves. Intense competition has led to
mega-projects, such as Emaar’s world’s tallest tower or Nakheel’s Palm and World
reclaimed islands, fuelled by short-term debt and benign conditions prevailing in the global
capital market. By the time the global financial crisis broke out, Emaar (part-owned by ICD)
was already a mature company with most projects sold, but Nakheel (a DW property
developer) or the developers of Dubai Holding, were not. Extensive leverage also fed
overseas investments and private equity ventures, principally within Dubai Holding and DW,
and at the top of the market.
8.
DW’s real estate interests are concentrated in Nakheel Properties, Limitless
World, and Istithmar World. Nakheel’s focus is Dubai; Limitless World, a more recent
company, has comparatively more overseas real estate ventures; and Istithmar World is an
investment arm with several overseas property-related interests. Although consolidated
financials of Dubai World are not public, Nakheel and Limitless likely constitute about half
of Dubai World’s assets, the rest being held mainly by DP World, JAFZ, and Istithmar.
Nakheel’s remaining interests in overseas properties were transferred to Istithmar in
September 2008.
9.
Dubai Inc. boosted borrowing sharply during 2004-08 to fund a new push into
commercial and residential property. Both foreign and local banks allowed Dubai Inc. to
increase leverage. Liabilities to global banks as a ratio to GDP were at similar levels to
Singapore in 2004, but this ratio became some two times higher by mid-2008. The increase
in foreign indebtedness took mainly the form of short-term debt. In addition to foreign
borrowing, domestic credit growth during 2004–08 was among the fastest in emerging
markets. In this period, the local banks generated about $100 billion of credit above that
expected from underlying trend credit growth.

213

Dubai Inc.’s flagship companies are the Jumeirah Hotels (Dubai Holding), DP World (Dubai World) and
Emirates Airlines and Dubal (ICD).

10.
The bursting of Dubai’s real estate bubble in mid-2008 and the post-Lehman
shutdown of capital markets increased investor concerns about Dubai’s ability to
service its debt. By early 2009, Dubai was still able to roll over, sometimes partially, the
debt falling due (Annex Box 2). However, there was consensus that the key test would be the
Nakheel 09 sukuk maturing December 14, because of its size ($4 billion, including interest)
for a company with limited earnings.
11.
Investor concerns eased substantially when the GD announced a $20 billion
support program for Dubai in February 2009. The GD sold the first $10 billion tranche to
the central bank of the U.A.E. in March 2009. Although Abu Dhabi was not formally
involved, the fact that the central bank as a federal institution fully subscribed the bonds was
taken as a signal that Abu Dhabi would help Dubai Inc. service its debt. By September, the
Nakheel 09 had risen above par, from 60 at the height of market concern in 2009Q1.31
12.
In July 2009, the GD set up the Dubai Financial Support Fund (DSF) to manage
the $20 billion package, as part of a broad push to restructure Dubai Inc. (Annex Box 3).
The DSF’s stated aim is to provide assistance on arm’s-length terms to Dubai Inc. strategic
entities that require temporary financial assistance but can otherwise demonstrate sustainable
business plans, the ongoing support of creditors, and realistic prospects of fulfilling their
repayment obligations, including to the DSF. Between March 2009 and the formal
establishment of the DSF in July 2009, the GD had already provided support to some strategic
entities for critical contractual payments and to protect Dubai’s economy and supply chain.
The DSF acquired these loans and amended as needed the relevant agreements. The DSF is
funded by securities issued by the GD. Although the securities are obligations of the GD, the
DSF is expected to service the securities from its own resources, hence its extra-budgetary
nature.
3

Trading above par reflected the fact that the Nakheel 09 would also pay half of the interest at maturity. The
accumulated interest was one feature of the Islamic nature of the structure.

Annex Box 3. The Dubai Financial Support Fund (DFSF)
The DSF is an extra budgetary fund of the GD’s Department of Finance (DoF) established in July 2009.
Its chairman is the Director of the DoF.
Objectives


support strategic entities critical for Dubai’s economy and supply chain;



maximize the impact of its capital;



deliver an appropriate risk-weighted return on capital employed; and



establish an optimal reporting regime that supports its financial objectives.

Terms and conditions
Applicant entities must submit detailed past, current and forecast financial and operational information;
comprehensive business plans explaining how operational or financial shortcomings support are
addressed; and a detailed and substantiated explanation of how debt, including any provided by DSF,
will be serviced and repaid.
Independent investment advisors appointed by DSF review this information to test the viability of the
business plans; negotiate the nature, terms and extent of support; and agree revisions where necessary.
On the basis of this due diligence, the advisors make recommendations to DSF management on the
extent, terms, and conditions of support, adequate security, payment of interest or dividends, financial
and operational covenants, reporting obligations, management observation and step-in rights.
At disbursement, procedures are agreed to monitor performance and report progress.
Funding
The DSF is funded through the proceeds of dollar-denominated securities issued by the GD under a $20
billion 5-year unsecured program with the following tranches:


First tranche, announced March 2009: $10 billion from the CBU, coupon of 4 percent per
annum or the rate on the U.S. 5-year Treasury Note plus 0.10 per cent per annum (whichever is
higher);



Second tranche, announced November 2009: $5 billion from two Abu Dhabi banks, half
conventional, half Islamic, similar terms;



Third tranche, announced December 2009: $5 billion from Abu Dhabi government, similar
terms. The second and third tranches have not yet been fully disbursed.

Source: Government of Dubai.

13.
Markets were surprised in November 2009 when GD announced that Dubai
World would seek a 6-month standstill on debt related to its real estate businesses as a
prelude to their restructuring. After several days of dislocation compounded by thin
holiday trading, markets settled into a new pattern of sharp differentiation between Dubai
entities with strong cash flows or explicit government guarantees, and other entities. With
Nakheel’s debt included in the announcement, bondholders read more carefully the
prospectus of the Nakheel 09 sukuk maturing in December, and concluded that the
complexity of the structure could hinder investor recourse to Nakheel or DW assets.
14.
Abu Dhabi stepped in shortly thereafter to prevent the disruption that a default
would have meant for the economy of the U.A.E. and its banking system. The
government extended a $5 billion loan to the GD in order to pay the Nakheel 09 in full and
on time. In announcing the transaction, Abu Dhabi stressed that support for Dubai entities is

45
and will remain selective and on a case-by-case basis. It is generally agreed that without
significant debt restructuring, Nakheel is unlikely to be a sustainable business (e.g., the
Nakheel 10 and 11 are trading at around 50–60 cents on the dollar). In supporting an entity
under financial duress, Abu Dhabi was signaling its intention to limit contagion to the U.A.E.
economy and banking system.
15.
The restructuring of DW is complicated because this holding company has dozens
of subsidiaries, participations and interests, both locally and around the world (Annex
Box 4). The GD appointed a chief restructuring officer (CRO) [Deloitte LLC] to go through
its accounts with a view to triage the businesses according to their needs for operational
restructuring and balance sheet restructuring. At this stage, the CRO’s focus is on the group’s
real estate operations and interests. However, the CRO will also need to determine whether
assets of the healthy parts of DW will also be included in the restructuring process.
16.
Neither DW nor Dubai Inc. discloses consolidated balance sheet or debt
information. There are no official statistics, and it is difficult to build them from company
financials because the majority of Dubai Inc. entities do not disclose financials, except to
their bankers. Documentation in the public domain covers only syndicated loans and bonds
as captured by various data providers, and analysts’ estimates are based on these sources. As
such, the estimates are of publicly-held debt and therefore exclude (i) syndicated loans for
which documentation is incomplete; (ii) bilateral loans (from global or local banks); (iii)
accounts payables/suppliers’ credits; and (iv) derivatives, credit commitments, and other
liabilities. Staff’s estimate of Dubai publicly-held debt is contained in Annex Table 1. Dubai
Inc. debt on this preliminary basis would be on the order of $85 billion, of which $8 billion
corresponds to foreign notes and bonds issued by banks controlled by Dubai Inc. The GD
would have direct debt of $24 billion, giving a total of $109 billion (about 130 percent of
Dubai GDP). Within this total, GD and GD-guaranteed debt is about $35 billion (40 percent
of Dubai GDP).
17.
Information on debt within the DW standstill perimeter has become clearer than
on debt of DW’s consolidated or Dubai Inc.’s debt. At this time, and after the payment of
the Nakheel 09, the standstill perimeter is about $22 billion (in local and foreign currencies),
of which $12 billion is in the form of syndicated loans, $7.5 billion corresponds to bilateral
loans and $2.5 billion to bonds. The share held by national banks is 45 percent of the total
($10 billion), of which 2/3 is to Dubai-based banks (6 percent of their book) and 1/3 to
Abu Dhabi banks (3 percent of their book). The national banks also hold 80 percent of the
Nakheel 10 and 11 sukuk bonds. The debt subject to negotiation is owed by Nakheel,
Limitless, and by DW at the holding company level (DW Holding, DW Group Finance), the
largest component being at the holding company level. The extent and form of the needed
debt restructuring will become clearer as the negotiations between DW and its creditors
progress.

The estimates of publicly-held debt are not comparable to the Fund’s external
debt concept, which is based on the residency principle, for two main reasons:


Holders of debt that are resident, including U.A.E national banks (which hold
45 percent of the DW debt within the standstill perimeter) and foreign banks resident
in the U.A.E., are excluded in the Fund’s definition of external debt.



Dubai Inc. owns businesses that are nonresident, and their debt should also be
excluded. For example, outstanding international debt securities issued by U.A.E.
residents amounted to $55 billion in June 2009, but reached $74 billion after adding
the debt securities of nonresident issuers controlled by U.A.E. nationals, for example
out of the Cayman Islands.

The information on publicly-held debt has the advantage of identifying a Dubai issuer, e.g.,
Dubai World or Nakheel, from any other U.A.E.-based issuer. Unfortunately, information on
the assets of Dubai Inc.’s balance sheet is not available, except for a few listed entities,

48
making it difficult to assess its net financial worth. 2 As a point of comparison, the GREs of
Abu Dhabi (excluding its SWFs) had assets of $61 billion in 2008, and debts of $40 billion as
of November 2009.
19.
BIS statistics on international banking and debt securities are compiled on a
residency basis and can be used to build a rough estimate of the U.A.E.’s international
investor position. Banks from 30 countries report most conventional claims, including
bilateral loans; banks from a subset of 24 countries also report derivatives claims, guarantees
and credit commitments. International debt securities are compiled by the BIS from market
sources, and are reported by residency of issuer and nationality of issuer. Accounts’
payables/suppliers’ credit can be proxied by export credit exposures that are insured by
OECD-based agencies. Staff has combined this data, together with estimates of external
assets, including Abu Dhabi SWFs, to obtain a summary estimate of the IIP for the U.A.E.
(Annex Table 2). Full details are provided in Annex Table 3.
20.
Central bank reserves, foreign assets of commercial banks, and deposits abroad
of non-banks are equivalent to twice the size of the external debt falling due in one year.
Foreign assets of the banking system and nonbanks augmented by the external assets of
SWFs and U.A.E. high net worth individuals (HNWIs) would cover the external debt twice
over. The estimated IIP for 2009 is equivalent to 132 percent of GDP. This estimate is based
on ADIA having foreign assets no larger than two times the size of Abu Dhabi’s GDP. It
implies that HNWIs, the SWEs of Abu Dhabi Inc., and Dubai Inc. would have external assets
of only $20 billion, a conservative estimate.

2

For example, Emaar (property arm of ICD) disclosed consolidated assets of $18 billion in 2009 in
60 companies (operations and investments) in 36 markets. It has full-fledged operations in the U.A.E., Saudi
Arabia, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Morocco, Algeria, Libya, India, Pakistan, Turkey, Indonesia, U.S.A.,
Canada, and UK.

APPENDIX II: UNITED ARAB EMIRATES—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
As of January 17, 2010
The World Bank
During 2008-09, the World Bank assisted the Ministry of Finance in building the capacity to
issue treasury bonds. Phases one (the assessment report) and two (legislation and market
infrastructure report) are completed. Components include assistance in drafting of the debt
framework law (since enacted) and the operational guidelines for the Debt Management
Office (DMO) of the U.A.E., as well as providing a sample code of conduct for the DMO.
Phase 3, as envisaged, will involve support to the operation of the DMO.
As part of ongoing consultations on a regional financial sector report to be published in 2010,
Bank staff have held discussions with the Ministry of Finance and Central Bank concerning
options for strengthening the functioning of the U.A.E. financial sector.
Within the U.A.E., the Bank has been cooperating with individual Emirates on an ad hoc
basis.


In Ras Al Khaimah (RAK), technical cooperation has included
o Promoting a better investment climate and assisting in mobilizing private
investment: an investors' conference (May 2005) attracted major strategic,
financial and individual investors from around the world and had a significant
impact on the investment climate improvement;
o More recently, the Government of RAK requested the World Bank’s technical
assistance to design a multi-jurisdictional student loan program. Under the
program, financial aid will be provided to students enrolled in courses at the
International Trade and Hospitality Program (a joint venture partnership
between the Government of RAK and the International Development
Corporation (IDC) providing an education, training and job placement system
designed to meet the needs of future and current employees and managers of
the hospitality industry).



In Abu Dhabi, the Bank is providing assistance to
o Abu Dhabi Food Control Authority, which is currently developing and
implementing a food security program for the emirate of Abu Dhabi with the
potential for developing a U.A.E.-wide approach; and
o Abu Dhabi Judicial Department, which is undertaking a judicial reform.



In Dubai, the Bank has provided background information about public sector reform
strategies to the Executive Council.

5

International Finance Corporation (IFC)
IFC continues to provide ad hoc support to the U.A.E. at the federal and local levels through
its regional office in Dubai. In addition, IFC’s Doing Business team has been working with
the Emirates Competitiveness Council (a joint federal and emirate body) to address
constraints identified in IFC’s ease of doing business global rankings.
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)
MIGA has provided political risk insurance for a container terminal project in Djibouti to be
run under a 30 year concession by Dubai Ports World. The $427 million guarantee was
specially designed to accommodate the Islamic financing structure for the project.

APPENDIX III: UNITED ARAB EMIRATES—STATISTICAL ISSUES
U.A.E.—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
As of January 19, 2010
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. The federal and individual emirates’
agencies have improved the availability and quality of the statistics, although much needs to be done.
The adoption of the Federal Statistics Law on May 18, 2009, and the establishment of an independent
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) are important steps in establishing a statistical system at the
federal level. While the Law expressly requires all agencies and local statistical centers to provide
data as required by the NBS, progress in compiling accurate and timely data will depend on the
issuance of implementation regulations (including the delineation of responsibilities among agencies
that compile statistics), staffing, funding and training, as well as political commitment.
National Accounts: The methodology broadly conforms to the 1968 SNA. GDP is compiled
annually with a lag of around 18 months and only current price expenditure estimates are available.
Some progress has been made in improving the source data but further work is needed to improve
updating procedures, and quarterly indicators are not available.
Price statistics: Following technical assistance from the IMF Statistics Department, the Ministry of
Economy started publishing a monthly CPI since January 2008. However, price indexes and GDP
deflators need further harmonization at the federal level.
Government finance statistics: In 2008, six of the seven emirates and the federal government have
received technical support in the compilation of fiscal data on a consolidated basis, using the GFSM
2001 format and 2008 as a base year. The authorities, however, are yet to adopt the action plan to
establish a fiscal reporting system for the production of the GFS in a regular and timely manner. An
institutional arrangement will need to be established to ensure adequate data provision. This
consolidation should complement initiatives to establish Debt Management Units at both the emirate
and federal levels.
Monetary statistics: The central bank has recently shifted the responsibility for compiling and
disseminating monetary data to the Banking Supervision and Examination Department, in order to
improve the timeliness of data to monthly frequency with less than a month lag. Although some
monthly aggregates and FSIs are already published on a monthly basis the Banking Supervision and
Examination Department has not been trained in MFSM 2000 and the published data do not follow
the recommended methodology.
Balance of Payments: The information needed to compile the balance of payments is insufficient,
especially for the financial account. Many components of the IIP also are missing or incomplete, as
the data on government foreign assets and private holdings of foreign assets and liabilities are not
published or lack appropriate surveys. The development of a comprehensive Balance of Payments
and IIP is however within the reach of the U.A.E. if the Central Bank, the NBS, and the Ministry of
Economy strengthen their capacity and receive appropriate support at the high level. The authorities
have indicated their interest in IMF technical assistance.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with United
Arab Emirates
On February 3, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with United Arab Emirates.1
Background
The United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) was adversely affected by a series of external and domestic
shocks in 2009, including the global economic slowdown, the shutdown of international capital
markets, and the impact of the bursting Dubai property bubble in mid-2008. Oil receipts
plummeted, global trade and logistics contracted, as did property/construction activities.
A second bout of disruption arose when Dubai World (DW) announced in late November 2009
that it would seek a debt standstill through May 2010, including on bonded debt owed by its
Nakheel property subsidiary. Market tensions calmed down after DW paid off the Nakheel bond
on time in December with financial support from Abu Dhabi, but uncertainties remain. In
particular, discussions on the modalities of Dubai’s debt restructuring are still ongoing, access
to financial markets by Dubai entities has become more difficult, and it will take some time for
the Government of Dubai (GD) to design and implement a strategy on the operational
restructuring of its government-related entities (GREs).

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
Overall real GDP is estimated to have contracted by about ½ percent in 2009. Hydrocarbon
GDP declined by 6¼ percent, while nonhydrocarbon growth, which had averaged 8 percent in
the three previous years, is estimated to have slowed to about 1 percent. This figure masks the
diverging fortunes of Abu Dhabi (where growth was sustained by public sector investment
spending) and the northern emirates (in particular Dubai and Sharjah), where economic activity
dropped owing to the bursting property bubble and the contraction in world trade.
After peaking at about 12 percent in 2008, annual consumer inflation declined to about
1 percent in 2009, reflecting lower import prices and a reduction in rents arising from an
increased supply of buildings as well as the renewal of contracts at deflated market prices.
The external current account balance is estimated to have shifted to a deficit of 2.7 percent of
GDP in 2009, the first deficit in decades. As a result of OPEC-mandated production cuts and
lower prices, hydrocarbon export revenues dropped by about 45 percent in 2009, while imports
fell by 22 percent owing to a sharp contraction in consumer goods imports and despite the large
public infrastructure projects in Abu Dhabi. The reopening of capital markets in the second
quarter of 2009 and external borrowing particularly by Abu Dhabi entities helped stabilize the
international reserves position by the end of 2009.
The consolidated fiscal position is estimated at a virtual balance in 2009, following a surplus of
21 percent of GDP in 2008. Both oil and non-oil revenues fell owing to the decline in oil prices
and the slowdown in economic activity, while spending increased by about 14 percent—a
continuation of the expansionary fiscal stance adopted in 2008. The nonhydrocarbon deficit
widened by about 7 percentage points to 34 percent of non-oil GDP in 2009, owing mainly to
higher outlays by Abu Dhabi on strategic projects.
Broad money growth slowed from 19 percent in 2008 to 10 percent in 2009. Real credit to the
private sector was flat in 2009 as demand weakened and commercial banks adopted a much
more cautious approach in response to the riskier conditions. Credit was redirected towards
public sector enterprises, and banks increased their holding of central bank CDs.
As the global crisis intensified, the authorities implemented measures to maintain confidence in
the banking system, including recapitalization. As a result, the capital adequacy ratio of national
banks increased from 13 percent to 18 percent in half a year. The authorities are currently
working on tightening the regulatory framework by introducing a general provision for
unclassified loans, standardizing loan classification, and enforcing provisioning standards
uniformly.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the U.A.E. authorities for their decisive response to shocks
from the global financial crisis, lower oil prices, and the bursting of the Dubai bubble. Directors
noted, however, that these shocks, together with the recent announcement that DW would seek
a six-month debt standstill, have raised important challenges for the U.A.E. economy.

3
Directors agreed that the prospects for the U.A.E. economy, given its underlying strengths,
remain favorable. It will be important, however, to embark on a more balanced and sustainable
growth path over the medium term.
Directors welcomed the ongoing engagement with DW’s creditors and stressed the importance
of a speedy, orderly, cooperative, and predictable approach to debt restructuring. They
underscored that the process should seek to enhance transparency and information disclosure
and ensure comparability of treatment among creditors. They also emphasized that debt
restructuring should be accompanied by a vigorous effort to undertake an operational
restructuring of GREs, including formulating exit strategies for nonviable corporations, a process
that will likely take time.
Directors welcomed the steps taken by the authorities to strengthen confidence in the banking
system, but noted that the DW event had highlighted the need for additional contingency
planning measures. In this context, Directors stressed the need to articulate a plan for dealing
with the potential increase in loan losses. They also emphasized the importance of pressing
ahead with introducing general loan provisions, enforcing more uniform provisioning and loan
classification standards, and further strengthening capital buffers. Directors agreed that
macroprudential policies should play an increasingly important role over the medium term, and
noted that countercyclical solvency and liquidity measures, as well as closer monitoring of
systemically important banks, could complement other regulatory policies. Directors also
recommended an assessment of corporate governance, as well as development of a federal
insolvency law.
Directors welcomed recent initiatives aimed at improving policy coordination at the federal level,
including the establishment of a Fiscal Coordination Committee, the development of multi-year
expenditure plans, and the introduction of debt management units. Looking ahead, they
encouraged the authorities to rationalize investment decisions at the federal level, and to
respond flexibly to the uncertainties surrounding the global outlook. Directors underscored that,
given the limitations of monetary policy, fiscal policy should continue to play an important role in
supporting economic activity. Most Directors agreed that the exchange rate peg to the
U.S. dollar has provided a credible anchor and contributed to macroeconomic stability.
Directors stressed the need for increased transparency of economic and financial data,
including financial accounts and business strategies for GREs. Together with improved
corporate governance, Directors concluded that these steps would contribute to facilitating
access of viable GREs to capital markets.
Directors viewed the adoption of the Federal Statistics Law and the establishment of the
National Bureau of Statistics as important steps toward developing capacity at the federal level.
They stressed the need to develop an action plan including the issuance of implementing
regulations and a strengthening of the Board’s operational independence. Directors also
welcomed the authorities’ efforts to compile consolidated fiscal statistics and encouraged them
to pursue plans to develop leading indicators and the U.A.E’s international investment position,
in line with initiatives under the General Data Dissemination System.

Statement by A. Shakour Shaalan, Executive Director
for the United Arab Emirates
February 3, 2010

Overview
1.
Following several years of rapid growth and structural reforms, the United Arab
Emirates (U.A.E.) economy was adversely affected by the global economic financial crisis,
the sharp drop in oil prices, and the correction of the Dubai property market. These events
were cushioned by the prudent management of the economy during the previous years, which
resulted in strong fiscal and current account surpluses, and sizeable net foreign assets. With
this solid position, the authorities took decisive measures to mitigate the impact of these
shocks on the economy. The recent announcement by Dubai World (DW) that it will seek a
standstill and restructuring of debt had only limited spillover effects given the solid
creditworthiness of the U.A.E.
Developments since the last Article IV Consultation
2.
The U.A.E.’s economy showed signs of slowdown in the second half of 2008. It
experienced a mild contraction in 2009, reflecting a decline in oil output—in line with
OPEC-agreed production cuts—and lower non-oil growth associated with the property
market correction and tight credit conditions. Non-hydrocarbon GDP growth dropped from
an average of 8 percent during 2006-2008 to 1 percent in 2009. Hydrocarbon exports plunged
by about 45 percent, leading to the emergence of a current account deficit of GDP. Inflation
fell substantially from a peak of 12 percent in 2008 to around 1 percent in 2009, mainly
reflecting a reduction in rents and import prices. Of course, in this environment bank credit
dropped sharply.
3.
The authorities acted swiftly to preserve financial stability, mitigate the impact of
spillovers, and support economic activity in 2009. The fiscal stance continued to be
expansionary, and focused on capital spending on infrastructure as well as on lending to
public corporations. Public expenditures increased sharply, which together with the decline
in revenues, resulted in the deterioration of the consolidated fiscal position from a surplus of
21 percent of GDP in 2008 to balance in 2009. The Central Bank of the U.A.E. pursued
policies to shore up confidence in the financial sector and provide needed liquidity. It
lowered the repurchase rate in early 2009, in tandem with cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve,
and created a sizeable concessional short-term lending facility.
4.
The authorities also stepped in to bolster bank capitalization. With capital injections
from the federal and Emirates’ governments, the U.A.E. average bank capital adequacy ratio
shifted from the lowest ratio among GCC countries prior to the crisis to the highest ratio. The
very stringent stress tests conducted by the staff confirm that bank capitalization is broadly
adequate to withstand severe shocks.

2
5.
The announcement of the DW debt standstill led to a strong but brief market reaction,
mainly because the assumption of an implicit sovereign guarantee was shaken. The
authorities consider that the market reaction created exaggerated uncertainty. CDS spreads
rose temporarily and there has been virtually no impact on cross border flows within the
banking system. The authorities decided to fully repay the US$3.5 billion sukuks maturing
on December 14—even though these were not guaranteed by the sovereign—in order to
allow time to coordinate with creditors on the remainder of the US$26 billion.
Outlook and policies in 2010
6.
Growth is expected to start recovering in 2010. The authorities forecast that GDP
growth will likely be higher than the staff estimate. They do not expect a deceleration in nonoil GDP in 2010, as Abu Dhabi’s oil and non-oil sectors are set to expand, and improved
global conditions will help Dubai’s services to reemerge. Some degree of uncertainty will
remain with respect to the pace of recovery of Dubai’s real estate sector. These prospects will
be underpinned by continued federal support. The federal government will maintain its
development expenditures, as well as the provision of loans and equity support for viable
Government Related Entities (GRE). To help preserve financial stability, the central bank
will stand ready to sterilize renewed inflows by raising reserve requirements in the event of
overheating, and to inject liquidity as needed in the event credit conditions tighten. Given the
limited scope for monetary policy, macroprudential policies will play an important role in the
case of renewed pressures from inflows. The authorities reaffirm their commitment to the
dollar peg, which has served the economy well and provided a stable anchor in the face of
uncertainty.
Steps to safeguard financial stability
7.
The crisis revealed some financial sector vulnerabilities, namely the overleveraging—which was facilitated by lax global liquidity conditions in 2004-2007—and the
maturity mismatch. In addition to the increase in bank capitalization, the authorities are
considering steps to further strengthen cross-firm supervision and macroprudential policies,
including counter-cyclical solvency and liquidity measures. These measures include direct
limits on GRE borrowing, standardizing and strengthening loan classification and
provisioning rules, and stricter enforcement. Some banks have already been requested to
immediately increase provisioning. To secure longer-term financing for up-scaled investment
and mega-projects, the authorities are drafting laws and regulations to foster a local debt
market and to extend the average debt maturity.
8.
The authorities are setting the scope and modalities for restructuring the remaining
US$22 billion debt in a fair and equitable manner, and launched an insolvency law reform to
facilitate the debt restructuring and preserve the rights of DW creditors. They also recently
established a US$20 billion Dubai Support Fund, which will be directed at supporting viable
and strategic public entities with the assistance of a chief restructuring officer. To the extent
possible, the authorities intend to avoid the sale of assets and to focus on securing longerterm refinancing for viable projects. While the authorities will continue to selectively support
viable entities to ensure that contagion is contained, they intend to minimize the bailout of
commercial entities that are not guaranteed in order to avoid moral hazard and burdening the

3
sovereign’s balance sheet, in line with the best practices which are described in Box 2 of the
staff report.
Transparency and statistics
9.
The government of Dubai has underscored its “strong commitment, as a global
financial leader, to transparency, good governance, and market principles1. With respect to
the concerns that were raised regarding the lack of public information, I would note that the
creditor banks—which hold the bulk of outstanding US$22 billion debt—had access to the
financial statements of Dubai Inc. entities. Moreover, the absence of government guarantees
was clearly spelled out in the prospectus of the Nakheel 09 sukuk. It therefore appears that
investors who assumed that the bonds were government-guaranteed either neglected to
carefully read the prospectus or were counting on a sovereign bail-out. In this regard, “lack
of information disclosure and transparency” cannot be viewed as the primary cause of market
volatility, as suggested in paragraph 2 of the staff report.
10.
The authorities are building a federal economic and statistical database. They adopted
the federal statistics law and established an independent federal statistics bureau in 2009 in
order to coordinate data collection, compilation, and dissemination. The authorities also plan
to increase transparency in financial data, notably for government-related enterprises.
Other reforms
11.
The U.A.E. will continue to gear its policies toward promoting further diversification
of its productive base and government revenue. To this end, and with a view to foster longterm fiscal sustainability in the context of a growing non-hydrocarbon economy,
consideration is being given to introducing a VAT within two years. The authorities are
aiming to coordinate fiscal policy, strengthen budget procedures, and centralize debt
management at the federal level, given that each of the seven emirates has autonomy with
regards to its natural resources and fiscal policy. Under the auspices of the newly established
Fiscal Coordination Committee, the U.A.E. will begin releasing its federal budget every three
years, beginning in 2011-2013, with the aim of coordinating the fiscal stance between the
emirates. In addition, debt management units are to be created to better coordinate financing
needs between the emirates and federal government.
Conclusion
12.
In conclusion, it is clear that the government of the U.A.E. is not only fully aware of
the issues that need to be addressed but has or is in the process of introducing measures to
prevent such a repeat. I am confident that the authorities will overcome the challenges they
are currently facing and will continue to lay the foundations for sustainable growth in the
Emirates.
