A mission visited Malabo and Bata during January 18–31, 2006 to conduct the
Article IV consultation discussions with Equatorial Guinea. The mission met with
Minister of Finance and Budget Owonu Edu, Planning Secretary of State Ela Oyana,
and the Banque des Etats de l’Afrique Centrale (BEAC) National Director
Bindang Obiang. The Equatoguinean economic team was led by Lucas Abaga,
Inspector General of the Ministry of Economy. Also, the mission met with other
senior government officials, representatives of the private sector, and donors.

•

The mission comprised of Messrs. Itam, Franken, Klueh, York and Ms. Loukoianova
(all AFR). Mr. Bah, Senior Advisor (OED), participated in the discussions, and
Ms. Tordo and Mr. Tsouck Ibounde (World Bank) joined the mission.
Mr. Bio-Tchané (AFR) co-chaired the concluding session of the mission with the

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Macroeconomic developments in recent years were broadly satisfactory. A
slowdown in hydrocarbon production caused the overall real GDP growth to
decelerate sharply but was strong at 6.5 percent in 2005. The non-oil sector remained
buoyant, recording an expansion of 10.7 percent in real terms. Inflation, while still
above the CEMAC regional convergence criterion of 3 percent, declined further to
4.8 percent at year end, In the context of significant improvements in the terms of
trade due to high world oil prices, the external position strengthened further with the
current account deficit narrowing by nearly one half to 13.3 percent of GDP and
international reserves rising to US$2.9 billion (equivalent to about 15 months of
projected non-oil sector imports).

•

In addition to the favorable external conditions underpinning macroeconomic
developments in 2005, financial performance followed the pattern of recent
years. Larger-than-budgeted revenues led to increased spending—mainly on physical
infrastructure—and saving. The overall fiscal surplus was about thrice the amount
projected in the budget. However, the non-oil fiscal deficit was as large as in the
previous year at 200 percent of non-oil GDP, and capital outlays were more than
double the budget provision. As would be expected, monetary developments were
dominated by the evolution in budgetary operations, with the increase in government
savings from oil revenues leading to further substantial increase in government
deposits with the regional central bank and commercial banks. The real effective
exchange rate of the CFA franc—calculated for Equatorial Guinea—continued to
appreciate, reflecting the appreciation of the euro vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar and a large
inflation differential with major trading partners.

•

The economic prospects for 2006 are slightly less favorable than in the preceding
year. Real GDP growth is projected to contract sharply, reflecting a flattening out of
oil production, while non-oil GDP growth would remain robust. Inflation is projected
to decline to less than 4 percent at year end, and the external position will strengthen
with the continued improvement in the terms of trade.

•

Based on current policies and the projected favorable external environment, the
medium-term prospects are positive. Overall growth would oscillate with
hydrocarbon production, but should average about 5 percent annually during 2007–
10. Although inflation is projected to decline only gradually with improved domestic
supplies of foodstuffs, it is likely to reach the CEMAC target of 3 percent by 2008.
The external position is projected to generate surpluses that would raise the level of
international reserves to about US$11 billion by end-2010 (61 months of non-oil
sector imports).

•

The Equatoguinean economy is now 20 times larger than what it was in the mid1990s. Overall economic growth has led to the rapid rise in measured per capita
income to that of middle-income countries, but the standard of living of the

-5-

population at large has not improved commensurately. Equatorial Guinea now has
adequate resources to make rapid progress toward alleviating poverty and achieving
the Millennium Development Goals. However, to channel resources to priority areas
efficiently, there is a need for a well-designed development strategy and strengthened
institutional capacity.
•

Accordingly, the staff welcomes the authorities intention to prepare a Poverty
Reduction Strategy that would guide government policies and provide a
sufficiently robust framework for public expenditure. In conjunction with
developing such a robust framework, the Fund will be providing shortly two resident
advisors on public finance management and macro-fiscal issues. In the meantime, the
budget process needs to be modified to provide more realistic estimates and a
“contingency element” to meet unanticipated needs.

•

As more resources become available to the government, the greater will be the
need for transparency in the division of the oil receipts between the oil
companies and the government. In this regard, the staff urges the authorities to
move rapidly with the next steps for full participation in the Extractive Industry
Transparency Initiative (EITI), including adopting the associated decree, finalizing
the government’s disclosure policy, and appointing an aggregator.

•

The lack of timely, accurate, and comprehensive macro- and socio-economic
data hampers the maintaining of developments. The staff would urge the
allocation of the required resources to enhance the statistical apparatus.

-6-

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The Equatoguinean economy is now 20 times larger than what it was in the mid1990s. During the first half of the 1990s, average oil production in Equatorial Guinea was
less than 5,000 barrels per day. About a decade later, hydrocarbon (oil and gas) production
had increased to 380,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed). Over that period, the
economy grew at an average rate of 37 percent per year. The hydrocarbon sector dominated
the expansion and was more than 80 percent of GDP in 2005. The non-oil sector was also
dynamic, with average annual growth in double digits during the last decade, propelled by
expansions in the service and construction sectors. Hence, Equatorial Guinea’s nominal GDP
in 2005 was US$6.8 billion, with an officially estimated population of 1.14 million.
2.
The overall economic growth since the mid-1990s has led to a rapid rise in per
capita income to that of middle-income countries, but the standard of living for the
population at large has not improved commensurately. While comprehensive data on
poverty are not yet available, tentative estimates suggest that a significant proportion of the
population is living below the poverty line1 and that social services remain underdeveloped.
The significant improvements in the Human Development Index (HDI) that Equatorial
Guinea experienced in the last decade were driven entirely by the high growth in GDP percapita.2 Life expectancy remains at about the average for sub-Saharan African (SSA)
countries, school enrolment and literacy has not changed noticeably, and access to safe water
is still among the lowest in the world.
3.
Equatorial Guinea now has adequate resources to make rapid progress toward
alleviating poverty and achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It is the
third largest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa, and, since 2004, high levels of production
and soaring oil prices have boosted hydrocarbon-related fiscal revenues. On current
projections, the exploitation of hydrocarbon should generate an estimated US$3.8 billion
(44 percent of GDP) per annum in government revenue over the next five years. However, to
channel resources to priority areas efficiently, there is a need for a well designed
development strategy and strengthened institutional capacity.
4.
Equatorial Guinea has generally been receptive to the Fund’s policy advice
within the context of surveillance. In particular, efforts have been made to improve the
transparency in the accounting for resources from the hydrocarbon sector, the budget process
is now generally including all undertakings by the government, and revenue administration
has been improved in line with FAD advice. However, Fund’s advice has not always been
implemented quickly. Efforts at improving statistics are still lagging, and the development of

The standard threshold of a minimum consumption or income level of US$1 per day (measured in purchasing
power parity terms).

The HDI combines measures of income, life expectancy, school enrolment, and literacy. However, the general
perception is that income distribution is particularly skewed in favor of the upper-middle and upper classes.

-7-

a comprehensive medium-term fiscal framework remains outstanding. Improvements in the
institutional capacity with technical assistance from the Fund, inter alia, should enhance the
framework for considering Fund policy advice.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND SHORT-TERM PROSPECTS
5.
Macroeconomic developments in 2005 were broadly satisfactory. Although there
was a slowdown in hydrocarbon production that caused overall real GDP growth to
decelerate sharply, non-oil GDP growth remained buoyant (Table 1). Large public
infrastructure investment and private housing construction continued to be the main factors
for growth in the non-oil sector. However, the non-oil primary sector continued to be weak—
with a persistent decline in cash crop agriculture—but performance in the tertiary sector—
mainly banking services and retail trade—remained relatively strong (Table 2). Inflation
declined slightly to 4.8 percent at end-2005 from about 5.1 percent at end- 2004, but the
annual average rose by about 2 percentage points in 2005 mainly because of higher domestic
prices for petroleum products and supply bottlenecks in the fast growing non-oil sector.
Nonetheless, public investment in infrastructure—particularly the road network in rural
areas—helped ease the constraints on the supply of domestic foodstuffs and thereby limiting
inflationary pressures.
6.
Equatorial Guinea complies with three out of the four policy convergence
criteria for the CEMAC countries—basic fiscal balance that is non negative, level of
public debt that is less than 70 percent of GDP, and net change in government arrears being
non-positive. The convergence criterion for inflation of 3 percent or less is yet to be
achieved.
7.
In the context of significant improvements in the external terms of trade due to
high world oil prices, the external position strengthened further in 2005 (Table 3). The
current account deficit narrowed to 13.3 percent of GDP in 2005 from 24.2 percent of GDP
in 2004 with the improvement in the trade balance. With a sharp increase in foreign equity
participation in hydrocarbon sector, a relatively large overall balance of payments surplus
was realized, raising international reserves to about US$2.9 billion at end-2005 (equivalent to
about 15 months of projected non-oil sector imports of goods and services).
8.
Fiscal performance in 2005 followed the pattern of recent years, with largerthan-expected revenues leading to increased spending and savings. Preliminary estimates
indicate an overall fiscal surplus of 23 percent of GDP or some 320 percent of non-oil
GDP—compared to the budgeted 8.4 percent of GDP (Table 4). The non-oil fiscal deficit
was about 200 percent of non-oil GDP in 2005, similar to the outcome in recent years but
substantially larger than the 90 percent budgeted. Revenues from the oil sector—which
account for 95 percent of total revenues—rose sharply with the rise in world oil prices.3 Non3

The government’s take from total receipts from hydrocarbon production rose from about 30 percent in 2004 to
40 percent in 2005, in line with the escalation clause in the various production sharing contracts.

-8-

oil tax revenue performed better than expected because of the continued buoyancy in non-oil
activities and further efforts to improve tax administration. These efforts—in line with
FAD’s advice on revenue administration—included the implementation of the new tax code,
the creation of a large tax payers unit, and the introduction of a value–added tax.
9.
Faced with much larger total revenue than had been budgeted, outlays on goods
and services and public investment were raised to meet some urgent social needs and to
accelerate investment in key infrastructures. Total expenditure declined by 5 percentage
points of GDP to 19.6 percent in 2005. However, current expenditure was about 40 percent
higher than budgeted mainly because of overruns in goods and services, and capital
expenditure was more than double the budget provisions because of unanticipated new public
investment projects.
10.
Monetary developments in 2005 continued to be dominated by the evolution in
budgetary operations. The increase in government savings from oil revenues led to a further
substantial increase in government deposits with both BEAC and the commercial banks, and
the growth of broad money remained high. (Table 7). The buoyancy in the non-oil sector was
the main factor for the continued expansion in bank credit to the private sector, particularly
for services and construction activities.
11.
A range of indicators suggest that the financial sector has remained relatively
sound. Banks were generally complying with the region’s prudential regulations (Table 9).
Both deposit and lending rates declined slightly, but the latter remained relatively high,
reflecting the high risk associated with domestic borrowers. Banks’ limited loan portfolios
were almost entirely concentrated in the construction sector, and with only a small number of
borrowers.
12.
The real effective exchange rate of the CFA franc—calculated for Equatorial
Guinea—continued to appreciate during 2005 (Figure 1). This pattern largely reflected the
appreciation vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar and the persistent large inflation differential with the
major trading partner countries (Figure 2). Overall, movements in the real effective exchange
rate appeared to be dominated by the response to favorable terms of trade developments—
particularly world oil prices—and other fundamentals, such as the strong overall fiscal
position. The appreciation of the real effective exchange rate for Equatorial Guinea was the
largest in the CEMAC region in the recent period, reflecting the country’s position as the
largest oil exporter and recipient of foreign direct investment relative to GDP, recent
developments in the terms of trade, and the relative large weight of the U.S. as the major
trading partner, with nominal depreciation vis-à-vis the CFA franc and substantially lower
inflation (Box 1).

Nonoil exports have remained relatively small in
Equatorial Guinea. Thus, in line with higher oil output and
increasing oil prices, recent external sector developments
were favorable for the five oil-producing CEMAC
countries. This is particularly noticeable for Equatorial
Guinea, where the value of oil exports both in US dollar
terms and in percent of GDP was the highest in the region
since 2003, overtaking Gabon. Reflecting differing
inflation performance and relative weights of trading
partners, real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciation
was most pronounced in Equatorial Guinea – REERs for
most of the other member countries stayed largely constant
or appreciated only slightly. The US is the largest trading
partner for Equatorial Guinea, unlike for all the other
CEMAC countries for which the EU is the major trading
partner.

Equatorial Guinea’s oil exports rose most rapidly, and the country received the largest foreign direct investment (FDI)
as a share of GDP among the oil-producing CEMAC countries in 1999-2005. The only exceptional year was 2002,
when Chad received higher FDI in percent of GDP, which was related to the investment in Chad’s oil pipeline. The
terms of trade appear volatile for all the oil-producing CEMAC countries during 1999-2005, reflecting fluctuations in
oil prices. However, terms of trade improvement was the largest in Equatorial Guinea in this period.

- 10 -

13.
Traditional exports (particularly coffee and cocoa) stagnated in the last few
years. This is partly because producers’ profits were adversely affected by the nominal
appreciation of the CFA franc vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar.4 However, another crucial underlying
factor for the stagnation in traditional exports was the loss of immigrant farm labor, which
was exacerbated by the abandonment of the farms in search of more lucrative employment in
the oil (and related) sectors and the “ageing” of the plantations.
14.
The economic prospects for 2006 are less favorable than in the preceding year.
Real GDP is projected to contract by 0.4 percent, reflecting an overall flattening out of oil
production. Non-oil GDP growth would remain robust at about 10 percent as the
implementation of the public investment program (PIP) continues, which would have a direct
positive impact on construction activity and important spillover effects on the tertiary sector.
Inflation is projected to decline further to less than 4 percent at year-end, supported by the
ongoing public sector wage restraint, expansion in feeder roads to improve conditions for
domestic supply of foodstuffs, and greater vigilance in the execution of the budget. With
favorable terms of trade developments, a marked increase in the trade surplus is expected,
leading to a further narrowing of the current account deficit to 6 percent of GDP. Gross
international reserves are projected to rise sharply to around US$4 billion (21 months of
projected non-oil imports).
III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
15.
Despite the broadly satisfactory macroeconomic performance, the authorities
face some major challenges. First, they are keenly aware of the need to tackle poverty both
in the short term by directing resources to priority social programs, and in the long term by
establishing a satisfactory growth trajectory that generates employment opportunities within
a stable macroeconomic framework. Second, progress with economic reform has been
hindered by capacity constraints in the country. This is particularly so in the area of policy
formulation and implementation, and in monitoring and assessing the impact of policies visà-vis the original intent. The government, therefore, would like to develop institutional
capacity with help from development partners, including the Fund and World Bank. Finally,
the government is concerned about managing the vast resources from the oil sector in a
manner that is efficient, transparent, and cognizant of the need to establish a solid foundation
for future generations.5

Nearly all traditional exports are priced and invoiced in U.S. dollars.

The background selected issues paper will include a chapter that provides a preliminary
assessment of the implications of developments in the hydrocarbon sector for overall
economic growth, with some cross-country experiences.

- 11 -

16.
It is with the above background that the mission conducted the discussions for the
2006 Article IV consultation.
A. Tackling Poverty
17.
The emergence of the hydrocarbon sector has led to a drastic change in the
structure of the economy, and traditional activities in the non-oil sector may have
become non-viable. Yet the bulk of the population earn their income from activities not
directly related to the oil sector. Hence, developing a dynamic non-oil sector is essential for
tackling poverty and achieving the MDGs. Of particular concern is why recent rapid growth
and high oil revenues have not translated into a perceptible rise in living standards and a
decline in poverty. In this regard, the mission welcomed the authorities’ intention of
preparing a National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS) to guide government policies over
the medium term. The authorities explained that the NPRS will be prepared in consultation
with civil society, non-governmental organizations and donors.
18.
Although specific policies and measures will need to be informed by the
forthcoming poverty assessment, the authorities identified a number of key elements to
the strategy with which the mission agreed:

6

•

Institutional capacity building to support the design, implementation and monitoring
of growth-enhancing and poverty-reducing policies;

•

Public investment in physical (roads, utilities, etc.) and social (health, education, etc.)
infrastructure—according to the priorities identified in the PIP and the Social Fund—
to foster the accumulation of physical and human capital;

•

Removal of impediments to financial intermediation—uncertainties over the legal
rights and obligations of borrowers and creditors, including information about
borrowers’ credit worthiness, particularly for small- and medium-enterprises; and

•

A combination of temporary targeted support for specific economic activities (such as
subsidies for inputs in cocoa and coffee production) with the creation of an
appropriate business environment and a level playing field for all private sector
agents6. This would involve establishing a clear legal and stable regulatory
framework, a predictable tax regime, and transparency in policy design and
implementation.

The Index of Economic Freedom’s business climate indicators show that respect for the rule
of law, corruption, price controls, informal barriers to foreign investment, tax enforcement of
existing laws, and weak property rights have retarded the development of open commercial
activities and impeded the conduct of normal business relations.

- 12 -

19.
In the meantime, the authorities, with assistance from a Canadian based
consultant firm—Business for Social Responsibility—and supported by the U.S.
government, have established a mechanism to fast-track priority social spending as a
temporary response to glaring poverty in certain parts of the country.7 The mission
encouraged the authorities to proceed with the planned national conference on poverty to
inform the NPRS that would provide the framework for such social spending. In this regard,
the World Bank will assist the authorities to establish a poverty profile, assess sectoral
policies to encourage private sector-led economic diversification, and restructure the energy
sector (including petroleum).
B. Capacity Constraints
20.
The failure to channel oil wealth to priority social areas has been partly due to
severe weaknesses in the institutional environment and crippling capacity constraints.
To address this challenge, the authorities are seeking assistance from the Fund, World Bank,
UNDP, and other donors. The Fund is to assist in (i) the reform of the public finance
management system, (ii) the development of an analytical and operational fiscal framework
for the medium term, and (iii) the improvement of economic statistics—including national
accounts, prices, and government finance. The first two areas will involve resident advisors,
while the third area will be covered through peripatetic advisors (Box 2). Technical
assistance from the Fund will complement that to be provided by other donors, particularly
the World Bank.
C. Resource Management
21.
The main concerns of the authorities regarding resource management are
related to the efficient use of oil revenues and the remuneration on the country’s foreign
reserves. With respect to usage, the mission supported the adoption of the NPRS approach
outlined earlier, which would provide a robust framework for public expenditure, with the
monitoring mechanisms to ensure transparency.

7

The Social Fund, which became operational in 2006, accounts for almost half of the total
provision for capital expenditure.

- 13 -

Box 2. Status of Technical Assistance
Background
During July 2005, diagnostic missions were undertaken by the Fiscal Affairs (FAD) and Statistics (STA)
Departments, and the World Bank. Both FAD and STA prepared a set of recommendations and action
plans to strengthen capacity. These recommendations and action plans were discussed further during the
Annual Meetings in September 2005, and subsequently accepted by the Equatoguinean authorities. Also,
a seminar on “Sources of Growth” in the Central African Economic and Monetary Community
(CEMAC) was held mid-March 2006.
•

Fiscal Issues. Two resident advisors have been identified to carry out the program of work in
the fiscal area. An advisor on public financial management (PFM) will assist in reforming the
legislative framework on PFM matters, improving the budget formulation and execution
processes, and enhancing information reporting and oversight controls. An advisor on macro
fiscal policy will focus on establishing an appropriate medium-term framework for managing
Equatorial Guinea’s vast oil wealth. Both of these advisors will be financed through a
reimbursement agreement with the Fund.

•

Statistics Department. STA has contracted a peripatetic advisor to assist in the compilation of
national accounts and price statistics. The advisor will visit the country four times during the
next 18 months, with the first mission coinciding with the 2006 Article IV consultation
discussions. Also, an STA expert conducted a diagnostic mission on government finance
statistics in January 2006.

•

World Bank. The World Bank will complement Fund technical assistance in the area of national
accounts (together with AFRISTAT), social statistics (poverty assessment), a public
expenditure review, and support in developing the National Poverty Reduction Strategy.

•

The reimbursement agreement with the Fund for the provision of the associated technical
assistance was finalized during the mission and signed during the Managing Director’s visit on
March 13, 2006.

Next steps
Both STA and the World Bank work programs are proceeding. With regard to fiscal issues, the staff has
identified experts, and it is envisaged that the work of the advisors could start in the second quarter of
2006. Technical assistance from the World Bank is awaiting the signing of a separate service agreement
with the authorities.

22.
In addition, the mission discussed with the authorities the pros and cons of a
separate oil fund. The mission was informed that the government considers the usefulness
of oil funds (such as the Fund for Future Generation, and the Special Reserve Fund) in
deciding how the budget savings are distributed. While such funds can provide a useful
buffer in uncertain times, the authorities pointed out the challenges in balancing urgent
current needs to fight poverty (and lay a strong foundation) against inter-generational
concerns over the use of the country’s oil wealth. The mission stressed that in these
endeavors, careful consideration should be given to the macroeconomic implications of frontloading public expenditures, as efforts to alleviate poverty might easily be eroded by

- 14 -

instability emanating from pressures on the current limited capacity—especially high
inflation that would impose a disproportionate burden on the poor and distort resource
allocation.
23.
With respect to foreign asset remuneration, the government’s stated objective is
to at least maintain the real value over the medium to long term. Currently, most of
Equatorial Guinea’s foreign assets are held with the BEAC, and the issue of the appropriate
level of remuneration has not yet been resolved. In the meantime, the BEAC has remunerated
(retroactive to 2004) these assets at the ongoing interest rate of 1.6 percent. Both the
authorities and the BEAC have made proposals regarding various rates of remuneration, and
the structure of deposits. Tripartite discussions were held in January 2006 between the
authorities, the BEAC, and the French Treasury, and further discussions on the issues were
held by the BEAC Council of Ministers in February 2006. The mission reconfirmed the
Fund’s readiness to assist in evaluating these proposals and, if necessary, with further
discussions involving the BEAC, the French authorities, and the Fund on the principles of
reserve management and related topics.
D. Fiscal Policy
24.
The authorities listed their objectives with respect to fiscal policy as: enhancing
the implementation of the 2005 tax law; optimizing non-oil revenue collection;
maintaining fiscal discipline to restrain inflation and strengthen the external position;
and adhering to a “fiscal rule” that limits recurrent expenditure to non-oil revenue and
finances capital expenditure from oil revenue. In recent years, fiscal performance has been
characterized by large unplanned expenditures, particularly in capital outlays. Four key
contributing factors have been identified: ad hoc augmentations to existing projects, expenses
for urgent needs, underestimation of project costs, and re-phasing of projects. While
recognizing the exogenous nature of some of these factors, the mission suggested that the
budget should make realistic initial estimates—particularly for expenditures—and adequate
contingency provision for unanticipated urgent expenses. This would facilitate budget
execution within clear parameters to enhance commitment control, transparency, and
predictability of the fiscal stance.
25.
In this regard, the mission urged the authorities to develop a robust fiscal
framework that will guide policy. Currently, the government’s “fiscal rule” has not worked
well, and has led to expenditure creep. Since hydrocarbon wealth is front loaded and
generates an uncertain and exhaustible income stream, general fiscal policy guidelines often
suggest saving a significant proportion of the related revenues.8 With substantial oil revenues
and a relatively low level of debt, there is room for increasing spending in the social sectors
and on the physical infrastructure.

Consistent with recent policy advice from the Fund and the World Bank to other oil
producing countries.

- 15 -

26.
However, as indicated earlier, the main building blocks to establish a mediumterm fiscal framework to guide the allocation of oil revenues between expenditure and
savings are still being developed.9 The mission emphasized that meanwhile the authorities
take into consideration the capacity to use additional resources effectively in order to avoid
waste, contain inflationary pressures, and maintain international competitiveness. Therefore,
the mission urged the authorities to save all resources that cannot be utilized efficiently
within a stable macroeconomic framework.
27.
The vast hydrocarbon receipts could contribute significantly to the financing of
projects associated with social and economic development. It is essential, therefore, for
the division of oil receipts between the oil companies and the government to be transparent
and timely in order to ascertain the available resources for such projects. The mission
welcomed Equatorial Guinea’s intention to participate in the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI) and the progress made so far in establishing the necessary
infrastructure. However, it appears that the momentum supporting the initiative has waned
somewhat, and the mission encouraged the authorities to reinvigorate the process. In this
regard, the next steps should include: adopting the EITI decree and related implementing
regulations that legitimizes and protects the participation of civil society and the industry;
holding a second stakeholders meeting to discuss government disclosure policy; appointing
an aggregator to compile, reconcile and oversee the quality and reliability of the data; and
finalizing the agreed action plans. In the meantime, as was the case in the recent past, the
mission reconciled the 2005 data regarding government oil production shares, oil export
receipts, and revenues accruing to the government (including royalties).
28.
The authorities were in general agreement with the above recommendations on
fiscal policy. The envisaged technical assistance in the areas of macro fiscal policy and
public finance management would help to address a number of the concerns. Furthermore,
the authorities indicated that Parliament has heightened its oversight of budget execution,
which would further strengthen fiscal discipline.
E. Monetary and External Policies
29.
Monetary policy discussions centered on the need for domestic liquidity to be
monitored in case measures are required to temper inflationary pressures. Given that
monetary policy is carried out at a regional level, fiscal policy has to assume the main role in
liquidity management. Also, extension of credit to unduly risky borrowers may undermine
the soundness of the financial sector. In the recent period, no action was taken explicitly by

9

For further discussions with the authorities in their effort to firmly establish such a
framework, the background selected issues paper will provide a preliminary assessment of
long-term fiscal sustainability, and a review of practices and challenges of managing oil
revenue.

- 16 -

BEAC to sterilize liquidity in the system, as there appeared to be some reluctance to utilize
them (because of the associated cost).
30.
The authorities agreed that the BEAC has adequate instruments to mop up
excess liquidity—through adjustments to the primary reserve requirement and
undertaking demand deposit auctions. The BEAC regional authorities acknowledged that
they face challenges in implementing monetary policy but noted their overall success in
liquidity management. The use of differentiated reserve requirements—a pragmatic
approach, given the very limited integration of money markets—had been effective in
sterilizing liquidity where the problem was acute, although this may have hindered the
emergence of a regional money market.10
31.
The authorities expressed satisfaction with the soundness of the banking system
and the regulatory environment. They viewed the conditions as sufficiently robust to
ensure stability. However, two prudential requirements were not observed in October 2005
by some of the commercial banks—maximum individual risk and capital adequacy. Even
though these deviations were viewed as temporary and had been reversed by early 2006,
when combined with the growth in non-performing loans, they raise some concern about the
health of the banking system.
32.
The mission shared the authorities’ concern with the relatively low level of
financial intermediation. Total loans amounted to only 41 percent of total deposits at end2005. Indeed, the relatively high levels of unrequired reserves of the commercial banks may
signal a lack of “effective” private lending opportunities in the economy because of structural
rigidities—including limited capacity to assess risks, uncertainties in the judicial system
concerning rights and obligations of both borrowers and creditors, high cost of enforcing
contracts and collecting collateral, the lack of a “banking culture” that emphasizes repayment
of loans, and the absence of micro-credit institutions outside the urban areas.
33.
The pegged exchange rate regime has provided an anchor to hold down inflation
and is perceived as an element that has had a positive impact on investors’ confidence.
As indicated earlier, the recent appreciation of the real effective exchange rate reflected
mainly changes in fundamentals. However, the effect on competitiveness, as well as the
absence of nominal exchange rate adjustments to buffer shocks, points to a need for careful
focus on the macroeconomic and structural policy options for improving the resilience and
productivity of the economy. In this regard, the authorities noted recent efforts to encourage
diversification into fishery, tourism, and regional financial services that would broaden the
economic base. Furthermore, focus is on (i) functional education and health in order to
improve labor productivity, and (ii) the adoption of appropriate technology to enhance

10

Issues.

- 17 -

agriculture productivity. These are in tandem with measures to improve the business
climate—particularly governance— for both foreign and domestic investors.11
34.
Another source of concern is the potential adverse impact of hydrocarbonrelated inflows on competitiveness, given the limited capacity. “Dutch disease” is viewed
less as an imminent threat, since the economy lacks a sizable non-oil tradable goods sector,
than as an important concern for the long-term development of the economy. In this regard,
the authorities have already taken some steps by liberalizing trade and reforming the tax
system in accordance with CEMAC standards, and could improve development prospects
further by elimination, other charges/surcharges as quickly as possible.12 They agreed with
the mission that a remaining challenge in trade liberalization is to work with the other
CEMAC partners to gradually reduce the current common external tariff.13 Also, in
connection with improving international competitiveness, the mission explored with the
authorities the scope for further trade liberalization through the elimination of nontariff
barriers and taxes on exports.
F. Statistical Issues
35.
Equatorial Guinea’s statistical apparatus remains weak.14 The lack of timely,
accurate, and comprehensive macroeconomic and social data hampers the monitoring of
economic and financial developments and the provision of a sound basis for policy
formulation. While data provided by the authorities are broadly adequate for surveillance,
there is a need to improve the frequency and the scope of data reporting. These problems
stem principally from severe institutional capacity constraints. The mission urged the
authorities to allocate the required resources to enhance this capacity as a priority. The
authorities’ intention of establishing a National Statistical Institute is an important step
11

Equatorial Guinea ranks low among oil producing countries in terms of governance
indicators. According to a recent study, government effectiveness is among the lowest, with
room for improving the quality of the regulatory framework (Kaufmann, Kraag, and
Mastruzz, 2005, “Governance Matters: Governance Indicators for 1996–2004”, the World
Bank).

12

Equatorial Guinea has adopted the common external tariff of CEMAC. The tariffs are
10 percent for capital goods and inputs, 20 percent for intermediate goods and 30 percent for
consumer goods. Import surcharges of 30 percent were imposed on imports of goods
previously subject to quantitative restrictions. These surcharges are to be eliminated in
3–6 years, with the longer period applying to certain agricultural and textile products.

13

This would limit the scope for harmful trade diversion that may result (under a prospective
EU Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA)) from the provision of tariff preferences to
goods imported from the EU.

14

- 18 -

forward, and the Fund—in collaboration with the World Bank and other donors—stands
ready to provide capacity building assistance. In a few areas, action plans and
recommendations have already been made, but progress with implementation has been rather
slow and disappointing. The mission sought the cooperation of the authorities for a set of
data and information to be transmitted to the staff on a regular basis.
IV. MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK
36.
The authorities reiterated their medium-term objective of maintaining a high
rate of growth, consistent with achieving the MDGs. Based on current policies and a
continued favorable external environment, the medium-term prospects are positive. Overall
growth is projected to oscillate with production in the hydrocarbon sector, but should average
about 5 percent annually during 2007–10 (Table 10). In particular, the hydrocarbon sector
will be boosted by the production of liquefied natural gas and the development of the Okume
oil field in 2007. Growth in the non-oil sector is projected to remain fairly robust at above
9 percent a year, reflecting ongoing large infrastructure investment as well as the benefits
from structural reform. Together with an annual population growth rate of about 3 percent,
real non-oil GDP per capita would increase by about 6 percent a year, compared with
9 percent during 2000–05. Although inflation is projected to decline only gradually with
improved domestic supplies of foodstuffs, it is likely to reach the CEMAC target of 3 percent
by 2008.
37.
Given the favorable outlook for world oil prices and prospective increases in
hydrocarbon production, the external position would strengthen further over the
medium term. The current account would move into surplus in 2008—and remain in surplus
thereafter—mainly from large increases in the trade surplus (Table 11). Against this
background, and despite a slowdown in oil-sector investment, the overall balance of
payments surpluses should lead to a further buildup in gross official international reserves to
about US$11 billion by end-2010 (61 months of non-oil sector imports).
38.
The immediate risks to this outlook are related to world oil prices and the level
of hydrocarbon production. If prices were to decline sharply for any reason, Equatorial
Guinea would face a significant reduction in oil revenues and in the accumulation of gross
international reserves. However, given the current strength of the fiscal position, and with
international reserves at very comfortable levels, the country would be able to withstand such
a shock in the short term, while adjustment policies are being designed and implemented
over the medium term. On the other hand, to the extent that recent discoveries lead to
commercially viable deposits, this would provide a further boost to economic growth and
hydrocarbon revenues.15
15

Recent hydrocarbon discoveries could extend the production horizon well beyond the
earlier projected 2020 for oil and 2030 for gas. This would make Equatorial Guinea a
regional hub for liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade in the Atlantic Basin.

- 19 -

39.
Equatorial Guinea’s external debt is sustainable. A debt sustainability analysis—
using the middle income country template—demonstrates that the country’s government
external debt is robust to most temporary shocks (Figure 3 and Table 12).16 Total government
external debt, which declined sharply from 36 percent of GDP in 2000 to about 6 percent at
end-2004, is projected to continue the trend and reach less than 2½ percent of GDP by 2010
(Table 13).17 This decline reflects the marked increase in GDP during the period combined
with no new loan disbursements. The net present value of medium- and long-term public
debt is projected at about 1 percent of GDP (and of exports) by 2010, with the debt serviceto-exports and the debt service-to-government revenue at 0.1 percent and 0.2 percent,
respectively.
40.
With the above medium-term outlook, the authorities held the view that the
general assessment made in 2005 with respect to achieving the MDGs remains valid
(Table 14). Achieving the objectives of reducing extreme poverty and hunger are assessed as
very likely and likely, respectively. Similarly, the promotion of gender equality and ensuring
environmental sustainability (including access to improved water and sanitation) are regarded
as very likely. However, a more reliable assessment can be made only after the various social
and economic surveys are completed in the next year or so.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
Equatorial Guinea’s macroeconomic performance in the recent period has been
broadly satisfactory. Real GDP growth, even after excluding the hydrocarbon sector, has
been strong, raising the per capita income to that of middle-income countries. Inflation is on
a downward trend toward the target for CEMAC countries of 3 percent—helped by wage
restraint in the public sector and investment in infrastructure that has eased supply constraints
for domestic foodstuffs. Thanks to the significant improvement in the terms of trade and the
policies of the government in spending oil revenues over the last few years, both the fiscal
and external positions have strengthened substantially, with government savings and gross
official international reserves at comfortable levels.
42.
Moreover, the medium-term macroeconomic prospects are favorable. Given the
outlook for world oil prices and prospective increases in hydrocarbon production, both
government revenues and the country’s official international reserves are projected to soar.
43.
Despite the macroeconomic environment, however, progress in alleviating
poverty and meeting the MDGs has been slow. Of particular concern, the recent rapid
16

17

The government is now up to date with its external debt service. The recent disputes on
repayments of debt to Italy and Spain have been resolved, including through some
rescheduling.

- 20 -

economic growth and large oil revenues have not translated into a perceptible rise in living
standards and a decline in poverty. Equatorial Guinea now has adequate resources to make
substantial progress within a reasonable timeframe. The staff agrees with the authorities that
a major challenge relates to managing the vast resources in a manner that is efficient,
transparent, and cognizant of the need to establish a solid foundation for future generations.
44.
Accordingly, the staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to prepare a National
Poverty Reduction Strategy. This would guide government policies and provide a
sufficiently robust framework for public expenditure, with the necessary monitoring
mechanism to ensure transparency. Also, such an approach would assist the authorities in
balancing urgent current needs to fight poverty against intergenerational and stability
concerns over the use of the country’s oil wealth.
45.
In the meantime, the budget process needs to be modified. The “fiscal rule” of
limiting current expenditure to non-oil revenue and financing capital outlays from oil revenue
has not been implemented. The persistent large excess of current expenditure over non-oil
revenue and severe overruns on capital outlays relative to the budget raise doubts about the
ability of the current budget process to elaborate and carry out fiscal policy. The staff
recommends more realistic budget estimates and the inclusion of a “contingency provision”
to meet urgent needs that were not explicitly anticipated in the budget. This would facilitate
budget execution within clear parameters to enhance commitment control, transparency, and
predictability of the fiscal stance.
46.
As more resources become available to the government, the greater will be the
need for transparency in the division of oil receipts between the oil companies and the
government. Last year, the staff welcomed the authorities’ earlier decision to participate in
the EITI and the steps toward establishing the necessary infrastructure. The pace of
implementation has since waned. The staff urges the authorities to move rapidly with the
next steps, including adopting the associated decree, finalizing the government’s disclosure
policy, and appointing an aggregator.
47.
While the financial system is generally sound, based on available indicators, the
staff shares the authorities’ concern regarding the relatively low level of financial
intermediation. To address this, the authorities should take appropriate measures to alleviate
structural impediments, including uncertainties in the judicial system as to the rights and
obligations of borrowers and creditors, and to enhance the capacity to assess risks.
48.
The pegged exchange rate regime has served Equatorial Guinea well, providing
an anchor to hold down inflation and a positive influence on investors’ confidence.
However, in the absence of exchange rate adjustments to buffer shocks, measures should be
taken to improve the resilience and productivity of the economy. These measures should
concentrate on the physical infrastructure, human capital, and governance for the business
climate. To improve international competitiveness, the staff recommends that Equatorial
Guinea works with the other members of CEMAC to gradually reduce the current common
external tariff, and that nontariff barriers and taxes on exports be eliminated.

- 21 -

49.
While the data provided by Equatorial Guinea are broadly adequate for
surveillance, the statistical apparatus remains weak. The lack of timely, accurate, and
comprehensive macro- and socio-economic data hampers the monitoring of developments.
The authorities’ intention to establish a National Statistical Institute is an important step
forward. However, the staff would urge the authorities to allocate the required resources to
enhance the statistical apparatus as a priority.
50.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ Based on an oil price of US$35 per barrel.
2/ Based on the latest WEO oil price assumption; a government take of 40 percent of oil exports; the preliminary budget outturn in 2005; and the level of nominal GDP and non oil GDP.
3/ Government investment in LNG project is outside the budget. However, it is included in the execution data for 2004 and 2005 and staff projections for 2006
under oil revenue and net lending (as it represents equity in the project). Also interest on off-shore deposits is included in staff projections. This item also includes
the discrepancy with monetary survey for the period 2002-04.
4/ Related to the crash of the banking system during the early eighties.
5/ Excluding oil revenues and oil-related expenditures.
6/ Including re-scheduled debt payments.
7/ The discrepancy in 2005 could be attributed to larger oil revenue that has been recorded by BEAC but not yet captured in the preliminary outturn for 2005.

1/ Including oil equivalent of methanol and liquefied gas.

2/ For the projection period, the price of oil is a simple average of three spot prices: Dated Brent, West Texas Intermediate, and the Dubai Fateh; less an assumed premium (AP) to account for
quality discount on Equatoguinean oil (which gradually decreases from US$5 to US$3.5 between 2005-10). The implicit prenium on the estimated value of exports in 2005 was
US$0.3 lower than the AP.
3/ Excluding oil revenues, oil-related expenditure, and interest on oil savings.
4/ Including grants.

Exchange Rate Arrangement and Safeguard Assessments
The Bank of the Central African States (BEAC) is the regional central bank of the
Central African States, of which Equatorial Guinea is a member. The safeguards
assessment completed on August 30, 2004 found that the BEAC has implemented a
number of measures to strengthen its safeguards framework since an earlier 2001
safeguards assessment, but further progress needs to be made in key areas. The main
recommendations of the 2004 assessment were reported in IMF Country Report No. 05/3.

APPENDIX II

Equatorial Guinea: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of February 28, 2006)
1.
The World Bank Group has not approved any new lending operations for Equatorial
Guinea since mid-1992. The discovery of large oil reserves caused Equatorial Guinea to
graduate to IBRD status (based on a GNP per capita of $1,170 in 1999), which has meant
that concessional IDA assistance is no longer available. In 1998, the World Bank prepared a
strategy paper on the development of petroleum resources in Equatorial Guinea, which it
discussed with the authorities. Since then the World Bank’s assistance has focused on
initiating a dialogue on the analysis and recommendations outlined in this report. At the
request of the authorities, a World Bank mission to examine Equatorial Guinea’s
participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) coincided with a
Fund fiscal ROSC mission in January, 2005. Subsequently, the World Bank has prepared a
services agreement to finance various activities, including (i) strengthening the management
of the petroleum sector and associated revenues; (ii) implementing the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI); and (iii) preparing a poverty reduction strategy.
IMF—World Bank collaboration
2.
Overall, the IMF and World Bank staffs have maintained a close collaborative
relationship in coordinating their operational activities and policy advice to the authorities.
After years of absence, the government has reengaged the international financial institutions
to provide crucial technical assistance in various areas.
World Bank activities
3.
The Bank is supporting the PRS preparation and the collection of household data of
the CWIQ type for the construction of a poverty profile. A Bank mission took place in
July 2005 to assist the Government in developing a road-map for the preparation of an IPRSP and to evaluate the feasibility of a Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ)
survey to construct the poverty profile.
4.
The Bank has financed a statistical capacity-building project designed to provide
financial assistance in the drafting and implementation of a long-term development program
of the national statistical system. The grant (US$397,000) was signed in February 2002 and
will close in December 2005. The first phase of the project (US$108,000; Bank-executed)
succeeded in preparing the NSDS (National Statistical Development Strategy). The second
phase of the project ($289,000; recipient-executed) provides technical assistance to improve
the national accounts, including procurement of hardware and software to support the system.
5.
At the request of the authorities, a mission from FIAS—a joint facility of the World
Bank and International Finance Corporation—visited Equatorial Guinea in April 2001 in
order to survey the investment climate in the country. The FIAS report identified a series of
obstacles to private investment both in the oil and non-oil sector (particularly foreign direct

- 42 -

APPENDIX II

investment). In view of these obstacles, the report recommended various actions aimed at
improving/simplifying the legal framework (laws and institutions) to create an investmentfriendly environment.
6.
The Bank provides technical assistance in the petroleum and energy sectors. To this
end, a technical assistance project is being discussed with the Government that includes: (a) a
study of the institutional set up to define the role and responsibilities of the Ministry of
Mines, Industry and Energy and the state oil company, GEPetrol; (b) a review of existing
petroleum sector laws and regulations, including environmental law and regulation; (c) sector
capacity building and design and implementation of training programs; (d) the development
of an Oil Revenue Diagnostic Model that integrates upstream and midstream activities by
generating forecasts of future sector revenues under different assumptions regarding costs,
prices and the pace of development; (e) the formulation of the national hydrocarbon and
energy policy the optimizes the links between the two sectors; and (f) the formulation of
resource revenue management policy, including relevant institutional arrangements.
7.
Finally, the Bank is providing assistance in the design and implementation of the
reporting framework and institutional arrangements necessary to implement the Extractive
Industry Transparency Initiative and related governance and anti-corruption policies.

Future Areas in which the World Bank analysis could serve as input for the IMF
8.
The Bank is willing to conduct a public expenditure review to assess expenditure
effectiveness, particularly in the social sectors. Thus, the work could provide a basic analysis
of budget preparation and budget execution in the country, and help in the assessment of the
relationship between budgetary allocations and PRSP objectives. This is an area where there
are synergies with the Fund technical assistance on public financial management and
macrofiscal analysis.

- 44 -

APPENDIX III

Equatorial Guinea: Statistical Issues
1.
Equatorial Guinea's economic and financial statistics remain very weak.
Although broadly adequate for surveillance, shortcomings in timeliness, accuracy and
comprehensiveness hamper the monitoring of developments. The deficiencies in timeliness,
and coverage of most macroeconomic data are related to the poor administrative and
technical capacity of the government. Technical assistance efforts have resulted in some
progress, although consolidation of these gains continues to elude the authorities. The Bank
of Central African States (BEAC) regularly reports monetary, interest rates, and exchange
rate statistics for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS), but their
timeliness needs to be improved.
Real sector and prices
2.
Real sector and price data suffer from significant weaknesses that are
compounded by poor centralization of information from the island and continental
regions. National accounts statistics are supplied at current and constant prices, but often
contain significant inconsistencies. The compilation of the official consumer price index
(CPI) has benefited from French technical assistance, but both the weights and composition
of the basket of goods and services are outdated, and the geographical coverage is not
comprehensive. The timely availability of data needs to be improved.
3.
An STA mission visited Malabo in July 2005. The mission reviewed the methods
and data sources used to compile both the national accounts and the consumer price index
(CPI), and assessed the adequacy of the statistical legislation governing the compilation of
statistics. It also assessed the resources devoted to the statistical function, and made
recommendations for improvement. The statistical legislation is quite recent (2001) and is, in
general, adequate to regulate the statistical system. However, the decree to create the
National Institute of Statistics has not been passed. In addition, the resources devoted to the
statistical function are insufficient as only one person is assigned to the national accounts unit
and three to the CPI unit. GDP estimates are prepared by the BEAC, rather than by the
General Directorate of Statistics and National Accounts (GDSNA). In this respect, the
GDSNA should implement the System of National Accounts, 1993, update the reference
period of the national accounts (1985), and update the CPI’s basket and weights (1986)
without delay.
4.
An STA follow-up mission on national accounts and prices visited Malabo in January
2006.
5.
Real sector statistics reported to STA (IFS) are limited to GDP (without
breakdown by sector or expenditure category), and exports and imports. The
December 2005 issue of IFS includes data for GDP through 2004 and exports and imports
through 2000. Export and import data are provided to AFR.

- 45 -

APPENDIX III

Government finance
6.
Following technical assistance from France, there have been some improvements
in fiscal accounting. Further improvements are needed, particularly in procuring timely and
accurate data from the Debt-Service Unit (Caja Autónoma de la Deuda Pública). Regarding
budget coverage and implementation, the authorities need to gradually incorporate some of
the autonomous entities into the budget. Equatorial Guinea does not report fiscal data to
STA. However, the authorities provide budget execution data to AFR. An STA mission in
early 2006 reviewed Government Finance Statistics.
7.
An STA mission in early 2006 reviewed Government Finance Statistics and found
weaknesses in the current legislation that support the compilation of GFS. The mission also
found that the institutional coverage of the consolidated central government is incomplete
and recommended including the operations of the National Social Security Institute
(INSESO). The GFS are compiled quarterly on a cash basis and their coverage includes only
budgetary central government. The mission recommended training for the technicians
directly involved in GFS compilation and the provision of relevant technical assistance to
improve the GFS in accordance with international recommendations.
Monetary accounts
8.
Although the coverage of monetary statistics for Equatorial Guinea is adequate
for program monitoring, the statistics are not disseminated on a timely basis. STA has
supported the implementation of the recommendations of the December 2002 mission,
including for migrating to the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. This has been done
partly through participation in regional BEAC monetary statistics workshops and in the
regional training seminars in monetary and financial statistics conducted biannually at the
Joint Africa Institute.
External debt
9.
Data on the outstanding stock of external debt and projections of debt-service
payments are hampered by serious inconsistencies. The debt service paid—reported by
the Debt-Service Unit—is often significantly different from that reported by the budget and
the Paris Club, as the unit usually lacks precise information on payments made. Also, details
regarding scheduled debt-service obligations are not incorporated into the budget in a
systematic and timely manner. Debt-service projections beyond the following year are only
provided in a highly aggregated form and some debt service takes place outside the DebtService Unit. The authorities have started a major inventory of their debt and are beginning
to address the capacity constraints in the Debt-Service Unit through training and new
staffing.
Balance of payments
10.
Customs data have improved since the implementation of the Central African
Customs and Economic Union reform and the deployment of customs brigades.

- 46 -

APPENDIX III

However, data analysis is still hampered by the lack of computerization. Although the BEAC
produces balance of payments data for Equatorial Guinea, delays are long and the data suffer
from significant inconsistencies with other datasets. While some progress was made in
compiling current and financial account items, the lack of availability of source data is a key
concern. Equatorial Guinea’s balance of payments data are published in the International
Financial Statistics Yearbook through 1996 only.

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation
with Equatorial Guinea
On May 10, 2006 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Equatorial Guinea.1
Background
The economic growth of Equatorial Guinea since the discovery of oil has been unprecedented,
averaging 37 percent per year during the last decade. This has led to a rapid rise in per capita
income to that of middle-income countries, but the standard of living for the population at large
has not improved commensurately.
In 2005, a slowdown in hydrocarbon production caused overall real GDP growth to decelerate
sharply, but non-oil GDP growth remained buoyant. End-of-year inflation declined from
5.1 percent in 2004 to 4.8 percent in 2005, despite an increase in fuel prices at the beginning
of the year.
Soaring oil prices boosted fiscal revenues in 2005, enabling the government to raise outlays
on goods and services and public investment to meet some urgent social needs and to
accelerate improvements in key infrastructure. Nevertheless, Equatorial Guinea also achieved
a larger-than-budgeted fiscal surplus (23 percent of GDP). With the much larger revenues,
outlays on goods and services and public investment were raised to meet some urgent social
needs and to accelerate improvement in key infrastructures. The increase in government
savings from oil revenues led to a further substantial increase in government deposits with
both BEAC and the commercial banks, leaving the growth of broad money high.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

- 49 The oil windfall also contributed to a strengthening of the external position. The
current account deficit narrowed to 13 percent of GDP in 2005 from 24 percent of
GDP in 2004, and the balance of payments recorded an overall surplus that raised
the level of international reserves to the equivalent of about 15 months of projected
imports of goods and services. Overall, movements in the real effective exchange
rate appear to have responded to favorable terms of trade developments—
particularly world oil prices.
The relatively solid macroeconomic situation and the availability of adequate
resources create a unique opportunity for the country to make rapid progress toward
alleviating poverty and achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
However, to channel resources to priority areas efficiently, there is a need for a well
designed development strategy and strengthened institutional capacity.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed that macroeconomic developments in Equatorial Guinea in 2005
continued to be broadly satisfactory, benefiting from a significant improvement in the
terms of trade. The external position strengthened further, and international reserves
rose significantly. However, Directors observed that while inflation has declined, it
remains above the level of the Central African Economic and Monetary Union
(CEMAC) regional convergence criterion. Directors supported the authorities’
medium-term goals of diversifying the economy into the fisheries, tourism, and
regional financial services areas, and of creating an environment conducive for
developing the domestic private sector in order to secure continued strong growth as
energy resources diminish.
Directors called on the authorities to take steps to regularize fiscal and budget policy
and make it a more effective planning and allocative tool. They cautioned that betterthan-expected revenue performance in Equatorial Guinea has tended to go hand-inhand with expenditure overruns, even though most of the overspending was
occurring in the area of physical infrastructure, which, they recognized, greatly needs
investment. Directors urged the authorities to make realistic budget estimates and
adequate contingency provision for unanticipated urgent expenses to facilitate
budget execution within clear parameters, and enhance commitment control,
transparency, and the predictability of the fiscal stance.
Given the large oil export revenues, a low debt level, and favorable medium-term
economic prospects, Directors noted that Equatorial Guinea can make rapid
progress toward alleviating poverty and achieving the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs). However, they observed that so far the improvement in the standard
of living of the population at large was not commensurate with the rapid increase in
per capita income, and poverty remains the big challenge. Directors welcomed the
authorities’ intention of preparing a National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS) to
guide government policies in fighting poverty while maintaining macroeconomic
stability. They commended the authorities for establishing a Social Needs Fund to
operate until the NPRS is finalized.

- 50 Directors agreed that there is room for increasing spending in the social sectors and
on the physical infrastructure. However, as the medium-term fiscal framework is not
yet fully developed, attention needs to be given to using resources effectively and
avoiding wasteful spending, which will also help contain inflation and preserve the
international competitiveness of the country’s non-oil economy. Directors welcomed
the assignment of two Fund-provided resident advisors for capacity building in public
finance management and macro-fiscal issues.
Directors emphasized the importance of improving governance, transparency, and
accountability as more resources become available to the government. They
encouraged the authorities to take the necessary steps towards full participation in
the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, including adopting the EITI decree,
convening a discussion with stakeholders on the government’s disclosure policy,
appointing an aggregator to compile, reconcile and oversee the quality of data, and
finalizing the agreed action plans.
Directors recommended that domestic liquidity be monitored in case measures are
required to temper inflationary pressures. Given that monetary policy is carried out at
a regional level, fiscal policy has to assume the main role in liquidity management.
They considered that the pegged exchange rate regime has provided an anchor to
hold down inflation and has had a positive impact on investors’ confidence.
However, in the absence of nominal exchange rate adjustments to buffer shocks,
Directors stressed the need for careful focus on the macroeconomic and structural
policy options for improving the resilience and productivity of the economy.
Directors supported the authorities’ resolve to continue enhancing banking
supervision, while ensuring that banks comply with prudential regulations, in order to
further strengthen the banking system. At the same time, they shared the authorities’
concern about the relatively low level of financial intermediation, and encouraged
them to address structural rigidities— including in the judicial system to clarify rights
and obligations of both borrowers and creditors. Directors encouraged Equatorial
Guinea to work with the other members of CEMAC to gradually reduce the current
common external tariff. They observed that the elimination of nontariff barriers and
taxes on exports would be instrumental for improving international competitiveness.
Directors urged the authorities to allocate with priority the required resources to
enhance the statistical capacity, as the lack of timely, accurate, and comprehensive
macroeconomic data hampers the monitoring of economic and financial
developments and the formulation of policy.

- 52 Statement by Damian Ondo Mañe, Executive Director for
the Republic of Equatorial Guinea
May 10, 2006

Introduction
On behalf of my Equatoguinean authorities, I would like to thank staff for the well-balanced
set of papers on the recent economic developments in Equatorial Guinea in particular the
selected issues paper on key issues and alternative scenarios on how Equatorial Guinea can
take advantage of oil windfall and better manage the surpluses in the long term. My
authorities commend the reviews of the various models and experiences of other countries
and look forward to deepening analysis and dialogue on the issues.
In addition, my Equatoguinean authorities highly value the positive discussions they have
had with Board members and the Managing Director who visited recently the country.
Indeed, the group of the Executive Directors had helpful meetings not only with the high
authorities but also with the representatives of Parliamentarian groups and donors’
community. In the same breath, they welcome the policy advice delivered by the MD during
the launching of the seminar on “sources of growth in Africa” organized in Bata last March
in the context of the CEMAC summit. It is worth noting that during his visit the MD signed
with the authorities the reimbursement agreement for the provision of technical assistance in
the areas of public finance management and macro fiscal policy.
As is well-known, Equatorial Guinea is a middle-income country with all the characteristics
associated with the group of low-income countries, in terms of poverty and institutional and
capacity constraints, and low output. Thanks to the revenue derived from oil production, the
country has solved its financial problems, and is now accumulating reserves at a fast pace.
The major challenge facing the authorities is to implement a sound and sustainable
development plan. In the short time period that oil production has started, important
infrastructure projects have started, namely road construction, improving the sea and airports,
schools and hospital constructions. However, much more needs to be done, but the country
faces a severe shortage of capacity, and the authorities are addressing this issue.
My authorities would like to reiterate their commitment to continue implementing sound
policies, designed to lay down solid foundations for broad-based sustainable economic
growth and poverty alleviation. To this end, they are cognizant of the challenges facing the
country, notably in the areas of economic diversification, social indicators’ improvement,
financial resources management and capacity building. In their efforts to strengthen incountry capacity, the authorities will benefit from the Fund’s technical assistance in public
finance sector. The Fund technical assistance will be complemented by the assistance from
the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in social service delivery,
as well as the World Bank with regard to the national accounts, social statistics and public
expenditure review.

- 53 -

The Social Needs Fund
While the country is accumulating large reserves, poverty remains a major problem. The
authorities have done much already to alleviate poverty, but the problem is that there is little
linkage between the oil sector and the rest of the economy. The oil production started and
grew faster in a context of narrow production and export base as well as lack of infrastructure
and institutional capacity. In fact, the size of the reserves grew so rapidly, while the capacity
to manage this wealth did not follow.
Fighting against poverty, diversifying the economy, developing the infrastructure and
enhancing capacity remain at the top of my authorities’ agenda. To address these issues, they
are working closely with their development partners. In this regard and until the finalization
of the National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS), the authorities have established by
Presidential decree No 120/05 on July 4, 2005 a Social Needs Fund. This fund has been set
up with the technical assistance of Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) and the key
stakeholders in Equatorial Guinea. In order to implement the program assigned to this fund,
the authorities and the US government through USAID have signed an agreement to
guarantee the quality, accountability and delivery of social service.
The Social Needs Fund, as a temporary mechanism and not a substitute for line ministries
mandate, is a mutual effort to improve social service delivery by enhancing the
administrative and technical capacity of selected ministries to support the financial
disbursement mechanism established by Presidential decree. The Social Needs Fund has been
adopted as the mechanism for soliciting, reviewing, adopting, funding, implementing and
monitoring projects in the areas of health, education, women’ issues and sanitation.
Technical assistance provided through this mechanism will help build capacity and foster
transparency and accountability in the design, implementation and evaluation of social needs
projects.
For the medium-term, the authorities with other stakeholders are in the process of preparing a
NPRS which would provide the framework for social spending and guide government
policies.
Implementation of EITI Initiative
The authorities have enhanced their participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative (EITI) through carrying out of all the necessary arrangements including the
adoption of the EITI decree, the creation of EITI National Commission with the participation
of the Parliament, the industry and civil society as well as the allocation of the needed
financial resources for the functioning of the Commission. The authorities, in collaboration
with the World Bank, remain committed to accelerate the implementation of the action plan
including the appointment of the aggregator in charge of data compilation and reconciliation
as well as quality control. They also will strengthen the civil society participation in the EITI

- 54 -

National Commission, make a presentation of the legal and institutional framework for the
implementation of EITI and launch the government information campaign.
In addition, it is important to note that last April, the Head of State met with the acting
President of the World Bank and underlined the authorities’ commitment to transparency and
good governance. In reviewing progress made in implementing EITI principles, it was agreed
that capacity constraints are the main cause of implementation delays. In order to help
overcome these constraints, my authorities requested an increased level of technical
assistance from the World Bank that would be included in the agreement of services under
negotiation. The medium-term reforms identified under this agreement covered transparency,
public expenditure review, public revenue reform, and accountability and corruption reform.
Moreover, I am pleased to inform the Board that transparency and good governance are now
of the public domain in Equatorial Guinea. For instance, these were broadly supported during
the CEMAC parliamentarian seminar in January 2005 and during on “Sources of Growth in
Africa” in March 2006.
Macroeconomic Developments in 2005
In 2005, macroeconomic developments were broadly satisfactory. Real GDP grew by 6.5
percent and it is worth noting that the non-oil sector recorded a 10.7 percent growth rate due
to the large public infrastructure investment and private housing construction. Inflation
declined to 4.8 percent at end-2005 due mainly to the decline in cash crop agriculture and
increase in domestic prices for petroleum products in addition to supply bottlenecks in the
growing non-oil sector. Despite its slowdown in 2005, the hydrocarbon sector continues to
dominate the economy in contributing to more than 90 percent of the GDP and government
revenues.
On the fiscal front, revenues as shown in the table below have rapidly increased due to the
combined effect of the improvement of oil production capacity and high international oil
prices. The non-oil sector also performed better than expected owing to the buoyancy in nonoil activities and sustained efforts to improve tax administration, including the new tax code,
in line with FAD’s advice, and which led to the creation of a large tax payers’ unit and the
introduction of a value-added tax. In addition, the audit of oil companies has resulted in the
collection of large revenue due to the government.

On the expenditure side, the government increased capital outlays to meet the urgent social
needs, and accelerated investment in key infrastructure, in the framework of the fight against

- 55 -

poverty. Public investment in infrastructure has translated in opening new roads, schools and
health centers as well as sanitation improvement and rehabilitation of offices for Ministries.
Furthermore, investment in infrastructure within rural areas has eased supply constraints for
domestic foodstuffs. In the same vein outlays on goods and services also were increased.
In the monetary sector, the rise in oil exports has led to a substantial buildup of
international reserves to about US$ 2.9 billion at end-2005 equivalent to 15 months of nonoil sector imports. The efficient use of oil revenues and the adequate remuneration of the
country’s foreign reserves remain the main concerns of my Equatoguinean authorities. Credit
to the economy continued to increase mainly in favor of services and construction activities.
As regards the exchange rate, the appreciation of the real effective exchange rate for
Equatorial Guinea reflects the country’s position as the largest oil exporter in the region and
recipient of foreign direct investment relative to GDP, recent developments in the terms of
trade, and the relative large weight of the U.S. as the major trading partner.
Policies for 2006 and Objectives for the Medium-Term
My Equatoguinean authorities reiterate their medium-term objective of maintaining a high
rate of growth in order to improve substantially the standard of living of the population as the
country has adequate resources. To this end, overall growth is projected to about 5 percent
annually during 2007-10 thanks mainly to the hydrocarbon sector which will be boosted by
the production of liquefied natural gas and the oil production from the new oil field.
Furthermore, it is worth noting that following the implementation of structural reforms and
the large investment in the infrastructures, growth in the non-oil sector is expected to
remain robust at around 10 percent a year. Inflation will decline to reach the CEMAC target
of 3 percent by 2008, and the overall balance of payments surpluses will allow for further
increases in gross official international reserves covering 61 months of non-oil sector
imports, by end-2010. In addition the authorities will continue their efforts to strengthen
transparency and accountability in the management of natural resources, as well as public
finance.
In the fiscal area, the budget process will be enhanced further. Thanks to the Fund technical
assistance, budget formulation and execution processes as well as information reporting and
oversight controls will be improved. This should also help to avoid exceeding budgetary
expenditures which have been due to underestimation of projects cost or changes in the
projects, as well as new additions or the need to meet pressing social needs. My authorities
are determined to meet the pressing needs of the country in the social sector and the
infrastructures. In 2006 public investment program, they have allocated to these two sectors
more than 92 percent of capital spending. Furthermore, the authorities are committed to a
more realistic budget estimates and the inclusion of a contingency provision to meet urgent
needs with a view to enhancing control, transparency and ability to implement sound fiscal
policy. The authorities will also pursue their efforts to implement their fiscal rule which
limits recurrent expenditure to non-oil revenue and finances capital expenditure from oil
revenue.

- 56 -

As regards the monetary sector, policies to contain the inflationary pressures and further
promote the financial intermediation will be strengthened. The authorities are cognizant that
fiscal policy has to assume the main role in liquidity management as the monetary policy is
implemented by the regional central bank. The establishment of an appropriate medium-term
framework for managing the country’s vast oil wealth will be helpful in the reduction of the
excess liquidity through implementing a prudent fiscal policy.
Regarding the issue on the foreign assets’ remuneration, the authorities’ objective is to
maintain the real value over the medium-term. It is important to note that this issue is very
crucial for the authorities owing to its impact on the macroeconomic developments over the
years to come. My Equatoguinean authorities are very appreciative of the staff analysis in the
selected issues paper and call for further analysis and alternatives. They will pursue the
discussions with BEAC and other stakeholders and welcome the Fund’s readiness to assist in
evaluating proposals on the reserve management and related issues.
The banking system remains sound, and the authorities are determined to ensure that all
banks comply with all prudential ratios. They will strengthen the financial intermediation
with a view to further finance the private sector through actions designed to enhance capacity
to assess risks, enforce contracts and collect collateral as well as to encourage the
establishment of micro-credit institutions notably in the rural areas.
With regard to the competitiveness, the authorities intend to focus on the macroeconomic
and structural policies to improve the resilience and productivity of the economy, but this
will take time. The authorities view their ongoing efforts in the areas of education, health,
infrastructure, and measures to improve the business climate as contributing to economic
diversification, increasing labor productivity and making the economy more competitive.
My authorities have reiterated their commitment to regional integration. Following the trade
liberalization and tax reforms in accordance with CEMAC standards, my authorities are
willing to pursue their efforts with the other CEMAC partners to gradually reduce the
remaining challenges in trade liberalization and improve development prospects for the
regional market.
Technical assistance, capacity building and statistical issues
The authorities’ ability to implement policies has been impeded, over the past years, by the
severe capacity constraints and weaknesses in the institutional environment. In order to
overcome these constraints, technical assistance is being sought from development partners.
In capacity building financed through national resources, it is worth noting that more than
100 students graduated from overseas universities over the last two years and this number
will increase in the year to come. In the areas of the public finance management system,
development of an operational fiscal framework for the medium-term and economic
statistics, two resident advisors will be provided by the Fund under the technical assistance

- 57 -

contract signed last March in Bata. All necessary arrangements have been put in place with a
view to launch this assistance as of next July. Regarding the preparation of the poverty
reduction strategy and related data collection and treatment, the authorities and the World
Bank are finalizing the services’ agreement which is expected to be signed next June. In
collaboration with other partners, the authorities will implement all necessary measures to
allocate adequate resources to enhance capacity building and the establishment of the
National Statistical Institute to improve the frequency and scope of data reporting.
Poverty reduction strategy
Poverty reduction and the achievement of the MDGs remain the main objective of my
Equatoguinean authorities. My authorities are also aware of developing a National Poverty
Reduction Strategy (NPRS) conceived as a framework for adjusting both level and
composition of public expenditure with the objective of improving the social indicators.
Towards the preparation of the NPRS, the authorities intend to organize, before the end of
2006, a national conference on poverty with the participation of the civil society, the NGOs
and donors. Four key elements to the NPRS have been identified namely (i) institutional
capacity building; (ii) public investment in physical infrastructure; (iii) removal of
impediments to financial intermediation; and (iv) creation of an appropriate business
environment. The technical assistance expected from the World Bank will be helpful in the
preparation of the authorities’ NPRS including the establishment of a poverty profile,
restructuring the energy sector and assessing sectoral policies to encourage economic
diversification.
Conclusion
My Equatoguinean authorities are fully determined to pursue their policy dialogue with the
Fund and other development partners in order to strengthen their efforts in enhancing
institutional capacities and take opportunity of oil resources to diversify the economy. Under
the EITI Initiative, they are implementing measures to enhance transparency and
accountability in the management of the country’s hydrocarbon resources. In addition, my
authorities fully recognize that the challenge facing the country is to tackle the capacity
constraints in order to implement sound and appropriate policies enabling the fight against
poverty and achieving the MDGs. Lack of capacity is not an excuse. It is a real challenge and
risk facing the economy of Equatorial Guinea which expects from now to 2020 revenues
estimated at more than US$ 30 billions. Therefore, the issues of institutional and capacity
building are of the highest priority. My authorities are aware that the technical assistance
benefited from the Fund, the World Bank and the USAID is only temporary, but they are
determined to seize this opportunity to improve the quality and the delivery of sound
macroeconomic management. The authorities are thankful to development partners, both
bilateral and multilateral, for their assistance in helping them to achieve their development
objective and are hopeful that the international community, in particular the Fund, will
continue providing them with such assistance.
