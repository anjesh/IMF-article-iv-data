KEY ISSUES
Context. Against the backdrop of generally sound policies and abundant natural resources,
Lao P.D.R. has made impressive progress in developing its economy and reducing poverty.
The key challenge going forward is to ensure that economic policy frameworks stay ahead of
the curve to achieve sustainable and broad-based growth.
Outlook and risks. Economic performance remains strong with growth projected at
8.3 percent in 2012 before slowing modestly in the medium term. Spillovers from the global
environment are expected to be modest, allowing policies to focus on reducing homegrown risks from rapid credit growth and inadequate reserve coverage.
Monetary policy was appropriately tightened in 2011 but has been passive since, inflation
has been contained, and the exchange rate has been stable despite liberalization of foreign
exchange transactions. Further tightening remains necessary to reduce credit growth and
replenish reserves.
Financial sector indicators reportedly remain sound, but this masks underlying
vulnerabilities from rapid credit growth. Financial sector supervision should be strengthened
and prudential measures deployed to maintain banking sector soundness.
Fiscal policy has been broadly appropriate, but rapid civil service wage growth could crowd
out higher priority spending. The debt distress rating has improved to moderate risk.
Building broad-based and inclusive growth. Structural reforms to improve the business
climate and trade integration are progressing as the authorities aim to complete entry
conditions for WTO accession by year-end.

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

INTRODUCTION
1.
Lao P.D.R. has made impressive
progress in developing its economy and
reducing poverty. Growth averaged
7 percent per annum over the last decade—
among the highest in the region, with poverty
incidence declining markedly. The country has
also made significant progress towards
achieving the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs). Macroeconomic policies have
remained generally sound, with inflation
within the official target, the fiscal deficit near
pre-global financial crisis levels, and the
exchange rate stable, but low reserve
coverage and rapid credit growth amid high
lending rates could be a source of
vulnerability. The authorities’ development
plan, which became operational in October
2011, targets growth of at least 8 percent
annually and achieving the MDGs by 20151.
2.
In concluding the 2011 Article IV
consultation, Executive Directors agreed
with staff that further fiscal and monetary
tightening would be important to curb
inflation and support the external position.
They also agreed that the frameworks for
macroeconomic and financial policies should
be strengthened and that structural reforms
be accelerated to diversify the economy,
improve the business climate, and foster
trade. The authorities have tightened policies
further and taken steps to safeguard financial
sector soundness, including the
recapitalization of the major state-owned
commercial banks (SOCBs). Structural reforms
have been accelerated in the context of

commitments under the ASEAN Economic
Community and the prospect of World Trade
Organization (WTO) accession, which have
been catalysts for economic reform and
transparency.
3.
Against this backdrop, the
discussions focused on policies to maintain
macroeconomic and financial stability
while building the foundations for more
broad-based growth. There was broad
agreement that the outlook for Lao P.D.R. is
bright and that the recent improvements in
economic performance and institutional
capacity warranted a reclassification of the
country’s debt dynamics to a moderate risk of
debt distress. The authorities and staff agreed
that downside risks from the global outlook
are limited and that therefore policies needed
to focus on maintaining financial sector
soundness and on growing international
reserves over time. In this regard we shared
the view that monetary and fiscal policies
should remain sufficiently tight. The
authorities were more sanguine about
financial market developments, but agreed
that the quality of credit growth should be
carefully monitored and recognized that
oversight of the financial sector needed
further improvement to stay ahead of the
curve. Looking ahead, it will be important for
the authorities to enhance competitiveness in
the nonresource sector through continued
structural reforms and to accelerate Public
Financial Management (PFM) reforms, which
would allow the budget to make a greater
contribution to inclusive growth.

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC

ECONOMIC CONTEXT
A.
Growth is Strong and Macroeconomic Policies Have Been on the Right
Track
4.
Economic activity remained strong
in 2011. Despite monetary and fiscal
tightening, global uncertainty, and natural
disasters in Lao P.D.R. and main trading
partner Thailand, real GDP growth is estimated
at 8.0 percent. Activity was buoyed by mining
and hydropower investments and construction,
while the expansion in the services sector was
indicative of resilient domestic demand.
5.
Inflation pressures have moderated,
with the headline rate falling to 3.6 percent
(y/y) in June 2012 from a peak of 9.8 percent
(y/y) in mid-2011, reflecting moderating food
and fuel price increases, policy tightening, and
base effects.
6.
The fiscal deficit has declined
sharply and is now at the pre-global
financial crisis average. The overall fiscal
deficit moderated to 3.0 percent of GDP in
FY2011 (October 2010-September 2011) from
4.6 percent of GDP in FY2010, due to
expenditure restraint and buoyant mining and
hydropower revenues, while VAT revenue
exceeded the conservative budget target
following the expansion in registered
taxpayers. Debt service costs remain
manageable given the concessional nature of
official borrowing.
7.
Despite fiscal tightening, monetary
conditions remain accommodative. The Bank
of the Lao P.D.R.’s (BoL) quasi-fiscal operations
of providing loans to local governments
continues, but its monetary impact was
mitigated in 2011 by accelerating the sale of

BoL securities in line with past staff
recommendations. As a result, the growth of
broad money declined substantially to
25 percent (y/y) at year end. However, growth
in monetary aggregates picked up again, with
the BoL continuing its quasi-fiscal lending
operations while tempering its security sales.
Quasi-fiscal lending and private sector credit
expansion contributed to a rise in credit to the
economy to close to 44½ percent (y/y) in
April—the highest rate of growth since
October 2010.
8.
Strong domestic demand, fueled by
credit growth, and resource sector activities

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

continue to create pressures on the balance
of payments. Nonresource import growth
outpaced export growth, with the overall
current account deficit widening to
US$1.7 billion in 2011 (21.4 percent of GDP),
while gross international reserves declined by
US$50 million to US$677 million at year-end,

covering about two months of prospective
nonresource imports, the lowest level in
almost a decade. Foreign direct investment
(FDI) increased sharply, mainly for hydropower
projects, and covered about 70 percent of the
headline current account deficit in 2011.

B. The Outlook is Favorable, but Domestic Risks are Elevated
Staff Views
9.
Near-term prospects are generally
favorable.

Growth is projected to accelerate in
2012 to 8.3 percent in light of the pause in
policy tightening, a recovery in agricultural
production, and public construction activities
related to the Asia-Europe Meetings (ASEM).
Over the medium term, growth is expected to
slow only moderately.2

Inflation is projected to average
5.1 percent in 2012, before increasing in 2013
to 6.8 percent reflecting base effects and
public wage bill pressures, which could also
fuel higher private sector wage demands.
Against the backdrop of still accommodative
financial policies, inflation is subject to
considerable uncertainty, as potential shocks
to food and fuel prices could quickly translate
into higher inflation.

The fiscal deficit is projected at
2.5 percent of GDP in FY2012 and FY2013, as
higher revenue collections and savings from

plantations) concessions that will last through 2015,

were submitted prior to the moratorium.

the reduction in off-budget capital spending
are largely used for a significant increase in the
civil service wage bill.

Growth in credit to the economy is
expected to slow through end-2013 given
lower financing of local governments and with
loan-to-deposit ratios already near regulatory
thresholds.

On the external side, the nonresource
current account deficit is expected to widen in
2012 to 19.1 percent of GDP, while the level of
international reserves is projected to rise to
US$723 million by year-end due to a
significant pickup in FDI inflows and
nonresource exports, but with the cover
remaining around two months of imports.
10.
The outlook is subject to a number
of, mostly home-grown, downside risks. The
strong momentum in foreign-funded
investment and the nonresource sector could
increase growth relative to the staff’s forecast.
On balance, however, the outlook is subject to
renewed global financial turbulence as well as
three, arguably more important, internal
vulnerabilities:

Spillovers. The global growth outlook
is still sluggish and subject to significant
downside risks. For Lao P.D.R., judging from
the growth experience during 2009, spillovers

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC

appear small, although unprecedented policy
stimulus at the time, for which there is less
space now, likely contained the fallout. There
are a number of reasons to expect modest
spillovers will prevail, given the country’s
limited integration with global markets,
continued supportive growth in main trading
partners Thailand and China, and with most
hydropower contracts contracted for the long
term. The main channel of contagion from
slower global growth would be through lower
gold and copper export prices, while in the
event of an extreme stress such as a domestic
financial crisis, Lao P.D.R. would likely
experience acceleration in dollarization, loss of
reserves, and significant balance of payments
pressures.

Financial sector risks. The rapid
expansion of the financial sector in recent
years raises concerns about banking sector
soundness and a possible emergence of
contingent fiscal liabilities down the road.
Despite some slowdown in 2011, credit growth
is on the rise again in 2012 putting recent
stability gains at risk. Global shocks could
expose these domestic vulnerabilities.

External risks. Reserve levels offer
inadequate protection against external and
internal risks (Box 1). The core balance of
payments—defined as the current account

balance net of FDI and ODA—remains in
deficit at around 4 percent of GDP, leaving the
external position vulnerable to terms of trade
shocks, potentially volatile capital inflows, and
possible concerns about banking sector
soundness or shocks to inflation.

Fiscal risks. The level of public sector
debt remains elevated compared to other LICs
in Asia. While off-budget capital spending has
declined, it remains indicative of weak
spending controls that could give rise to
additional contingent liabilities.

Authorities’ Views
11.
The authorities broadly shared the
staff’s outlook and assessment of risks. They
noted the key challenge was to ensure that
growth remains inclusive and broad-based,
consistent with their development plan. In this
context, the authorities recognized top
priorities were scaling up education and health
care spending and diversifying the sources of
growth. They agreed that the impact of
spillovers were likely to be modest and that
instead policies should be focused on
monitoring and improving the quality of
banking sector credit and replenishing the
level of international reserves over time.

MAINTAINING MACROECONOMIC STABILITY
12.
Policies will need to be sufficiently
tight to avoid jeopardizing recent financial
stability gains. Monetary policy and strong
banking supervision are likely to be the “first

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

line of defense” against excessive credit
growth, but tighter fiscal policies will also
contribute and reduce the current account
deficit.

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 1. Reserve Adequacy and Risks to External Stability

Lao P.D.R.’s optimal level of reserves is
estimated to be close to three months of
imports. This is based on a recently developed
methodology and assumes the opportunity cost
of holding reserves is around 4 percent.1 In
applying the model to Lao P.D.R., shock variables
(terms of trade, external demand, FDI to GDP
ratio, and aid to GDP ratio) were set at the lower
20 percentile of the country-specific distribution
over the past ten years (2001–2010).
Fundamental indicators (CPIA and fiscal balance)
were set at their most recent levels. These
choices capture the volatility of shocks to the
economies of Lao P.D.R.’s main trading partners
and to its terms of trade, which constitute
important sources of risk to the external balance.

not account for the high degree of dollarization in
Lao P.D.R’s economy. Previous research advocates
higher foreign reserves coverage for dollarized
economies, as currency substitution is easier under
moderate dollarization. Higher coverage would
also mitigate the risk a run on dollar deposits out
of fear for expropriation, in the event of a balance
of payments crisis.2 In this regard, it is also
advisable that the assets of the deposit insurance
fund mirror the currency composition of deposit
liabilities in the banking system.

Reserves, in months of imports

Traditional metrics indicate that, at current
levels, Lao P.D.R.’s international reserves do
not offer adequate protection against
external shocks. Common rules of thumb
suggest that reserves should cover at least
three months of prospective imports or be
equivalent to up to 50 percent of broad money.
Lao P.D.R. falls short on both counts and has low
reserves coverage compared to other lowincome countries (LICs) in Asia.

A. Monetary Policy: Supporting Sustainable Development by Slowing
Credit Growth
Staff Views
13.
Although inflation is manageable,
in the context of heightened financial and
external risks, further tightening is needed.
Staff urged the BoL to contain the expansion
in Net Domestic Assets by accelerating the
exit from quasi-fiscal lending to local
governments. In the meantime, BoL securities
should be issued to sterilize these lending
operations. An increase in the required
reserve ratios would reduce excess liquidity,
while an increase in policy rates would
unlikely affect lending conditions due to the
weak transmission mechanism. Tighter
monetary policies could also reduce the
moderate overvaluation of the kip (Box 2) and
contribute to external stability.
14.
A stabilized exchange rate remains
the appropriate monetary anchor for Lao
P.D.R., but there is scope to enhance the
policy framework. Given the importance of
Thailand as a trading partner, staff supports
the authorities’ implicit objective of stabilizing
the value of the kip vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar
and the Thai baht in order to meet inflation
objectives and to support efforts to dedollarize3. Nevertheless, to achieve this
intermediate target, it will be important to
maintain appropriately tight macroeconomic
policies. The current practice of expressing the
official inflation target in terms of real GDP
growth could give rise to pro-cyclical policy
3

Recent gains to entrench macroeconomic stability,
including from the increased credibility of monetary
policy, has allowed the authorities to partially
liberalize foreign exchange transactions, which could
further contribute to supporting the usage of the kip.

moves. Staff recommended instead that the
BoL considers adopting an explicit inflation
target range over the medium term. To get
there, the BoL needs to improve the
compilation of monetary statistics to enhance
liquidity forecasting and foreign exchange
cash-flow projections and to develop the
interbank foreign exchange (FX) market,
which at present consists of spot FX
transactions only, as was noted in the 2011
Article IV consultation. Staff noted the IMF is
willing to support these activities through
technical assistance and training.

Authorities Views
15.
The authorities felt that current
policy settings were generally appropriate.
Although broadly agreeing with the staff’s
recommendation to issue additional BoL
securities, demand for these instruments was
tepid, while the BoL saw raising the reserve
requirement as a measure of last resort as this
would put an additional burden on banks’
liquidity position, especially the smaller ones.
The authorities argued that the current policy
settings struck the right balance for achieving
the multiple BoL objectives. Over the
medium-term, once the monetary policy
framework was sufficiently strengthened, the
BoL indicated it could consider adopting an
explicit inflation target range. In this regard,
they noted that the country was still dollarized
and that this affected both the conduct and
transmission of monetary policies. At the
moment, foreign currency deposits consisted

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 2. The Conduct of Monetary Policy in Lao P.D.R.
The conduct of monetary policy in Lao P.D.R. is
still at a rudimentary stage. Monetary policy
relies to a great extent on regulations-based
instruments. The interbank market is rudimentary
and financial intermediation is in the process of
developing.
Monetary policy pursues multiple targets.
While the Bank of the Lao P.D.R. (BoL) law states
that one of the roles of the central bank is to
promote and maintain the stability of the kip, the
BoL also pursues several other objectives
including targeting growth in net domestic assets,
the inflation rate, and five-year plan’s GDP growth
target. In addition, the BoL has a financial stability
mandate. In practice, the BoL interprets the
monetary policy objectives as keeping the
inflation rate below the real GDP growth rate,
keeping M2 growth below 25 percent, and
limiting exchange rate volatility vis-à-vis the
U.S. dollar and the Thai baht within +/- 5 percent
band each year.
The BoL lacks full operational independence to
set a more narrow monetary policy objective.
Article 2, 2.2 of the BoL Decree on the
Organization and Activities instructs the BoL “to
study the national monetary policy-plan and
submit it to the government for consideration and
to implement this policy-plan effectively after
approval by the National Assembly.”
In recent years, the BoL has used several
instruments to implement monetary policy:





Standing facilities: The BoL has a
noncollateralized overdraft lending facility, on
which banks can draw for short-term liquidity.
Overdrafts must be paid within seven days.
Interest is charged at a fixed rate set by the
BoL and adjusted infrequently. This rate is
generally regarded as the policy rate, as it is
the only central bank rate that is published.



Money market operations (OMO): the BoL
utilizes net sales of BoL bonds (a short-term
instrument) and auctions of treasury bills to
conduct OMO. Net sales of BoL bonds have
been the most active instrument in recent
years, as they have been used to sterilize
BoL’s quasi-fiscal operations. Treasury bills
have been used much less.



Statutory liquidity requirements (SLR). Banks
are required to hold a liquidity ratio of 20 to
25 percent.

The presence of dollarization constrains the
BOL’s ability to serve effectively as a lender of
last resort. While the extent of dollarization has
declined over the past decade, it remains high.
Going forward, it will be important to continue to
maintain macroeconomic stability; promote
financial intermediation in the kip in tandem with
stronger bank supervision and accumulate
international reserves to withstand any exchange
rate pressure; and, over-time, build market-based
monetary policy tools and the interbank market.

Reserve requirements: The reserve
requirement has been set at 5 percent for kip
deposits and 10 percent for foreign currency
deposits since May 2006. In 2008, a reserve
requirement for eligible certificates of deposit
was introduced at 2 percent for both kip and
foreign currency. Neither the required nor
excess reserves are remunerated.

Rapid credit growth raises concerns
about the health of the banking system.
Stronger credit growth can be indicative of
financial deepening, in itself a welcome
development, provided that its pace is not
excessive and improvements in regulatory
and supervisory enforcement capacity stay
ahead of the curve. Competition for deposits
by an increasing number of banks in
combination with high lending rates, calls in
doubt whether banks can continue to benefit
from high-yield projects while sustaining debt
repayment and avoiding balance sheet
problems over time. Although NPLs, as
reported by the BoL, are low at present, this
mainly reflects rapid credit growth and
possibly the restructuring of loans before they
become past due. Risk management
capacities of banks are weak and although the
capital adequacy of the three SOCBs has
increased following a recapitalization, it
remains below the regulatory minimum for
two of them. Anecdotal evidence suggests
connected lending is prevalent and that credit
growth is fueling rapid real estate price
increases, which are not fully captured in the
CPI inflation.4

Sources: Country authorities; and IMF staff estimates

the prudential toolkit. Although onsite and
offsite inspections of banks take place
regularly, the supervisory approach remains
compliance-based and does not adequately
address risks. In addition, data gaps and poor

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

data quality hamper the ability to adequately
monitor the system, while supervisory
capacity is spread thinly as the number of
banks is expanding rapidly. Staff encouraged
the authorities to participate in the IMF-World
Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP). Careful monitoring of property sector
developments and enhancing the prudential
toolkit by setting exposure limits to real estate
could help prevent potential asset-price
bubbles. Staff indicated that SOCB
recapitalization plans should be linked to
memoranda of understanding that would lay
out structural conditions and performance
criteria for disbursing capital, while
independent audits should continue. Further
capital market development, including
through additional listings on the stock
exchange and development of the local bond
market, would help to reduce the reliance on
the banking system. There is a need for clear
and impartial oversight of both the stock and
bond markets.

Authorities Views
18.
The authorities agreed that
maintaining the credit quality is essential
for sustainable growth, but were more
sanguine about financial sector risks. They

saw current credit growth in line with the
overall objectives set out in the development
plan. Furthermore, it had slowed substantially
from the peak of 2009 and reflected welcome
financial deepening and strong deposit
growth. In their view, financial sector
indicators remained sound and overall
leverage compared favorably to other lowincome countries in the region. The
authorities had also strengthened the
financial operations of the SOCBs and had
taken steps to safeguard financial sector
soundness, including increasing the minimum
capital requirement and issuing a new
regulation on loan classification and
provisioning requirements. The authorities
said they would consider participation in the
FSAP and continue to upgrade their systems
in preparation for this. They also would
consider requesting input from the IMF on
the Anti Money Laundering/Combatting the
Financing of Terrorism Law currently being
drafted for submission to the National
Assembly by year-end. In addition, the
authorities are encouraged to address the
shortcomings in their anti-money laundering
and combating the financing of terrorism
(AML/CFT) regime, identified in the 2011
evaluation by the Asia/Pacific Group on
Money Laundering (APG).

C. External Stability: Building a Reserve Cushion for Dealing with Adverse
Shocks
Staff Views

Current reserve coverage is
inadequate for dealing with shocks. There
is a risk that rapid credit expansion and large
capital inflows are funding private sector
imports of consumption goods rather than
future exports by bolstering productive
investment outside the mining and

hydropower sector, implying further erosion
of reserve coverage in the future and leaving
Lao P.D.R. vulnerable to terms of trade shocks;
Staff noted that capital inflows are also
potentially volatile, including FDI which for
other countries was proven to be less robust
during the global financial crisis than
previously believed. Finally, concerns about
banking sector soundness or shocks to
inflation could lead to currency substitution,
eroding reserves directly and through
additional foreign exchange intervention to
keep the kip stable.
20.
Maintaining sufficiently tight
macroeconomic policies and structural
reforms would improve reserve coverage.
Reserve coverage is low compared to most
other LICs in Asia, with staff encouraging the
authorities to take advantage of prospective
large capital inflows to build reserves. A
CGER-like assessment suggests that, on
average, the kip’s overvaluation is moderate,
but has declined since the last consultation
(Box 3). Given the stated objective of limiting
nominal exchange rate volatility, a continued
reduction in the degree of overvaluation is
consistent with further tightening of
macroeconomic policies in order to contain

inflation at or below trading-partners levels
and slow down nonresource import growth.
Over the medium-term strengthening the
reserve cover requires productivity-enhancing
in the nonresource sector.

Authorities Views
21.
The authorities felt reserve
coverage was broadly adequate, but would
try to take advantage of strong capital
inflows to increase buffers further. They
took some comfort from the fact that the
country remained dollarized, but saw the
prospect of strong FDI and Official
Development Assistance as an opportunity to
replenish coverage, while structural reforms
would continue to enhance competitiveness
in the nonresource sector. There was some
discussion on the appropriate measurement
of imports, with the level used by the IMF
significantly higher (and reserve coverage
correspondingly lower). They believed the
current macroeconomic policy stance was
sufficiently tight to reduce the kip's
overvaluation further and contribute to
external stability.

D. Fiscal Policy: Creating Buffers for Future Spending
Staff Views
22.
Maintaining prudent fiscal policies
will complement monetary tightening to
contain overheating pressures. Staff viewed
the current fiscal stance as broadly
appropriate and welcomed the plan to scale

5

Between 2002–07, the headline deficit averaged about
3 percent of GDP. A significant stimulus was
implemented in 2009 that led to an increase in the deficit
to close to 7 percent of GDP. Most was provided through
the BoL, which disbursed funds directly to private
contractors to finance local government’s off-budget
infrastructure projects. The authorities plan to issue
bonds to clear about 20 percent of the stock of BoL
lending (Kip 1,000 billion) and an additional Kip 200–300
billion to repay part of the SOCB recapitalization bonds.

Box 3. Exchange Rate Assessment

These estimates should be interpreted with
caution. The margin of error can be large due
to data limitations. In addition, it should be
noted that some of the required adjustment in
the external position will come about naturally,
with current resource sector investments
expected to lead to a significant boost in
exports (mainly hydropower) after 2016, which
is beyond the CGER exercise. Hence, these
approaches may overestimate the needed
adjustment in the exchange rate and therefore
the misalignment of the kip.

Staff estimates, using Lao-specific
elasticities, present a mixed picture on the
direction of misalignment, but on average
suggest modest overvaluation. The exchange
rate assessment indicates a degree of
misalignment of the kip in the range of -19.9 to
31.2 percent. This range of overvaluation is
lower than that in the 2011 staff assessment
(between 8 and 42 percent)1/. The equilibrium
exchange rate (EER) approach indicates an
undervaluation of the kip. The different results
from the last staff report reflect data revisions
of the estimated net foreign assets for Lao
P.D.R. as well as developments of the current
account balance.

The budget targets an across-the-board increase in
wages by 37 percent and additional monthly
allowances (about 0.9 percent of GDP each) with
offsetting savings from phasing out off-budget
capital spending and restraining other recurrent
spending. The FY2013 budget was approved by the
National Assembly in July 2012.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Staff recognized the need to increase civil
service wages to compensate for cost-ofliving increases and maintain competitive pay
with the private sector and supported the
hiring of additional workers in social sectors
(health care and education). However, the
rapid, across-the-board increase in the civil
service wage bill and allowances risks
crowding out much needed, domesticallyfinanced, public investment and could
undermine macroeconomic stability, while
earmarking of future revenue for this purpose
should be avoided.
23.
For the medium term, staff noted
that the government’s domestic revenue
goal of 16–17 percent of GDP required an
additional tax effort of 1 percent of GDP,
which was viewed as achievable if the current
strong revenue momentum is maintained
despite declining mining revenue. However,
the authorities would need to move forcefully
on ongoing reforms of the tax system and
avail themselves to TA, including that financed
from the IMF’ Management of Natural
Resources Wealth Topical Trust Fund. In the
event and assuming expenditure remains
under control, the nonmining deficit, as the
most appropriate fiscal target and anchor,
would fall to below 5 percent of GDP by
FY2015.7
24.
The external debt sustainability
analysis suggests that Lao P.D.R. now faces
a moderate risk of debt distress from a
high risk previously. The projected strong
performance of the economy, fundamental
improvements in institutional capacity,
together with recent fiscal consolidation have
7

See Box 3 in the Staff Report for the 2011 Article IV
Consultation.

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

led to an upgrade in the country’s risk rating
and imply that debt indicators fall below
indicative thresholds in the baseline. Staff
welcomed the commitment to reduce public
external debt to below 35 percent of GDP by
2015, which required appropriately tight
macroeconomic policies so that inflation
converges to key trading-partner levels to
avoid nominal exchange rate depreciation. In
this regard, it is also important to improve
debt management capacity and develop a
medium-term borrowing strategy for the
government, including for resource sector
activity, as well as to ensure greater disclosure
of borrowing plans.

Authorities Views
25.
The authorities emphasized their
commitment to prudent fiscal policies and
intent to build buffers to deal with future
shocks. They agreed that any revenue
overperformance next fiscal year (as well as
underspending) and a higher share of mining
revenue should be saved, for which they

would establish a State Accumulation Fund to
be managed by the newly established State
Reserve Department within the Ministry of
Finance. The reserve could be used in the
event of natural disasters or if the need for
counter-cyclical policies arises. The authorities
also saw higher wages as necessary to
compensate for cost of living increases and
also contribute to improving governance.
They recognized that the level of debt
remains high but indicated that the debt
service is relatively low due to its highly
concessional nature. The authorities have put
a ceiling on new debt commitments for
nonself-financing expenditures equal to
25 percent of revenues, while borrowing for
commercial projects would only be pursued if
the internal rate of return exceeded
9.5 percent. The improved debt distress rating
was welcomed as this reflected the country’s
strong performance and implied that the
economy’s absorptive capacity had improved.

BUILDING BROAD-BASED AND INCLUSIVE GROWTH
Staff Views
26.
Lao P.D.R. is embarking on
significant further trade integration, which
should promote growth. The country will
face increased competition following the
phased mandatory reduction of tariffs under
the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement. In addition,
the government is embarking on revising
relevant laws and passing implementing
decrees in preparation for WTO accession.
27.
Efforts to improve the business
climate should be intensified. The latest

World Bank Doing Business Survey (2012)
suggests that Lao P.D.R. has made limited
progress in streamlining business procedures
and strengthening policy frameworks to boost
private sector-led growth. Getting electricity,
gaining access to credit, providing investor
protections, and trading across borders are
areas where much remains to be done.
Ongoing efforts to improve the business
climate and trade integration should be
accelerated to support growth in the
nonresource sector and achieve further
poverty reduction (see Table 5 on the status
of the MDGs in Lao P.D.R.).
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

28.
Accelerating PFM reforms would
contribute to achieving inclusive and
sustainable growth, by improving the quality
and transparency of spending and enhancing
its prioritization to upgrade human and
physical capital accumulation and povertyreducing outlays. Priority reforms include
improving government accounting and cash
management and establishing a treasury
single account, including through IMF TA.
29.
Modernizing and upgrading the
quality and comprehensiveness of
economic data is becoming a more urgent
priority as Lao P.D.R. develops. Data
shortcomings hamper policy formulation,
analysis, and surveillance, including the
monitoring of emerging macroeconomic and
financial risks and tracking progress made
with achieving inclusive growth, including
through poverty-reducing government
expenditures.

Authorities Views
30.
The authorities noted that reforms
to improve the business climate had been
accelerated. Commitments under the ASEAN
Free Trade Agreement and the prospect of
WTO accession had led to significant revisions
to laws and the regulatory regime. These
included efforts to streamline business
registration procedures and the preparation
of the Investment Promotion Law, while
trade-related legislation is expected to be
approved by the National Assembly by
September. The authorities also noted that
entry conditions for Lao P.D.R.’s accession to
the WTO could be finalized by end-2012,
noting the positive effect on exports and
foreign investments in the medium-term. The
authorities responded that they will consider
requesting TA to address data shortcomings.

STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
Lao P.D.R. continues to make
impressive progress in developing its
economy and reducing poverty. The
authorities’ policy management has been on
the right track and is supporting confidence.
Staff expect strong GDP growth in the coming
years, inflation to remain manageable, modest
fiscal deficits, and favorable debt dynamics. As
a result, poverty incidence should continue to
decline, with the country having generally
good prospects to achieve the MDGs by 2015.
32.
The benign outlook is subject to
elevated, mainly home-grown downside
risks, in particular from the rapid expansion
of the banking sector. Spillover effects from
the weak and uncertain global environment

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

should be relatively modest, with the main
channel of contagion through lower
commodity prices. Instead, the main risk to
macroeconomic stability stems from rapid
credit growth in an environment of limited
external and fiscal buffers to absorb potential
domestic and external shocks and weak
financial sector oversight.
33.
A key policy challenge for the
Lao P.D.R. authorities is to maintain
macroeconomic stability and build broadbased and inclusive growth. Policies and
institutional reforms will need to balance the
objective of supporting growth in the near
term with ensuring that development is
sustainable by minimizing risks to

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

macroeconomic stability. In this regard, the
authorities should focus on further tightening
monetary and fiscal policies and strengthening
banking supervision, regulation, and
enforcement, while continuing to improve the
business climate to support growth in the
nonresource sector and achieve further
poverty reduction.
34.
Monetary conditions need to be
tightened. Policy tightening in recent years
helped to contain inflation pressures and
contributed to maintaining exchange rate
stability. The increased credibility of monetary
policy has allowed the authorities to partially
liberalize foreign exchange transactions. With
inflation manageable, the BoL’s policies should
be focused on phasing out quasi-fiscal
operations and further reducing the pace of
monetary expansion through stepped-up
sterilization and higher reserve requirements.
Tensions that result from the pursuit of
multiple monetary policy objectives may have
contributed to the low reserves cushion, thus
ultimately undermining the main anchor (a
stabilized exchange rate). Further
improvements to the policy framework would
include improving the compilation of
monetary statistics to enhance liquidity
forecasting and foreign exchange cash-flow
projections. Over the medium-term, an explicit
inflation target range could be adopted, which
would enhance the effectiveness of monetary
policy by anchoring inflation expectations, in
the context of also improving the monetary
transmission mechanism.
35.
Banking supervision should be
strengthened to maintain financial sector
stability. Staff urged the authorities’ continued
attention to maintaining the quality of credit
and to ensure that the pace of financial
deepening is consistent with improvements in

regulatory and supervisory enforcement
capacity, while the prudential toolkit should
also be strengthened.
36.
Reserve levels are well below
standard precautionary metrics and need to
be replenished. International reserves provide
a cushion against shocks, but current levels of
protection are inadequate. Staff were
encouraged by the authorities’ intent to
replenish reserve buffers in the near future by
pursuing tighter macroeconomic policies to
slow down import growth, and also to take
advantage of the prospect of strong capital
inflows in the coming years. The staff estimates
the real effective exchange rate on average to
be modestly overvalued compared to medium
term fundamentals, but less so than in the
past.
37.
The fiscal stance is appropriate, but
large civil service wage increases should be
reconsidered. The deficit target in FY2013,
under generally more efficient and transparent
budget processes, is supportive of
macroeconomic stability provided any revenue
overperformance is saved and new off-budget
spending is avoided. Medium-term fiscal goals
also seem broadly appropriate, focused
around reducing the nonmining deficit to
below 5 percent of GDP. In this regard, staff
are encouraged by the intention of the
authorities to establish a reserve funded
mainly by excess revenues. This will strengthen
the ability of the budget to respond to future
shocks, including natural disasters. However,
the reorientation of expenditure towards civil
servant wages could crowd out higher priority
spending.
38.
Staff support the authorities’
intention to build broad-based and
inclusive growth. The authorities efforts

under the umbrella of WTO accession and the

way for an improved business climate that will
enhance the competitiveness of the
nonresource sector. Accelerating PFM reforms
would contribute to achieving inclusive and
sustainable growth by improving the quality,
transparency, and prioritization of spending.

Figure 4. Lao P.D.R.: Fiscal Sector Developments and Outlook
Fiscal performance has improved since 2009 owing to strong revenue collections and restrained spending. The nearterm outlook is also favorable with continued fiscal consolidation and a comfortable level of government deposits.
Strong resource revenue has helped sustain the growth of
overall revenue despite lower grant disbursement.

While the introduction of VAT has also improved the
collection of nonresource revenue since 2010.

Following the improvement in the country’s CPIA rating, Lao P.D.R.’s risk of debt distress
is reclassified from high to moderate, as all external debt distress indicators stay below
policy-dependent indicative thresholds during the forecasting period under baseline
assumptions, although thresholds are breached in the presence of certain shocks.2 In
addition, debt service ratios remain comfortably within the policy-dependent indicative
thresholds even under stress conditions, due to the high level of concessionality of official
borrowing. The new risk classification will have important implications for Lao P.D.R.’s
borrowing capacity. While the composition of concessional funds is expected to be
skewed away from grants and towards loans, the overall envelope of external resources
available to the country should increase.

1

This DSA was prepared jointly by the IMF and World Bank (WB), in consultation with the Asian Development
Bank (AsDB). The debt data underlying this exercise were provided by the Lao P.D.R. authorities, the AsDB, and
the WB, combined with IMF staff’s estimates.

2

The low-income country debt sustainability framework (LIC DSF) recognizes that better policies and
institutions allow countries to manage higher levels of debt, and thus the threshold levels for debt indicators
are policy-dependent. In the LIC-DSF, the quality of a country’s policies and institutions is measured by the
World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index and classified into three categories:
strong, medium, and weak. Lao P.D.R.’s policies and institutions, as measured by the CPIA, averaged 3.29 over
the past 3 years. Since its average CPIA has been above the 3.25 mark for two years in a row, Lao P.D.R.’s policy
performance has been reclassified from weak to medium according to the “Staff Guidance Note on the
Application of the Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-income Countries
(www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2010/012210.pdf).” Therefore, the relevant indicative thresholds for this
category are: 40 percent for the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio, 150 percent for the PV of debt-to-exports ratio,
250 percent for the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio, 20 percent for the debt service-to-exports ratio, and
20 percent for the debt service-to-revenue ratio. These thresholds are applicable to public and publicly
guaranteed external debt.

INTRODUCTION
1.
This LIC DSA for Lao P.D.R. reclassifies
the risk of debt distress from high to
moderate.3 Recent improvements in Lao P.D.R.’s
CPIA index led to a reclassification of its policy
performance from weak to moderate.4
Consequently, Lao P.D.R.’s indicative debt distress
thresholds were raised relative to 2011 levels.
These higher thresholds combined with a similar
debt dynamics relative to the previous DSA led to

the risk reclassification.
2.
The high level of concessionality of
official borrowing keeps debt service ratios at
manageable levels. In addition, public and
publicly-guaranteed (PPG) external debt stock
indicators are expected to remain below policydependent indicative thresholds throughout the
entire projection period under the baseline.
However, shocks to the domestic and external
environment or excessively loose macroeconomic
policies may push the stock of external public
debt beyond sustainable levels, with some debt
distress indicators breaching their respective
thresholds under certain stress tests.5 In this
regard, debt dynamics are most sensitive to large
real depreciations of the kip, as external debt is
predominantly denominated in foreign currency.

thresholds have been reduced.

BACKGROUND AND ASSUMPTIONS
3.
Lao P.D.R.’s external PPG debt remains
elevated compared to other LICs in Asia, but
its burden has eased considerably in the recent
past. 3The nominal stock of PPG debt increased
from US$3.5 billion in 2010 to US$3.7 billion in
2011. 4However, high real GDP growth and the
Kip’s appreciation vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar
contributed to a decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio

from 50.3 percent of GDP to 44.4 percent of GDP
in 2011. 5The corresponding net present value (PV)
of debt at end-2011 was 29.8 percent of GDP,
down from 36.6 percent of GDP in 2010. Similarly,
the PV of PPG debt relative to exports declined
from 85.9 percent in 2010 to 78.1 percent in 2011.
4.
Approximately 56 percent of PPG debt
in Lao P.D.R. is held by multilateral creditors,
mainly the Asian Development Bank (AsDB—

33 percent) and the International Development
Association (IDA—18 percent). Around 38 percent
of the debt is held by bilateral creditors—mainly
China, India, Japan, Korea, Russia, and Thailand.
Noteworthy, the importance of bilateral creditors
has increased vis-à-vis multilateral ones. Albeit
small, the share of nonconcessional PPG debt has
increased steadily in the last several years,
standing at 6.3 percent in 2011. This increase was
expected given heavy investments in hydropower
and electricity generation projects, including the
need by the public sector to finance equity stakes.

5.
The increasing presence of bilateral
creditors underscores the need to strengthen
debt management capacity. This is particularly
important to ensure that debt sustainability
considerations are taken into account when new
debt is contracted. A mitigating factor for
Lao P.D.R.’s external debt burden lies in the
prospective returns on the hydropower and
mining projects that have been financed in part
by external PPG debt. While many of these
projects face construction and implementation

challenges, the long-term power purchase
agreements that are signed for these projects and
the resulting government revenues in the form of
royalties, dividends, and profit tax payments
arguably reduce the risk of debt distress.
6.
Recorded domestic public debt rose to
8.9 percent of GDP in 2011, up from
8.5 percent of GDP in 2010, as the central bank
disbursed more loans to finance local
government’s off-budget infrastructure projects.
Lending from the Bank of Lao P.D.R. (BoL) to local
governments represents about three-quarters of
the recorded total domestic debt, with the
remainder inclusive of government bonds related
to the recapitalization of state-owned commercial
banks (SOCBs). Total PPG domestic and external
debt stood at 53.2 percent of GDP in 2011, down
from 58.8 percent the year before. This
improvement is also driven chiefly by the
combination of GDP growth and exchange rate
effects. The stock of BoL’s loans to local
governments is projected to peak in the near
future as the BoL’s quasi-fiscal operations are
gradually phased out.

External financing is assumed to

term, grant financing is expected to decline
relative to loans from bilateral creditors as well as
from commercial sources.

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
A. External Debt Sustainability Analysis
9.
Contrary to the previous DSAs, the PV
of debt-to-GDP ratio is not expected to cross
the policy-dependent indicative thresholds at
any point during the forecasting period under
baseline conditions (Figure 1 and Table 1). This
marked improvement is driven by the increase in
the indicative threshold, as Lao P.D.R.’s policy
performance was raised from weak to moderate
due to its improved CPIA index of 3.4 in 2011.
Similarly to last year’s DSA, all three external debt
stock indicators are projected to remain basically
flat until about 2018, as large projected
disbursements are expected to be counteracted
by a combination of debt repayment and high
GDP growth during the next several years. Also in
line with the previous DSA, debt service ratios fall
comfortably below policy-dependent thresholds
during the entire forecasting period.
10.
Exchange rate and shocks to the cost
of new loans present the most important risks
to external debt sustainability. Table 3 and
Figure 1 illustrate how a one-off 30 percent
depreciation of the kip vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar
would lead to a sharp rise in the PV of the debtto-GDP and the PV of debt-to-revenues, although
in the last case the new policy-dependent
4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

threshold is not breached. A rise in the cost of
additional financing (by 200 basis points relative
to the baseline) would increase the PV of debt-toexports ratio by more than 30 percentage points
in the long run relative to the baseline. However,
even under this extreme scenario, there would be
no breaches of the corresponding threshold,
contrary to the results in the previous DSA when
policy performance was still rated as weak. Hence,
improved policy performance reduced the
vulnerability of Lao P.D.R.’s external debt to
potential shocks to the cost of public funds.
11.
Debt dynamics continue to be
markedly worse under an alternative scenario
in which key variables are at their historical
averages. Through 2015, debt dynamics are
more favorable under this historical scenario—
which takes into account the appreciation of the
kip relative to the U.S. dollar experienced during
2002–2011.6 In later years, this effect is

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

Box 1. Baseline Scenario—Underlying Assumptions (2012–32)
The baseline macroeconomic framework assumes that the economy will be underpinned by further development of
Lao P.D.R.’s potential in hydropower and mining, supported by continued reforms aimed at transitioning to a market economy
and the strengthening of macroeconomic policies.
Real GDP growth is projected to average 7.9 percent
between 2012–17. The near-term outlook is boosted by
expanding production of mining and hydropower, with
the (US$3.7 billion) Hongsa Lignite mining and power
station expected to start operations in 2015–16. In
addition, the outlook for tourism and agriculture is
favorable, buoyed by domestic demand and strong FDI
inflows. Over the longer term, assumed structural
reforms would create a better environment for private
investment, broadening the sources of growth. Real
GDP is expected to moderate to 6.5 percent on average
during 2018–32, as production in the resource sector
reaches maturity. Over time, the share of agriculture in
GDP is expected to decline, as the transition to a
market based economy is accompanied by the rising
importance of the industry and services sectors.
Graduation from low-income status could be achieved
in the second half of the projection period.
Inflation is projected to average 5.1 percent in 2012,
down from 7.6 percent in 2011, on the back of lower
food and fuel price inflation. Over the medium term,
inflation is expected to decline further, but it is
projected to remain above 4 percent until 2017.
The balance of payments continues to be driven by
developments in the resource sector, which has an
important bearing both in the current account and the
capital and financial account. Starting from a large
deficit of 21.4 percent of GDP in 2011, the current
account is projected to improve considerably in the
long-term. While the nonresource current account
deficit is projected to deteriorate until 2018, the
resource current account is forecasted to move into
surplus as early as 2016, building on the maturation of
mining and hydropower projects. In this context, the
assumed pick up in nonresource exports and services is
driven by strengthened competitiveness and regional
integration, supported by improvements in the
investment climate, streamlining of business
regulations, and the prevalence of trade commitments.
The overall external position is expected to strengthen
over time, exemplified by the gradual improvement in
the international reserves position. Private capital
inflows in the form of FDI are expected to remain high
through the first half of the projection period as large
new projects get under way before they gradually
decline to a more sustainable level.

External financing is assumed to remain on largely
concessional terms over the medium term. In the longrun, however, grant financing decreases with economic
development.


Multilateral creditors: Projected loan
disbursements in the medium term are relatively
low, since IDA and AsDB have a pipeline of
operations financed on grant terms. Over the
longer term, grant financing decreases with
economic development and project loans are
assumed to increase moderately.



Bilateral creditors: For 2012–13, project loan
disbursements also increase, as donors provide
support to the government’s development agenda.
Over the medium and longer term, greater
participation by new emerging market creditors
results in an increased role for bilateral finance,
including for lending purposes to state-owned
enterprises.



Commercial creditors: Over the medium term,
commercial disbursements are relatively small,
principally used to finance a portion of the
government’s equity stake participation in the new
hydropower projects. The DSA assumes that
disbursements of the government’s borrowing to
finance its equity stake in the Hongsa Lignite
project will take place in 2014 and 2015.

Fiscal policy is projected to remain on a consolidation
path, with the primary deficit declining from 2.4 percent
of GDP in 2011 to 1.3 percent of GDP in 2018, before
reaching 0.5 percent of GDP towards the end of the
projection period. Reductions in the deficit are largely
driven by expected declines in primary expenditures,
since the ratio of revenues and grants to GDP are
forecasted to decline from their 2012 peak starting in
2013.
Domestic debt decreases over the medium term driven
by repayments of the lending to local governments
from the BoL. In the long term, net external finance
declines relative to GDP, and a larger share of budget
deficits is financed domestically, pushing domestic debt
to higher but sustainable levels.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC

outweighed by the higher historical average of
the current account deficit (14.7 percent of GDP
per annum compared to 10.0 percent of GDP per
annum in the baseline), and the lower historical
average for FDI (4.6 percent of GDP per annum
compared to 9.0 percent of GDP per annum in the
baseline). These estimates indicate that the

historical scenario assumes around 9 percentage
points of GDP more in debt accumulation the
baseline, putting Lao P.D.R. on an unsustainable
path in the long run. Therefore, a negative shock
to FDI in Lao P.D.R. would force it to reduce
substantially its current account deficit in order to
avoid external debt distress.

B. Public Sector Debt Sustainability
12.
In line with the previous DSA’s
projections, the PV of total PPG debt in
percent of GDP and in percent of revenue are
both projected to decline markedly over the
long run under baseline assumptions (Figure 2
and Table 2). Domestic debt is expected to
decline from 8.9 percent of GDP in 2011 to about
5.4 percent of GDP by 2017. In addition, the PV of
debt-to-revenue ratio is also projected to decline
during the forecasting period.
13.
Public debt ratios are particularly
sensitive to a kip depreciation over the
medium term (Figure 2 and Table 4). Similarly to
the results in the last DSA, a 30 percent real
depreciation of the kip would immediately raise
the PV of public debt-to-GDP and the PV of
public debt-to-revenue, before both indicators
start a declining trend once again. While the debt
service-to-revenue ratio is relatively stable under
the baseline scenario, it would increase
permanently by a substantial margin if the kip
were to depreciate sharply. It should be noted
that this scenario is likely to overstate risks given
that a significant share of GDP, including most of
the resource GDP, is earned in foreign currency
14.
Public debt indicators are susceptible
to the effects of contingent liabilities. The
settlement of arrears and debts to contractors,
related to public investment projects
implemented by local governments and the
recapitalization of SOCBs could lead to a rise in

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

recorded domestic public debt. As an illustration,
the fifth bound test, which considers the effect of
a 10 percent of GDP increase in other debtcreating flows, provides hints on the possible
effect of a resolution of relevant contingent public
liabilities.
15.
Alternative scenarios show less
positive debt dynamics over the longer term.
For example, in a historical scenario where real
GDP growth and the primary balance are fixed at
their historical averages, the PV of public debt-toGDP ratio rises above 42 percent by 2032. If,
however, the primary balance were fixed at the
level projected for 2012, the PV of debt-to-GDP
would be roughly unchanged in the medium term,
but it would be higher relative to baseline
conditions by the end of the projection period.
Together, these results highlight the importance
of efforts towards improving fiscal balances over
time, even relative to the positive fiscal
performance expected for this year.
16.
The baseline scenario also assumes
that the BoL will slow down its quasi-fiscal
operations. Naturally, public debt dynamics
could deteriorate significantly should this
assumption not materialize.

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

THE AUTHORITIES' VIEWS
17.
Authorities broadly agreed with the
overall assessment and indicated they are
supportive of the reclassification of debt
distress. They expect to capitalize on the better
risk classification to expand access to official
resources and improve their ability to finance
capital needs. In addition, the authorities agreed
with staff that a better risk classification may
improve access to nonconcessional loans in the
future. This is important since Lao P.D.R. is
expected to rely more on commercial funds as it
graduates from its low-income country status
over the medium term.

18.
The authorities highlighted that debt
projections over the medium term remained
imprecise and questioned the exchange rate
assumptions built into the framework. On the
basis of information provided by local contracting
parties, the authorities anticipated a smaller
increase in disbursements of new funds from
some bilateral donors between 2012 and 2017
than assumed in the DSA.7 In addition, they
questioned staff’s projections for the evolution of
the kip-U.S. dollar exchange rate—driven by
inflation differentials—which has an important
bearing on external debt indicators.

CONCLUSION
19.
Due to recent improvements in policy
performance, Lao P.D.R.’s risk of debt distress
has been reclassified from high to moderate.
The improved 2011 CPIA index moved Lao P.D.R.
to the group of countries with medium rather
than weak policy performance, raising its policydependent debt distress thresholds. Consequently,
the new marks are not breached by any of the
debt distress indicators under baseline conditions.
Since debt dynamics are relatively similar to what
was projected in the previous DSA, it is clear that
the risk reclassification is driven by improvements
in domestic policies and institutions.
20.
These gains notwithstanding, results
are still sensitive to assumptions regarding
investment and performance of the resource
sector. Despite long-term contracts with fixed
prices for energy exports to neighboring countries,
Lao P.D.R.’s economy remains exposed to
fluctuations in copper and gold prices in the
medium term, as well as to economic
developments in its main trading partners (China,

Thailand and Vietnam).8 Lower growth in7
Lao P.D.R. and a weaker balance of payments8
would worsen debt dynamics. Thus, a tightening
of macroeconomic policies can support external
sustainability. Cautious assessment and
monitoring of large-scale projects and private
external debt will be required to mitigate the risks
posed to external and public debt sustainability,

7

The staff maintained the US$600 million of projected
disbursements from China between 2012–2017, which
is based on information collected by previous missions.
These disbursements do not, however, result in a
material change in the overall assessment of debt
distress.

8

In a customized scenario where commodity prices
decline by 20 percent in 2013 and 2014, debt stock
indicators approach or even reach their policydependent thresholds, illustrating the vulnerability of
Lao P.D.R. to commodity price shocks. However, this
customized scenario poses less of a threat to debt
dynamics than the historical scenario.

capacity and developing a medium-term

lead to more efficient utilization of borrowed
funds and more favorable debt dynamics even
under stress scenarios. If these conditions were to
materialize, Lao P.D.R.’s risk of debt distress could
improve even further.

1/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
2/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
3/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
4/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
5/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
6/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly
assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

A. Membership Status

G. Exchange Arrangement

Joined: July 05, 1961; Article XIV

The exchange rate arrangement is classified as
“stabilized.” The de jure arrangement is
floating. The authorities’ objective is to limit
currency fluctuations vis-à-vis major
currencies, including the U.S. dollar and Thai
baht within ±5 percent per annum. The Bank
of the Lao P.D.R. (BoL) sets a daily official
reference rate, which is calculated as a
weighted average of the previous day’s
interbank rates. Commercial banks and foreign
exchange bureaus are required to maintain
their buying and selling rates within
±0.25 percent of the BoL’s daily reference rate
for the U.S. dollar. For the euro and baht, the
buying and selling rates may not exceed a
margin of 0.5 percent. For other currencies, a
margin of 2 percent applies.

On May 28, 2010, Lao P.D.R. accepted the
obligations under Article VIII, Section 2, 3, and
4, following the elimination of one restriction
subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII
arising from a requirement to obtain tax
payment certificates for some transactions.
Lao P.D.R. now maintains an exchange system
free of restrictions on the making of payments
and transfers for current international
transactions, except for restrictions imposed
solely for the preservation of national or
international security notified to the Fund
pursuant to Decision No. 144-(52/51).

ANNEX II. IMF-WORLD BANK COLLABORATION
The Bank and the IMF country teams for
Lao P.D.R. met on July 3, 2012 to identify
macro-critical structural reforms and to
coordinate the two teams’ work for FY13. The
teams were led by Ms. Keiko Miwa (Country
Manager, EASPR, World Bank), Mr. Sudhir
Shetty (Director, EASPR, World Bank) and
Mr. Dennis Botman (IMF Mission Chief for
Lao P.D.R.).
The teams agreed that Lao P.D.R. had made
impressive progress and that the key challenge
going forward is to maintain macroeconomic
and financial stability, achieve more diversified
growth, and ensure that the country’s natural
resource wealth is developed in a sustainable
way that benefits the entire population.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Prudent fiscal and monetary policies and a
strengthening of policy frameworks, including
financial sector supervision and regulation, are
essential to preserve banking sector soundness
and replenish international reserves. Reforms
to public financial management will need to be
strengthened further—on both the tax and
spending side—along with improvements in
the enabling environment for private sector
development to help ensure that Lao P.D.R.’s
resource wealth is not the only source of
economic progress and that economic
development results in a generalized
improvement in living standards and reduction
in poverty.

Development Plan (NSEDP, 7th Five-Year
Plan)), and seeks to promote inclusive and
sustainable economic growth and poverty
reduction. The country assistance program
evaluation, 2000–09, concluded that the
AsDB’s assistance was successful, relevant, and
effective. The CPS is designed to help the
government diversify the economy in a
sustainable and inclusive manner through
agriculture and natural resources, education,
energy, urban development, and public sector
management. The CPS aims to maximize
efficiency and sustainability through larger
operations implemented over a longer period;
maximize synergies with Greater Mekong
Subregion program; and increase
responsiveness to emerging issues in a rapidly
changing economy. It highlights four thematic
areas that will influence the design and focus
of activities, including private sector
development, governance, gender equity, and
regional cooperation and integration. The CPS
focuses on four core sectors: education,
agriculture and natural resources, water supply

and other municipal infrastructure and
services, and energy. Strengthening public
sector management is a crosscutting issue, key
to efficient and effective development in
Lao P.D.R. The performance-based allocation
of the Asian Development Fund (ADF), based
on the country performance assessment (CPA)
finalized in 2010, provided Lao P.D.R. with an
ADF allocation in the amount of
US$152 million for the biennial period
2011–12. The CPA for the next allocation
period (2013–2014) will be finalized by the end
of 2012.
As of end-2011, cumulative loans/grants
approved stood at US$631.48 million, out of
which a cumulative amount of
US$266.66 million was awarded for contracts.
During 2011, US$73.2 million of grants were
disbursed and US$53.2 million of contracts
were awarded. Seven new technical assistance
(TA) projects for a total of US$7.6 million were
approved in 2011, including project
preparation; TA projects related to transport
and renewable energy; and capacity building
TA to improve management and operational
effectiveness.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

ANNEX IV. STATISTICAL ISSUES
Assessment of Data Adequacy for
Surveillance
General: Macroeconomic and financial data
provided to the IMF have shortcomings that
significantly hamper surveillance.
Strengthening balance of payments (BOP) and
national accounts statistics is a priority.
National accounts: National accounts
comprise annual estimates of GDP by activity
at current and constant base year 2002 prices,
broadly following the System of National
Accounts (SNA) 1993. Despite some
improvements following the implementation
of annual enterprise and household surveys,
unresolved gaps and inappropriate data
collection and compilation methodology
continue to undermine the coverage and
reliability of the GDP estimates. Lao P.D.R.
participates in the IMF’s Statistics Department
(STA) project to implement the SNA and
International Comparison Project (ICP), funded
by the government of Japan, and has received
technical assistance (TA) to improve annual
national accounts and develop quarterly
national accounts (QNA). Following the TA
mission of December 12–21, 2011 under this
project, the authorities launched the updating
of the base year of their national accounts
from 2002 to 2007 and this is planned for
release in late 2012. It is expected that the
QNA and parts of the 2008 SNA will be
released in October 2014.
Prices statistics: Lao P.D.R. compiles a
monthly CPI (December 2010=100) using
weights based on the 2007/08 Lao Expenditure
and Consumption Survey. To date no PPI has
been developed. A TA mission was held on
June 4–15, 2012 to improve the CPI and begin

developing a PPI. The authorities have begun
to develop a new PPI for LAO. It is expected
that the new PPI will be released in July 2013.
The mission was funded through the
authorities' participation in the STA project to
implement the SNA and ICP.
Government finance statistics: Government
finance statistics remain weak. The timeliness
of fiscal reporting needs significant
improvement. Off-budget activities are not
included in the fiscal data, although they have
expanded rapidly. Annual budget and outturn
data formats do not follow international
standards. Except for the annual data
disseminated in the Official Gazette, no fiscal
data are disseminated in the country.
Monetary statistics: Regarding the
compilation of monetary statistics, the
classification of data by institutional sector and
by financial instrument as well as valuation
principles need to be strengthened. The
Standardized Report Forms (SRFs), which
embody the IMF-recommended framework for
compiling monetary statistics need to be
introduced. Financial soundness indicators
should also be compiled and published. An
STA mission to introduce the SRFs has been
proposed, however, the authorities have not
taken this up yet.
External sector statistics: The last TA mission
was conducted in 2002. Lao P.D.R would be
one of the beneficiaries of the recently
approved Japan Administered Account (JSA)
Project on the improvement of external sector
statistics in the Asia and Pacific region. A TA
mission on balance of payments statistics may
take place in FY 2013.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
the Lao People’s Democratic Republic
On August 31, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Lao P.D.R. 1
Background
Despite policy tightening, global uncertainty, and natural disasters in Lao P.D.R. and its main
trading partner, Thailand. real GDP growth remained strong at 8.0 percent in 2011 compared to
an average of 7 percent per annum over the last decade. This has allowed the country to make
significant progress with attaining Millennium Development Goals (MDG) targets. Inflation has
moderated to 3.8 percent (y/y) in May 2012—reflecting lower food and fuel price pressures,
policy tightening, and favorable base effects. The fiscal deficit declined further in 2011 to reach
the pre-global financial crisis average. Credit growth, however, has again picked up to over 40
percent (y/y) in the first four months of 2012, reversing positive progress towards maintaining
financial stability in 2011. The current account deficit has widened and gross international
reserves declined by US$50 million to US$677 million at end-2011, covering about two months
of prospective nonresource imports, the lowest level in almost a decade.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
Macroeconomic policies have remained generally sound; however, low reserve coverage and
rapid credit growth amid high lending rates have emerged as sources of vulnerability. Although
the FY2013 budget targets a broadly unchanged fiscal stance, the prospect for rapid increases
in civil service wages could crowd out higher priority spending going forward. Monetary policy
remains accommodative and recently the Bank of Lao P.D.R. has tempered the sale of its
securities, thus contributing to an increase in credit to the economy. The supervisory approach
remains compliance-based and the entrance of new banks in recent years have spread
supervision capacity thinly. Data gaps and poor data quality also hamper the ability to
adequately monitor the economy and to design proactive policies to prevent macroeconomic
vulnerabilities.
Structural reforms have been accelerated in the context of commitments under the ASEAN
Economic Community and the prospect of World Trade Organization (WTO) accession. The
authorities aim to complete entry conditions for WTO accession by year-end.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their sound policies, which have contributed
to impressive economic growth, reduction in poverty, lower inflation, and improved debt
dynamics. Directors encouraged the authorities to take advantage of the favorable conditions to
maintain macroeconomic and financial stability, build external and fiscal buffers, and achieve
sustainable and broad-based growth.
Directors recommended a further tightening of monetary policy to help address the risks
stemming from rapid credit growth. Quasi-fiscal lending to local governments should be phased
out, and the pace of monetary expansion reduced through sterilization and higher reserve
requirements. Directors also encouraged the authorities to strengthen the monetary policy
framework and avoid pursuing multiple policy objectives. Moving to an explicit inflation target
range in the medium term would help enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy and anchor
inflation expectations. Directors stressed the importance of replenishing international reserves,
to be supported by tightening macroeconomic policies and taking advantage of the prospective
large capital inflows.
Directors emphasized the need to strengthen banking supervision to maintain financial sector
stability. Improving the regulatory and prudential toolkit will ensure the quality of credit amid
financial deepening. They encouraged the authorities to participate in the Financial Sector
Assessment Program in due course, and welcomed the efforts underway to address the
shortcomings in the Anti- Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)
regime.
Directors welcomed the commitment to prudent fiscal policy and to build buffers to deal with
future shocks. They encouraged the authorities to exercise restraint in civil service wage
increases which could crowd out higher priority spending. Directors recommended anchoring

3
fiscal goals around the nonmining deficit. They welcomed the establishment of the State
Accumulation Fund sourced by excess revenues and underspending, which will strengthen the
ability of the budget to respond to future shocks. Directors recognized the improved debt
sustainability assessment and called for further strengthening of the debt management
framework and maintaining prudent borrowing policies.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ reform efforts to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth.
Improvements in the business climate, under the umbrella of WTO accession and the ASEAN
Free Trade Agreement, will be key to enhancing competitiveness in the nonresource sector,
while stepped up efforts to strengthen public financial management will create more space for
high impact spending. Directors also noted the importance of improving the quality of data. They
agreed that technical assistance by the Fund would support the authorities’ reform agenda.

Statement by Mrs. Aida Budiman, Alternate Executive Director for Lao P.D.R. and
Mr. Soulysak Thamnuvong, Advisor to Executive Director
August 31, 2012
1. As always, Lao authorities appreciate the constructive policy discussions and
valuable advice provided by the Mission Team during the 2012 Article IV
consultation. This year’s Article IV consultation was particularly important due to
the fact that Lao PDR concluded its second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)
for 2011-2015 which culminated into the adoption of the Seventh National Socio
Economic Development Plan (NSEDP). Given the need to reduce poverty and
achieve the objectives of the other MDGs by 2015 as well as to exit from the country
status as Least Developed Country (LDC) by 2020, the authorities share the focus of
the discussion on maintaining macroeconomic and financial stability while building
the foundations for more broad-based growth.
Recent Economic Development and Outlook
2. Lao PDR performed better-than-expected during the sixth NSEDP or the first PRSP
with annual average economic growth reaching 7.9 percent, as against the target of
7.5 percent. The poverty headcount was dropped from 46 percent in 1992/93 to
28 percent in 2007/08 and is expected to attain the related MDG target of 25 percent
by 2015. Nevertheless, the authorities noted that there are some remaining issues and
multiple challenges in meeting the MDGs, as also pointed out in the Joint Staff
Advisory Note (JSAN). These remaining issues and challenges being addressed in
the second PRSP. Reflecting the authorities’ strong commitment to tackle poverty
issues, the second PRSP places poverty eradication as one of the main strategic
orientations. The Plan also focuses on macroeconomic stability and promoting
inclusive and sustainable private sector led growth and regional integration, as well as
sets ambitious but achievable targets and objectives. It sets the goal of attaining a
GDP growth rate of at least 8 percent annually to allow a GDP per capita level of at
least US$1,700 by 2015.
3. Despite the global uncertainty and domestic challenges, the economy continued to
achieve a vibrant GDP growth of 8.0 percent in 2011, which is the first year of
implementation of the second PRSP. The economic expansion was propelled by the
industrial sector, particularly mining, electricity and manufacturing, and the services
sector. Economic growth is expected to remain robust in 2012 reaching 8.3 percent
on the strength of the expected recovery in agricultural and construction sector as
well as appropriate policy mix. The favorable economic performance is expected to
be sustained over the medium-term in line with the targets of the seventh NSEDP.
4. After peaking at 9.8 percent (y/y) in April 2011, the CPI Inflation has trended down
reaching 7.6 percent in 2011 and 2.9 percent in July 2012. This favorable
development was owed to abated pressures from domestic agricultural supply shocks
caused by flooding brought by Nokten and Haima storms, and easing of global oil
and commodities prices. At the same time, some policy tightening was put in place to

address inflationary expectations. Inflation is projected to average 5.1 percent in
2012, which is in line with the Bank of the Lao PDR’s (BOL) target. The Kip
exchange rate remains stable. After recording normal fluctuation against the US$ and
Baht in 2011, Kip has depreciated against the US dollar by 0.07 percent, and
appreciated against the Baht by 4.7 percent during the first semester 2012.
Meanwhile the international reserve level has improved steadily and expected to be
higher by the end of 2012.
5. The authorities continue to consider fiscal consolidation as a priority. The overall
fiscal deficit moderated to 3.0 percent of GDP in FY11 from 4.6 percent of GDP in
FY10, due to expenditure restraint and buoyant mining and hydropower revenues,
while VAT revenue over-performed. The authorities expect the overall budget deficit
to narrow to 2.5 percent of GDP in FY12 and maintain this level of deficit over the
medium term. Credit growth has also slowed down markedly from 90.7 percent in
2009 to 44.5 percent in April 2012; Credit growth is expected to decelerate further to
about 32 percent by the end of year. Given the rise in credit growth, albeit at a
decelerating pace, the authorities continuously strengthen prudential regulation and
banking supervision. Another notable progress was in the area of external debt
sustainability which concluded that Lao PDR has been upgraded from a high risk to a
moderate risk of debt distress country. This is due to the strong economic
performance and continued improvement in public debt management by the
authorities.
6. The authorities remain committed to pursue structural reforms and mobilize foreign
investments. The broad-based and sustained economic growth underpinned by
domestic and external macroeconomic stability is key in raising general living
standards, achieving further progress in poverty reduction, and meeting the MDGs
goals. This is the principal objective that guides the authorities in formulating and
implementing their policies to deliver the greatest benefit for the Lao people. They
noted that this year’s discussions have contributed greatly in helping the authorities
evaluate the appropriateness of their strategy and have provided valuable inputs for
improvement.
Fiscal Policy
7. The authorities are committed to continue fiscal consolidation through continued tax
reform and improved customs administration, as well as public finance management.
The authorities’ performance in fiscal consolidation has been encouraging as reflected
by the continued moderation in fiscal deficit and firm commitment to maintain a
2.5 percent of GDP deficit level over the medium term.
8. The authorities view that an increase in the civil service wage bill in FY12 needs to
be implemented since the wage freeze had been in effect for several years. The
adjustment is important not only to compensate the increased cost of living but also to
contribute to public governance improvement and provide incentive for civil servants
to prevent brain-drain. Noting the unintended consequences of this action, the
authorities commit to carefully monitor spending so as not to overcrowd other

important expenditures and coordinate with related ministries to mitigate its impact
on inflation.
9. Realizing the need to build fiscal room, the authorities have established the State
Accumulation Fund (SAF) this year, which will be managed under a new State
Revenue Department of the MOF. The resources of SAF will be sourced from fiscal
saving, either from revenue over-performance including higher share of mining
revenue or from under-spending. The funds from SAF will be used for unforeseen
circumstances, such as natural disasters or counter cyclical policies.
10. The authorities are of the view that public sector debt is well managed. Financing is
important to deliver the PRSP goal for the economy but it has been done in prudent
manner. Public debt in terms of GDP is expected to decline gradually and the
country’s risk of debt distress has been reclassified from high to moderate. The
authorities welcome and note that the improved debt distress rating will have
important implications for Lao PDR’s borrowing capacity. In particular, it is
expected that the overall envelope of external resources available to the country could
potentially increase to meet the country’s increasing financial needs for socioeconomic development. In terms of debt reporting system, the authorities are
currently in the process of finalizing the Debt Management and Financial Analysis
System (DMFAS). The DMFAS will enable the authorities to record public debt data
accurately and in a timely manner, including the disbursement schedule. The system
is currently in the final stage of data entries and planned to be effective by the end of
this year. The UNCTAD mission is scheduled to verify and validate the system by
mid-September 2012.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
11. Monetary policy has been geared to achieve and maintain price stability. The
authorities believe that the current monetary policy settings are generally
appropriate. While authorities recognize that there are still room to improve the
efficiency of open market operations and liquidity forecasting, they stressed that in
the conduct of monetary management they always take into account liquidity
condition and the Kip exchange rate movement. They note the staff’s advice to
contain the expansion of the central bank net domestic assets (NDA) by accelerating
the exit from quasi-fiscal lending. In fact, since the beginning of last year the BOL
has restrained its quasi-fiscal lending by providing loans only for a few necessary and
productive projects to improve the domestic supply of goods, with decreasing amount
in the period ahead. Likewise, BOL’s loan to local governments is expected to be
gradually phased out.
12. In the current framework setting, the BOL securities are considered as the most
efficient instrument in conducting monetary policy. It also plays an important role to
promote interbank operations and help liquidity management in the banking system in
the Lao context. The BOL takes note of staff’s recommendation on issuing additional
BOL securities but will consider carefully on implementation. Taking into account

the current condition, the BOL views that an increase in the reserve requirement ratio
is the last resort to be considered. Over the medium-term, the authorities indicated
that an implicit inflation target range will be considered once the monetary policy
framework is sufficiently strengthened.
13. The authorities continue pursuing a managed floating exchange rate regime as the
main instrument to maintain monetary stability. In this regard, the authorities
appreciate staff’s assessment on exchange rate policy that a stabilized exchange rate
regime remains the appropriate monetary anchor since this regime has contributed
greatly to overall macroeconomic and financial stability as well as promoting the
greater use of Kip. The BOL continues to promote active FX interbank market
operations and further liberalize foreign exchange policy. This liberalization aims at
reinforcing public confidence and eliminating the FX parallel market eventually.
14. The authorities shared the importance of building the reserve level to improve the
policy room. However, the authorities believe that recent international reserves
coverage remains sufficient based on their measurement of imports. They have a
fruitful discussion with staff on the appropriate measurement of imports and found
scope for further improvement in this regard. With the strong prospect of FDI and
ODA, including the plan to sell land titles valued in foreign exchange by the end of
2012, it is expected that the international reserves coverage level will further improve.
Financial and Banking Issues
15. With the current rapid expansion of financial sector, the authorities remain committed
to strengthening supervision to support financial soundness. Currently, the banking
condition remains sound with adequate capital, low NPL and regular banking
supervision/examination. The BOL is well aware of keeping the pace of
strengthening prudential regulations and supervisions in line with the financial
development. They have taken steps to safeguard financial sector soundness by
increasing the minimum capital adequacy ratio from 8 to 12 percent and issuing a
new regulation on loan classification and provision requirement. The authorities are
more optimistic on credit growth as it is reflective of a welcome financial deepening
process (credit over GDP ratio has increased from 23 percent in 2009 to 39 percent in
2012) and accompanied by proper prudential regulation and continued improvement
on banking supervision. They see the important role of FSAP in guiding a sound and
rigorous financial sector development but would like to concentrate on improving
data and other necessary condition before launching to that stage.
16. To address the shortcomings in the AML/CFT indentified in the 2011 evaluation by
APG, an AML/CFT law is currently being drafted. In this regard, the authorities have
requested and expect valuable inputs from the Fund before submitting the draft law to
the National Assembly (NA) by the end of year.

Structural Reforms
17. The authorities have accelerated structural reforms to help improve business climate
and build broad-based and inclusive growth. Commitments under the AFTA and the
prospect of WTO accession had led to significant revisions of laws and the regulatory
regime. Progress has been made in streamlining business registration procedures and
preparing the investment promotion law; trade-related legislation is expected to be
approved by the NA in September; the WTO accession would be finalized by end2012. These could help enhance competitiveness and diversify the economic growth
engine.
18. In conjunction with these efforts, the authorities continue working on modernizing
and upgrading the quality and availability of economic and financial data. The
statistics law and the statistics strategy for 2010-2020 are now in place, while the
implementing decree passed in the Government meeting. This decree has been
further amended and will be submitted to the Ministry of Justice for consideration and
approval. Currently, the National Statistics Bureau is in a process of forming its team
to work with the World Bank to launch a Lao statistics project, which will include
4 main components: (i) improvement of regulatory framework and other related
regulations, (ii) enhancement of basic infrastructure of the statistics, (iii) development
of data collection and analysis, and (iv) ICT system upgrade.
19. In addition, the BOL has recently accepted to participate in the project on the
improvement of external sector statistics in the Asia Pacific region, which is the first
project that will be held at the newly established TA office for Lao PDR and
Myanmar in Bangkok.
Conclusion
20. The authorities continue to show their strong commitment to pursue the
macroeconomic and financial stability while delivering a more inclusive growth for
the economy guided by the seventh national socio-economic plan 2011-2015. That
said, they understand that there would be an arduous road to achieve the goals stated
in the Plan. Moreover, some goals will need longer-term to yield the benefits. They
acknowledge that these goals are important to accelerate economic development and
deliver a better and inclusive welfare for the Lao people. Thus, the authorities
appreciate the Fund’s continuous engagement, timely advice and policy
recommendations. They also call for appropriate technical assistance from the Fund
in various areas. They look forward to enhancing the already productive and warm
relationship with the Fund and the international community in the near future.
