September 29, 2006
•

A mission visited The Gambia June 8–21, 2006, to conduct the 2006 Article IV consultation
and to assess performance under the country’s staff-monitored program (SMP). A previous
mission (February 27–March 12, 2006) assessed SMP performance against targets set for
December 2005. The teams comprised Mr. Tsikata (head), Mr. Srour, Mr. Sriram,
Mr. Veyrune (February mission), Mr. Gilmour (June mission), and Mr. Tyaba (June
mission), all from AFR. Mr. Gakunu (Alternate Executive Director) participated in some
discussions during the February mission, and Ms. Lephoto (Advisor to the Executive
Director) participated in both missions.

•

The missions met with the Secretary of State for Finance and Economic Affairs, the
Governor of the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG), the Attorney-General, other senior
government officials, the speaker and members of the Public Accounts Committee of the
national assembly, and representatives of business, civil society, and donors.

•

Political tensions have been rising since late March 2006, when the government announced
that it had foiled a coup plot. President Jammeh was re-elected to a third term on
September 22, 2006. He came to power in a coup in 1994 and won elections in 1996 and
2001. Parliamentary and local government elections are scheduled for early 2007.

•

The Gambia has a de facto managed floating exchange rate system. It accepted the
obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4, of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement
on January 21, 1993. There are no restrictions on making payments for current international
transactions.

•

Mr. Segura-Ubiergo has been appointed the Fund’s Resident Representative to The Gambia
and Senegal with effect from September 20, 2006. He will be based in Dakar.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Macroeconomic stability was sustained in 2005 and the first half of 2006. Real
GDP grew by 5 percent in 2005, year-on-year inflation has been about 2 percent since
June 2005, and interest rates have fallen, though they remain high in real terms. The
external current account widened in 2005 but increased capital inflows contributed to
a slight appreciation of the dalasi in nominal and real effective terms. The net present
value (NPV) of external debt was estimated at 312 percent of exports at the end of
2005, well above The Gambia’s policy-related indicative sustainable threshold of
100 percent.

•

Performance under a Staff-Monitored Program (SMP) spanning October 2005–
March 2006 was satisfactory. All structural benchmarks were implemented, albeit a
few with a delay. In particular, guidelines and procedures to strengthen internal
controls at the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) are being implemented.
Performance against quantitative targets was mixed; fiscal targets for December 2005
were missed, but on a cumulative basis all targets for the end of March 2006 were
met.

•

Consolidating macroeconomic stability, achieving debt sustainability, and
enhancing the country’s external competitiveness were the principal themes in
policy discussions. Expenditure pressures are the main risk to the short-term outlook.
Because spending on an African Union (AU) summit held in Banjul in July was
higher than budgeted, staff emphasized the importance of avoiding extrabudgetary
spending in the lead up to elections—presidential in September and parliamentary
and local in early 2007—if the government’s domestic borrowing is to be contained
and fiscal room left to increase poverty-reducing and growth-promoting expenditures.
Discussions on growth and poverty reduction covered investment climate issues that
need to be addressed to enhance The Gambia’s external competitiveness and
prospects for benefiting from regional integration initiatives.

•

Recent political events cloud the outlook. Several soldiers and civilians are on trial
for treason related to an alleged coup plot in March 2006. In June 2006, the
Millennium Challenge Corporation of the United States suspended The Gambia’s
eligibility for assistance, citing, among other factors, evidence of human rights abuses
and increased government restrictions on political parties and press freedom.

•

The authorities are eager for a new PRGF arrangement so as to make progress
toward the completion point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
Initiative. The HIPC completion point triggers could be satisfied by mid-2007 if
good performance is sustained.

4
•

The authorities and Fund staff have held preliminary discussions on structural
reforms that could be incorporated into a new PRGF-supported program. The
areas of emphasis identified were strengthening public financial management and
accountability, enhancing CBG operational independence and internal controls, better
aligning PRSP priorities with budget execution, and tackling data deficiencies that
currently hinder economic analysis, policy formulation, and performance monitoring.

5

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The Gambia is at a crossroad in its economic development. Though over the past
two and a half years the authorities have succeeded in achieving macroeconomic stability,
the economy remains highly vulnerable to exogenous and policy-induced shocks. In recent
years, shocks have included drought, a sharp depreciation of the exchange rate, disruptions to
groundnut marketing arrangements, and closure of the borders with Senegal. To build on the
recent stabilization, the authorities need to make a decisive long-term commitment to a
reform agenda that will promote growth and reduce poverty. Such an agenda should include
strengthening governance and accountability in public finances and at the central bank, a
deepening of the financial system, and improving the investment climate to foster private
sector development.
2.
A combination of exogenous shocks, fiscal slippages, and accommodating
monetary policy derailed The Gambia’s last PRGF-supported program soon after it
was approved in 2002. In 2003, staff discovered that data had been misreported to the Fund
under the 1998–2001 Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF)/PRGF arrangement,
and a Safeguards Assessment undertaken by the Fund revealed questionable audit practices
and a breakdown in internal controls at the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG). Following
delays in implementing measures specified by Fund staff to address the weaknesses revealed
by the Safeguards Assessment, the PRGF arrangement expired in July 2005 without a single
review being completed.1
3.
The authorities’ response to policy recommendations in the 2005 Article IV
consultation has been generally positive (Box 1), and they successfully completed an
SMP spanning October 2005–March 2006.2 They are eager for a new PRGF arrangement
so that they can make progress toward the completion point under the Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) initiative and benefit from debt relief under both the Enhanced HIPC
initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). The results of a debt
sustainability analysis undertaken as part of the Article IV consultation indicate that the
country is currently debt distressed—with all the key debt and debt service indicators well
above indicative thresholds—and stress tests suggest that it will remain at modest risk of debt
distress even after MDRI relief.

1

The specific measures included re-audits of the CBG’s 2001 and 2002 financial statements and a special audit
of CBG foreign exchange transactions during 2000-03.

4.
Given recent political events and forthcoming elections, staff pointed out the
potential adverse effects of political developments on the country’s economic prospects.
In particular, donors are concerned about political governance issues. In June 2006, the
Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) of the United States suspended The Gambia’s
eligibility for assistance, citing among other factors, human rights abuses and increased
restrictions on political parties and press freedom.
Box 1. The Authorities’ Response to the 2005 Article IV Consultation Recommendations
•

The authorities curtailed discretionary expenditures in the second half of 2005, but were
unable to offset completely the impact of extrabudgetary expenditures early in the year.

•

The retail prices of petroleum products were raised in July 2005 and again in January
2006 to curtail subsidies and shore up government revenues. The authorities review prices
every month and adjust them when warranted to avoid budget subsidies for these products in
the aggregate. The price of kerosene is cross-subsidized by premium petrol and diesel prices.

•

The authorities have made good progress in implementing an Action Plan to strengthen
internal controls at the CBG. The plan approved by the CBG Board in July 2005 reflected
recommendations of new external auditors and of the Fund’s Safeguards Assessment.

•

A new Act aimed at strengthening the operational independence of the CBG was passed
by the national assembly in December 2005; the president gave his assent in January
2006.

•

The government took some steps to strengthen public financial management and to
enhance transparency and accountability in the budget process. Regulations to
operationalize the Government Budget Management and Accountability Act (2004) are being
implemented. A commitment control system has been introduced on a pilot basis with Fund
technical assistance.

•

The monopoly of the Gambian Agricultural Marketing Corporation (GAMCO) in
purchasing groundnuts was broken, but other reforms in the groundnut sector have
stalled. A government decision to increase substantially the financial requirement for
licensing groundnut buyers/operators led to the then-new GAMCO monopolizing crop
purchases and processing in the 2004/05 season. For the 2005/06 season, five operators were
licensed, including the Gambia Groundnut Corporation (GGC) which previously had been
limited to providing storage and transportation services. The authorities have fallen behind in
their schedule to privatize GGC (a HIPC completion point trigger).

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE SMP
A. Recent Economic Developments
5.
The macroeconomic environment has improved significantly over the last few years
and was again favorable in the first half of 2006 (Figure 1, Table 1).
•

•

In spite of large adverse terms of
trade movements, real GDP
growth rebounded from a
drought-induced decline in 2002
to an annual average of
5.7 percent per year for 2003-05
(Table 1), outpacing average
annual population growth
(estimated at 2.8 percent). Growth
was broad-based, led by
agriculture, construction, hotels
and restaurants, and
communications (Table 2).

•

Though treasury bill yields and banks’ lending rates have fallen, they are still
very high in real terms, reflecting high levels of government domestic borrowing in
the past, and more recently the CBG’s cautious approach to lowering its rediscount
rate. The CBG reduced the rediscount rate gradually from 33 percent at the end of
2004 to 15 percent in May 2006. In the government securities market, the average
yield on treasury bills fell from 30 percent at the end of December 2004 to 16 percent
at the end of December 2005 and to 14.5 percent at the end of June 2006. The lending
rates of commercial banks have declined more slowly; prime rates were reported to
be around 19 percent in June 2006.

The fiscal adjustment

effort slackened in 2005
compared to 2004 (Figure 2,
Table 3). After registering a
surplus of 2.4 percent of GDP in
2004, the basic balance—a
proxy for the domestic fiscal
effort—was near balance in
2005, reflecting lower customs
revenues and higher domestic
interest payments.3 A two-month
closure of the border with
Senegal pushed customs
revenues down, and high
domestic debt at the end of 2004
resulted in a substantial increase in domestic interest payments.

Interest payments are taking a heavy toll. In 2005, interest payments accounted for
47 percent of current expenditure (43 percent of domestic revenue). In the main, domestic
interest payments (about 80 percent of total interest payments) represent the yields on
treasury bills which, in The Gambia, are used for both government financing and monetary
operations. The larger fiscal deficit and a relatively tight monetary stance increased domestic
debt from 33 percent of GDP at the end of 2004 to 36 percent of GDP at the end of 2005.4

3

The basic balance is defined as domestic revenues minus total expenditure and net lending, excluding
externally financed capital spending.
4

Monetary operations to sterilize the impact of foreign capital inflows accounted for most of the build up in
domestic public debt in 2004.

10
8.
PRSP-related spending in 2005 fell short of budget estimates. A public
expenditure review update led by the World Bank found that PRSP-related expenditures
accounted for 24 percent of domestically financed expenditures in 2005, compared to a
budgeted 30 percent. Within PRSP-related expenditures, agriculture and health had the
largest shortfalls; the education sector was reasonably well protected.
9.
The external current account deficit (including official transfers) widened
significantly from 5 percent of GDP in 2003 to about 15 percent in 2005 (Table 8). This
reflected a higher oil bill and increases in non-oil imports for externally financed projects. In
addition, groundnut exports collapsed in 2005 as a result of failures in internal marketing
arrangements; changes in licensing requirements removed the most established operator from
the scene and breakdowns in GGC barges slowed transportation of the crop to processing
plants. A bright spot in the current account was strong growth in tourism earnings; tourist
arrivals rose by more than 20 percent in 2005. The current account deficit was financed by
increased inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) and official concessional loans. The
ratio of nominal external debt to GDP fell from 145 percent at the end of 2004 to 136 percent
at the end of 2005.
10.
The dalasi has appreciated modestly in nominal and real effective terms after
massive depreciations in 2001-03 (Figure 3). The appreciation reflects the tightening of
monetary policy and increased inflows of remittances, transfers, and FDI. The economy has
stayed relatively

B. Performance Under the SMP
11.
The principal purpose of the SMP was to help the authorities reestablish a policy
track record.5 In line with the approach endorsed by the Board during the 2005 Article IV
consultation discussion, the SMP sought to strengthen internal controls and the operational
independence of the CBG, enhance public financial management and accountability, and
begin to make progress toward fiscal sustainability. Overall performance under the SMP
was satisfactory.
12.
Performance against structural benchmarks was strong (Table 9). The CBG
made notable progress in strengthening its internal controls by instituting guidelines and
procedures to strengthen accounting practices and controls in the management of
international reserves. Quarterly audits of selected accounts undertaken by external auditors
did not identify any significant discrepancies between accounting records and data reported
to the Fund for program monitoring purposes. Furthermore, the CBG is now up to date with
its audited financial statements, and the authorities are addressing remaining areas of
weakness highlighted by the external auditors (e.g., violations of statutory limits on advances
to government, and the central bank’s negative equity position).6 Some steps have also been
taken to improve public financial management and accountability, including submission of
government accounts for 2000 and 2001 to the Auditor-General for audit, and formulation of
guidelines for closing below-the-line accounts.7 The coverage and timeliness of data
reporting have also improved.
13.
Performance against quantitative targets was mixed at the first test date
(December 2005), but improved in the second half of the program (Table 10). The two
fiscal targets (on net domestic borrowing and the basic balance) for December 2005 were
missed, due to a shortfall in revenues attributable to a two-month closure of the border with
Senegal. There was a marked improvement in fiscal performance in the first quarter of 2006,
which enabled the authorities to meet the fiscal targets on a cumulative basis through
March 2006.

Audits of the accounts for 2003, 2004, and 2005 were completed in October 2005, February 2006, and June
2006, respectively.

The Public Accounts Committee of the national assembly held public hearings in October 2005 to discuss the
Auditor-General’s report on the accounts for the 1992–99 fiscal years.

12
III. REPORT ON POLICY DISCUSSIONS
14.
The discussions were organized around four main themes: consolidating
macroeconomic stability; achieving public and external debt sustainability; promoting
growth and reducing poverty; and steps toward a possible new PRGF arrangement.
Staff and the authorities also reviewed progress in implementing the HIPC completion point
triggers.
A. Consolidating Macroeconomic Stability
15.
The authorities and staff agreed that the most pressing macroeconomic
challenge is to rebalance the policy mix to help bring down real interest rates. The
authorities noted that high interest payments were crowding out priority PRSP-related
expenditures and that high real interest rates had limited commercial bank lending to the
private sector, with adverse consequences for private investment and growth. The discussions
highlighted fiscal and monetary policies and related structural reforms needed to achieve
updated medium-term objectives.

The medium-term projections are driven by the twin objectives of making
progress toward external sustainability, and limiting the government’s domestic
borrowing requirement in order to put downward pressure on interest rates and create
fiscal space for increasing growth-promoting and poverty-reducing spending. Fiscal
adjustment contributes substantially to the envisaged adjustment in the external current
account, especially in the first few years. However, the evolution of The Gambia’s external
current account deficit is influenced largely by the availability of official external financing
and private capital inflows (mainly FDI), hence external sustainability requires focusing
more on the burden of external debt and debt service, than on the size of the current account
deficit per se. The baseline scenario assumes that The Gambia will reach the HIPC
completion point around mid-2007, but does not incorporate the impact of MDRI debt relief
on the government budget. It was agreed that discussions on the use of such relief would
await the completion of the new PRSP; they could take place at the time of discussions on a
possible new PRGF arrangement.
17.
Assumptions and objectives underlying the updated macroeconomic framework
(Tables 1–8) are:
•

Average annual real GDP growth will be about 5 percent.

•

Annual inflation will be in the range of 3–4 percent.

•

The fiscal deficit (including grants) will be reduced from 8.6 percent of GDP in 2005
to 0.6 percent in 2011.

13
•

The ratio of domestic public debt to GDP is projected to fall from 36 percent at the
end of 2005 to about 24 percent in 2011. The pace of the reduction in the first two
years takes into account the authorities’ commitment to clear domestic expenditure
arrears estimated at 3.7 percent of GDP.

•

The external current account deficit (including official transfers) will be reduced from
14.5 percent of GDP in 2005 to 7.4 percent of GDP in 2011.

•

International reserves will be maintained at the equivalent of about four months of
import cover.

18.
The projected reduction in the external current account deficit reflects more
official transfers and lower trade deficits. The adjustment path maps a large reduction in
the deficit between 2005 and 2007 driven by a boost in official transfers and recovery in
groundnut exports. The increase for 2008–11 is more modest because official transfers taper
off. Part of the increase in official transfers is associated with a switch in the composition of
official external financing for projects from loans to grants which is expected to occur when
The Gambia reaches HIPC completion point.8 In addition, it is assumed that there will be a
modest increase in available external financing as donors provide support to a new MDGbased PRSP expected to be completed in 2006. International reserves are projected to remain
at the equivalent of about four months of import cover, on the assumption of strong FDI
inflows and HIPC debt relief.
19.
The projected improvement in the fiscal balance reflects a substantial increase in
grants, lower interest payments, and an increase in revenues. As mentioned, part of the
increase in grants reflects a change in the composition of external financing. The decline in
domestic interest payments assumes a steady fall in the average interest rate from 19 percent
in 2005 to 15 percent in 2006 and 10 percent in 2009, premised on an improving
macroeconomic environment and lower domestic borrowing by the government. Savings
from declining interest payments over the projection period are used to boost povertyreducing expenditures.9 The bulk of the improvement in revenues occurs in 2006, reflecting
revenue-enhancing measures, equivalent to about 2 percent of GDP, that were introduced in
the budget.10

8

The World Bank and the African Development Bank are expected to provide more grants and less loans to
The Gambia.

9

Most of poverty-reducing expenditures fall under the category of “other charges” in the government accounts
(Table 3). The decline in other charges observed in 2007 reflects the exceptional expenditures on the AU
summit incurred in 2006.

10

The measures included increases in the pump price of petroleum products and in license fees on
telecommunication operators, an increase in the sales tax on non-oil imported goods from 10 percent to
(continued)

14
20.
Monetary policy will target an expansion in broad money slightly above the
growth rate of nominal GDP over the medium term. Low inflation is expected to boost
the demand for money and steady fiscal consolidation should allow average interest rates to
fall, stimulating credit to the private sector.
Fiscal policy and related structural reforms
21.
The updated fiscal projections for 2006 suggest a greater adjustment effort
compared to 2005, but significant shortfalls when compared to the 2006 budget
(Table 3). The authorities provided staff with estimates of the cost to the budget of The
Gambia hosting the African Union (AU) summit that took place in Banjul during June 25–
July 2, 2006; the estimate amounted to 2.1 percent of GDP, more than twice the provision
approved in the budget (0.8 percent of GDP). It appears that most of the expenditures on the
summit had been incurred by the time of the Article IV mission, with modes of financing that
included borrowing from parastatals at no interest (to be fully repaid by the end of 2007) and
drawing down a government deposit abroad. Other commitments the authorities were
proposing to honor in the second half of 2006 and beyond included equity contributions to a
regional bank and to a subsidiary of the Islamic Development Bank, clearance of expenditure
arrears, and capitalization of the CBG. The authorities did not foresee needing to provide
additional budgetary resources for the forthcoming general elections. They expected that the
amount approved in the budget (0.9 percent of GDP) would be supplemented by
contributions from donors through a basket funding arrangement coordinated by UNDP.
22.
Total expenditures for 2006 are now projected at 27.7 percent of GDP,
compared to the budget estimate of 26.4; a difference which is roughly equivalent to the
extra spending on the AU summit. The authorities proposed the sale of assets (including
cars purchased for the AU summit) to partially finance the extra spending, and were willing
to discuss new revenue measures and cuts in the recurrent budget to achieve the budget
targets. In the view of staff, it was unrealistic to expect positive results from new measures;
extensive revenue measures were introduced in the 2006 budget, and the discretionary budget
was already severely constrained. Rather, staff suggested that because of the one-off nature
of the expenditures associated with the AU summit, it would be preferable to allow slightly
higher domestic borrowing. However, staff noted that this would have the effect of slowing
down the effort to reduce domestic debt and put upward pressure on interest rates. The
authorities and staff agreed on a revised outlook that calls for a 1.5 percent of GDP surplus in
the basic balance in 2006, compared to the target of 3 percent of GDP in the budget.
Domestic borrowing is now expected to amount to 2.5 percent of GDP, roughly 1 percentage
point higher than initially budgeted.
15 percent to make it the same as the domestic sales tax, and an increase in duties on certain goods from
18 percent to 20 percent to conform with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
common external tariff agreement.

15
23.
Domestic interest payments are projected to drop from 7 percent of GDP in 2005
to about 5 percent of GDP in 2006, mainly on account of the lower yields on treasury bills
observed since the second half of 2005. Gross domestic debt is also projected to fall in
relation to GDP from 35.5 percent at the end of 2005 to about 33 percent at the end of 2006.
This partly reflects an agreement between the Department of State for Finance and Economic
Affairs (DoSFEA) and the CBG for the government to pay off half of a long-term
government loan to the CBG by drawing down the sterilization account at the CBG into
which proceeds of treasury bill auctions are deposited.
24.
Staff expressed concern about a lack of information on extrabudgetary spending
financed by external grants. The authorities were unable to provide an estimate of grants
received from friendly countries toward defraying the cost of hosting the AU summit; they
said they had received considerable assistance in kind. Staff noted that the difficulty in
providing information pointed to an important weakness in the coverage of budget reports,
and urged the authorities to redouble their effort to establish a central project management
and aid coordination directorate at DoSFEA with responsibilities that will include compiling
comprehensive information on aid flows into the country and the uses to which the resources
are intended to be put.
25.
Failure to maintain fiscal discipline poses the greatest risk to the medium-term
outlook. In particular, over-commitments (e.g., on externally financed projects that require
substantial local counterpart contributions), expenditure overruns, and extrabudgetary
expenditures risk further accumulation of domestic arrears and/or increased domestic
borrowing. Under such circumstances, the projected increase in fiscal space stemming from
lower debt service would be unlikely to materialize. Staff also referred to anecdotal evidence
about quasi-fiscal activities of some public enterprises and indicated that transparent
reporting of such activities would be required as part of a possible new PRGF-supported
program.
26.
The authorities acknowledged that weaknesses in budget formulation and
execution have in the past led to large domestic payments arrears and fiscal slippages.
The arrears have reflected mainly inadequate provision in the budget for the government’s
contribution to projects financed by international development banks and donors. The
authorities informed staff that there has been progress in implementing an Integrated
Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) with the assistance of the World Bank.
However, in view of continuing uncertainty about when IFMIS will become fully
operational, staff urged the authorities to give high priority to extending the commitment
control system (introduced on a pilot basis in 2005) to all budget units. The authorities said
that more work was needed to sensitize stakeholders and to build capacity. They requested
continued technical assistance from the Fund’s regional fiscal adviser.

16
27.
Authorities and staff agreed on the need to improve the transparency and
timeliness of reporting on government operations. The authorities explained that they
were taking steps to clear the remaining backlog of unaudited government accounts; they
expect to submit accounts for 2002–04 to the Auditor-General by the end of 2006 and
accounts for 2005–06 by the end of 2007. They agreed that timely audited reports are
essential so that the national assembly can exercise its responsibilities to oversee public
finances.

The CBG uses a money targeting framework to pursue its price stability
objective, and uses its rediscount rate to signal changes in its policy stance. It sets an
intermediate target for growth in broad money (the nominal anchor of the system) and uses
reserve money as its operational target. The main instrument used by the CBG to influence
the path of reserve money is the issuance of treasury bills. A challenge for the CBG is to
ensure consistency between its weekly monetary operations (guided by a reserve money
path) and its

29.
Staff welcomed reductions in the CBG’s rediscount rate that occurred during
the first half of 2006 (from 19 percent at end-2005 to 15 percent in May 2006) which helped
remove the uncertainty that prevailed in the treasury bill market in the second half of 2005.
Staff agreed with the central bank that risks to the fiscal outlook for the second half of 2006
made it prudent to be cautious about the pace of further rate reductions. However, the CBG

11

Before the MPC became operational (July 2004), the rediscount rate was calculated as a fixed markup over
the market-determined treasury bill rate. The yield on the 91-day bill is widely perceived in the market as the
“benchmark” rate.

17
should be sensitive to the potential for conflict between its open-market operations and its
rediscount rate announcements.
30.
Though the financial sector in The Gambia is relatively sound, financial
intermediation remains low. The regulatory framework for the financial system was
strengthened in 2003 with the enactment of a new Financial Institutions Act, as well as new
laws on Insurance and Money Laundering. All the seven commercial banks in the country
have met a new minimum paid-up capital requirement.12 Profitability and liquidity ratios
remain high, but the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans increased slightly from
11 percent at the end of 2004 to 12 percent at the end of 2005 (Table 7). The loan-to-deposit
ratio remains relatively low (43 percent as of March 2006). The CBG and representatives of
the Bankers Association briefed staff about their ongoing discussions on aspects of the legal
system that discourage lending, and about plans to establish a credit reference bureau to
facilitate the lending process.
31.
A high degree of concentration and high profit ratios suggest that there may be
room for more competition in the banking system. Although there are seven banks in the
country, two of them account for over 70 percent of the sector’s total assets and three
quarters of deposits. Staff analysis of the factors that have contributed to the persistent wide
spread between banks’ lending and deposit rates identified three main factors—payoff to
shareholders, overhead costs, and the implicit costs of reserve and liquid asset requirements.13
The CBG informed staff that it has licensed two new banks that are expected to start
operations before the end of 2006, and expects that this would enhance competition in the
sector.
32.
Staff recommended that the CBG consider lowering the unremunerated
statutory reserve requirement from the current 18 percent, which is very high by
international standards. With inflation below 2 percent, the authorities and staff agreed that
there was scope for allowing more growth in reserve money to accommodate a gradual
reduction in reserve requirements. At worst, this might nudge the inflation rate upwards; but
it could also put downward pressure on treasury bill yields if the impact on lending is
negligible (e.g., for structural reasons).
B. Making Public and External Debt Sustainable
33.
At the end of 2005, the stock of external public debt stood at the equivalent of
136 percent of GDP. Four-fifths of this debt is owed to multilateral creditors, and the

12

remainder to bilateral creditors. Gross domestic debt amounted to 36 percent of GDP at the
end of 2005.
34.
The Gambia is currently debt distressed and is projected to remain at moderate
risk of debt distress even after MDRI relief. The mission shared with the authorities the
results of a preliminary draft of an external debt sustainability analysis (DSA) undertaken
jointly by staffs of the Fund and the World Bank (Appendix I).14 The country’s NPV of debtto-exports ratio, estimated at 312 percent at the end of 2005, is well above the policy-based
indicative threshold of 100 percent.15 Other key indicative thresholds are also breached in
2005; the NPV of debt–to-GDP ratio stood at 84 percent (substantially higher than the
threshold of 30 percent), and the debt service-to-export ratio was 21 percent (compared to a
threshold of 15 percent). The debt indicators fall below the thresholds under a scenario in
which The Gambia receives both HIPC and MDRI relief in 2007 (within three months of
reaching HIPC completion point). However, the thresholds are again breached under stress
testing, suggesting that there is still a moderate risk of debt distress. The stress tests indicate
that the Gambia’s debt sustainability is highly sensitive to export growth assumptions,
projections of nondebt creating inflows, and the terms of new borrowing. Preliminary
estimates indicate that MDRI stock relief from IDA, AfDB and the Fund reduce the NPV of
debt-to-export ratio from 212 percent to 93 percent in 2007.
35.
The outcome of the public debt sustainability analysis mirrored the results of the
external debt sustainability analysis as external debt accounts for the bulk of total public
debt. Under the baseline scenario, the NPV of public debt is projected to decline from about
121 percent of GDP in 2005 to about 78 percent of GDP in 2011 and to 46 percent in 2026.
In relation to domestic revenue, the NPV of public debt is projected to fall from about
564 percent in 2005 to 206 percent in 2026. Under the MDRI scenario, the ratio remains
above the indicative threshold (200 percent) through 2008 and then falls steadily to 169
percent in 2026. However, stress tests indicate a high risk of breaching the threshold.
36.
The continuing risk of debt distress indicated by the DSA highlights the
importance of nondebt creating flows (e.g., grants and foreign direct investment) for
The Gambia’s external and fiscal sustainability.

14
15

The DSA was refined and extended to cover domestic public debt after the mission.

This is the threshold for poorly performing low-income countries, the category in which The Gambia is
classified.

19
C. Promoting Growth and Reducing Poverty
Promoting growth
37.
Agriculture, tourism, and trade are the main sources of growth in The Gambia.
Groundnuts cultivation remains the mainstay of the agricultural sector (about one-third of
value-added), although its share has been declining. The tourism sector has fared very well in
recent years, growing at an annual average rate of 10 percent since 2002, and the rate of
growth is projected to remain healthy at 6–7 percent annually. The Gambia has traditionally
enjoyed a dynamic reexport trade sector that benefits from, among other things, competitive
tariffs and a port that is very efficient by regional standards.
38.
Discussions on policies to promote growth centered on competitiveness and
investment climate issues. The authorities and staff agreed that the exchange rate regime
and the current level of the exchange rate were both appropriate. The Gambia has a de facto
managed floating exchange rate system. Since 2004, the CBG’s intervention in the foreign
exchange market has been minimal and limited to purchases to maintain international
reserves at levels agreed with Fund staff (including under the SMP).16 Given the economy’s
susceptibility to real shocks—demonstrated by the pervasive influence of weather conditions
on agricultural output—a flexible exchange rate provides a useful adjustment mechanism.
39.
Staff analysis of the evolution of exchange-rate based indicators showed no
evidence of significant or persistent misalignment of the exchange rate.17 The analysis
also suggests that The Gambia’s flexible exchange rate regime has facilitated reasonably
rapid adjustment of the real exchange rate to conditions in Senegal which is an important
market for reexports, a source of some imports, and a competitor in the groundnut export
market.
40.
Regional commitments and a recent substantial increase in the sales tax on
imports may erode profitability in the reexport trade area. Staff discussed the likely
impact on reexport trade of The Gambia’s implementation of the ECOWAS common
external tariff (CET) in January 2006; this was accompanied by an increase in the sales tax
on imports from 10 percent to 15 percent to align it with the domestic sales tax.
Implementing the CET implies a 2 percentage point increase in the tariff rate on consumer
goods, which are the bulk of reexports. Together with the higher sales tax, this implies a
7 percentage point increase in applicable rates. This significant increase in costs to traders

16

CBG purchases of foreign currency accounted for about 6 percent and 4 percent of the market’s turnover in
2004 and 2005, respectively. CBG sales of foreign currency to the market was negligible in 2004 and nil in
2005.

17

See Selected Issues Paper on external competitiveness.

20
may adversely affect the reexport trade. Staff mentioned anecdotal evidence that imports of
textiles for reexport were already beginning to slow.
41.
The authorities acknowledged the possible adverse impact of the CET on
reexport trade, but stressed their belief that the potential benefits of greater regional
integration through ECOWAS outweigh the costs. In particular, given The Gambia’s
small population of about 1.5 million, the prospect of duty-free access to the whole
ECOWAS region, which has a population of 234 million, should stimulate investment, trade
and growth. Goods with a minimum of 35 percent value-added in the home country can be
exported duty-free within ECOWAS.
42.
Authorities and staff agreed on the importance of improving the investment
climate in order to promote private investment in export-oriented production and
employment. The authorities pointed out recent progress in implementing the World Bank
Gateway Project (which aims to help The Gambia develop alternative sources of trade in
such areas as the services sector and agribusiness), and taking measures to make the legal
system and infrastructure more investor-friendly. They also spoke of the recent strong growth
in investments in tourism, and, to a lesser degree, agriculture. While acknowledging recent
progress, staff referred the authorities to independent assessments on competitiveness and
investment climate that suggest The Gambia lags behind other countries in the region in
government effectiveness, the rule of law, and control of corruption.18
Reducing poverty
43.
Implementation of the PRSP has been uneven. The PRSP prepared in 2002
covered the period 2002–05. The authorities have prepared two annual progress reports
(APRs); one for 2002–03 and one for 2004. The second APR and a Joint Staff Advisory Note
(JSAN) were circulated to the Executive Boards of the Fund and the World Bank in June
2006.19 The APRs indicate some progress in increasing access to basic social services, but not
much progress in the divestiture and decentralization programs. The authorities noted that
implementation of the first PRSP had been hampered by several factors, including:
(i) capacity constraints; (ii) shortfalls in assistance from donors; (iii) a lack of clarity on
output targets and indicators; and (iv) an inadequate system for monitoring and evaluation.
They were hopeful that PRSP II which will include costed interventions required to meet the
MDGs, will receive more donor support than the first.
44.
Staff agreed with the authorities that PRSP implementation needs to be better
integrated into the budget process. The authorities highlighted the decreasing share of
poverty-reducing spending in the government budget as a major concern, and stressed the
18

See the discussion of investment climate issues in the Selected Issues Paper on external competitiveness.

19

IMF Country Report No. 6/397 (November 2006).

21
importance of additional fiscal space for reversing this trend. Staff suggested that reducing
interest payments offered the best prospect for increased fiscal space and that this meant
limiting the government’s resort to domestic borrowing. Furthermore, staff noted, there is
scope for better protecting poverty-reducing expenditures by limiting extra-budgetary
spending and better prioritizing non-PRSP expenditures.
45.
The authorities said that though The Gambia was not likely to meet the poverty
reduction target in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), it was likely to meet
some other goals, such as increasing primary school enrollment, improving maternal health,
increasing access to safe drinking water, and curtailing the spread of HIV/AIDS (Table 12).
D. Toward a Possible New PRGF Arrangement and HIPC Completion Point
46.
Authorities and staff agreed that, to the extent possible, the macroeconomic
framework underlying a possible new PRGF-supported program should be based on
the new PRSP now being prepared. Staff indicated that it would draw on results of “needs
assessment” exercises being undertaken by the authorities (with assistance from the U.N.
Millennium Project) if they are available at the time of program discussions.
47.
Authorities and staff held preliminary discussions on structural reforms that
could be included in a new PRGF-supported program. Areas of reform identified were:
(i) measures to strengthen public financial management and accountability, including a more
comprehensive coverage of government operations; (ii) progress on clearing the backlog of
unaudited government accounts; (iii) measures to further strengthen internal controls and
CBG operational independence; (iv) measures to improve the investment climate and
promote private sector development; and (v) actions to tackle data deficiencies that currently
hinder economic analysis, policy formulation, and performance monitoring. The authorities
said they would need technical assistance to make progress in most of these areas.
48.
The HIPC completion point triggers could be satisfied by mid-2007, the
authorities and Fund and World Bank staff agreed. The triggers are grouped under five
headings (Table 11). In two areas—poverty reduction and social sector reforms—the
conditions appear to have been met. In two others—macroeconomic stability and structural
reforms—the authorities have made solid progress toward meeting the conditions.20 There
has been slower progress in meeting the governance conditions, especially issuance of
reports on overall budget execution and on the use of HIPC interim relief.

20

The macroeconomic stability condition requires successful implementation of a PRGF-supported program for
at least six months and the completion of at least one program review.

22
IV. DATA AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ISSUES
49.

nominal GDP for 2003 that was slightly higher

doubts about the quality of the official estimates. Staff urged the authorities to speed up work
on using the results from the 2003 household expenditure survey to produce independent
estimates of gross domestic expenditure and to rebase the national accounts at constant
prices. The survey results should also be used to update the basket of goods and services used
for calculating the consumer price index (CPI).
50.
The authorities are taking steps to improve the quality of balance of payments
statistics along the lines recommended by STA. The CBG has revamped its balance of
payments unit, including allocating more staff to it. Several CBG staff benefited from Fund
balance of payments statistics training programs during 2005–06 and the CBG is shifting to
compiling balance of payments statistics according to the fifth edition of the Balance of
Payments Manual.
51.
The authorities expressed appreciation for the Fund’s technical assistance aimed
at strengthening capacity in the areas of economic management and compilation of
economic statistics. They highlighted in particular, assistance received from a regional fiscal
adviser, wide ranging assistance to the CBG from MFD, and assistance from STA to improve
the quality of balance of payments and monetary statistics. They requested a replacement for
the regional fiscal advisor who recently left the region.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
52.
Strengthening of macroeconomic polices since late 2003 has significantly
improved macroeconomic performance in The Gambia. Inflation has fallen to low singledigit levels and growth at over 5 percent a year has been respectable. However, poverty is
widespread and the economy is still vulnerable to exogenous and policy-induced shocks. The

23
Article IV discussions focused on the challenges of consolidating macroeconomic
stabilization while working to promote higher growth and reduce poverty.
53.
If the recent achievements are to have lasting effects, the authorities must avoid
the mistakes of the past, especially stop-go policies, and make a long-term commitment
to a reform agenda that will promote higher growth and reduce poverty. The agenda
should cover enhanced governance and accountability in public finances and at the central
bank, improvements in the investment climate to foster private sector development, a
judicious program to improve basic infrastructure, and better integration of PRSP priorities
into the budget process.
54.
The authorities are rightly concerned that high domestic interest payments have
crowded out poverty-reducing and growth-promoting spending, but must exercise fiscal
discipline to address this concern. In particular, to contain domestic borrowing, the
authorities need to avoid extrabudgetary expenditures and expenditure overruns in
nonpriority areas. The government also needs to pay more attention to the financing
constraint in the budget process and avoid over commitments that risk creating new domestic
arrears or unfavorable domestic debt dynamics. Staff urges the authorities that so long as
external financing evolves broadly as projected, they should aim to achieve the projected
surpluses on the fiscal basic balance (averaging 2.4 percent of GDP per year over the next
five years) in order to make progress towards reducing the domestic debt burden. Staff also
urges the authorities to give high priority to extending the commitment control system to all
spending units.
55.
While The Gambia has made some progress toward strengthening public
financial management and accountability, the authorities are correct that capacity
constraints have held back the pace of progress. Staff also agrees with the authorities that
there is a need for comprehensive civil service reform and supports their request for World
Bank assistance in this area.
56.
The CBG has made significant strides toward strengthening internal controls
and addressing the governance problems that contributed to serious policy lapses in the
early 2000s. Staff encourages the authorities to implement the new CBG Act, especially with
respect to limits on lending to the government.
57.
The current level of the exchange rate is appropriate, and the authorities are
right to focus on structural reforms and the investment climate so as to enhance The
Gambia’s external competitiveness. There is no evidence of significant or persistent
misalignment of the exchange rate. At the request of the authorities, the World Bank has
begun work that will be useful in formulation of a program for improving the investment
climate.
58.
Satisfactory performance under a six-month SMP has been followed by fiscal
slippages associated with hosting the AU summit. In view of the one-off nature of the

expenditure overruns, and progress made in fiscal adjustment compared to 2005, staff
believes that the impact of the slippages will be short-lived and that the fiscal situation can be
put back onto a sustainable path reasonably quickly. While recognizing the risk of further
slippages, staff believes that on balance, there is a basis for proceeding to discuss a new
PRGF arrangement with the authorities. The authorities are eager for a new PRGF
arrangement to help provide a framework for economic reforms and make progress toward
the HIPC completion point and securing debt relief. At the same time, however, the
authorities need to do more to achieve better alignment of the PRSP to budget execution and
to promote greater transparency and accountability in public finances.
59.
Going forward, the main risks to the medium-term outlook are failure to
maintain fiscal discipline, withholding of donor support on account of governance
problems, exogenous shocks, and capacity constraints. Following the fiscal slippage
associated with the hosting of the AU summit, further fiscal slippages that undermine the
objective of containing the government’s domestic borrowing would jeopardize efforts to
increase fiscal space for growth-promoting and poverty-reducing expenditures. The
suspension of The Gambia’s eligibility for assistance by the MCC underlines donors
sensitivity to governance issues; withholding of donor support would condemn PRSP II to
the same poor implementation fate as its predecessor. Improving the investment climate in
critical for sustaining recent increases in FDI and for diversifying The Gambia’s exports of
goods and services and thus reducing its vulnerability to shocks. Staff encourages the
authorities to continue to work closely with the World Bank on measures to improve the
investment climate.
60.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on a standard 12month cycle.

Excluding advances to the government in foreign currencies.

2

These advances reflect previously unrecorded public spending and borrowing in 2001, financed by the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG), and the previously unrecorded
depletion of foreign exchange reserves in 2001-03 as reported by the authorities on October 28, 2003.

3

In March 2003, the government instructed the CBG to lend the equivalent of D137 million in U.S. dollars to a newly created public enterprise for a seismic survey
of offshore oil deposits.

4

Measures
1. Poverty reduction
(i) A full PRSP has been prepared through a participatory process and satisfactorily
implemented for one year, as evidenced by the Joint Staff Assessment of the country’s
annual progress report.
(ii) Improvement of the poverty data base and monitoring capacity, as evidenced by
progress in restructuring the Central Statistics Department or developing its capacity.
2. Macroeconomic stability
Continued maintenance of macroeconomic stability as evidenced by satisfactory
implementation of the PRGF-supported program.
3. Governance
Progress in strengthening public expenditure management as evidenced by (i)the issuance
of annual public reports on budget execution; and (ii) semiannual reports on the use of
interim HIPC Initiative debt relief, the latter to be reviewed by the Task Force and High-Level
Economic Committee (HILEC).
4. Social sector reforms
(i) Budgetary savings from HIPC interim debt service will be used in accordance with the
annual budgets approved by the Task Force and the HILEC.

Status

(ii) In progress

Not met

(ii) Measures and targets regarding progress in implementing education and health reform
programs include:
(a) Increase by at least 45 percent (from 192 graduates in the base academic
year 2000/01) the number of teachers for lower basic education graduating from The
Gambia College; this measure will help The Gambia raise the quality of teaching in the most
important grades.

Met

(b) Ensure appropriate funding of a trust fund for girls’ scholarships in the poorest
regions and make progress in raising such rates by expanding this scholarship scheme to
no less than 2,000 girls annually in at least 3 regions.

Met

(c) Increase by at least 5 percent each year (from 44 percent in the base year
of 1998) the number of births attended by a person trained in antenatal care. This should
reduce the relatively high maternal death rate; monitoring mechanisms for this indicator
have also been defined in the Participatory Health, Population, and Nutrition Project
(PHPNP).

Met

(d) Increase the share of primary and secondary health care within the recurrent
budget for health. The recurrent budget for primary and secondary health care is
understood to comprise health centers; dispensaries and subdispensaries; health promotion
and protection; family health; disease control; and nurses’ training. These are covered by
budget lines 06 to 11 under heading 21 of the budget; they do not include expenditures
incurred directly or indirectly on (i) foreign personnel; and (ii) all the referral hospitals. The
base year for measurement is 1999.

In progress

5. Structural reforms
Measures to promote private sector development:
(i) Establish a functional multisector regulatory agency.

Met

(ii) Bring to the point of sale The Gambia’s two major public groundnut processing plants.

APPENDIX I
THE GAMBIA: JOINT FUND-WORLD BANK DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
1.
This debt sustainability analysis (DSA), prepared jointly by the staffs of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, uses the standard Debt
Sustainability Framework (DSF) for low-income countries.1 The external and domestic
debt data underlying this DSA are from the authorities. A full reconciliation of external debt
will be conducted before The Gambia reaches the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC)
completion point, expected to occur in 2007, an assumption that is factored into the DSA
baseline scenario. The analysis also assesses the impact of the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI), which would likely be delivered within three months of the completion
point.

breached under stress testing, indicating that the risk of debt distress remains moderate even
after the delivery of MDRI relief.

I. EVOLUTION OF THE GAMBIA’S PUBLIC DEBT SINCE THE HIPC DECISION POINT

The Gambia reached the Decision Point under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative in
December 2000. Based on external debt data at the end of 1999, the Boards of the
International Development Association (IDA) and the IMF approved debt relief worth
US$66.6 million in NPV terms assuming the participation of all creditors. Interim relief in

The last DSA was prepared solely by Fund staff in the context of the 2005 Article IV consultation.

According to the latest World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment, which summarizes the
quality of a country’s policies, The Gambia is a “poor performer.” The relevant indicative thresholds for the
category are 30 percent for the net present value (NPV) of the debt-to-GDP ratio, 100 percent for the NPV of
debt-to-exports ratio, 200 percent for the NPV of debt-to-revenues ratio, 15 percent for the debt service–toexports ratio, and 25 percent for the debt service–to-revenues ratio. These ratios are applicable to public and
publicly guaranteed external debt.

the form of debt service reductions was provided by IDA,3 the IMF,4 and the African
Development Bank (AfDB). Reaching the HIPC completion point, originally expected at
around the end of 2002, was delayed by serious policy slippages, which derailed the program
supported by the IMF’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF).

At the end of 2005, the latest date for which comprehensive data are available,
the stock of external public debt stood at US$628 million (136 percent of GDP), with an
NPV of US$385.7 million. Four-fifths of this debt was owed to multilateral creditors, and
the remainder to bilateral creditors. The total external debt stock has increased 36 percent
since the end of 1999, the base year of the HIPC decision point, through 2005. Most of this
increase can be attributed to new disbursements, estimated at about US$217 million, from the
World Bank, AfDB, the Islamic Development Bank, and other multilateral donors.

The stock of gross domestic debt stood at 35.5 percent of GDP at the end of 2005,
up 8.5 percentage points from its level at the end of 1999. Large extrabudgetary spending
was responsible for raising domestic debt from 31.5 percent of GDP in 2000 to just over
38 percent in 2001. After declining to 27.5 percent of GDP in 2003, owing to an inflationdriven spike in nominal GDP, the stock of domestic debt grew more than 7 percentage points

IDA interim relief in the amount US$31.8 million was delivered through a 50 percent reduction on debt
service obligations until the one-third prescribed limit was reached. The IDA guidelines on interim relief
stipulate that “cumulative interim relief in net present value terms should not exceed one-third of the total NPV
debt relief committed by IDA” (Enhanced HIPC Initiative: Provision of Interim HIPC Debt Relief on IBRD
Loans and IDA Credits, August 25, 2004).

The Fund’s interim assistance amounted to SDR 0.8 million, covering 9.6 percent of each repayment
obligation falling due until 31 December 2001 (IMF Country Report No. 04/42, February 2004).

between 2003 and 2005, largely on account of the central bank’s sale of government debt to
sterilize the impact of capital inflows.
II. METHODOLOGY AND KEY ASSUMPTIONS
6.
The baseline DSA assumes that The Gambia will reach the HIPC completion
point in mid-2007. The DSA incorporates a simulation of debt relief consistent with the
formulations agreed to in the HIPC decision point document. The impact of the delivery of
stock debt relief under the MDRI is also estimated5. These estimates are provided for
illustrative purposes only and are subject to changes to the assumed completion point timing
and/or exchange rate assumptions and revisions pending full reconciliation of the debt data.
7.
The key macroeconomic assumptions in the DSA are presented in Box 1. For the
reasons given in the decision point document for The Gambia,6 reexports are excluded from
the export and import projections. The service-related costs of the reexport trade (i.e.,
transportation and insurance rendered by enterprises in The Gambia) as well as traders’
estimated profit margins are included in nonfactor services receipts.7

III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
8.
The Gambia’s NPV of debt-to-exports ratio, estimated at 312 percent in 2005, is
well above the relevant policy-based indicative threshold of 100 percent. Under the
baseline projections (Tables 1 and 2 and Figure 1), which assumes that HIPC completion
point relief is secured in mid-2007, this ratio declines steadily to 184.7 percent by 2011, and

The relevant cut-off dates are end-2003 for IDA and end-2004 for AfDB debt.

falls below the indicative threshold by 2021. The NPV of debt-to-GDP is estimated at
83.7 percent in 2005 and is expected to continue to breach the indicative threshold
(30 percent) for most of the projection period. The debt service-to-export ratio, estimated at
21.2 percent in 2005, falls below the threshold (15 percent) in 2011. Thus The Gambia would
remain in debt distress even after the delivery of HIPC debt relief at completion point.
9.
Only the delivery of MDRI relief from IDA and the AfDB would substantially
improve The Gambia’s debt sustainability outlook. Under the MDRI scenario, which
assumes delivery of MDRI relief within three months of the HIPC completion point, the
NPV of the debt to exports ratio would plummet to 93 percent in 2007 (Table 3 and
Figure 2), below the 100 percent threshold. The NPV of debt to GDP would also fall below
the 30 percent threshold, reaching 27 percent in 2007. The application of stress tests,
however, once again pushes the debt indicators above the thresholds, indicating that the risk
of debt distress would remain moderate.

42

Box 1: Macroeconomic Assumptions 2006–26
The medium-term assumptions in the baseline scenario for 2006–26 are consistent with the
framework presented in the IMF staff report on the 2006 Article IV consultation. Key
macroeconomic assumptions include the maintenance of sustained real GDP growth and a
stable macroeconomic environment.
•

Real GDP growth is projected to average 5 percent per year, with business climate
improvements and foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows further boosting agriculturalrelated production and tourism activity. Nonetheless, the economy remains vulnerable to
weather shocks. Under the fiscal and monetary policy assumptions, annual inflation would
stay at about 3 percent, and the real exchange rate would remain stable.

•

Exports of goods and services are projected to recover, growing by an average of
close to 8 percent a year. The projections are relatively optimistic compared to previous
years, based on the assumption that the authorities will continue to implement market
reforms in support of private sector development. In addition, the higher growth reflects a
recovery following relatively poor performance in recent years, including a slump in
tourism activity in 2001 and declines in groundnut exports both in 2003 (owing to a
drought) and in 2005 (owing to marketing problems). While clearly subject to risk,
including the effect of severe weather, the projections assume that the groundnut sector
resolves its problems, prompting an initial export rebound in 2006, followed by modest
production increases (3 percent per year). Growth in exports is supported by increased
export diversification, including through agribusiness development, and a projected decline
in the reexport trade as a share of total exports. After growing a robust 22 percent in 2005,
growth in tourist arrivals moderates to an average of about 5–6 percent a year over the
medium term, supported by further tourism investments and improved services.

•

After deteriorating in 2006, owing to higher oil prices and lower groundnut prices,
the terms of trade are projected to improve steadily. The current account deficit
(including transfers) is assumed to remain relatively high in the first few years, reflecting
strong FDI-financed imports, before declining to less than 5 percent of GDP. Reserves are
projected to stay at 4.0–5.5 months of import cover.

•

External support is projected to rise moderately following the completion point, as
donors step in to support both the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and progress
toward the Millennium Development Goals. Efforts to enhance the investment climate and
boost external competitiveness are expected to yield sustained FDI inflows. While strong,
current inflows mainly support tourism and agricultural projects.

•

Reflecting new measures implemented in the 2006 budget, revenues are expected to
increase from roughly 20.0 percent of GDP in 2005 to 21.5 percent of GDP in 2006,
though they decline slightly over the projection period. Average interest rates on
government debt are projected to decline steadily, from 16 percent in 2006 to about
10 percent in 2010 and 9.5 percent in 2026.

43

10.
Stress tests indicate that even with MDRI relief, The Gambia’s debt
sustainability is highly sensitive to (i) export growth assumptions, (ii) projections of
nondebt-creating inflows,8 and (iii) the terms of new borrowing. Under these stress tests,
the DSA results exceed the relevant indicative debt thresholds. Moreover, the baseline and
MDRI scenarios hinge on the avoidance of the types of policy mistakes that weakened
macroeconomic performances in recent years. Indeed, under a “historical scenario” that
assumes similar policy missteps, the path of the debt indicators deteriorates markedly
(Alternative scenario A1, Table 3).
IV. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
11.
The outcome of the public debt analysis is driven principally by the external
debt assumptions, as external debt accounts for the major share of total public debt.
Under the baseline scenario (Tables 4 and 5 and Figure 3), the primary balance is projected
to increase from near-balance in 2005 to a surplus of 1.9 percent of GDP in 2006, reflecting
enhanced revenues, and a surplus of 5.4 percent in 2007, reflecting a marked shift in the
composition of external financing from loans to grants (assumes grants from AfDB and other
donors, and HIPC relief from multilateral creditors at completion point). The primary balance
surplus is then projected to shrink steadily to about 1 percent of GDP in 2014, and to stay
near that level through 2026. The decline in the primary balance mainly stems from a steady
increase in noninterest domestic spending, which partly offsets somewhat lower external
financing inflows (and is partly offset by a decrease in interest payments). Accordingly, the
overall position (including grants) is projected to be fairly stable from 2007 to 2026, ranging
from near-balance to a deficit of 2 percent of GDP.
12.
The NPV of public debt is projected to decline from about 120 percent of GDP in
2005 to close to 77 percent of GDP in 2011 and to 46 percent of GDP in 2026, mostly
reflecting the decline in external debt (Table 4). As a ratio of domestic revenues, the NPV
of public debt is projected to fall from about 564 percent in 2005 to just over 206 percent at
the end of the projection period.
13.
Under the MDRI scenario (Table 6 and Figure 4), all additional relief after the
first three years would be spent on poverty-reduction; in the first three years, a small
fraction of the relief would be used to pay down domestic debt more quickly. Thus, from
2010 on, the stock of domestic debt matches that in the baseline scenario, so that the
difference between the stock of debt in the two scenarios stems solely from differences in
8

Such inflows comprise official and private transfers and foreign direct investment.

44

external debt. Thus, the NPV of the public debt–to-GDP ratio drops sharply, to about 74
percent of GDP in 2007 and to 38 percent in 2026. In terms of public revenue, the NPV of
public debt is projected to decline to 170 percent at the end of the projection period.
V. CONCLUSION
14.
As shown by the DSA results, without the delivery of HIPC and MDRI debt
relief—supported by grant financing and a reduction in the level of domestic debt—The
Gambia will remain in debt distress. After the delivery of MDRI relief, a shift in the
composition of external financing from concessional loans to grants, combined with lower
domestic debt, is necessary to keep debt to sustainable levels and provide room for povertyreducing development expenditures. Given the continuing risks, development of a
comprehensive public debt management strategy that includes public enterprise and
contingent liabilities should be a priority.

Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), noninterest current account as percent of GDP, and nondebt-creating flows.
Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4
Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5
Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6
Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing), in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Safeguards assessments
A FIN Safeguards Assessment mission visited The Gambia in March 2003 and in
November 2003 to conduct a Stage 1 onsite assessment of the Central Bank of The Gambia
(CBG). The assessment was completed on February 3, 2004. A summary of its findings and
recommendations is outlined in Box 3 of the IMF Country Report No. 4/143 (May 2004).
Exchange rate arrangement
Until January 20, 1986, the Gambian currency, the dalasi, was pegged to the pound sterling
at a rate of D5 = £1. On January 20, 1986, an interbank market for foreign exchange was
introduced, and since then the exchange rate has been determined by market forces. Effective
June 30, 2002, the exchange rate arrangement of The Gambia was reclassified from

The Fund approved the decision on 12/15/2000 as Decision 12365-(00/126). The World Bank Board decision
was taken on 12/14/2000.

independently floating to managed float with no preannounced path. As of July 31, 2006, the
midpoint exchange rate in the interbank market was D28.0296 per U.S. dollar.
The Gambia has been part of the exchange rate mechanism of the West African Monetary
Zone (WAMZ) since April 2002.

62
Appendix III
The Gambia: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of August 31, 2006)
1.
The Bank and the Fund cooperate closely in providing support for implementation of
The Gambia’s development strategy, which is set forth in the Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP), the Strategy for Poverty Alleviation II. The PRSP was finalized in April 2002
and endorsed by the Boards of the World Bank and IMF in July 2002. It outlines a mediumterm strategy to reduce poverty that has five objectives: (1) macroeconomic stability and
effective public resource management; (2) promotion of propoor growth and employment
through private sector development, particularly in the rural agricultural sector; (3) improved
basic social services and infrastructure; (4) building the capacity of local communities and
civil society organizations (CSOs); and (5) strengthened multisectoral programs to reduce
population growth, gender inequality, HIV/AIDS, malnutrition, and environmental
degradation. The PRSP contains a multidimensional poverty analysis, an outline of a
monitoring and evaluation framework, preliminary performance indicators and targets,
estimates of the cost of implementation, and an indicative financing gap. The current PRSP
covered the period from 2003 to 2005. The authorities are now preparing a second PRSP
covering 2007 to 2011; it is expected to be completed toward the end of 2006.
2.
The Bank’s support to The Gambia is outlined in its Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS). The CAS is aligned with the PRSP, particularly in the following areas:
(1) establishing a macroeconomic and sectoral environment conducive to economic growth;
(2) rehabilitating and building infrastructure; (3) enhancing human capital by providing more
efficient social services; and (4) building capacity in departments responsible for economic
management. The Bank’s direct support in recent years has mainly been sector-based
investment projects and analytical work. The Fund has traditionally led the dialogue on
macroeconomic policy, including fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies. Areas of close
collaboration include public expenditure management reform and government statistics.
Collaboration on trade issues should soon increase with the planned Integrated Framework
analysis led by the Bank. The next CAS is being prepared for FY07.
3.
As of August 2006, IDA had approved 34 credits worth a total of about
US$296 million. The current portfolio consists of seven projects in HIV/AIDS, poverty
alleviation (infrastructure), capacity building for economic management, private sector
development (trade gateway), education, community-driven development, and locust
prevention (regional), totaling US$86.9 million, of which US$38.0 million is undisbursed.
4.
An HIV/AIDS rapid response operation was approved in January 2001. The project
is designed to (1) contain the HIV/AIDS pandemic, (2) reduce the spread of the pandemic
and mitigate its effects, and (3) increase access to prevention services, treatment, care, and
support for those infected and affected by HIV/AIDS.

63
5.
A Poverty Alleviation and Municipal Development operation was approved in
March 1999 to (1) reduce the backlog in public infrastructure development and improve the
maintenance of public assets; (2) alleviate poverty by creating temporary jobs and improve
the selection of small- and medium-sized investments, which should be directed at upgrading
the living environment of the poor; and (3) strengthen the technical and managerial capacity
of local authorities (with an emphasis on their financial situation), local private firms
(namely, consultants and contractors), and Gamworks (a procurement agency). In addition to
the original credit of SDR10.7 million (US$15 million equivalent), the Bank approved a
supplemental credit of SDR2.7 million (US$4.0 million equivalent) to upgrade the
infrastructure in water supply, roads, and sanitation facilities.
6.
A Capacity Building for Economic Management Project was approved in
July 2001 to help build (1) government capacity for economic planning, policy formulation,
and execution, and (2) the capacity of the judicial and financial systems to facilitate private
sector development. Reforms supported by the project include establishment of the Revenue
Authority, implementation of the Integrated Financial Management Information System
(IFMIS), capacity building and restructuring of the Central Statistics Department (CSD), and
establishment of an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) court system.
7.
The Trade Gateway Project was approved in February 2002 to help the country
establish itself as a globally competitive business park by laying the foundations for
expanded private investment, export-oriented production, and employment through a free
zone and an improved institutional environment.
8.
The second phase of the Education Project was approved on June 1, 2006, to help
The Gambia improve conditions for teaching and learning in basic education by
(1) improving the performance of students, teachers, and schools, (2) strengthening capacity
building and performance management, and enhancing monitoring and evaluation, and
(3) expanding access to underserved communities.
9.
A regional Emergency Locust Project covering Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali,
Mauritania, Niger, Senegal, and The Gambia was approved in December 2004. To help
reduce the hardships imposed on people and the environment by current and future locust
invasions, it supports improved strategies for prevention, early warning, reaction, and
mitigation at both the national and regional levels.
10.
A Community-based Rural Development Project was approved on August 31,
2006, to help rural communities, in partnership with local government authorities, plan,
implement and maintain their priority social and economic investments.
11.
As of July 31, 2006, the IFC’s portfolio had three investments in The Gambia with a
balance of about US$0.75 million. The investments are for a medical clinic (Ndebaan) and
commercial fishing (Lyefish).

64
12.
IDA, MIGA, and the IFC will continue to coordinate their efforts to support
development activities in The Gambia. Their activities are enhanced by the IFC office in
Dakar, which also oversees IFC activities in The Gambia.

APPENDIX IV
The Gambia: Relations with the African Development Bank
(As of August 31, 2006)
1.
The African Development Bank (AfDB) Group began lending to The Gambia
in 1974. As of August 31, 2006, it had approved, 52 operations with total commitments, net
of cancellations of UA197.2 million (US$298.9 million) in the following sectors: transport
(26 percent); agriculture (22.6 percent); social (21.5 percent); public utilities (12.6 percent);
multisectoral (9.1 percent); environment (6.1 percent); and industry (2.1 percent).1 About
84 percent of the Bank Group’s net commitments were made from the resources of the
African Development Fund (ADF), 9 percent from the AfDB nonconcessional window , and
7 percent from the Nigerian Trust Fund (NTF).
2.
As of August 31, 2006, 35 operations had been completed, 3 were cancelled at the
government’s request, and 14 others continue, including 3 multinational projects, all in
agriculture. Implementation of the portfolio is generally satisfactory; it achieved a rating
score of 2.01 (on a scale from 0 to 3) during the Bank Group’s 2006 portfolio review. The
portfolio has a relatively low project-at-risk (PAR) rate of 33.3 percent, which compares well
with the Bank-wide average of 43.3 percent stated in the AfDB’s 2004 Annual Portfolio
Performance Review (APPR). Total disbursement rates for the portfolio are also satisfactory.
By the end of August 2006, they were 84.3 percent (overall), 100 percent (AfDB-financed
projects), 83.8 percent (ADF), and 44.5 percent (NTF). The satisfactory performance of the
portfolio is attributed to the supervision missions conducted by the AfDB, especially
since 2003.
3.
The AfDB is also a major participant in The Gambia’s enhanced Heavily Indebted
Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative program, under which it is due to grant debt relief of
US$15.7 million in net present value (NPV) terms (23.6 percent of total debt relief under the
program).
4.
The AfDB’s strategy for The Gambia for the period 2005–09 is still being prepared
and is awaiting finalization of the country’s new Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).
The draft Country Strategy Paper (CSP) proposes to improve productive capacity through
microfinance management and credit projects and to enhance economic management. The
CSP has yet to be approved. The last CSP for The Gambia, which covered 2002–04, was
designed to help the country in its efforts to meet the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) by addressing specific institutional and human capacity constraints. The plan is
based on The Gambia’s poverty reduction strategy (SPA-II), and the base-case scenario
focuses on the interventions shown in Table IV.1.

Department, Public Divestiture Agency,
parliament, and the Public Procurement
Agency.

5.
Under ADF–X, The Gambia is a grants-only recipient. Additional resources can be
made available if there is improvement in both performance under the Country Policy
Institutional Assessment (CPIA) and portfolio performance.
6.
The AfDB’s strategy is implemented through both lending and nonlending activities.
The extent of lending depends on finalization of the new PRSP, satisfactory performance
under the IMF-supported PRGF, progress toward reaching the HIPC Initiative completion
point, advances in strengthening public expenditure management, and improved
performance of AfDB-sponsored projects. Nonlending intervention is designed to
strengthen policy dialogue between the government and stakeholders and focuses mainly on
studies, funded through grants, to improve governance, mainstream gender, fight HIV/AIDS
and communicable diseases, and improve the energy supply.

67

APPENDIX V
THE GAMBIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
The poor quality of some data and complete lack of others make it hard to analyze
economic developments. There are substantial weaknesses in The Gambia's economic and
financial statistics, especially in national accounts, balance of payments, and external debt
statistics. Data reporting by the authorities to the Fund is somewhat irregular. The Gambia
participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and its metadata have been
posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) since May 2000.
2.
A data ROSC mission visited The Gambia in February 2005 to assess data quality in
four main areas of macroeconomic statistics (national accounts, government finance,
monetary, and balance of payments) based on the Fund’s Data Quality Assessment
Framework (DQAF, July 2003). Data dissemination was also assessed in terms of the GDDS
recommendations. The mission recommended establishment of an interim Statistics Council
to spearhead passage of the Statistics Act, eventual creation of an autonomous Bureau of
Statistics, and preparation of a comprehensive statistics reform package. Accordingly, the
National Assembly passed a new statistics act in December 2005. Work began in June 2006
to implement the plan for transforming the Central Statistics Department (CSD) to The
Gambia Bureau of Statistics (GBOS).
Real sector
3.
Annual national account estimates are compiled using only the production approach.
In the absence of more comprehensive information, they rely heavily on indicators. In
response to STA assistance on national accounts since 1998, the CSD has prepared a
program to (1) improve the quality of source statistics by improving and expanding existing
surveys; (2) improve the coverage and methodology of GDP estimates, including
implementation of the System of National Accounts (1993 SNA); (3) rebase the constant price
estimates—the current baseline is 1976/77—to a more recent period; and (4) make
independent estimates of expenditure aggregates. An STA peripatetic adviser helped the
authorities compile national accounts and price statistics.
4.
Currently, the CSD produces data on the consumer price index (CPI) based only on
the 1976/77 weights for the low-income population of the greater Banjul area. The World
Bank has been providing technical assistance to the CSD to update CPI weights using
the 2003 household expenditure survey to better reflect current consumption patterns, and
update the national accounts and expand the compilation to include independent estimates of
gross domestic expenditure. The authorities are making progress in these efforts. As in the
case of the national accounts, improvements in the CPI will require that the CSD have
adequate resources.

68

Government finance
5.
The authorities release data on central government transactions with a lag of about
eight weeks for both revenue and expenditure. Reporting in the treasury ledger is subject to
considerable delay; the central government accounts for 1991–2001 were not audited
until 2005. Inadequacies persist in compiling data on an economic basis and in tracking
foreign-financed expenditure, including HIPC debt relief. Monthly data on domestic
government financing are available with a delay of six to eight weeks.
Monetary data
6.
Data reporting by the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) is irregular. The
commercial banks follow a uniform chart of accounts to report financial data to the CBG.
They also transmit flash reports of key monetary data to the CBG on a weekly basis. Over the
past few years, the CBG has several times reclassified the monetary accounts to improve
sectorization and coverage, as well as to harmonize the data reported to STA and AFR. In
particular, there were substantial revisions to data on foreign exchange transactions and
lending to the central government for 2001–03. The monetary and financial statistics mission
in April-May 2006 made further recommendations to expand the coverage of depository
corporations to include credit unions. The mission also recommended that accrued interest be
included in the value of financial instruments. Given the significant influence of the Social
Security and Housing Development Corporation in monetary developments, the mission
recommended compilation of a financial survey. To improve the accuracy and classification
of government accounts, it designed a supplementary form for reporting government
positions at the CBG, to be reported to the IMF monthly. It also introduced standardized
report forms to make it easier for the authorities to report data to the Fund for the use of both
AFR and STA.
Balance of payments
7.
A significant proportion of The Gambia's external transactions, including reexports,
are informal. Including reexport trade in the balance of payments assumes that reexports are
a fixed share of total imports. Tourism receipts are derived from a simple function of tourist
arrivals and average length of stay in The Gambia. Data on private capital flows are poor but
the CBG has taken recent initiatives to improve on them. Official grant and loan
disbursements and repayments are relatively well recorded, but there are some gaps in project
disbursements. Data on the gross and net CBG international reserves bank are available with
a short lag, but had to be substantially revised for 2001–03.
8.
STA provided technical assistance on balance of payment statistics in June–
July 1999, September 2000, and most recently in February 2006. However, until the

69

February 2005 ROSC mission, progress in implementing STA recommendations on balance
of payments had been slow.
9.
On the recommendation of the ROSC mission, the CBG revamped the balance of
payments unit by elevating it to a full section with additional staff. To strengthen capacity to
compile balance of payments data, the Fund provided substantial training to the CBG staff
in 2005–06. A member of the CBG staff attended STA’s Balance of Payments Statistics
course in May–June 2005 and another attended in May–June 2006. CBG staff also
participated in the regional balance of payments seminar offered by STA in Banjul early in
2006.
10.
In line with the recommendations of the February 2006 balance of payments technical
assistance mission, the CBG has speeded up the process of compiling balance of payments
statistics according to the Balance of Payments Manual, 5th edition (BPM5). The preliminary
data are expected to be ready in September 2006. With assistance from the U.K. Department
for International Development, the CBG conducted an enterprise survey in March 2006 to
collect data for the International Investment Position. In April 2006, the CBG also initiated a
survey funded by the World Bank to collect data on selected components of the current
account.
11.
The government, with the assistance of the World Bank, recently installed the new
version of the Commonwealth Secretariat’s debt-reporting and management system.
Publication
12.
The CBG has begun to regularly disseminate some macroeconomic statistics on its
website. Until last year, macroeconomic data was provided to the public only through
references in the annual budget speech. The CBG's annual report and quarterly bulletins,
which disseminate much of the nation’s macroeconomic data, have not been published
since 2000; the CSD’s publications are not being issued regularly either.
13.
There has been no reporting of data for publication in the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook since 1993 or in the Balance of Payments Statistics and International
Financial Statistics (IFS), other than monetary and CPI data, since 1997.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with
The Gambia
On October 13, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with The Gambia, and also assessed the country’s performance under a staff
monitored program (SMP).33
Background
The Gambia has achieved macroeconomic stability over the last two and a half years. Real GDP
growth rebounded from a drought-induced decline in 2002 to an annual average of 5.7 percent per
year for 2003–05. Underpinned by a tight monetary policy stance, year-on-year inflation—as
measured by the consumer price index—fell to low single digit levels in 2005 and stayed below
2 percent in the first six months of 2006. Though treasury bill yields and bank lending rates have
fallen, they remain very high in real terms. The average yield on treasury bills fell from 30 percent at
the end of December 2004 to 14.5 percent at the end of June 2006.
The overall fiscal deficit increased from 5.7 percent of GDP in 2004 to 8.6 percent in 2005, reflecting
lower revenues and higher domestic interest payments. A two-month closure of the border with
Senegal depressed customs revenues, and higher domestic debt at the end of 2004 resulted in a
substantial increase in domestic interest payments. In 2005, interest payments accounted for
47 percent of current expenditure (43 percent of domestic revenue). PRSP-related spending in 2005
(23 percent of domestically financed expenditures) fell short of the level envisaged in the budget
(30 percent).
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.
33

72

The updated fiscal outlook for 2006 suggests a greater fiscal adjustment effort compared to 2005,
but a shortfall when compared to the 2006 budget. In particular, higher-than-budgeted expenditure
on the African Union summit held in Banjul in July 2006 is the principal factor behind projected
overspending amounting to about 1 ½ percent of GDP.
The external current account deficit (including official transfers) widened significantly from 5 percent
of GDP in 2003 to about 15 percent in 2005, due mainly to higher imports. In addition, groundnut
exports collapsed in 2005 as a result of failures in internal marketing arrangements. A bright spot in
the current account was strong growth in tourism earnings; tourist arrivals rose by more than 20
percent in 2005. The current account deficit was financed by increased inflows of foreign direct
investment (FDI) and official concessional loans. The ratio of nominal external debt to GDP fell from
145 percent at the end of 2004 to 136 percent at the end of 2005.
The dalasi appreciated modestly in nominal and real effective terms during 2004–05 after massive
depreciations in 2001–03. The appreciation reflects a tighter monetary policy stance and increased
inflows of remittances, transfers, and FDI. The economy has stayed relatively competitive; tourism
receipts (the main source of foreign exchange earnings) have increased sharply and gross
international reserves are at a comfortable level, equivalent to four months of imports.
The Gambia is classified as a Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC). It reached the decision point
under the HIPC Initiative in December 2000 and is eligible for debt relief under both the Enhanced
HIPC Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) when it reaches completion point.
The results of a debt-sustainability analysis undertaken as part of the Article IV consultation indicate
that the country is currently debt-distressed with all the key debt and debt service indicators well
above indicative thresholds. Stress tests suggest that The Gambia will remain at moderate risk of
debt distress even after MDRI relief.
A combination of exogenous shocks, fiscal slippages, and accommodating monetary policy stance
derailed The Gambia’s last Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)-supported program soon
after it was approved in 2002. Following delays in implementing measures to address weaknesses
revealed by a Safeguards Assessment, the PRGF arrangement expired in July 2005 without a single
review being completed.
In order to re-establish a track record of policy implementation with the IMF, the authorities
undertook an SMP spanning October 2005–March 2006. Performance under the program was
satisfactory. All structural benchmarks were implemented, although some with a delay. In particular,
guidelines and procedures to strengthen internal controls at the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG)
are being implemented, and steps have been taken to clear a backlog of unaudited government
accounts. Performance against quantitative targets was mixed; fiscal targets for December 2005
were missed, but the slippages were made up by the end of March 2006.

73

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities on stabilizing the economy over the last two and a
half years, which helped achieve low inflation and respectable economic growth. Directors noted,
however, that the country continues to face severe challenges, in view of the high debt burden,
narrow productive base, vulnerability to exogenous and policy-induced shocks, and widespread
poverty. In these circumstances, and recalling the stop-go policies of the past, Directors urged the
authorities to make a long-term commitment to a reform agenda that would promote higher growth
and reduce poverty. They considered that such an agenda should include improving fiscal discipline,
strengthening governance and accountability in the management of public resources, deepening the
financial system, and enhancing the investment climate to foster private sector development. While
recognizing that continued technical assistance will help support these efforts, Directors noted that
more effective use of such assistance will enhance capacity building.
Directors were encouraged by The Gambia’s performance under the Staff-Monitored Program that
ended in March 2006. They especially welcomed the progress made by the Central Bank of The
Gambia in addressing governance problems that had contributed to monetary policy lapses several
years previously, and commended its success in reducing inflation and building up reserves.
Directors called for full implementation of the new Act designed to strengthen the operational
independence of the CBG.
Directors noted the authorities’ concern that high interest payments are crowding out Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) priority expenditures, but considered that the authorities need to
exercise fiscal discipline to address this concern. They stressed that limiting the government’s
domestic borrowing is critical for lowering interest rates, and consequently creating fiscal space for
increasing growth-promoting and poverty-reducing public spending. In that context, they expressed
disappointment that, subsequent to the SMP, fiscal slippages have emerged in connection with The
Gambia’s hosting of an African Union summit.
Directors stressed that the authorities should strengthen public financial management, including
through the Integrated Financial Management Information System. In particular, it would be crucial to
avoid expenditure overruns, extra-budgetary expenditures, and over-commitments on externally
financed projects with substantial local counterpart funding requirements. Directors urged the
authorities to extend the commitment control system beyond its current pilot phase to all spending
units. They highlighted the need to better integrate the PRSP into the budget process, and to ensure
that the resources released by debt relief contribute effectively toward reducing poverty.
Directors observed that, although the financial sector is relatively sound, financial intermediation is
low. They noted that a high degree of concentration and high profit ratios in the banking system
suggest room for more competition, but noted that structural impediments to lending should also be
addressed. Directors encouraged the authorities to review laws that discourage lending, and to take
steps to improve the efficiency of the court system and facilitate the establishment of a credit
reference bureau.

74

Directors were of the view that The Gambia’s floating exchange rate regime has served the country
well and that the current level of the real effective exchange rate is broadly appropriate. At the same
time, they underscored the importance of structural reforms to enhance external competitiveness
and reduce the vulnerability of the economy to exogenous shocks. In this regard, they welcomed the
authorities’ request for assistance from the World Bank in the formulation of a program to improve
the investment climate. Improvements in education and health would also strengthen capacity
building and enhance productivity. Several Directors expressed concern about the recent weakness
in the groundnut sector, and recommended that the remaining impediments to its efficient operation
be removed.
Directors noted that stress tests in the debt sustainability analysis undertaken jointly by Fund and
World Bank staff suggest that The Gambia will likely remain at a moderate risk of falling back into
debt distress even if debt relief under the MDRI is provided. They underscored the importance of
reliance on nondebt creating flows and further efforts to strengthen debt management. Directors also
noted the importance of strengthening domestic revenue mobilization to supplement, and reduce
dependency on, external resources.
Directors expressed concern about the severe data deficiencies that hamper the analysis of
economic developments. They urged the authorities to speed up work on using the results of the
2003 household budget survey to improve the quality of the national accounts and the consumer
price index. Additional steps are also necessary to improve the quality of balance of payments
statistics along the lines recommended by the Fund.
Directors generally considered that there is a basis for proceeding to discuss with the authorities a
program that could be supported under a three-year PRGF arrangement. They expected that a new
arrangement would provide a framework for consolidating the implementation of sound
macroeconomic policies and also assist the authorities make progress toward the HIPC completion
point in order to benefit from debt relief. Directors urged the authorities to redouble their reform
efforts, noting that credible fiscal consolidation and improved governance would be important for a
new PRGF arrangement.

Statement by Peter Ngumbullu, Executive Director for The Gambia
October 13, 2006
On behalf of the Gambian authorities we thank staff for the candid and constructive dialogue during
the Article IV consultations and the review of the country’s performance under the SMP. We also
thank the Executive Board and Management for their continued support. The authorities appreciate
the advice extended by the Fund and are in general agreement with the thrust of the staff report. As
a result of the strengthened macroeconomic management, The Gambia has made significant
progress towards macroeconomic stability in recent years. However, the economy continues to be
vulnerable to external shocks including drought and higher oil prices. Public debt also continues to
be high and unsustainable. The authorities look forward to negotiating a new PRGF arrangement
with the Fund, which will be critical in anchoring their reform program, unlocking donor support,
obtaining debt relief under enhanced HIPC and MDRI and realizing some fiscal space which will
allow allocation of resources to development and poverty reducing activities.
Macroeconomic performance in 2005 was broadly favorable with growth in real GDP being
supported by agriculture, construction and services sectors. The level of inflation remained in the
low single-digits for over a year as a result of the tight monetary policy regime adopted by the
authorities. The dalasi also continued to be stable, supported by the strong economic fundamentals
and robust foreign exchange inflows.
Fiscal performance weakened somewhat in 2005 as a result of slightly lower revenues, a marked
decline in grants and increased expenditures. Lower international trade tax revenue—attributable in
part to a two-month closure of the border with Senegal—was largely responsible for the lower
revenue performance. On the expenditure side, higher domestic interest payments were the main
factors behind the increase. The size of domestic interest payments, at 47 percent of current
spending in 2005, was a reflection of the high interest rates and domestic debt in 2004 which was
issued to finance the much needed poverty reducing expenditure in the absence of adequate donor
support as well as for monetary policy operations.
The external current account deficit (including official transfers) widened markedly in 2005, largely
as a result of increased imports, in particular, the higher oil import bill. In spite of a marked increase
in production in the 2004/05 crop season, the export of groundnuts and their products almost
collapsed in 2005 on account of a failure in marketing arrangements. The current account deficit
was financed by increased private capital inflows and some official concessional loans. The overall
external position remained comfortable, with the level of gross international reserves of about four
months of imports.

77
The Gambia’s good performance under the SMP is an indicator of the authorities’ commitment to
improve macroeconomic management and establish a track record of sound policy implementation.
All the quantitative targets and structural benchmarks were met, albeit a few with a slight delay.
Internal controls at the CBG were strengthened by putting in place guidelines and procedures for
improving accounting practices and controls in reserves management. The authorities have also
begun improving public financial management and accountability by reducing the backlog of
unaudited government accounts.
Significant progress has been made in improving fiscal performance over the past year and the
authorities are committed to stepping up their efforts to sustain this performance. They have
reassured that the slippage in budget implementation as a result of higher than budgeted expenditure
on the AU summit was a once off occurrence that would not be repeated again. This was mainly a
result of the significant shortfall in external assistance that the country expected for financing the
summit. To mitigate against the impact created by hosting the summit, the authorities plan to sell
some of the assets acquired for the summit. The basic fiscal balance is still expected to generate a
surplus, thus indicating improved fiscal effort relative to last year.
High interest payments continue to exert tremendous strain on the budget and divert resources away
from poverty reducing and growth promoting expenditures. This is evident in the fact that PRSP
related spending fell short of the budget estimates in 2005. The high interest payments reflect the
high level of domestic debt for financing the deficit and the tight monetary policy. The authorities
therefore plan to contain domestic borrowing and to finance future budget shortfalls through
concessional borrowing and grants. This is expected to alleviate the problem of high interest
payments through reductions in the stock of domestic debt and interest rates. The authorities also
plan to pay off half of their CBG long term loan.
The authorities are committed to improving budget formulation processes and stem the problem of
arrears arising from inadequate budgetary provision for counterpart funding of donor funded
projects. They are currently in the process of implementing the Integrated Financial Management
Information System (IFMS), with the assistance of the World Bank, to improve public financial
management. To facilitate performance in the interim, they plan to extend the commitment control
system that was introduced on a pilot basis in 2005 to cover all budget units. Technical assistance
from the Fund’s regional advisor has been requested to build capacity in this regard. On the revenue
side the authorities are taking measures to improve tax administration and promote tax compliance.
The authorities are also taking steps to improve transparency and timeliness of reporting on fiscal
operations. They are currently in the process of clearing the backlog of unaudited government
accounts and their submission to the Auditor General is expected to be brought up to date by the
end of 2007.

78
The primary objective of monetary policy will continue to be the pursuit of price
stability, through monetary targeting. The tight monetary policy stance adopted by the authorities
has succeeded in bringing inflation to low single digits. Implementation of the new central Bank
legislation which provides for enhanced central bank independence is also expected to further the
CBG’s capacity in execution of monetary policy.
The financial sector remains sound with banks well capitalized and profitable. However, credit
extension to the private sector is low. To address this, the CBG in collaboration with representatives
of the Banking Association, is undertaking a review of the legal system with a view to identifying
and addressing impediments to lending. They also plan to establish a credit bureau which will
provide reference on credit worthiness of individuals and private entities seeking credit from the
financial sector. The authorities agree with staff that there may be room for increased competition in
the banking sector. In view of this they hope that the two new banks that the CBG has licensed to
begin business by the end of 2006 would enhance competition. The spread between commercial
bank deposit and lending rates in the Gambia continues to be wide indicating that the bank costs
may be high. Staff has identified the payoff to shareholders, overhead costs and the implicit cost of
reserves as the main factors behind high bank costs. The reduction in the current high levels of
government domestic borrowing, due to a return to fiscal stability, is expected to facilitate a
reduction in risk premia and the decline in the implicit rate on government securities. This is
expected to reduce bank holdings of treasury bills, and increase the supply of loanable funds
thereby improving financial intermediation. The CBG will also consider staff’s recommendation to
help reduce bank costs by lowering the levels of statutory reserves.
As indicated by the joint Fund-Bank debt sustainability analysis, the level of public debt is high and
unsustainable and without full delivery of debt relief The Gambia is deemed to be under debt
distress. It is therefore very important for the country to enter into a PRGF arrangement which will
facilitate reaching the HIPC completion point and further debt relief under the MDRI. The Gambia
has made significant progress towards meeting completion point triggers and it is expected that the
completion point will be reached by mid 2007 and the fiscal space provided by the debt relief will
be used to increase pro-poor spending.
Achievement of high, sustainable and broad based growth is necessary for The Gambia to reduce
poverty and meet the MDGs. Significant progress has been made in the promotion of the tourism
sector which has attracted a lot of investment and has been growing at an annual average growth
rate of 10 percent since 2002. The authorities are cognizant of the important role of competitiveness
and the investment climate in promoting private sector led growth. The recent implementation of
the ECOWAS common external tariff and the increase of sales tax to be in line with regional taxes
is likely to have a negative effect on the competitiveness of the Gambia’s re-export trade to
neighboring countries. However, the authorities believe that, given the small size of the economy,

79
the potential benefits of regional integration and duty free access to the whole ECOWAS region will
outweigh the costs.
The authorities agree with staff that fast tracking structural reforms aimed at improving Gambia’s
external competitiveness and the investment climate is imperative. In this regard they have, with the
support of the World Bank, implemented the “Gateway” project which aims to make Gambia a
globally competitive export and processing centre through the expansion of private investment in
export oriented production and employment. Significant progress under the project has been made.
This includes the establishment of the Gambia Investment Promotion and Free Zone Agency
(GIPFZA), implementation of several road projects to improve transportation infrastructure,
development of physical infrastructure for the free zone and opening up of the energy and
telecommunications sectors to private participation.
Action has also been taken to strengthen the country’s legal framework and align the business
regulatory framework with the rest of the world. To this end, a commercial court was established in
2005 with the goal of speeding up dispute resolution and the authorities have requested the
Commonwealth Secretariat to assist with judges to clear the backlog of cases before the commercial
court. An Alternative Dispute Resolution Act has also been passed to alleviate the pressure on the
commercial court and work is underway to make it functional. In addition, the authorities are also
undertaking a review of the Companies Act to enhance its comprehensiveness and strengthen its
financial reporting provisions. The authorities acknowledge that more still needs to be done to
improve the business climate and they are committed to taking additional measures to make the
country a more attractive investment location.
The authorities acknowledge that the significant deficiencies in statistics complicate
macroeconomic analysis and policy formulation. They are therefore taking appropriate action to
alleviate this problem. In light of the capacity constraints being experienced in dealing with this
issue the authorities request continued technical assistance from the Fund in order to enhance
progress in this area.
In conclusion, we would like to reiterate the authorities’ commitment to consolidating progress
made towards macroeconomic stability, promotion of growth and implementation of their reform
agenda. They hope they can continue to count on the continued support of the Fund and the
international community in general in mitigating the enormous capacity and financial constraints
that they face in their pursuit of these objectives. This is particularly important for the country to
reduce poverty and make progress towards achieving the MDGs. The authorities look forward to the
negotiation of the new PRGF program later this month and to its successful implementation which
will pave the way for debt relief and creation of fiscal space to tackle poverty reduction.
