-3EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: Macroeconomic developments have generally been favorable, although a surge
in credit growth and a related sharp widening of the external current account deficit point to
possible economic overheating. Bank claims on the nongovernment sector rose by nearly
8 percentage points of GDP in 2003, and their growth shows no signs of easing.
Nevertheless, bank prudential indicators remain strong. A credit-induced import boom
widened the external current account deficit to 8½ percent of GDP. However, FDI inflows
have been strong, reserves are rising, and competitiveness appears broadly adequate. Fiscal
policy was tightened in 2003, as the government saved half of the revenue overperformance
and reduced the deficit to 0.4 percent of GDP. The pace of structural reform has slowed, with
two large privatizations and fiscal structural measures delayed. The government’s popularity
has stabilized at low levels, but it retains some latitude in policy implementation due to a
general wariness to hold early elections.
Discussions: The discussions focused on policies to contain the risks associated with the
widening current account deficit and rapid credit growth, and on advancing structural
reforms. Staff and authorities concurred that the widening external imbalance had increased
macroeconomic risks, and that a mix of short-run demand containment and medium-run
supply enhancement would be the appropriate way of addressing these risks. To this end, the
authorities indicated they would target a deficit of ½ percent of GDP this year, rather than
1¼ percent of GDP as originally planned. Moreover, they agreed to use any revenue
overperformance (likely in light of collections so far) to achieve balance. They also intend to
achieve budgetary balance in 2005-06, although EU-related expenditures were likely to
produce a deficit in 2007. In addition, they plan to reduce bank liquidity by tightening reserve
requirements and shifting government deposits from commercial banks to the central bank.
There was agreement that, in order to raise output and export capacity, structural reforms
needed to be revitalized, with staff underscoring the need for policies that spur FDI, critical
for growth in the medium term and for short-term external financing. The authorities broadly
agreed with Bulgaria’s ex post assessment, which concluded that a program-based
engagement with Bulgaria would be the most effective way of supporting the government’s
economic program in the run-up to EU accession in 2007.
Staff appraisal: The authorities’ macroeconomic program for 2004 represents an adequate
response to the heightened risks. However, the implied fiscal adjustment is small, and the
authorities should stand ready to tighten fiscal policy further if the external situation does not
improve as expected. Fiscal flexibility is particularly important as the planned measures to
reduce bank liquidity may be limited in their effect on credit growth due to the open capital
account. To provide room to respond to possible shocks, the authorities are right to aim at
fiscal balance in 2005–06 but they should take steps to contain fiscal deficits upon EU
accession in 2007. The authorities’ intention to complement demand management policies
with structural reforms aimed at enhancing supply is appropriate; in this regard, creation of a
new privatization pipeline for 2005-06 is particularly important.

-4I. INTRODUCTION
1.
A staff team1 visited Sofia during March 25-April 13, 2004 to conduct the 2004
Article IV consultation and discuss the Ex Post Assessment (EPA) of Bulgaria’s longerterm program engagement with the Fund. The mission also updated the 2001/02 FSAP.
Bulgaria’s relations with the Fund and IMF-World Bank collaboration in Bulgaria are
described in Appendices I and II, respectively.
2.
A two-year SBA expired on March 15, 2004, and the authorities have
expressed interest in a successor arrangement which they intend to treat as
precautionary. All purchases under the previous SBA were made. During the Article IV
mission, negotiations on a successor program were begun. The SBA discussions are expected
to be finalized in light of the Board’s discussion of the EPA.
3.
Support for the governing coalition appears to have stabilized at low levels, but
reform commitment is firmly anchored in the broadly shared goal of EU accession.
After losing last year’s local elections, pressures on the government to weaken economic
policies ahead of the mid–2005 parliamentary election have increased. However, all political
parties are wary of early elections, which might delay the closing of remaining EU accession
chapters. Therefore, despite losing its majority in parliament in March, the government has
retained some latitude in policy implementation.

discussions during March 29-April 5. The mission met with the Prime Minister, key
economic ministers, the Governor of the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB), parliamentarians
(including the main opposition party), and representatives of trade unions and the private
sector, and coordinated its work with World Bank staff.

decline, inflation has fallen to modest levels, and the external and public debt ratios have
declined markedly.
5.
In concluding the 2002 Article IV consultation, Executive Directors
emphasized the need for continued sound macroeconomic policies and further
structural reforms to prepare the economy for EU accession. As discussed in the EPA,
the government has broadly adhered to this policy advice (including by tightening the fiscal
stance in light of changed circumstances), although the pace of structural reform has
slackened reflecting political obstacles, and improving social indicators remains a key
challenge (Table 1). The government intends to reinvigorate structural reform, in the context
of prudent macroeconomic policies, with the support of Programmatic Adjustment Loans
(PALs) from the World Bank.

underpinned by credit growth. On the production side, growth was negatively affected by
a drought-related decline in agricultural output. Reflecting in equal measure active labor
market policies and private sector job creation, the unemployment rate dropped by
3½ percentage points between end-2002 and the first quarter of 2004, but remained high
at 13½ percent (seasonally adjusted). High-frequency indicators point to continued robust
growth in Q1/2004 (Figure 1).

Inflation has increased due to temporary factors. While consumer price inflation
averaged 2¼ percent in 2003, a drought-related jump in food prices raised 12-month CPI
inflation to 5½ percent at end-2003. Inflation accelerated further to 6¼ percent in March

-8of financial intermediation still relatively low, this credit boom reflects a catch-up from a
low base and has continued in 2004, with the 12-month rate remaining above 50 percent
in March 2004.2 Prudential indicators remain strong (Table 5). Broad money growth
accelerated to nearly 20 percent in 2003, reflecting the continued remonetization of the
economy. Interest rates on loans and deposits were broadly stable last year. Meanwhile,
the credit boom may have boosted real estate prices. Residential real estate prices—
essentially flat during 2000–02—increased by 12¼ percent in 2003.

Balance sheet vulnerabilities remain fairly sizable at the sectoral level (Appendix III).
However, the private sector’s large net short-term foreign-currency liabilities are more
than offset by the excess of the BNB’s international reserves over base money.

Fiscal policy was tighter than programmed in 2003, owing to revenue overperformance (Tables 7 and 8). As the current account deficit widened, the government saved
half of the revenue overperformance and balanced the budget in 2003,3 against a programmed
deficit of 0.7 percent of GDP. Notwithstanding a shortfall in grants of ½ percent of GDP,
revenue was 1½ percent of GDP higher than expected, mainly due to the import boom
(accounting for 80 percent of the overperformance) and improved tax collection. Expenditure
was 0.7 percent of GDP higher than budgeted, as government-mandated municipal spending
was, for the first time, fully funded and hospital arrears were cleared. Year-end wage and
pension bonuses and other nonbudgeted spending also limited fiscal savings.
8.
Notwithstanding progress in certain areas, the pace of structural reform has
slowed. Bank privatization was virtually completed in 2003. A new energy law was passed
and retail electricity and district heating prices were raised further toward cost-recovery
levels. The restructuring of district heating companies advanced, cutting subsidies to that
sector, and railway payrolls were reduced by 10 percent, while subsidies were better targeted.
In the fiscal area, the large taxpayer office was expanded, and program budgeting and better
budget preparation practices were initiated. However, crucial reforms experienced delays,
including selling the tobacco holding (Bulgartabac), finalizing the sale of the telecoms
company (BTC),4 operationalizing the National Revenue Agency (NRA), and reforming the
health, education, and railway sectors.
III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
A. Key Strategic Issues
9.
Despite a generally strong policy record and improved fundamentals, the
Bulgarian economy faces some key challenges and vulnerabilities on its way to EU
accession:
•

The surge in credit growth and the related weakening of the external current account are
the most apparent and unexpected developments since the last Article IV consultation. To
what extent do these developments involve macroeconomic risks and how could policies
minimize them?

•

Maintaining a tight fiscal stance may become difficult in the run-up to the election,
particularly given the reduced support for the government. Will the authorities resist
pressures to increase spending?

3
4

The deficit was 0.4 percent of GDP under the new definition discussed in paragraph 18.

The long-awaited sale of a 65 percent stake in BTC was signed in February, but a dispute
about granting BTC a GSM license has again delayed the completion of the sale.

- 11 •

Growth performance is satisfactory but further progress is needed to reduce the income
gap vis-à-vis the most advanced European transition countries and to reduce poverty.
How can this be achieved and what are the priorities in this area?

The Article IV discussions focused on these questions. Based on the EPA, the discussions
also covered the nature of future IMF engagement in Bulgaria.
10.
Staff and authorities concurred that the widening external current account
deficit had increased macroeconomic risks. The credit expansion did not raise immediate
financial stability issues (see below), but had spurred imports, moving the external deficit
into dangerous territory. Stabilizing the external debt ratio with a current account deficit of 89 percent of GDP over the medium term would require inflows of FDI in excess of those
projected. Moreover, in view of its level, a decline in the debt ratio would reduce external
risks.5 Therefore, over the medium term, with privatization inflows shrinking, staff and
authorities concurred that a deficit higher than some 7 percent of GDP would likely involve
an increase in the external debt ratio from still sizable levels. Thus, the current external
position involved some risks. The authorities noted that, to some extent, these risks were
mitigated by the rising export capacity associated with higher investment goods imports.
However, staff pointed out that consumer goods imports had also risen rapidly, and that a
significant share of investment—two thirds in 2003—was in the nontradable sector and
would thus not raise export capacity. Altogether, while markets so far had taken a benign
attitude, there was a need to minimize risks, particularly in the context of the CBA, and
policies had to be adjusted to gradually reduce the deficit to levels consistent with a mediumterm reduction of the external debt ratio.
11.
The current account weakening was seen primarily as reflecting a creditinduced rise in private domestic demand in excess of potential growth. Competitiveness
remained broadly adequate (Box 1 and Figure 5). The CPI-based REER suggested some loss
of competitiveness vis-à-vis some non-EU members, but unit labor costs in manufacturing
had continued to decline and Bulgaria’s share in EU and world imports had risen.
12.
Thus, there was broad agreement that economic policies should aim, in the
short run, to contain domestic demand; and in the medium term, to boost export and
output capacity. The authorities noted that focusing only on restrictive policies would not be
sustainable over the medium term. Staff agreed, but underscored that relieving the external
constraints and accelerating growth would require revitalizing structural reform. In this
context, policies to spur FDI would be particularly important, as FDI would support the
growth process over the medium term, while financing the external deficit over the short run.

Chapter II of Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix (to be issued) discusses external
sustainability. Similar trends—rapid credit growth combined with sizable current account
deficits financed largely by FDI—were observed in other accession countries (Figure 4).

Box 1. Competitiveness Indicators
Bulgaria’s competitiveness remains broadly adequate, but warrants close monitoring.
Real effective exchange rate (REER) and unit labor costs (ULCs): Bulgaria’s CPI-based REER has
recently appreciated more rapidly than the currencies of other CEE countries whose exchange rates are
not rigidly pegged to the euro (Figure 5). However, a comparison with the Eurozone indicates that ULCs
in manufacturing have declined strongly (Box Figure 1). Also, ULCs in manufacturing decreased while
the manufacturing producer price index (PPI) increased, suggesting increasing profitability of Bulgarian
producers of tradables. On the other hand, the total PPI recently increased more strongly than the
manufacturing PPI, pointing to a shift in relative profitability towards nontradables (Box Figure 2),
though this effect is weakened as economy-wide unit labor costs have remained flat while they were
falling in manufacturing.

Productivity and wage growth: While economy-wide productivity growth turned negative in 2003, this
partly reflected government-sponsored employment creation. Productivity declined only in the services
sector, while it has continued to increase in manufacturing, above the rate of real wage growth (Box
Figure 3).1 However, low wages are also a reflection of Bulgaria’s apparent lag behind other CEE
countries in qualitative productivity indicators, as suggested for example in the recent Lisbon review of
competitiveness. 2
Exports: Despite the appreciation of the euro (and with it, the lev), exports grew rapidly during 2003,
and Bulgaria’s market share in the EU increased, broadly in line with other CEE countries (with flexible
exchange rates) (Figure 5). Bulgaria’s share in world imports also increased (Box Figure 4).

On the tools to contain domestic demand, views were more nuanced. Staff
regarded fiscal policy as the key tool to restrain demand, as the CBA constrained monetary
policy actions. The authorities concurred that fiscal policy was critical, but noted that its
flexibility during the budget year was limited. Moreover, considerable uncertainty remained
on the cyclical strength of demand going forward, and the immediate risks to the external
account did not seem excessive. Finally, fiscal policy was constrained by the political
difficulty of running surpluses when this was not justified by long-term fiscal needs. Such
political constraints were even more acute in the run-up to next year’s election. Altogether,
their strategy to contain demand involved tightening fiscal policy with respect to initial plans,
but also moderating credit growth by draining banking system liquidity. It was agreed that the
effectiveness of this policy would depend on the elasticity of capital inflows to domestic
monetary conditions. Nonetheless, it was a strategy worth trying, also in light of the
difficulties of centering all the adjustment on fiscal policy. However, the authorities should
stand ready to tighten fiscal policy and/or implement credit measures beyond current plans if
needed.
B. Macroeconomic Framework
14.
Authorities and staff broadly concurred that the 2004 macroeconomic outlook
was favorable, assuming appropriate policies (Figure 6 and Table 9):
•

Real GDP growth would increase to 5 percent, as a reduction in the negative external
sector contribution—reflecting slower import growth owing to reduced credit
expansion—was expected to more than offset the slowdown in domestic demand. From
the supply side, output growth should benefit from a recovery in agriculture and high
investment.

•

Average consumer price inflation, at 5¾ percent, would be higher than in 2003, but the
12-month inflation rate should fall to 3½ percent by year-end as the temporary factors
driving recent price increases unwind.

•

With measures to restrain bank liquidity, growth in credit to the nongovernment sector
should fall to 26 percent year on year by end-2004.

•

After widening further in the first quarter, the 12-month current account deficit should
narrow as credit decelerated, although the deficit was likely to be broadly unchanged for
the year as a whole (at 8.2 percent of GDP). A further increase in FDI—owing partly to
privatization receipts—should ensure 82 percent coverage of the deficit and, combined
with other capital inflows, a further rise in international reserves. The gross external debt
ratio would decline by half a percentage point of GDP.

15.
There was also agreement about the risks to this favorable scenario: (i) credit
and import growth might not slow as expected, as capital inflows might replace reduced
domestic liquidity; (ii) external demand might be softer than projected, e.g., reflecting a
weaker-than-expected recovery in the EU; and (iii) FDI might not develop as expected,

- 17 e.g., reflecting implementation risk ahead of the election. If these risks materialize, the
external position would weaken, possibly requiring further policy adjustment. Another key
risk, of a more medium-term nature, is that continued rapid credit expansion might in time
lead to increased financial vulnerabilities, including deteriorating bank asset quality and an
asset price bubble, with potentially disruptive macroeconomic implications.
16.
The authorities’ medium-term outlook envisaged robust growth, low inflation,
and a gradual narrowing of the current account deficit (Table 9).
•

Staff concurred that medium-term growth of 5-5½ percent was achievable. This would
require an increase in the investment ratio, reforms to boost productivity, and increases in
labor force participation and employment in the face of a declining working age
population.6 Inflation should fall to 3½ percent, slightly above EU levels owing to
productivity catch-up effects.

•

Higher investment needs would be met by a rise in the private saving rate, reflecting
higher per capita income, rising corporate profitability, financial deepening, and other
structural (e.g., legal) reforms. Public saving would rise due to a shift from current to
capital expenditure.

•

Reflecting these developments—and in the later years, EU transfers—the current account
deficit would decline gradually to 6 percent of GDP by 2009. Initially, relatively high
deficits would mostly be covered by FDI, boosted by privatization receipts. Subsequently,
declining deficits are expected to be largely financed by greenfield FDI. The external debt
ratio would decline to 43 percent, with international reserves remaining at a comfortable
level.

•

A sustainability exercise shows that only in a scenario featuring lower exports, higher
imports and smaller FDI inflows would the external debt ratio rise to 64 percent in 2009
(Tables 10-13).7
C. Fiscal Policy

17.
Staff proposed a reclassification of some below-the-line capital transfers as
expenditure to reflect the true underlying fiscal stance. Such transfers were similar to
subsidies and had an expansionary demand effect. Staff also urged the authorities to move to
accrual accounting in line with international standards.

- 18 18.
The authorities concurred, and presented their fiscal plans for 2004 under the
new methodology. The 2004 budget envisaged a deficit (after reclassification) of 1¼ percent
of GDP, a fiscal expansion with

percent of GDP this year, bringing the Overall fiscal balance including B-T-L operations

19.
Staff would have preferred a more ambitious fiscal adjustment, and suggested
saving any revenue overperformance. Staff argued that it was particularly important that
revenue overperformance, which appeared likely given the outcome of the first few months,
be saved rather than spent. The authorities acknowledged that the revenue projections, which
reflect only a partial offset of lower direct taxes by higher indirect taxes, were conservative.
However, they noted that revenue buoyancy would not necessarily mean that domestic
demand was rising faster than expected. Altogether, they intended to save up to ½ percent of
GDP of any revenue overperformance, potentially bringing the budget into balance this year
and achieving a fiscal tightening vis-à-vis 2003. A more ambitious target would be
considered only if external developments deviated from their baseline. Staff warned that
additional fiscal adjustment could be needed, and that fiscal policy therefore should remain
flexible.
20.
Staff welcomed the intention to focus the fiscal correction on the expenditure
side, given inefficiencies in public spending. To achieve the fiscal tightening, the
authorities intended to limit late-year unbudgeted spending by cutting the wage bill (mainly
by sequestering unfilled vacancies) and reducing to more realistic levels projections for
capital spending and interest payments. Staff welcomed this adjustment, but argued that
larger reductions in the wage bill and other current spending would have been preferable. As
a precaution, the authorities would continue to cap discretionary spending at 93 percent of the
downward revised levels through the third quarter. Given the macroeconomic situation and
the need to clarify the scheme for building motorways, the authorities said that the transfer to
the road enterprise proposed in the budget would not take place in 2004.
21.
Improved tax administration and expenditure management would help achieve
fiscal objectives in 2004 and beyond. The authorities intended to maintain a tax system with
low rates and few exemptions while continuing to shift from direct to indirect taxation. Tax
administration would be improved with the implementation of the NRA in 2005. Efforts to
combat tax evasion and fraud were being stepped up with the establishment of a “tax police.”
The 2005 budget preparation was being brought forward, while program budgeting was being
introduced in additional ministries. The incorporation of the lev-denominated accounts of all
autonomous budgetary entities in the Treasury Single Account as well as the deployment of
the Financial Management Information System (FMIS) in all ministries would further
enhance expenditure management. Finally, the authorities planned to strengthen local

- 19 government finances through closer monitoring. Staff welcomed these measures and urged
their expeditious implementation, noting that the NRA and FMIS reforms were well behind
schedule.
22.
The authorities were targeting budget balance in 2005-06, but deficits would
reemerge from 2007. Regarding 2005, they noted that if the external position were to
improve faster than expected, a small deficit may be envisaged. Detailed policies were still
being developed, but the authorities planned to further lower the corporate and personal
income tax rates and introduce tax breaks for families. The revenue shortfall was expected to
be only partially offset by raising excise taxes toward minimum EU levels and improved tax
collection. Staff cautioned that the envisaged changes may threaten the achievement of fiscal
balance in 2005. On the expenditure side, better targeted social spending and outlays related
to EU accession and infrastructure remained priorities. The wage bill increase in 2005 would
be limited to projected inflation, and subsidies further reduced. However, the authorities felt
that EU-related expenditure would lead to a deficit of 2-3 percent of GDP from 2007.8 Staff
cautioned that a deficit of this size would reduce the scope for countercyclical fiscal policy,
particularly as Bulgaria was likely to be subject to the Maastricht rules soon after EU
accession. Staff therefore recommended adjusting priorities to make room for EU-related
spending, while allowing a small temporary deficit in 2007 reflecting the pre-payment of
agricultural subsidies related to the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy.
23.

2013, with rising surpluses thereafter.
But these surpluses would likely be
used to strengthen the fully-funded second pillar of the pension system and reduce the high
contribution rates. Moreover, the outlook assumed that the current pension indexation
practice (¼ wages, ¾ prices) would be maintained. To reduce discretion, staff recommended
that this indexation formula be enshrined in law. Also, the certification process for disability
pensions needed to be strengthened. The authorities saw merit in staff’s suggestions, which
they intended to implement soon. Health care faces long-term sustainability risks, and needed
reforms include expanding the activity-based financing of hospitals to induce restructuring

requirements of EU accession.

- 20 and stricter controls over claims and reimbursements. While generally committed to these
reforms, the authorities pointed to the difficulty of overcoming political resistance.
D. Incomes Policy and Labor Market Flexibility
24.
The authorities believed that continued implementation of a strict incomes
policy and increasing labor market flexibility were needed to strengthen
competitiveness. They noted that a restrained public sector wage policy would provide
guidance to private sector wage bargaining. Along with restraint on the government wage
bill, the nominal increase in the aggregate wage bill of the 60 largest public enterprises that
are monopolies, were subsidized, or made losses in the third quarter of 2003 would be limited
to 4 percent in 2004. The authorities intended, in collaboration with the World Bank, to
amend the labor law with a view to making entry to and exit from work more flexible. They
planned to continue active labor market policies to reintegrate the long-term unemployed.
Staff cautioned that care should be taken to ensure that these policies do not result in
prolonged hidden public sector employment.
E. Financial and External Sector Policies
25.
Staff and authorities agreed that increased financial intermediation was good
from a structural perspective, after years of depressed bank lending in the wake of the
1996-97 crisis. Moreover, as confirmed by the FSAP follow-up (Box 2), financial stability
and prudential risks did not seem to constitute a major concern at this stage. Staff
commended the BNB for tightening loan classification and provisioning requirements,
increasing the frequency and focus of on-site inspections, extending its credit register, and
restricting the conditions under which current profits can be included in regulatory capital.
26.
However, high credit growth was more problematic from a macroeconomic
perspective, and discussions focused on how a deceleration could be achieved. A
reduction in some banks’ liquidity and the increasing share of loans in banks’ portfolios
would likely lead to some deceleration of bank credit even in the absence of new measures.
However, in order to minimize risks on the external side, the authorities concurred that credit
could be decelerated by (i) transferring certain government deposits held in commercial
banks to the BNB; and (ii) tightening reserve requirements by broadening the coverage of
liabilities subject to reserve requirements to instruments with maturities of two years or
above and excluding part of banks’ cash in vault from the reserve requirement calculation.
Altogether, these measures—which would be implemented in the second and third quarters
of 2004—amount to 13¾ percent of reserve money. While sizable, the efficacy of these
measures would depend on the responsiveness of capital flows to domestic monetary
conditions, and their effect on credit growth would need to be monitored closely. Staff
pointed to the need for further measures—including minimum liquid asset ratios—if these
measures did not produce the expected decline in credit growth.

- 21 -

Box 2. FSAP Follow-Up1
Bulgaria’s banking sector continues to operate in an environment of sound supervision, and
high capital, profitability and liquidity levels. So far, financial sector vulnerabilities remain
contained, a result supported by the authorities’ stress tests. Rapid credit growth remains the key
concern. Credit expansion was strongest in new markets, such as consumer and mortgage lending,
which, if sustained, could give rise to new sources of vulnerabilities:
•

•

•

Credit risk must be monitored closely. So far, asset quality remains adequate. However,
asset quality indicators do not necessarily provide early warnings of future problems and the
authorities need to strengthen their ability to monitor the overall indebtedness of the private
sector, as credit activities may increasingly shift to the nonbank financial sector.
Foreign borrowing may generate foreign exchange risk. With the exclusion of euros from
the prudential open foreign currency position limit, banks may borrow disproportionately from
abroad in euros in an effort to sustain credit growth, potentially producing large currency
mismatches. However, as balance sheet analyses indicate, this risk is mitigated by large foreign
reserves of the BNB.
New credit products may introduce liquidity risk and raise interest rate risk. As banks are
increasingly extending longer-term credit, their balance sheets may exhibit wider maturity
mismatches, which may need to be regulated. Furthermore, the limited shift to fixed interest
rates on longer-term contracts could raise interest rate risk.

The authorities have implemented several FSAP recommendations, including:
•

Creation of a financial sector supervisory coordination committee, and, on its
recommendation, a single supervisory agency for nonbank financial institutions, the
Financial Sector Commission. Its supervisory capacity, regulatory framework, and enforcement
powers, however, need further strengthening, with a focus on the insurance sector.
• Introduction of a more effective bank insolvency regime. However, its implementation
remains either largely untested (no new bank insolvency) or slow (in resolving old problem
banks).
• Progress in identifying and assessing the soundness of banks’ ownership structure. Where
necessary, a process of capital restructuring and replacement of off-shore shareholders was
initiated.
• Creation of a Council for Financial Stability. While important for improving inter-agency
cooperation, the authorities need to strengthen their ability to monitor and assess how crosssectoral linkages affect financial stability.
• Updated payment system, including the launch of a new real-time interbank gross-settlement
system.

- 22 27.
The government’s financial asset and liability management would also take
into account the need to withdraw liquidity from the banking system. The government’s
strategy of shifting from external to domestic borrowing would help absorb bank liquidity,
and contribute to developing the domestic capital market. Indeed, domestic borrowing could
be stepped up for this purpose. As part of their debt management strategy, the authorities are
considering prepaying some of their obligations to the Fund, and may buy back or prepay
some other external obligations, subject to maintaining an adequate level of international
reserves, in excess of base money as required by the CBA.
28.
The authorities' trade policies continue to follow guidance from the European
Commission prior to EU accession. In response to the poor 2003 harvest and the
consequent increase in food prices, the authorities introduced a temporary ban on exports of
wheat and flour, which is scheduled to expire on July 31, 2004.
F. Other Structural Reforms
29.
The authorities concurred that an improved business climate was essential to
stimulate investment and growth. They were reforming company registration and dispute
resolution procedures, judgment enforcement, collateral law, and corporate governance.
Furthermore, laws simplifying investment procedures and providing assistance to investors
had been submitted to parliament. Staff noted that these laws should avoid special tax
incentives. The authorities reported that corruption had been declining and corruption
indicators (e.g., Transparency International) placed Bulgaria favorably among other countries
in the region. Nevertheless, they remained committed to implementing the 2001 anticorruption strategy, focusing on reducing corruption in the civil service.
30.
Staff stressed the need to complete pending privatizations and create a new
pipeline for 2005-06. The authorities indicated that the BTC sale was nearly completed, that
final bids for the power distribution companies would be accepted by end-June, and that,
after a long delay, a new privatization advisor was preparing the companies of Bulgartabac
for sale, possibly as early as this year. Looking to 2005-06, staff urged the authorities to
develop privatization plans (including for the electricity generation sector), in cooperation
with the World Bank, which would allow maintaining a sustained FDI flow and increase
efficiency in the energy and transport sectors.
31.
The authorities agreed that further reforms in the railway and energy sectors
were critical to the government’s medium-term fiscal strategy and to removing
impediments to sustained higher growth. Reform of the energy sector was proceeding
well: the energy regulator would announce a 10 percent increase in the average household
electricity and district heating prices to take effect on July 1, 2004, thus allowing these
utilities to achieve short-term cost recovery—based on estimates made two years ago—and
reducing their need for subsidies. Staff recommended articulating a strategy for the electricity
sector, in consultation with the World Bank. The authorities reiterated their commitment, in
collaboration with the World Bank, to make the railway sector sustainable, by further
reducing payroll and increasing tariffs.

- 23 IV. RELATIONS WITH THE FUND
32.
Discussions with the authorities and former government officials revealed no
major disagreements with the analysis and conclusions of the EPA paper. Current and
former officials had two main comments on the assessment which are reflected in its final
version: (i) they emphasized that the recent slowdown of reform reflected greater obstacles
compared to the period immediately after the crisis when the case for key reforms was
apparent; and (ii) they stressed the critical role of the CBA in restoring the credibility of the
economic policy framework.
33.
Looking ahead, the EPA concludes that a program-based engagement would
be the most effective way of supporting the government’s economic program, given that
economic risks are nontrivial and that a program could help mobilize support for
appropriate policies on the way to EU accession. The EPA notes that, following the
successful stabilization in 1997, the longer-term program engagement with Bulgaria had not
reflected a lack of receptivity to Fund advice, but rather the authorities’ appreciation for that
advice. As a result, most of the drawbacks usually associated with longer-term program
engagement—diminished incentives, loss of credibility for the Fund in supporting weak
programs, poor ownership, and a weakening of the surveillance function of the Fund—do not
apply to Bulgaria.
V. OTHER ISSUES
34.
The authorities reported on further progress in improving data quality and
complying with international standards and codes. Data quality and timeliness are
generally adequate for surveillance and program monitoring, but some deficiencies remain
(Appendix IV). In December 2003, Bulgaria subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard. The authorities have implemented all but one of the recommendations of the 2002
safeguards assessment—the establishment within the BNB of an audit committee—a function
they feel is already performed by the BNB’s monetary board. The authorities’ efforts to
combat money laundering and financing of terrorism have continued since the 2001/02
FSAP, including by bringing the anti-money laundering law into compliance with EU
standards and enacting a new law to counter terrorism financing.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
Bulgaria’s economic performance has remained solid, reflecting prudent
macroeconomic policies and progress with structural reforms, but external
vulnerability has increased. The authorities’ policy framework, centered on a CBA, has
helped to deliver robust growth—despite weak external demand—modest inflation, and
falling external and public debt ratios. Significant progress has been made in establishing a
flexible market economy, and falling unit labor costs in manufacturing have supported
competitiveness. The authorities are committed to continuing this policy approach, which
includes maintaining the CBA until euro adoption, implementing prudent fiscal and incomes
policies, and reinvigorating structural reforms. While this strategy continues to be well-suited

- 24 to Bulgaria’s needs, rising external vulnerability highlights the need for vigilance and
steadfast policy implementation, especially in the area of structural reform.
36.
Thus, the authorities face considerable challenges, both on the macroeconomic
and structural fronts. The expansion of bank credit is a healthy phenomenon from a
structural perspective, and there appears at present to be little threat to financial stability,
given strong supervisory practices of the BNB and banks’ sound financial position. However,
the credit boom has led to an import surge and a sharp widening of the external current
account deficit. If left unchecked, rapid credit growth may further exacerbate the external
imbalance, possibly leading to a reversal of the favorable external debt dynamics of recent
years. On the structural front, progress has slowed: remaining large state monopolies—in
particular, BTC and Bulgartabac—have still not been privatized; little progress in reforming
the health, education, and railway sectors has been made recently; and further progress is
needed to improve the business climate. Reform in these areas is critical to unleash the
economy’s potential and help reduce vulnerabilities.
37.
To address these challenges, the authorities should tighten macroeconomic
policies and advance structural reform more forcefully. The heightened macroeconomic
risks accompanying the credit boom and the widening external imbalance should be
countered by a mix of policies—within the constraints of the CBA—to moderate demand and
enhance the economy’s supply response and export capacity: (i) a more prudent fiscal stance;
(ii) draining liquidity from the banking system while pursuing the recommendations of the
FSAP follow-up; and (iii) accelerating structural reforms. The timely adoption of such
policies would also support maintaining the CBA until euro introduction.
38.
Against this background, the authorities’ macroeconomic program for 2004/05
represents an adequate response, although a more ambitious fiscal adjustment would
have been preferable, particularly this year. The authorities should be commended for
reversing the expansionary stance underlying the 2004 budget, and for envisaging a
tightening in 2005. In this respect, with tax revenues likely to exceed the conservative budget
projections, it will be critical that the lowered spending ceilings are not exceeded until budget
balance is reached. Thereafter, the authorities should consider saving a portion of any
continued revenue overperformance. Without such additional savings, the fiscal target for
2004 involves a broadly neutral stance vis-à-vis 2003, with little dampening effect on
domestic demand. A more ambitious fiscal target would haven been preferable, and any
deterioration of the current account or inflation would warrant further adjustment. The
authorities’ willingness to introduce measures to reduce credit growth is also welcome.
However, while sizable, their effectiveness remains to be seen in the context of an open
capital account. Thus, fiscal flexibility needs to be maintained to respond promptly should
credit growth continue to fuel excessive growth in domestic demand and imports.
39.
Considerable pressures threaten the medium-term fiscal position. The
authorities’ strategy of shifting from direct to indirect taxation is appropriate, but care needs
to be taken that its implementation does not worsen the fiscal balance. The planned reforms
to strengthen tax administration and expenditure management are welcome but need to be
implemented without delay. Of particular importance are measures to ensure the medium-

- 25 term sustainability of the pension and health care systems. As entering ERM2 with a solid
fiscal position is important, the authorities should take timely steps to contain the fiscal
deficits upon EU accession. The fiscal expansion currently envisaged for 2007 involves
significant risks.
40.
The authorities are right in complementing demand management policies with
structural reforms aimed at enhancing supply. Their focus on measures to strengthen the
business climate to attract FDI is appropriate in this context. Among these measures,
privatization is also critical to meeting Bulgaria’s external financing requirements in the next
few years and to increasing productivity. For these reasons, the authorities’ plans to complete
the long-delayed sales of BTC and Bulgartabac are welcome, and they are encouraged to
adhere to the schedule for the sale of the electricity distributors. For 2005-06, they should
create a new privatization pipeline. These measures need to be supplemented with further
reforms in the labor market—in particular, to facilitate entry to and exit from work.
41.
As important macroeconomic risks remain, continued Fund engagement under
a successor stand-by arrangement would be appropriate provided that sufficiently
strong policies can be agreed. Fund support would facilitate internal consensus on policy
implementation, including in the run-up to next year’s election, and provide confidence to
foreign investors and lenders. Given the long-term program engagement and the absence of
an imminent financing need, a new SBA should have lower access and be precautionary. EU
accession, expected in early 2007, would serve as a natural exit from a program-based
relationship with the Fund.
42.
Given the strong international reserve position, the authorities’ intention to
make repayments to the Fund on the expectations schedule is appropriate. Maintenance
of an adequate reserve cover should guide the authorities’ plans to prepay external
obligations.
43.
Data quality and transparency have improved substantially. Data are adequate
for surveillance and program monitoring, and the BNB’s safeguards practices are broadly
adequate.

1/ Pension and unemployment contributions were combined in January 2002.
2/ Includes additional compulsory social security contributions (for the second pillar of the pension system) for public sector employees.
3/ Under the 2003 and 2004 budget, these transfers were envisaged to be made below the line for various purposes. From 2007 includes contribution
to EU budget.
4/ The deficit is 2007 is due to the pre-payment of subsidies related to the Common Agricultural Policy to farmers, which are expected to be refunded to the
government the following year through a transfer from the EU.
5/ Slight differences between privatization receipts in the balance of payments and the fiscal accounts are due to domestic privatization. In 2004, however, 500
million leva (1.3 percent of GDP) of previously completed bank privatizations will be transferred to the government upon the closure of the Bank Consolidation
Company.

2/ Gross domestic saving equals gross national saving less net factor income and transfers from abroad. The government
contribution to gross domestic saving equals revenues less current expenditures, excluding external interest payments.
3/ From 2003 onwards, includes below-the-line transfers. In 2003, balance excluding below-the-line transfers was 0.0 percent of GDP.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in euro terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in euro value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
4/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; euro deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
5/ Nominal export growth at 95 percent of baseline scenario, nominal import growth at 105 percent of baseline scenario, net FDI (excluding privatization) at 80 percent of baseline scenario, and no privatization of energy generation companies and Bulgartabac.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, euro deflator growth, and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain
at their levels of the last projection year.

1/ Defined as non-interest current account deficit, plus interest and amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
2/ Gross external financing under the stress-test scenarios is derived by assuming the same ratio of short-term to total debt as in the baseline scenario and the same average maturity on medium- and long term
debt. Interest expenditures are derived by applying the respective interest rate to the previous period debt stock under each alternative scenario.
3/Nominal export growth at 95 percent of baseline scenario, nominal import growth at 105 percent of baseline scenario, net FDI (excluding privatization) at 80 percent of baseline scenario, and no privatization of energy generation companies and Bulgartabac.

Safeguards Assessment:

Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) was subject to
an assessment with respect to the SBA arrangement which was approved on February 27, 2002. The
assessment, which was completed on June 12, 2002, identified certain weaknesses and made
appropriate recommendations, as reported in IMF Country Report No. 02/174. The BNB has
implemented most of the safeguards recommendations and committed to implementing the
remaining ones. Currently, the BNB is subject to a subsequent assessment with respect to the
expected new arrangement. The necessary documentation has been provided by the authorities and
the assessment is underway.
VIII.

Exchange Arrangement:

An amendment to the Law on the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) effectively established a currency
board arrangement from July 1, 1997. The deutsche mark was chosen as the peg currency, which
has since been replaced with the euro at the rate of lev 1.95583 per € 1 at par. The BNB is required
to sell and purchase on demand and without restriction currencies of EU member countries for leva
on the basis of spot exchange rates that may not differ from the official exchange rate by more than
0.5 percent. Bulgaria has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles
of Agreement, and maintains an exchange rate system that is free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions.
IX.

Article IV Consultation:

The last Article IV consultation was concluded on July 22, 2002 (see IMF Country Report
No. 02/174). Bulgaria is on a 24-month cycle. The Acting Chairman’s summing-up of the
discussion was circulated as SUR/02/80.

APPENDIX II

Bulgaria: IMF-World Bank Relations

A. Partnership in Bulgaria’s Development Strategy
1.
The government’s economic program has been underpinned by a conservative fiscal
policy and significant progress with structural reforms. So far Bulgaria has made substantial
progress towards long-term macroeconomic stability—an important step along the way to its
ultimate goals of improving living standards and accession to the EU. The wide-ranging
reforms in the government’s agenda hinge on the continuing challenge of macroeconomic
stability in the context of the Currency Board Arrangement (CBA), sustaining structural
reforms and establishing a business environment conducive to growth, together with
improved governance, a deeper financial system, and investment in human capital and
physical infrastructure.
2.
The IMF has been leading in supporting Bulgaria’s medium-term program in
maintaining macroeconomic stability. Building on the achievements of the three-year
Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement with Bulgaria, in February 2002 the IMF Board
approved a two-year Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with Bulgaria. The SBA, with a reduced
scope and detail of structural conditionality compared to the EFF, focused on medium-term
fiscal challenges and structural reforms with significant macroeconomic, typically fiscal,
implications. Currently the IMF and the government are discussing a new 2-year
precautionary program.
3.
The World Bank has been leading the policy dialogue in structural and institutional
reforms aiming at (i) promoting competitive private sector-led growth; (ii) strengthening
market institutions and improving both corporate and public sector governance; and
(iii) mitigating the social impact of restructuring and delivering social services more
effectively. In May 2002 the Board of Directors discussed the Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) of the Bank which outlined the roadmap for the Bank’s country support for the period
2002–04. In addition to the Bank’s ongoing lending operations in areas such as health, child
welfare, water, trade and transport, environment, land registration and cadastre, the CAS
includes a three-year programmatic adjustment lending (PAL) program of up to three PALs
of up to US$150 million each. In February 2003, the Board of Directors approved the first
PAL operation—it aimed at advancing structural, regulatory, and institutional reforms in the
real and financial sectors. The second PAL, PAL-2, aims at supporting improvements in
public sector governance. The Bank continues to undertake substantive country diagnostics
providing a solid base for policy dialogue and design and implementation of its lending
operations in Bulgaria.
B. IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
4.
In general, the Bank has the lead on the dialogue on the core structural aspects of the
reforms while the Fund has the lead on the dialogue on the macroeconomic, typically fiscal,
aspects of the reforms. There are a number of areas where the IMF leads and its analyses
serve as inputs into World Bank policy formulation and advice, including policies to maintain

- 45 -

APPENDIX II

macroeconomic stability, fiscal policies, income policies and external sector policies. There
are other areas in which the Bank and the Fund share responsibility and are coordinating
closely their policy advice to the Bulgarian authorities such as in the financial sector, public
expenditure management and budgeting, and tax administration. In some areas, the Bank has
taken the lead but its analysis, country diagnostic work, and policy recommendations served
as inputs into the Fund’s policy advice on the fiscal front such as education, health care,
pensions, social protection, energy, and railways. In areas such as private sector development,
strengthening market institutions (including entry and exit policies, regulatory reform to
enhance the business climate, judicial reform, labor market reform), and improving
governance the Bank has the lead and there has been no conditionality under Fund programs.
In addition to consultations early in the process of formulating and adjusting each
institution’s program with Bulgaria, the Bank and Fund staff teams interact extensively
during the review of the progress achieved in the country and coordinate closely their policy
advice to the Bulgarian authorities.
B.1. Areas where the IMF leads and its analyses serve as inputs into the World Bank
policy formulation and advice.
5.
To achieve the objectives of its economic program, the Bulgarian authorities are fully
committed to maintain sound and flexible macroeconomic policies centered on a Currency
Board Arrangement (CBA) and implement an ambitious reform agenda. In particular, the
authorities have maintained a very tight fiscal policy since 1998 and, attaining a deficit of 0.4
percent of GDP in 2003. The aim is to eliminate the deficit by 2005, conduct fiscal policy
flexibly in the face of shocks, and maintain a high level of fiscal reserve assets. Given the
constraints of the CBA, the authorities see labor market policies as another key component of
the broad policy strategy. A strict incomes policy for the state enterprise sector is enforced
and measures aimed at facilitating the adjustment of labor markets are being implemented.
The structural and institutional reforms, which constitute the third pillar of the policy
strategy, are focused on creating a fully functioning market economy that is competitive and
can flexibly adjust to shocks.
6.
In the context of a 24-month Stand-By Arrangement that expired on March 15, 2004,
the IMF took the lead in assisting Bulgaria in safeguarding macroeconomic stability and
promoting structural reforms in areas that are macro-critical and fall within the Fund's core
expertise. To safeguard the CBA and ensure that it can continue to serve as the
macroeconomic policy anchor, the IMF set ceilings on the size of the overall deficit of the
general government and quantitative floors on the balance of the fiscal reserve account. To
prevent threats to the currency board and macroeconomic stability that could arise from a loss
in competitiveness or excessive external financing requirements, Fund conditionality also
included ceilings on the wage bill of those state enterprises that have the largest losses and
arrears, are monopolies, and receive subsidies, and on the contracting and guaranteeing of
public sector external debt. A new 2-year precautionary program is currently being discussed.

- 46 B.2.

APPENDIX II

Areas of shared responsibility.

7.
Financial Sector. In late 2001, staff of the two institutions carried out a joint IMFWorld Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) for Bulgaria, providing a shared
perspective on the development agenda of the country and on the prioritization and
sequencing of reforms in the financial sector. Key findings of the FSAP are conditionalities
on financial sector policies under both the SBA and the PAL program. The IMF has
emphasized aspects related to the banking sector—mainly on policies under the mandate of
BNB and supervisory agencies—while the World Bank is focusing on policies that affect
market performance and development of the financial sector such as improving the legal and
institutional framework for lending, restructuring of the banking sector, strengthening
creditor rights, corporate insolvency and governance, and non-banking financial sector issues.
A focused update of the FSAP was undertaken by Fund staff in the context of the 2004
Article IV consultation mission in March–April 2004.
8.
Since 1997, in the context of two Finance and Enterprise Adjustment Loans
(FESALs), and now with the PAL program, the Bank has supported the government in sector
restructuring of the financial sector. Privatization of commercial banks has been a major
component of the FESALs, while the Fund provided support for the institution building
efforts of the BNB and its Banking Supervision Department in particular. In the financial
sector, the Bank has focused on banking, insurance, pension funds, and capital markets while
the Fund has continued its focus on the BNB, banking supervision, and the payments system.
9.
Revenue Administration. The IMF and the World Bank have been carrying out a
joint effort since 1996 to assist Bulgaria in reforms aimed at the establishment of an efficient
revenue collection agency. Diagnostics consistently pointed to revenue collection deficiencies
including weak management, and problematic audit and enforcement of collection, which in
turn facilitates low compliance. Supporting reform efforts, the World Bank implemented a
project to modernize the Social Security Institute, including its revenue collection activities.
The IMF provided a long-term advisor to the Ministry of Finance, and focused advisory
services through consulting assignments. Joint World Bank-IMF efforts resulted in a proposal
for “Implementing a Modern Revenue Collection Agency” in March 2000, which is now
moving forward. The World Bank’s Board approved on June 5, 2003 the Revenue
Administration Reform Project (RARP, €31.9 million), developed with technical assistance
of the IMF, to support the establishment of the national revenue agency (NRA), which seeks
to maximize the level of voluntary taxpayer compliance, promote effectiveness and
efficiency, establish a professional workforce and approach to collection, and help reduce the
scope for corruption. The RARP became effective on August 7, 2003.
10.
Public Expenditure Management. The Bank has taken the lead in the dialogue on
the efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditures and has outlined policy directions in
the context of the Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR)10 which are being
10

The PEIR is entitled Bulgaria: Public Expenditure Issues and Directions for Reform,
August 2002, The World Bank, (Report No. 23979-BUL)

- 47 -

APPENDIX II

further supported by the PAL program. The PEIR has also been a useful input to the IMF
program. The PEIR notes that notwithstanding progress to date, important challenges remain
in: (i) improving management and accountability in the use of public resources; (ii)
restructuring and rationalizing intersectoral public expenditure—particularly energy and
railways, economic services, defense and security, and general services; (iii) reallocation of
intrasectoral priorities—especially in health, education, and social protection; and (iv) higher
investment requirements in many sectors—infrastructure and environment—some of which
are priorities for EU accession, and some of which should involve the private sector. The
PEIR notes that Bulgaria’s main fiscal challenges include working towards an improved
allocation of expenditures, while gradually reducing the overall level of expenditures over the
medium term in tandem with Bulgaria’s fiscal targets of easing the overall tax burden,
especially payroll taxes.
11.
The IMF has provided long-term technical assistance on budgeting and expenditure
management. To ensure the fiscal discipline necessary to support the CBA, the government
has already initiated a number of public expenditure management reforms. New budget
procedures were introduced in early 2002 and were implemented for the 2003 budget.
Despite this important progress, the PEIR notes that there is a need to continue and broaden
the reform effort—capital expenditure proposals should be prepared under hard budget
constraints and as an integral part of the medium-term budget frameworks; and the financial
management at the local level should be strengthened. These reforms are also supported by
the Bank through the PAL program.
B.3. Areas where the World Bank leads and its analyses serve as inputs into the IMF
policy formulation and advice.
12.
Energy sector. The Bank has played the lead role in assisting the government in the
design of the reform program in the sector, and more importantly on its implementation.
After the completion of the Energy Project at end-2000, the Bank has continued to support
the developmental objectives of the sector to increase the energy efficiency. Under the PAL
program, the government has strengthened the legal and regulatory framework and initiated
steps to enable the private sector to assume an increasing share of commercial risks. Policy
recommendations have been outlined in the Bank Energy and Environment Review
completed in 2003, which aimed at also evaluating alternative strategies to balance the need
for economic development and environmental protection. The Fund’s and the Bank’s teams
have worked collaboratively in close consultations with the government, and the SBA
included a performance criterion focusing on implementation of the schedule for bringing
electricity prices to full cost recovery level, and two benchmarks—one on implementation of
the new regulatory pricing regime, and the other on preparing a new Energy Act to harmonize
Bulgaria’s legislation with EU Directives. In addition, in June 2003 the Bank’s Board
approved two district heating projects to support the rehabilitation of the Sofia and the Pernik
District Heating Companies.
13.
Railways. The Bank has been the government’s main external partner in the
transformation of the railway sector, particularly through the Railway Rehabilitation Project,
which was completed in June 2002. This transformation is at present only half way achieved.

- 48 -

APPENDIX II

Some essential measures have been implemented under the PAL program, especially the
divestiture of all railway ancillary activities, securing a major reduction in staffing, and
completing the institutional separation of the national company into two new infrastructure
and rail services enterprises together with the opening of rail services to private operators.
Key remaining steps include tariff reform, reduction of loss making services to only those
that can be socially justified and supported by state contracts (public service obligations),
further reduction of staff, and improved corporate governance. They were refined in the
context of the recent PEIR and are being supported by the Bank through the PALs. Detailed
assistance with the design of these reforms will be further provided through transport sector
work in the near future.
14.
Education. The reform efforts in the education sector aim at improving expenditure
management in view of the declining population, especially in school age, and at enhancing
quality and access to education. The main priority in the education sector, including
universities, is to reallocate expenditures from surplus capacity in teaching staff and
underused facilities toward modernization and upgrading of curricula, textbooks, teaching
materials, schools, and other quality-enhancing education inputs. The Bank has supported the
government program in education through the Education Modernization Project loan (closed
on March 31, 2004), the PALs, and the analytical work done for the Poverty Assessment, the
PEIR, and the Inter-governmental Finance study11. Under PAL-2 the government has
developed a concept for an education reform strategy and action plan, the implementation of
which would be supported though PAL-3.
15.
Health care. Key reform priorities in the health sector include addressing the
concurrent problems of surplus capacity issues in health facilities, the serious deterioration in
the quality of facilities and health services, and the inadequate modernization of equipment.
At the same time, the government needs to ensure the financial integrity of the NHIF, which
is the central point of the reforms in the sector. For a long time the Bank has been supporting
the restructuring of the health sector through the Health Sector Restructuring Project which
was closed at end- 2001. The follow-up Health Sector Reform project approved in late 2000
is under implementation and focuses on the administrative and information systems of the
NHIF, and supports the ambulatory care sector and the hospital sector.
16.
Social protection programs. Social protection programs—pensions, labor market
programs, social assistance, and short-term and family benefits—have a wide coverage
among the population. On pensions, one reform priority is to improve compliance with, and
coverage of, the public pillar, and define a clear rule for indexing pensions. During FY04, the
preparation of a policy-oriented note will support the pension policy dialogue. On labor
market programs, there is a need to monitor these closely to improve their effectiveness and
long-term impact in stimulating labor demand. Subject to progress in key reforms,
consideration should be given to reduce the tax burden related to labor market policies in

order to curtail labor costs.12 Some social assistance and benefit programs have become more
pro-poor since the mid-1990s and are playing a major role in alleviating poverty. However,
given the plethora of these programs, and the complexity of program design in many cases, a
constant challenge of the social protection system as a whole is to examine opportunities for
consolidation and engage in systematic monitoring of the programs, their costs and
effectiveness.
17.
The Bank has been the main partner of the government in its efforts to address
poverty reduction and meet its social development objectives. The main findings of the
Poverty Assessment and the PEIR contribute significantly to the enhanced policy dialogue
with the government on its policy options to improve living standards in the country, and
increase the effectiveness and adequacy of its social protection programs. The Bank is
assisting these important reforms in the social protection system through providing grants
amounting to US$2.2 million. The latter focus on poverty monitoring and evaluation,
integration of ethnic minorities, child development and building social capital in
disadvantaged communities. A Bank-financed Child Welfare Reform project helps address
the needs of children in public care, while a Bank-financed Social Investment and
Employment Promotion (SIEP), which supports community and employment creation and
strengthening of ALMPs, was approved in 2002. Although not subject to structural
performance criteria or benchmarks, the IMF has been also monitoring the sustainability of
the pension system and the advancing of the labor market reforms in terms of their relevance
for the Fund’s program objectives.

Private Sector Development. Bulgaria has completed the divestiture of about 95
percent (based on value of assets) of its non-infrastructure state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
since 1995. To encourage the entry of new firms and the expansion of existing ones, the
business climate will have to be improved focusing on reducing barriers to entry, reducing
compliance cost of the regulatory regime, developing a competitive environment, eliminating
the constraints to bank lending, and establishing an efficient exit mechanism for non-viable
enterprises. Under the PAL program, major changes in the basic legislation have been
initiated - notably the Commercial Code, the Civil Procedure Code, and the Labor Code, and
the passage of legislation on how the State will regulate economic activity to ensure stability
and predictability of regulatory regimes
19.
In the context of the two Finance and Enterprise Adjustment Loans (FESALs)
and the PAL program, the Bank has supported the government in sector restructuring
of the non-infrastructure enterprise sector. Privatization of SOEs has been a major
component of the FESALs. Under PAL-1 and PAL-2, the Bank has led the dialogue on

reforms covering the regulatory regimes, the insolvency process, labor markets, and
competition.
20.
Public sector governance. The government is pursuing a broad program to improve
public sector governance including strengthening the capacity of the public administration,
improving service delivery, reducing corruption, and reforming the judiciary. The support of
this program has been the main focus of PAL-2. The policy, legal and institutional framework
has been developed and put in pace to strengthen merit and depolitization. Performance
standards for service delivery have been developed and one-stop shop principles have been
introduced in five central administrations and six regional administrations, the system of
performance appraisal and professional development within the state administration has been
enhanced. Concrete steps have been undertaken to increase accountability and transparency –
the conflict of interest and asset declaration regime has been strengthened; a monitoring
system to track progress in meeting the anti-corruption objectives has been designed; key
ministries and agencies have prepared detailed and practical anticorruption action plans.

APPENDIX II

C. The World Bank Group Strategy and Lending Operations
The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Bulgaria1 discussed by the Bank’s Board on May 9, 2002, focuses on three
main themes: (i) promotion of competitive private sector led growth, (ii) strengthening public administration reforms and anticorruption initiatives, and (iii) mitigating the social impact of restructuring and delivering social services more effectively.
Programmatic Adjustment Lending. Up to three Programmatic Adjustment Loans (PALs), the first one approved by the
Board in February 2003, 2 support the government’s reforms aiming at: (a) completion of privatization and restructuring in
energy and infrastructure; (b) improving the environment for private sector led growth; (c) deepening the financial sector;
(d) reducing poverty and improving human capital, and better delivery of social services; and (e) support public administration
reform and anti-corruption programs.3
Bank Assistance Program in Bulgaria to date comprises 33 operations for a total original commitment of
US$1,820.9 million equivalent. This includes eleven adjustment loans (US$1050.8 million), 19 investment projects (US$750.7
million), and two Bank-managed Global Environmental Fund (GEF) grants and one Bank-managed Prototype Carbon Fund
(PCF) operation—Wood Residue to Energy. Of these 33 operations, 24 have been completed, of which two have been
restructured and partially cancelled during implementation, and nine operations are currently under implementation.
IFC’s Activities in Bulgaria IFC’s Activities in Bulgaria comprise 17 projects (totaling US$213 million) in the support of
financial sector development, infrastructure and restructuring of post-privatized companies. Of those, 15 projects were
approved from 1999-on. In the financial sector, IFC has supported two specialized SME banks and established Bulgaria’s first
micro lending bank. In addition, IFC has invested in a leasing company and in a venture capital fund which targets the SME
sector.
Economic and Sector Work. The country diagnostic work recently completed includes Bulgaria: Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (2004) and Bulgaria: Inter-governmental Finances (2004). Other country diagnostic work being
completed includes a study on environmental sequencing, an infrastructure and energy study, a national energy efficiency
study, and an expenditure needs for roads study. Going forward, the Bank plans additional country diagnostic work on pension
funds, on gender and ethnicity issues, rural development assessment, a private sector assessment, and a CEM (Country
Economic Memorandum) focused on policy reforms for growth.

APPENDIX III

BULGARIA: AN AGGREGATE BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS13
1.
At end-2003 currency and maturity mismatches in Bulgaria, while contained at the
aggregate level, are considerable in individual sectors. While in the private sector (both
financial and nonfinancial) short-term external liabilities in foreign currency exceed liquid
external foreign-currency assets, this is more than outweighed by the public sector’s liquid
foreign assets. Therefore, the public sector’s large international reserves, combined with a
public debt structure that limits official demands on the foreign currency reserves of the
central bank, insure the private sector’s balance sheet mismatches.
•

The nonfinancial private sector (NFPS), while posting a sizable overall short foreign
currency position (medium- and long-term as well as short-term), has a long position
in short-term foreign-currency assets and liabilities. However, short-term external
liabilities in foreign currency exceed liquid external foreign-currency assets by a
sizable margin (about 6 percent of GDP; Appendix Figure 1). This implies that
potential pressures on the short-term external position of the NFPS—e.g. arising from
reduced rollover of credit lines—would be transmitted to the domestic banking sector,
as foreign currency denominated liquid liabilities of the banking sector to the NFPS
are very large as a result of the substantial degree of euroization of the banking system
(48 percent of the sector’s liabilities are in foreign currency, mostly euros).

•

The public sector’s short overall foreign currency position derives from its large
(though falling) external debt. However, this debt is all medium and long-term (by
original maturities14), and there is thus little short-term refinancing risk. This is
reflected in liquid foreign-currency assets exceeding short-term foreign-currency
liabilities by a wide margin: including coverage of the monetary base by foreign
exchange (required by the currency board) as a foreign-currency liability, liquid
foreign currency-denominated assets exceed short-term foreign-currency liabilities by
a margin of more than 11 percent of GDP. The situation is similar for the external
short-term foreign currency position (Appendix Figure 3).

•

The financial private sector (FPS) has a long overall foreign currency position, but its
short-term foreign-currency liabilities exceed liquid foreign-currency assets by a wide
margin (12½ percent of GDP), deriving from the financial intermediation role of the
sector, and the considerable degree of euroization. Meanwhile, short-term external
liabilities in foreign currency exceed liquid external foreign-currency assets only by a

13

More detailed analysis is provided in Chapter II of Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix
(to be issued).
14

Amortizations of external debt falling due in 2004 are about €241 million (1.4 percent of
GDP), which does not make a significant dent in the public sector’s net foreign currency or
external positions.

- 53 -

APPENDIX III

limited amount (Appendix Figure 2). This suggests that, though weaknesses in the
banking sector’s own balance sheet do exist, the larger risk to the banking system
arises from the domestic NFPS, with its sizable potential demand on banks’ foreign
exchange.

2.
Overall, therefore, the public external short-term foreign currency position is
strong enough to offset weaknesses in the private sector (Appendix Figure 4). This
reduces the risk of potential rollover difficulties of firms in the NFPS (which is unlikely to be
uniform across firms) being transmitted via the banking system the entire economy. In the
banking sector itself, this reduces the ultimate risks from one of foreign-currency positions to
one of the usual maturity mismatches that financial intermediation creates, regardless of
currency.
3.
In summary, the strength of the short-term external foreign currency position in
Bulgaria depends on the public sector. At present, the cushion of official reserves is
sufficient to counterbalance weaknesses in the private sector’s balance sheets, but this comes
at a cost, including moral hazard. In addition, credit developments are likely to weaken
private sector balance sheets further, putting greater demands on public reserves and

- 54 -

APPENDIX III

requiring continued reserve build-up through inflows on non-debt creating financing, while at
the same time aggravating moral hazard, as well as political and budgetary costs.

APPENDIX IV

Bulgaria: Statistical Issues

Bulgaria compiles and submits data to the Fund of sufficient quality and in a regular
1.
timely manner to adequately permit program monitoring and surveillance (Table 17). Despite
a comprehensive economic database, problems remain in national accounts and price
statistics, particularly in the coverage of the emerging private sector, as well as in the balance
of payments statistics, where frequent and substantial revisions have hampered economic
analysis. In addition, work remains to be done in fully reconciling high frequency data on
economic activity with quarterly and annual national accounts data. Annual international
investment position statistics are compiled and reported to STA for publication.
On December 1, 2003, Bulgaria subscribed to the International Monetary Fund's
2.
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), marking a major step forward in the
development of the country's statistical system.
Real sector

The National Statistical Institute (NSI), with technical assistance from the OECD, has
3.
established a system to compile national accounts according to the recommendations of the
European System of Accounts, 1995. GDP by activity and expenditure categories are
compiled and reconciled within an annual supply and use framework. Government output and
final consumption are estimated on a cash rather than an accrual basis. In addition, Bulgaria
publishes national accounts including current and capital accounts for the five main domestic
sectors (general government, financial corporations, nonfinancial corporations, nonprofit
institutions serving households, and households). As for most countries, the financial account
and the balance sheets are missing.
A monthly industrial production index is compiled. An IMF STA national accounts
4.
statistics mission found problems with the quality of inventories data and the deflation
method used to construct the industrial production index, and the mission made
recommendations for their resolution.
The NSI has also compiled estimates of quarterly GDP by expenditure categories for
5.
the period beginning with first quarter of 1994 through the third quarter of 2002, based on
significantly improved quarterly surveys. Problems remain in the methods for the deflation of
some components of the national accounts, such as household consumption, capital
formation, and external trade, and in the coverage of private sector activities. However,
significant progress has been made in the development of export and import deflators.
The producer price index (PPI) is being revised. Detailed product specifications and
6.
transaction prices are being introduced gradually during the rotation of samples by branch
classes. The NSI is in the process of expanding the collection of transaction prices throughout
the industrial sector with 83 percent of domestic industry sales now covered. The new work

- 57 -

APPENDIX IV

program calls for completing the PPI revision process by June 2004. Publication of the
rebased PPI began in March 2003, with the weights and reference period updated to 2000 and
linked at December 2002 to form a continuous monthly series for the period January 2000 to
January 2003.
The consumer price index (CPI) provides a reasonable measure of inflation and price
7.
developments in Bulgaria. The recommendations provided by STA missions have been
broadly implemented. The NSI has completed the exercise to link annual Laspeyres price
indices together, producing a time series that begins in 1995. This series also follows the new
classifications and index methods recommended by Eurostat and STA, and has been
published as the official CPI. The coverage of the index was extended, although it still does
not include owner-occupied housing. A new method for imputing missing observations of
new products is being applied, but quality adjustment procedures are only applied in a few
particular cases (e.g., the heating component).
The flow of customs data has improved significantly since the April-May 1998 STA
8.
mission and a new system for processing customs records is near completion. The
development of export and import unit value indices is progressing smoothly and additional
support is expected from Eurostat in this area. The current indices can be used effectively as
deflators for the import and export components of the national accounts. The Import and
Export Division meets monthly with the Bulgarian National Bank to review data issues and
ensure consistency between the NSI export and import data and the balance of payments data.
The lack of comprehensive labor statistics hampers the assessment of developments
9.
in employment and wages, especially in the private sector. Annual data are collected by the
NSI, using a census of all establishments. The NSI also obtains current estimates from a
monthly survey of establishments using all public employers and a sample of private
employers (excluding establishments with less than 5 employees, and including about 10,000
private employers out of approximately 69,000 qualifying establishments). The main
shortcomings of these data include: (i) the under-reporting of private sector wages; (ii) the
reporting of only average gross earnings, not wages for time worked and wages by
occupation; and (iii) the lack of coverage of the self-employed and employment in small
firms. Plans for improvement include using National Social Security Institute (NSSI) data to
estimate wages by occupation and age and the number of self-employed and employment in
small firms. The household budget survey could provide an alternative source of data for
private sector wages. Regarding employment, the NSI household labor force survey is an
alternative source of data, but improvements are needed to make it more consistent with the
establishment survey, especially regarding agricultural employment. The survey also needs to
be conducted on a consistent schedule, semi-annually or quarterly. It has been conducted
twice a year since 1993 (three times a year since 1999), but at irregular intervals. From 2001
onward, the NSI intended to conduct the survey on a quarterly basis. Also, Eurostat has been
providing support since mid-2000 in the context of a pilot project ending in mid-2001 to
improve the labor force survey’s compliance with Eurostat recommendations.

- 58 -

APPENDIX IV

10.
A Population Census was conducted in early 2001 and is a source for redesign of the
household surveys conducted by the NSI, particularly the household budget survey and the
labor force survey.
Government finance

11.
A combined STA/FAD mission in September 1999 reviewed progress under the
budget execution reform program, assisted the MoF with the development of a new chart of
accounts for the government sector, and provided advice on the implementation of accrual
accounting for government, budgetary, and the statistical system. The mission also examined
possible actions to improve fiscal transparency in line with the Experimental Report on the
Implementation of Standards and Codes prepared in August 1999; key recommendations are
to improve the fiscal data to meet fiscal reporting requirements for EU accession, in
particular, implementing the new chart of accounts and the Financial Information
Management System; disseminate information on arrears of central and local governments,
local government debt, and details of financing; compile and disseminate discrete monthly
and quarterly data; and update the MOF website monthly. Consolidated data on central
government operations are routinely reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook and in
IFS. For the GFS Yearbook 2003, 2002 data for the general government sector and its
subsectors were reported on an accrual basis in accordance with GFSM 2001. The Ministry of
Finance prepares data on the execution of the consolidated government on a monthly basis.
These data do not conform to GFS standards and while not published in a bulletin format
they are posted on the Ministry of Finance’s website.
Money and banking statistics

Statistical methods conform with the key classification and valuation principles in the
12.
IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual, 2000. To address remaining deviations, the
authorities reported that starting in January 2003, positions on financial derivatives, which at
present are small, would be included in the balance sheets. Further, the consistency in the
coverage of the BNB’s claim on banks (which included claims on liquidated banks) and the
banks’ liabilities to the BNB had improved in January 2003 after the BNB had written off
most of the claims on the liquidated banks. With respect to its near-term statistical program,
the BNB is progressively harmonizing its data collection and compilation methods in line
with the European Central Bank’s framework for monetary statistics. In particular, a
significant number of enhancements in sectoral and instrument detail and classification were
made in the data for 1995 and onward. These were reflected in the revised monetary statistics
published in the August 2002 and November 2003 issues of IFS.

- 59 -

APPENDIX IV

Balance of payments

Bulgaria reports monthly balance of payments data on a regular and timely basis, but
13.
data are subject to frequent and substantial revisions. An IMF technical assistance mission in
December 2000 made a number of recommendations to strengthen the balance of payments
and external debt compilation systems, which included the development of a closed-type of
international transactions reporting system, the development of estimates of “shuttle trade”
with countries bordering Bulgaria, strengthening the methodology for travel transactions, and
compiling data on trade credit liabilities. The treatment of the license to operate a mobile
telephone service has been clarified and agreed with the BNB. The GSM license purchase has
been recorded under foreign direct investment, in Bulgaria’s equity capital component in the
first quarter of 2001. As there is no repayment obligation, the transaction does not change the
country’s external debt position. Balance of payments transactions related to the mobile
phone license are no longer recorded for the subsequent periods. In 2003, the ROSC mission
identified the following problems in the balance of payments statistics: i) residents’ foreign
currency accounts with resident banks are incorrectly included; ii) merchandise trade data are
prone to errors and are not timely; and iii) most data are collected on a cash basis.

BULGARIA
Ex Post Assessment of Longer-Term Program Engagement
Prepared by a Staff Team from EUR, MFD, PDR, and RES
Authorized for Distribution by EUR and PDR
May 19, 2004

•

Bulgaria has had a longer-term engagement with the Fund, based on the definition in
IMF (2003), thus requiring an Ex Post Assessment (EPA) of its relationship with the
Fund. This paper provides such an assessment, focusing primarily on the last ten years
(1994-2003), and on the strategy for any future engagement.

•

The EPA team comprised Mr. Cottarelli (head, EUR), Mr. Dell’Ariccia (RES),
Mr. Duenwald (EUR), Mr. Nystedt (PDR), and Mr. Teo (MFD).

•

The EPA is based on the analysis of available documents, as well as on “EPA
interviews” conducted in Washington and Sofia with current and former Fund staff
members, World Bank staff members, as well as with current and former
representatives of the authorities.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Bulgaria’s transition from central planning was initially difficult. In the context
of loose macroeconomic policies and slow structural reform, GDP fell almost steadily
through 1997, when it was 40 percent below its

in 1992-93, reflecting
compressed domestic demand and financing constraints.
2.
However, since the 1996-97 crisis, macroeconomic performance has dramatically
improved. In that year, Bulgaria embarked on a comprehensive reform agenda, anchored by
a currency board arrangement (CBA) that yielded high and stable growth (in the
4-5½ percent range during 2000–2003) and low inflation. But risks remain. Unemployment
and poverty are still high and signs of reform fatigue have emerged. The macroeconomic
outlook is also not without risks: the external current account deficit has recently widened
and bank credit is booming, two possible signs of overheating.
3.
Bulgaria’s transition was supported by Fund resources both during the early
difficult years, and during the later more successful period. In the first period, after the
completion of a one-year SBA, three consecutive SBAs went off track (Table 2). In contrast,
starting in 1997 two SBAs and one EFF were successfully completed. Alongside, other
facilities were also used. Altogether, Bulgaria was engaged with Fund-supported programs
for 118 out of 168 months during 1990–2003, and for 94 out of 120 months during the last
ten years.

State ownership was near complete. Moreover, Bulgaria’s exposure to market institutions,
which helped promote reforms in other CEE countries, was limited (World Bank 2002a).

countries. Thus, the old leadership was not as discredited as elsewhere, and there was no
organized opposition to the regime (Giatzidis 2002).3 While many Bulgarians supported
reforms, the socialist party (the offspring of the communist party) remained a viable political
force, and a rapid succession of governments during 1990-97 (Table 3) suggests a lack of
reform consensus.
7.
In this context, early programs, aimed primarily at stabilizing the economy,
soon ran into problems. While a first SBA was completed in March 1992, a second SBA
went off track in late 1992. In parallel, GDP dropped, unemployment surged, and the external
current account deficit approached 13 percent of GDP in 1993. After the failure of the second
SBA, a hiatus followed during which, in the context of persistently lax monetary and fiscal
policies and little progress in structural reform, macroeconomic conditions deteriorated
further, leading to a first currency crisis in late 1993-early 1994. A new stabilization effort
supported by a third SBA in April 1994 was derailed in the Fall, when the government fell.
8.
In this period, at the core of Bulgaria’s instability was the poor state of public
enterprises, and their dangerous symbiosis with banks. The unreformed state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) were problematic in two ways. First, their large deficits were financed by
state (and private) banks and, indirectly, the central bank, fueling inflation, and undermining
the population’s trust in the banking system. Second, lack of reform depressed output, thus
making any stabilization attempt difficult to sustain over time. Finally, weak governance in
both public and private firms fostered corruption and a rent-seeking culture (Box 1).
Box 1. SOEs and Banks in Bulgaria Before 1997: A Dangerous Symbiosis
Until the middle of 1996, no large- to medium-sized loss-making SOEs had been declared bankrupt, and
by end-1996, less than 6 percent of the assets of SOEs had been privatized. The cumulative losses of
SOEs averaged 22 percent of GDP during 1993-95 (OECD, 1997). These losses were financed by
arrears (to suppliers and the government) and bank loans, which in turn were refinanced by the central
bank. Periodically, the state took over the related banks’ bad loans: bonds issued for this purpose
amounted to half of domestic debt in 1993-95 (OECD, 1997). This subjugation of banks to SOEs’ needs
was facilitated by poor accounting, auditing, reporting, and disclosure standards. Indeed, in a climate
characterized by insufficient protection against insiders’ interests, private banks also extended credit
irresponsibly. Moreover, the unstable macroeconomic conditions, and the absence of adequate
supervision, encouraged banks to take speculative positions, including in the foreign exchange market.
In early 1996, 70 percent of outstanding loans were classified as nonperforming, and the negative net
worth of the banking system was estimated at 10 percent of GDP.

3

Bulgaria’s demographic structure (an “older” population compared to other CEE countries)
may also have slowed down the political transition.

-8-

9.
However, pre-1997 programs did not successfully address the SOEs/banks
problem. Supported by an SBA, a remarkable attempt was made in 1994 to strengthen the
central budget position through major cuts in public spending. This yielded large primary
surpluses averaging 8½ percent of GDP during 1994-96. In those years, the central budget,
adjusted for inflation, was much lower than the headline figure (Feyzioğlu et al., 1999,
p. 37). But, without SOE and bank reform, the adjustment fell disproportionately on some
population groups and, in the midst of further political instability, was ultimately
unsustainable. A last-ditch attempt at stabilization—probably too little and certainly too
late—was launched in mid-1996, with the support of a fourth SBA. The 1996 program
responded to a rapid surge in inflation and depreciation, and a collapse of confidence. It
involved a further fiscal adjustment in the central budget (with the primary surplus rising to
9¼ percent of GDP that year), a strengthening of bank supervision, and commitments to
launch SOE reforms. But, Fund endorsement failed to catalyze support,4 as the government
continued to be seen as lacking reform credentials. Indeed, implementation of structural
reforms was once more too hesitant.5 Eventually, a simultaneous loss of confidence in the lev
and in the banking system led to the 1996/97 financial crisis.6 By September 1996, one-third
of banks had been closed, but through a disorderly process, and by year-end, Bulgaria was
experiencing hyperinflation, international reserves had collapsed, and support for the
government had dissipated.7
B. Stabilization and Growth: 1997 Onwards
10.
The severity of the crisis made it clear that a new policy strategy and a proreform government were needed. Under the weight of the crisis, the socialist government
resigned in December 1996, and a reform-minded caretaker government was established to
resolve the crisis. Thereafter, the reformists won the April 1997 elections in a landslide, and,
in the same month, a new 14-month SBA was approved.
4

The gap between Bulgaria’s spread and the EMBI remained about unchanged at the
inception of the program, and rose dramatically a few weeks later.
5

Following board approval of the SBA, NDA growth was well above targets, triggering a
renewed worsening of the crisis after a brief pause. Corrective measures discussed during the
first review were never implemented and the review was not completed.
6

Confidence in banks may have been weakened by the proposal in December 1995 to
introduce a partial deposit insurance scheme, while previously bank deposits had been
regarded as implicitly covered fully by the state (the Fund had recommended not introducing
partial deposit insurance as public confidence in banks was low). Finally, public confidence
was also shaken by the collapse of pyramid schemes in mid-1995.
7

The closure of some banks contributed to the panic, partly because of lack of full deposit
insurance. Another contributing factor may have been the leak of a side letter to the Fund
committing the authorities to close more banks if the initial strategy proved insufficient.

-9-

11.
The new program envisaged bold reforms underpinned by a CBA. While no
major measures were envisaged at the central budget level, and indeed the primary surplus
was allowed to decline over time as the burden of interest payments fell, the critical link
between SOEs and banks was severed by acting on both sides of the problem. On the one
hand, the new currency board—whose introduction was preceded by a wide-ranging public
debate that enhanced ownership—prevented the central bank from financing banks and the
budget. On the other hand, key upfront steps were taken to reform SOEs and banks. This was
achieved by closing and restructuring the loss-making SOEs,8 and, following the closure of
problem banks in late 1996, by strengthening bank supervision (by increasing the
independence of bank supervision and its power to intervene in banks, and by making the
prudential framework consistent with international standards). Incomes policy for SOEs was
also strengthened to harden their budget constraints and guide wage expectations. Moreover,
the privatization program was revived.
12.
The program was immediately well received by markets. Bulgaria’s gap against
the EMBI fell by 250 basis points the week after

completed and followed by two new
arrangements. The latter, in the context of a stable political environment, focused on
continued fiscal prudence—with falling interest payments permitting a reduction in the
primary surplus—and further reforms. A virtuous circle was set in motion: with
macroeconomic stabilization achieved, the government could focus on addressing remaining
structural problems. This in turn put macroeconomic policies on a sounder footing.
Privatization was accelerated (especially in 1999-2000), SOE restructuring pushed further
ahead, banking sector laws strengthened, price liberalization continued, and the process of
land restitution completed. Throughout this period, and increasingly, Bulgaria’s desire to join
the EU provided an additional incentive to keep reforms on track. Performance also
improved with respect to Fund conditionality. Some waivers were needed after 1997, but this
partly reflected the rising number of actions subject to conditionality (Table 4). However,

under the most recent SBA the number of structural conditions met with delay or not met

as discussed below, the external current account deficit rose to 8½ percent of GDP in 2003,

III.

THE CAUSES OF FAILURE AND SUCCESS

15.
This section focuses on three questions: (i) What changed in 1997? (ii) Why did the
change not occur earlier? (iii) Why did the Fund support programs that were too weak?
A. What Changed in 1997?
16.
There was broad consensus during the EPA interviews that, in terms of policy
implementation, the 1997 program succeeded because it credibly severed the
SOEs/banks link. Earlier programs did involve sizable adjustments in the central budget, but
this approach was too narrowly based, and, thus, unsustainable. Severing the SOEs/bank link
broadened the scope of the adjustment and hit at the core of Bulgaria’s inflationary spiral.
17.
Both components of the strategy to sever that link (structural reform and the
CBA) were critically important:
•

9

SOE/bank structural reform and privatization were covered in the 1997 SBA and in the
following EFF by very detailed conditionality. The EPA interviews highlighted that the
Fund’s conditionality became the blueprint for reform and greatly facilitated policy
coordination within Bulgaria. It was also noted that it would have been significantly more
difficult, at least de facto, to have such a detailed conditionality, had the 2002 guidelines
on streamlining conditionality been in place.

Average tariffs dropped from about 17 percent in 1997 to 11½ percent in 2003.

The CBA played two roles. First, it provided a strong institutional barrier against the risk
that money growth would be subordinated to the needs of SOEs and banks. Second, as a
communication tool, it provided a “banner” around which virtually all components of
society seemed to coalesce. Since 1997, consistency with the CBA has become the
ultimate litmus test for assessing the key economic policy decisions. Its importance, visFigure 7. Average EBRD Transition Index, 1991-2003

countries, and improved further
only after 1998 (Figure 7). Also, some gradualism that had failed to impress markets in
1996 (e.g., putting some SOEs in “isolation,” rather than closing them) was well received
in 1997. The CBA increased the credibility of the reform process, avoiding the need for
an excessive front-loading. However, the EPA interviews also underscored that the CBA
would not have worked in isolation. The two components of the strategy were mutually
reinforcing.

18.
Equally important in stabilizing expectations was the change in the political
landscape. The government formed in mid-1997 was homogeneously reformist and was
supported by a wide parliamentary majority. This reassured markets that the period of
political instability was over and that the reforms would continue over time.
19.
There was less agreement on the extent to which other factors may have been
relevant. Conditions at the outset of the program, the external environment, and financial
support were somewhat better in 1997 than before, but not decisively so. These factors are
discussed in Box 2, together with the role that over-optimism in policy design may have
played in the failure of the pre-1997 programs.

- 12 -

Box 2. Initial Conditions, External Environment, Over-Optimism, and Financing
Initial conditions: Bulgaria’s starting point on the transition route was weak. By 1997, in spite
of remaining major shortcomings, some structural progress had been made. Implementation
capacity had also increased. Moreover, the early 1997 hyperinflation cut the burden of
domestic debt dramatically, strengthening the fiscal accounts. The importance of these factors
should not be exaggerated, though: in other respects, Bulgaria in 1997 was in worse shape than
in the early 1990s: inflation expectations had been rooted, per capita GDP was lower,
unemployment had surged, and external debt had been inflated by the depreciation.
External environment: Market sentiment towards emerging markets was weak in 1994, and,
while improving, remained weak in 1996. In contrast, the 1997 program benefited from more
favorable conditions. For example, the average of the EMBI spread for the six months around
the program’s starting date was 727 basis points for the 1996 program and 449 basis points for
the 1997 program. However, external financing conditions had been propitious also in the early
1990s. Moreover, the post-1996 program was resilient to sizable external shocks: for example,
the Russian crisis caused only a brief rise in Bulgaria’s spread.
Over-optimism: An interesting, and separate, issue is whether the external environment had
been assumed to be better than it turned out to be, and, more generally, whether over-optimism
had contributed to the failure of earlier programs. Clearly, the repeated failures of pre-1997
programs resulted in sizable over-prediction of growth performance (and under-prediction of
inflation). But was this the result of the failure, or of optimistic assumptions on outcomes,
given the program policies? The EPA team could not explore this issue fully, due to resource
constraints. However, during the EPA interviews over-optimism was not mentioned as a
relevant cause of failure.
Financing: Lack of financing was not a key factor behind the failure of the pre-1997 programs.
By end-1995, the Fund was Bulgaria’s largest creditor accounting for 8¼ percent of external
debt. Fund support to the failed 1996 program was broadly equal to that to the successful 1997
program, and was frontloaded. However, it has been noted that the 1996 program was
underfunded vis-à-vis borrowing needs, and that larger access could have bought time to push
reforms through. Be this as it may, the Fund in 1996 did contact donors for additional support,
but their lack of enthusiasm may have reflected the authorities’ poor track record.

B. Why Did The Change Not Occur Earlier?
20.
The EPA interviews highlighted the central role the 1996–97 crisis played in
exposing the failure of earlier policies and in triggering the change in policies. The view
that there simply was not enough consensus for reform before 1997, within the government,
parliament, and the population at large, was undisputed during the interviews. Pre-1997
governments, while including reformers, were not homogeneously reformist, reflecting an
underlying lack of pro-reform consensus in the population at large and the political economy

- 13 -

factors discussed in paragraph 6.10 With the crisis, output collapsed, unemployment surged,
and the savings of the populations vanished as prices skyrocketed. This triggered the change
that allowed addressing at the core the SOEs/banks link.
21.
Was the change also delayed by lack of understanding by the Fund about the
nature of Bulgaria’s problems? This does not seem to have been the case. While data
problems were significant (Box 3), at least as of 1993, the Fund had singled out the criticality
of the SOEs/banks link. Indeed, the Executive Board, in the context of the 1993 Article IV
consultation, highlighted the vulnerabilities created by the lagging reform effort. Program
discussions were delayed in 1993 by lack of consensus on reforms.11 Both the 1994 and the
1996 programs regarded SOE/banking reforms as critical.12 The centrality the Fund attributed
to these reforms is confirmed by internal documents and the EPA interviews. One could note,
however, that neither the 1994 nor the 1996 program conditionality covered SOEs/banking
reform to an extent comparable with the 1997 program. These programs did envisage reforms
but these were described in relatively general terms, with conditionality operating primarily
through the program review process. However, as detailed in Box 4, this more limited
conditionality does not indicate lack of understanding of the importance of structural
problems, nor did it have major implications for the failure of the 1994 and 1996 programs.
A few participants in the EPA interviews argued that more detailed conditionality might have
facilitated the implementation of reforms. Be this as it may, quantitative macro-conditionality
was able, indirectly, to catch the authorities’ structural slippages, which the authorities
decided not to correct. However, when ownership was strong in 1997, the specification of
detailed structural conditionality did help, primarily in providing the authorities with a
blueprint for their reform agenda.

10

Political instability before 1997 was obviously also an obstacle to policy implementation.
But this instability was, in itself, also a reflection of lack of a pro-reform consensus.
11

During 1995 staff argued that, without reforms, the macroeconomic stabilization achieved
after the 1994 crisis was not sustainable. At the end of the 1995 Article IV consultation,
Executive Directors also highlighted the need to reinvigorate reform efforts, and stated that
“as regards the banking sector, rehabilitation plans need to be bold and implemented
vigorously to avoid a looming banking crisis… .”

12

For example, the 1994 LoI (paragraph 15) stated that “losses of the enterprise sector in
1993 represented a quasi-fiscal deficit that is estimated to be roughly of the same magnitude
of the budget deficit in this year. We recognize that these deficits threaten Bulgaria’s
economic and financial stability and the time has come to address this challenge.”

- 14 -

Box 3. Did Lack of Data Prevent Diagnosing the SOEs/Banks Problem?
As in other transition countries, program design in Bulgaria was hampered by lack of adequate
data. The government’s quasi-fiscal activities were notoriously hard to pin down. While by the
mid-1990s all SOEs had to provide their financial data quarterly, poor accounting standards
made the reported data relatively unreliable. But the existence of severe problems in SOEs and
banks was well known, and was confirmed by the repeated need for the government to cover
bank losses through the injection of securities, and for the central bank to provide liquidity.

Box 4. Structural Conditionality (or lack thereof) In the 1994 and 1996 Programs
The 1994 letter of intent committed the authorities to SOE reform and privatization. However,
these actions were not covered by conditionality, except through the program review process.
With ample evidence that the pre-program discussions had clearly focused on the SOE/banks
link, this cannot be due to an underestimation of the problem. Rather, the Fund preferred to
rely on an indirect, and more traditional, approach to enforce SOE/bank reform, namely
through credit ceilings. Failure to deliver on the structural side would have implied breaching
these ceilings, as it did.
The 1996 program did involve a series of structural prior actions, but they were not sufficiently
comprehensive. One prior action was to agree with the World Bank on a program for enterprise
reform, which was achieved “in principle”. As to banks, the authorities were not willing to go
ahead with a complete restructuring. The Fund eventually accepted a “two-step” approach on
the condition that the banking strategy would be quickly revised if market confidence was not
restored (this involved agreement on a side letter, whose leak may have deepened the crisis
further). In addition, an early review was provided for to assess financial sector developments
and progress in SOE reform.

C. Why Did the Fund Support Programs That Were Too Weak?
22.
If the main reason for the failure of the programs was the lack of a pro-reform
consensus, did the Fund fail to see this? The World Bank decided to delay the conclusion
of program discussions in 1994 and held the release of its adjustment operation tranche in
1995-96 due to lack of progress in structural reforms. The Fund went ahead. Did the Fund
fail to appreciate political risks?
23.
This does not seem to be the case. The prolonged program discussions ahead of both
the 1994 and the 1996 programs, the authorities’ unwillingness to take adequate measures,
and the repeated slippages in earlier programs were clear evidence of problems to come.
Moreover, internal Fund documents did repeatedly point at the risks of the political situation.

- 15 -

24.
Three reasons were mentioned in the EPA interviews to explain why the Fund
went ahead in spite of these political economy risks:
•

The most important one was that the decisions to support Bulgaria in 1994 and 1996
were taken under crisis situations, that is, when it is inherently more difficult to deny
support, particularly for an institution that has crisis prevention at the core of its
mandate. The Fund faced the difficult choice of not supporting Bulgaria, with virtual
certainty of deepening the crisis, or supporting her with a modest chance of success.
This dilemma is illustrated, for example, by the discussions ahead of the 1996
program. At that time, the authorities were unable to reach agreement with the World
Bank on key structural reforms, particularly on enterprise reform. On that occasion,
Fund management took the view that waiting for this agreement could have slowed
down discussions and delay completion until September/October 1996. However, the
crisis situation required putting in place a program expeditiously. One could take the
“cynical view” that a deeper crisis was needed to shake up the political system, but
such a position comes out as the best course of action only with the benefit of
hindsight, and in the absence of a counterfactual.

•

The authorities’ performance was not uniformly bad. As noted, both in 1994 and
1996, the central budget position was strengthened significantly, also reflecting the
fact that the Ministry of Finance was controlled by the most reformist component of
the government’s coalition. 13 The fact that this was the main ministry counterpart of
the Fund in the discussions may have made it more difficult to deny support.

•

The increased attention of the international community and the Fund to ownership
issues is relatively recent. In the mid-1990s, it would have perhaps been harder for
Fund staff to deny support to a program based on ownership considerations.

25.
It is difficult to assess whether better cooperation between the Fund and the
World Bank would have avoided giving support to the 1994-96 programs. The World
Bank felt that Bulgaria did not deserve support at that time, while the Fund supported the two
failed programs. In 1997, the Fund again took the lead, this time in supporting the successful
program. Indeed, in the absence of a World Bank supported program, the Fund had to take
the lead in the negotiations of both macroeconomic policies and structural reform, including
in the critical banking and SOE sectors.14 One would be tempted to find in all this an
13

In early-1994, the central budget position was even stronger than targeted. Moreover, some
structural reforms were undertaken in 1994: a VAT was introduced, the bankruptcy law
required to close loss-making SOEs was approved, and an external debt reduction was
successfully negotiated. And, in 1996, insolvent banks started being closed.

14

In reviewing Bulgaria’s experience in 1997, the Bank’s Operations Evaluation Department
noted that:
(continued)

- 16 -

example of the Fund’s alleged bias towards giving the benefit of the doubt, or of the Bank’s
alleged propensity for caution. With the Fund’s mandate including crisis prevention, its
propensity to take risks may have been higher. Moreover, when two institutions are involved
in decisions that are, by and large, judgmental, there are bound to be cases of disagreement,
which may complicate approaching the authorities with a unified front.
IV. DID BULGARIA NEED SEVEN YEARS OF FUND SUPPORT AFTER 1996?
26.
Fund support is usually seen as providing three benefits: financial, catalytic, and
“political economic”. The first relates to the classical role Fund resources can play in
closing a financing (balance of payments) gap. The second relates to the effect of the Fund’s
stamp of approval on the availability of financial resources from other sources. The third
relates to the role the Fund can play in mobilizing internal support for appropriate policies.
Of course, if a program were fully owned by the government, the opposition, and the
population at large, this latter role would be meaningless. Conversely, the discipline provided
by Fund monitoring cannot be a substitute for a sufficient degree of ownership. But, in
between these two extremes, there is a continuum of situations in which appealing to an
external source of discipline may facilitate policy implementation.
27.
The EPA interviews highlighted that the relevance of the first two roles declined
over time for Bulgaria, while the third role remained important, or even increased in
importance. This justified not only the EFF that followed the 1997 SBA, but also the most
recent SBA, although in the latter case a precautionary SBA may have been as effective.
A. Financial Benefits
28.
The direct financial benefit of IMF support (in closing the financing gap) is
difficult to quantify but was not trivial. Under the extreme case in which Bulgaria had not
been able to borrow additional resources at all, the adjustment would have occurred through
a lower level of activity, which would have involved sizable losses.15 At the other extreme,
one could assume that Bulgaria could have borrowed from international markets additional
"After 1997, once the new Government adopted a Currency Board and began implementing
reforms, the Bank adopted a prudent stance and only gradually launched a full lending
program....With growing evidence of government commitment and achievement of
macroeconomic stabilization, the Bank began to support a broad reform program through a
series of sectoral adjustment loans addressing, enterprise, banking, agricultural, social
protection, and energy sector reforms... .”
This confirms that the Bank resumed support only after growing evidence that
macroeconomic stabilization had been achieved. The latter, however, did require early
structural reforms, which were initiated under the Fund’s SBA.
15

Quantifying these losses would require making a number of assumptions (on the effect on
growth, the response of capital flows, and the alternative use of international reserves).

- 17 -

resources at the rates it was actually borrowing. Taking into account the spread between
those rates and the IMF lending rate, the saving for Bulgaria from borrowing from the Fund
declined over time: the 1997 SBA, the 1998 EFF, and the 2002 SBA involved annual
benefits, respectively, of 0.4 percent of GDP, 0.3 percent of GDP, and less than 0.1 percent
of GDP. The decline reflected the falling spread on Bulgaria’s debt and, for the last program,
the smaller size of support.16
B. Catalytic Effects?
29.
As noted, unlike later programs, the 1997 SBA contributed to a tightening of
spreads, consistent with the existence of a catalytic effect. However, quantifying the
catalytic effect of Fund programs is complicated by the difficulty of separating the effect of
the change in policies and the political environment from the mere effect of the Fund’s stamp
of approval. 17 The effect on spreads was more limited in later programs. To these effects,
one should add those related to financing from other multilateral creditors (EU, World Bank,
EBRD), which may have been missing without a Fund-supported program.
C. Mobilizing Internal Support
30.
The consensus view in the EPA interviews was that Fund endorsement
facilitated reform implementation significantly, particularly in later years. As discussed,
until 1997, Fund endorsement was not sufficient to promote good policies. Conversely, it
could be argued that the reforms may have been implemented even without Fund support in
1997, given the overwhelming popular support for reform. Be this as it may, the Fund has
generally been well regarded in Bulgaria, so that its support for a certain measure has
typically added to its legitimacy, making it less likely to be opposed in parliament. In this
respect, the importance of Fund endorsement may have increased in later years, as
parliamentary majorities became more fragmented. This appears to have been particularly
important in justifying the 2002 SBA, as the government elected in 2001 did not have a
strong majority, and included less reform-minded coalition partners.18 It may also provide a
rationale for a new program.

16

Considering the outstanding stock of Fund resources committed in earlier programs, the
financial benefit for Bulgaria would be about 0.7 percent of GDP per year during 1997–2002.
17

Recent studies that try to disentangle these effects would suggest that the fall in Bulgaria’s
spread was not due to catalytic effects. Mody and Saravia (2003) conclude that catalytic
effects emerge only when the program country’s fundamentals are initially “not too bad,” as
defined by middle-of-the range external debt-to-GDP ratios and/or reserves-to-imports ratios.
Thus, in principle, given Bulgaria’s high external debt ratio, no program with Bulgaria was
likely to have had a catalytic effect.
18

For example, the fiscal tightening in 2003 (with respect to original plans) would most
likely not have been implemented as promptly in the absence of a Fund-supported program.

- 18 -

V. A NEW FUND-SUPPORTED PROGRAM?
A. The Risks Ahead
31.
Important macroeconomic risks remain. Bank credit is booming and the current
account deficit nearly doubled in 2003, possibly signaling the emergence of unsustainable
imbalances (Box 5). The extent these developments pose risks is uncertain. As to credit
growth, “bad” credit booms are hard to distinguish from “good” credit booms based on
macro indicators,19 and the assessment for Bulgaria is complicated by the fact that the level
of bank credit is still relatively low (Figure 9).20 Prudential indicators do not yet show signs
of deterioration (although such indicators provide a lagging signal of bank asset quality). As
to the widening of the external deficit, it could reflect the need to raise Bulgaria’s output and
export capacity, and is still largely financed by FDI. Financial markets have viewed these
developments in a benign way. But, markets have been wrong before, and, with external debt
still high (Figure 10), Bulgaria remains exposed to the vagaries of market sentiment.

As Gourinchas, Valdez, and Landerretche (2001) note “while most banking crises may be
preceded by a lending boom, most lending booms are not followed by a banking crisis.”
20

A model-based approach suggests that the post-transition equilibrium level of the bank
credit-to-GDP ratio for a country with Bulgaria’s fundamentals is some 50 percent
(Cottarelli, Dell’Ariccia, and Vladkova-Hollar, 2003). The actual 2003 level was
27½ percent.

- 19 -

Box 5. The Recent Widening of the Current Account Deficit and External Sustainability
The external current account deficit almost doubled in 2003, to 8½ percent of GDP, while
bank credit to the private sector rose by close to 50 percent. Both consumer and investment
goods’ imports surged. In parallel, credit growth was driven by both households and business.
If credit does not slow, the current account deficit could widen further. A compensating factor
is that, while declining, FDI coverage of the current account deficit was 82 percent in 2003 (but
only 63 percent excluding privatization receipts). Bulgaria’s real effective appreciation also
bears watching. The CPI-based REER has appreciated significantly in recent years, including
vis-à-vis other CEE countries and Turkey (Figure 8). Other competitiveness indicators are
more favorable: unit labor costs have fallen, and Bulgaria’s export market shares have risen.

32.
There are also political and social risks. Growth performance has been good, but
not impressive. Moreover, unemployment and poverty, while better than in 1997, are still
relatively high (World Bank, 2002b). Reflecting these problems, the political situation is not
as solid as in the late 1990s and there may be a risk of reform fatigue. The recent local
elections have shown that support for the government has weakened, and the coalition’s
cohesion has eroded. While there may be little appetite for early elections, opinion polls
suggest that, on present trends, a new government coalition is likely to be formed after the
mid-2005 elections, but its composition remains highly uncertain. This uncertainty is partly
offset by the consensus to maintain the CBA and advance EU accession.
B. Nature of Future Fund Engagement and Exit Strategy
33.
The authorities are interested in a new precautionary SBA in support of a
program aimed at reducing current risks while preserving the growth momentum. This
seems to require lowering the external current account deficit and, preferably, external debt.
The current account deficit is now some 1½ percentage points of GDP above what staff
regards as adequate to stabilize the external debt ratio without relying on one-off
privatization receipts and given reasonable assumptions on greenfield investment. A larger
deficit may eventually prove viable, but the still high external debt ratio, the lack of exchange
rate flexibility, the need to avoid risks to the credibility of the CBA, uncertainty about the
prospects for FDI, and the relatively distant date of EU entry, call for prudence. Within the
context of a declining current account deficit, one-off privatization receipts—which could be
high in the next two years—should be used to lower external debt. There is also a need to
keep credit growth under close watch, to ensure that it does not give rise to an unsustainable
financial bubble.

34.
Achieving these goals would require appropriate macroeconomic and structural
policies. More specifically:
•

The external current account deterioration appears to be related primarily to rapid
domestic demand growth (in addition to the cyclical weakness of demand in the euro
area), partly driven by fast credit growth. Tight fiscal policy will have to be the main
instrument to contain excessive domestic demand growth. Its specific parameters will
have to be set in light of updated macroeconomic developments and their definition
goes beyond the scope of this paper. But, in any case, it will be important to maintain
fiscal flexibility in response to shocks.21 At the same time, the quality of fiscal policy,
which has recently been skewed towards short-term measures, should be improved.
Structural fiscal measures should focus on enhancing tax administration and
expenditure management. The 1999 pension reform should also be strengthened in
some respects.22

•

Containing external risks will also require strict incomes policies in the public sector
and increased labor market flexibility through labor market reform, so as to reduce
inflationary pressures and boost competitiveness.

•

Should credit growth be excessive, the authorities must stand ready to implement
further measures—including perhaps tightening reserve requirements and prudential
regulations (although the effectiveness of these measures would depend on the extent
of capital mobility and the degree of capitalization of banks, both or which are high).
More generally, a continued strengthening of financial supervision is needed to
reduce financial stability risks.

•

Reforms to further improve the business environment are needed to attract foreign
capital and boost potential output and exports. Earlier sections have once again
confirmed the strict connection between macroeconomic performance and structural
policies, and the important role that Fund conditionality has played in this area in
Bulgaria. Looking ahead, the reform agenda should include completing privatization,
and strengthening governance and the fight on crime (Bulgaria ranks 54th out of
133 countries in the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index;
Transparency International, 2003).

35.
The balance of the arguments would be for recommending continued program
involvement, assuming a successful completion of the program discussions:
21

Public asset and liability management can also help avoid overheating. Borrowing
domestically rather than externally, or shifting government deposits from commercial banks
to the central bank, would tighten domestic liquidity, ceteris paribus.
22

The modalities of pension indexation should be set by law. Moreover, the procedures for
granting disability pensions, which have increased rapidly, should be reviewed.

- 22 -

•

At the economic level, market sentiment towards Bulgaria is currently favorable, and
there does not appear to be an imminent balance of payments need. However, as
discussed, economic and political risks are nontrivial. There is little room for policy
slippages, given Bulgaria’s lack of monetary flexibility, and a potential balance of
payments need cannot be ruled out.

•

The macroeconomic nature of the risks justifies the Fund’s involvement.

•

The authorities have stressed that Fund support could: (i) facilitate internal consensus
on appropriate policies, including in the run up to the 2005 elections; and (ii) provide
confidence to foreign investors, rating agencies, and perhaps other multilateral
institutions. As to the first objective, the EPA team concurs that the Fund’s presence
has and would likely continue to facilitate the enactment of appropriate policies. As
noted in reviewing the 1997-2003 programs, the Fund’s presence may be perhaps
more important at a juncture when caution in macroeconomic policies may be
jeopardized by the more fragmented political situation. As to the second objective,
while catalytic effects vis-à-vis private capital are unlikely to be strong in the future,
other multilaterals—the EBRD, the European Commission, and the World Bank—
may prefer to engage with Bulgaria in the context of Fund arrangements.

•

As highlighted earlier, the longer-term program engagement between Bulgaria and
the IMF during 1997-2003 has not reflected a lack of receptivity of Fund advice, but
rather the appreciation that the authorities have had for that advice. Thus, most of the
drawbacks identified by the IMF’s Independent Evaluation Office (2002) in case of
longer-term program engagement—weaker incentives to take decisive action, loss of
credibility for the Fund in supporting weak programs, poor ownership, and
weakening of the surveillance function of the Fund—do not apply to Bulgaria.

36.
A surveillance-only relationship, while feasible, would be significantly less
effective in supporting the authorities’ program. In particular, the EPA interviews
highlighted that a surveillance-only relationship would be seen as signaling a more detached
role for the Fund in the eyes of Bulgaria’s public opinion. As such, it may not be very
effective in maintaining policy discipline. Program conditionality would facilitate gathering
the political support for appropriate policies.
37.
However, given the longer-term program engagement and the absence of an
imminent financing need, a new SBA should be lower access and precautionary. A
precautionary SBA is in line with Executive Board decisions on signaling devices. The Board
has agreed that precautionary agreements will continue to provide a framework for
monitoring policies in countries that meet standards for Fund financial support, but which do
not have an immediate financing need. Indeed, Management’s guidance note to the staff for
Assessments of Countries with a Longer-Term Program Engagement (IMF(2003)) points out
that “precautionary arrangements may provide a more effective device for facilitating the
transition from sustained reliance on Fund resources... .”

- 23 -

38.
The new arrangement is expected to be the last one, with EU accession serving as
a natural exit from a program-based relationship. A precautionary arrangement could
cover a period of two to three years, thus bridging the gap before possible EU accession in
early 2007. By then program policies are expected to have achieved the targeted decline in
the external deficit and brought closer to completion the structural reform agenda. Moreover,
the proximity of EU accession, and later the need to progress towards adoption of the euro,
will provide an alternative to the discipline arising from Fund support. As intended by the
authorities, euro adoption would be, in a successful scenario, the exit strategy from the CBA.
39.
Program discussions should focus on understanding better the extent of the
risks. Attention should be paid to the level of competitiveness, the determinants of the import
boom (particularly to what extent it is driven by investment that would raise export capacity),
the prospects for greenfield FDI, and the determinants of the credit boom, especially any sign
of emerging asset price bubbles. The latter will require, in particular, further analysis of the
breakdown of credit (by borrowing sector, maturity, and currency composition), of risk
management practices, and of banks’ funding sources. Equally important, political economy
factors should be assessed to evaluate the risk of noncompliance.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
40.

The EPA team reached a number of conclusions:

•

The nature of Bulgaria’s longer-term engagement with the Fund differs deeply
between the pre-1997 period and the later period. In the former, that engagement
occurred in the context of programs that failed to achieve their objectives; in the
latter, it occurred within the context of successful programs and reflected the
authorities’ belief that the Fund could play a useful role in supporting the transition
process even after the initial stabilization.

•

The pre-1997 programs failed primarily because they were not implemented in their
entirety, which in turn reflected insufficient ownership and support for reform. Policy
implementation was good only in some areas (e.g., the central budget), which were
perhaps under closer control of the reformists within the government, but did not
extend to the critical SOEs/bank sector. The programs did recognize that
macroeconomic stabilization required SOE/bank reforms. While the 1994 and 1996
programs did not include conditionality on these reforms to the extent of later
programs, they did include policy commitments and quantitative macro-conditionality
consistent with the reform goals. But those commitments were violated.

•

The major shortcoming in the Fund’s actions was its willingness to support programs
that lacked sufficient ownership. This underscores the importance of an adequate
assessment of political economy factors. But the fact is that the Fund has no control
over those factors and that, in those circumstances, the best it can do is to deny
support. This becomes more difficult when a country is in crisis, and when a program
has even a modest chance of success.

- 24 -

•

The 1996–97 crisis proved to be a watershed for the country, and triggered the change
in politics and policies, boosting programs’ ownership. As of 1997, Bulgaria
benefited from Fund support in a number of ways that could not have been realized
through a surveillance-only relationship. The most important one was the role the
Fund played in providing a blueprint for reform and in mustering domestic support to
implement it. In the most recent period, this role may even have become more
important, given the less homogeneous composition of government forces.

•

The cooperation between the Fund and the World Bank on Bulgaria went through
different phases. In both 1994 and 1996, the Fund supported Bulgaria without a
World Bank supported program. In 1997, the Fund again took the lead, this time in
supporting the successful program. Indeed, in the absence of a World Bank supported
program, the Fund took the lead also in the design of structural conditionality. In
more recent years, the cooperation between the two institutions was more consonant
with their respective areas of responsibility (and was mentioned as an example of
effective collaboration in the recent Joint Fund-Bank Progress Report on Fund-Bank
Conditionality and Collaboration). However, from the point of view of program
design, Bulgaria’s post-crisis experience suggests that detailed structural
conditionality may have played a useful role in coordinating domestic policies
particularly during 1997–2001. The use of structural conditionality to the extent of, in
particular, the 1997–1999 programs would, de facto, have been significantly more
difficult under the 2002 guidelines on streamlining conditionality.

•

Looking forward, the balance of arguments is in favor of accepting the authorities’
request for a new precautionary SBA, provided policies are right. Economic risks
ahead are nontrivial, and a program-based engagement could help mobilize support
for appropriate policies and reforms, minimizing those risks. A surveillance-based
relationship would unlikely be as effective. Prospective EU accession in early 2007 is
seen as a natural exit from Fund programs.

•

A new program should contain measures to limit the risks related to the widening of
the external current account deficit and the ongoing bank lending boom. This falls
squarely within the mandate of the Fund, including in the area of financial sector
stability. Alongside, the reform process should continue with the goal of further
privatization, and improvement in the business climate. This is needed to stimulate a
supply response, which is critical for the political sustainability of macroeconomic
stability. Cooperation with the World Bank in this area is essential. While the Bank
should take the lead in the structural area, Fund conditionality can play selectively an
important role, in areas of more direct macroeconomic implication such as
privatization (given its relevance for lowering external debt).

•

During the program discussion, there is a need to evaluate not only current
macroeconomic risks, but also implementation risk arising from political economy
factors. The EPA for Bulgaria has confirmed that a proper evaluation of these risks
should be a necessary component of any pre-program discussion.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
June 14, 2004
This statement provides information that has become available since the issuance of the staff
report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation. This information does not change the staff’s
appraisal in that report.
•

High-frequency economic data point to robust growth. Industrial output and sales
volume surged by 17¼ percent and 15½ percent year on year, respectively, in the first
quarter while twelve-month inflation eased from 6.2 percent in March to 6.1 percent
in April. The registered unemployment rate declined to 13.2 percent in April, while
real wages increased by 0.1 percent year on year in January-March 2004.

•

External developments are broadly in line with projections. As expected, the twelvemonth external current account deficit widened to 8.8 percent of GDP in March, with
a weaker trade deficit (13.4 percent of GDP) offset by better net income and transfers
balances. However, at €280 million in the first quarter, net FDI inflows (mostly
greenfield) were higher than expected, covering 58 percent of the current account
deficit and contributing, together with strong capital inflows, to a small gain in
international reserves.

•

The growth of credit to the nongovernment sector slowed from 52¼ percent year on
year in March to 50¾ percent in April, with credit to households and nonfinancial
corporations rising by 80 percent and 40 percent, respectively. The authorities have
begun to take measures to reduce bank liquidity by shifting government deposits in
commercial banks to the central bank and imposing a reserve requirement of
4 percent (from July 1) on previously excluded instruments with maturities of two
years or above, while excluding (from September 1) 50 percent of cash in vault from
reserve requirement calculations.

•

In the first four months of the year, the government accumulated a cash fiscal surplus
of 1.4 percent of GDP, reflecting a large revenue overperformance (1.8 percent of
GDP), partly offset by higher expenditure (0.4 percent of GDP). The
overperformance of tax revenue was due mainly to higher-than-projected corporate
profits in 2003 and imports in the first quarter of 2004. The latter led to higher VAT
and customs and excise duties. Expenditures for maintenance and operations,
subsidies and social programs exceeded budget allocations—in contrast to the
authorities’ intention, reported in paragraph 20 of SM/04/179, to limit discretionary
central government spending to 93 percent of its downward revised levels through the
third quarter.

•

On June 7 the communications regulatory commission approved the granting of a
GSM license to the BTC communications company, thereby removing the remaining
obstacle to the completion of its sale. The deadline for the submission of binding bids

-2-

for the privatization of seven electricity distribution companies was extended to
July 9 at the bidders’ request.
•

On June 4, Bulgaria closed three additional EU accession chapters and negotiations
on the last one (competition policy) are expected to be completed by end-June.

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Bulgaria
On June 14, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Bulgaria.1
Background
Bulgaria’s economic performance has continued to improve since the 1996–97 crisis. A policy
strategy anchored by the currency board arrangement and supported by a prudent fiscal policy, a
strict incomes policy for state-owned enterprises, and structural reforms, has resulted in average
real GDP growth of 4½ percent since the last Article IV consultation. The unemployment rate,
although still high, has dropped considerably, and inflation has remained subdued. The Currency
Board Arrangement has provided necessary stability to the economy, and the accompanying
tight fiscal policy has allowed public debt to decline commensurately. In 2003, Bulgaria tightened
fiscal policy, saving half the revenue overperformance and reducing the deficit to 0.4 percent of
GDP. The ex post assessment of Bulgaria’s long-term involvement with Fund-supported
programs concluded that the relationship had been generally effective and that a program-based
engagement would be the most effective way of supporting the government’s economic program
in the run-up to European Union accession in 2007.
Despite generally favorable macroeconomic developments, Bulgaria faces a risk of economic
overheating due to a surge in credit growth and a related sharp widening of the current account
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities.

-2deficit. Bank claims on the nongovernment sector rose by nearly 8 percentage points of GDP in
2003, and their growth has not abated. Bank prudential indicators, however, show no signs of
deterioration. The credit-induced import boom widened the current account deficit to 8½ percent
of GDP in 2003. However, foreign direct investment inflows have been strong and reserves have
been rising. Competitiveness remains broadly adequate, but warrants close monitoring.
Structural reforms have continued, albeit at a slower pace. Bank privatization has been
completed. Measures have been taken to bring energy prices to cost-recovery levels, and the
restructuring of electricity distribution companies has advanced. In the fiscal area, the large
taxpayer office was expanded, and program budgeting and better budget preparation practices
were initiated. However, progress has been limited in reforming the health, education, and
railway sectors. Furthermore, delays in selling tobacco holding Bulgartabac remain troubling.
For 2004, given the high credit growth and the associated risks of economic overheating, the
authorities have agreed to a deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP—rather than 1.2 percent of GDP as
originally planned in the budget—and to further use the expected overperformance of revenue to
attain balance for the year. They also intend to achieve balance in the coming years, although
EU-related expenditures may necessitate a small deficit in 2007. The authorities have planned to
reduce bank liquidity to the extent permitted by an open capital account by tightening reserve
requirements and shifting government deposits from commercial banks to the central bank.
In order to enhance Bulgaria’s supply potential to attain sustainable higher growth, the authorities
plan to undertake measures to further improve governance and the business climate.
Furthermore, privatization of remaining state-owned enterprises is also being planned, not only
to help alleviate risks emanating from high current account deficit but also to facilitate further FDI
inflows.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the solid economic performance in recent years, which—despite a
weak external environment—has delivered robust economic growth, a reduction in
unemployment, moderate inflation, and declining public and external debt ratios, and supported
the authorities’ commitment to persevere with their policy framework. However, they were
concerned about the recent widening of the external current account deficit caused by a sharp
expansion of credit, and emphasized the need to moderate the pace of domestic demand as well
as accelerate structural reforms to boost output and export potential.
Directors noted that the credit boom has led to a surge in imports, and may point to possible
economic overheating. However, they considered that it does not presently seem to represent a
threat to financial stability owing to the strengthened supervisory practices of the Bulgarian
National Bank (BNB) and the sound financial positions of banks. Nevertheless, Directors were
concerned that, if left unchecked, the rapid credit growth and the increase in foreign borrowing
might further exacerbate the external imbalance and undermine the favorable external debt
dynamics and solid economic performance of recent years.
Directors encouraged the authorities to tighten macroeconomic policies more forcefully to
address these challenges. They recommended a mix of policies—within the constraints of the
currency board arrangement (CBA)—to moderate demand and enhance supply as well as export

-3capacity by tightening the fiscal stance, draining liquidity from the banking system, and
implementing structural reforms, including privatization, more vigorously. The timely adoption of
such policies, and pursuit of the recommendations of the Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) follow-up, will also support maintaining the currency board arrangement until euro
introduction.
Against this background, Directors viewed the authorities’ macroeconomic program for 2004–05
as adequate, although many of them would have preferred a more ambitious fiscal adjustment,
especially in 2004, to dampen domestic demand, particularly as the CBA constrains monetary
policy actions. They commended the authorities for reversing the expansionary stance of the
2004 budget and for envisaging budget balance in 2005. In light of the revenue overperformance
so far in 2004, they urged the authorities to save the overperformance at least until budget
balance is assured, and to resist pressures to increase spending in the run up to next year’s
election. Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to undertake further fiscal tightening
should the current account or inflation performance be weaker than currently projected.
With regard to the medium term fiscal position, and in view of the need to accommodate higher
infrastructure spending in the future, Directors cautioned the authorities to implement their
strategy of shifting partially from direct to indirect taxation in a revenue neutral way, and urged
them to accelerate reforms to strengthen tax administration and expenditure management.
Measures are also needed to ensure the sustainability of the pension and health care systems.
Finally, in light of the need to enter ERM2 with a solid fiscal position, Directors encouraged the
authorities to take timely steps to prevent fiscal deficits upon EU accession.
Directors commended the authorities for their measures to reduce credit growth by tightening
reserve requirements and shifting certain government and other deposits from commercial banks
to the central bank. However, as the effectiveness of these measures remains to be seen in the
context of an open capital account, fiscal flexibility needs to be maintained to respond promptly if
credit expansion continues to fuel excessive growth of domestic demand and imports.
Directors strongly supported the authorities’ intention to complement demand management
policies with structural reforms aimed at enhancing supply. They were encouraged by the
authorities’ focus on measures to improve the business climate, including by reducing barriers to
entrepreneurial activity and making the labor market more flexible, which will help to attract
greater foreign direct investment. Directors noted that structural reforms have slowed, with the
privatization of some major state monopolies still incomplete, and little progress in health,
education, and railway sector reforms. As privatization is critical to meeting Bulgaria’s external
financing requirements in the next few years and to increasing productivity, they welcomed the
long-delayed sale of the telecoms company (BTC) and the plans to complete the privatization of
the tobacco holding (Bulgartabac) as well as to sell the electricity distribution companies before
year end. The establishment of a new privatization pipeline for 2005-06 is also crucial.
Directors welcomed the opportunity to review Bulgaria’s program engagement with the Fund
since the mid 1990s. They considered that the ex post assessment (EPA) contains a balanced
analysis of the country’s performance under Fund arrangements and of the role played by the
Fund in Bulgaria. The EPA also highlights that strong country ownership from the outset is critical
for the success of Fund-supported programs. Directors noted that the 1996/97 crisis had been a

-4watershed for the country, triggering a fundamental change in policies and boosting program
ownership. They considered that the Fund had played an important role in providing a blueprint
for reform and in helping to muster domestic support for its successful implementation since the
crisis. As important macroeconomic risks remain, most Directors viewed continued Fund
engagement under a successor Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) appropriate to support the
government’s economic program and help maintain policy discipline, provided that economic
policies and the commitment to reform are consistent with the need to reduce macroeconomic
risks. However, given the long-term program engagement and the absence of an imminent
financing need, they concurred with the authorities that a new SBA should have lower access
and be precautionary, and provide a clear strategy for the transition from a program-based
relationship with the Fund. Most Directors were of the view that in this regard EU accession,
expected for early 2007, should offer a natural exit. A few Directors, while prepared to go along
with a precautionary SBA, noted that a surveillance-only relationship would be as effective in
supporting the authorities’ economic program, and would not imply a reduced role for the Fund.
Directors welcomed the improvements in data quality as well as the decision to subscribe to the
Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
