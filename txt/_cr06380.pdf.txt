EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

From 2005 until early 2006, Korea enjoyed strong growth on the back of rapidly
increasing exports and consumption. This favorable situation has led to large capital
inflows, a stronger won, and low inflation. In the past few months, however, the economy
has slowed while inflation has picked up.

•

The staff team anticipates a soft landing, with GDP growth easing from 5 percent in
2006 to 4¼ percent in 2007, while inflation remains low. However, the risks to growth are
mostly on the downside, arising from the possibility of a sharper slowdown in the U.S.
economy, high and volatile oil prices, and tighter global financial market conditions.

•

What short-term policies should the authorities pursue? Until now, they have been
withdrawing macroeconomic stimulus as the recovery has progressed. But with downside
risks mounting, a neutral stance is more appropriate, with monetary policy guarding
against a slowing economy. On the financial policy side, action is needed to improve the
flow of debtor information and curb excessive lending by smaller non-bank financial
institutions.

•

Beyond these immediate challenges, longer-term problems loom. Potential output
growth has started to decline and would slow much further if current trends—an ageing
population, decelerating capital accumulation, and falling productivity growth—continue.
Reversing this trend will require a fundamental reform: just as Korea once industrialized
by thrusting the manufacturing sector into the global economy, it now needs to do the
same for the financial sector, the service sector, and the labor market. Specifically, the
authorities should:
o Implement their plans to build an advanced financial system by deregulating capital
markets and the foreign exchange system, while complementing these reforms with
measures to contain the attendant risks;
o Improve service productivity by opening the sector up to more competition and
enhancing small firms’ access to finance;
o Increase labor market flexibility by reducing the costs of dismissals while expanding
the social safety net;
o Address the prospective long-term deterioration of the fiscal position owing to
population aging by tackling the health care and pension problems.

A GLOBALIZATION STORY
“The development plan [aims] to prepare Korea to maintain an acceptable standard of living
when external aid ends…Industry is not highly developed.”
–First Article IV Staff Report, 1956.
1.
Fifty years ago, Korea held its first
Article IV consultation with the Fund. At
that time, the country was a poor agricultural
nation, the poorest member of the IMF, in
fact. However, it soon embarked on a
strategy to transform a nation of farmers into
an industrial power. At the heart of this plan
was a radical strategy of developing the
country through exports. In other words,
Korea—for so long known as the “Hermit
Kingdom”—decided to join the world.

This development path proved the road to prosperity. By 1982, the country had
entered the ranks of the world’s top 15 exporters. By the mid-1990s it had joined the OECD.
And though the country suffered a setback during the 1997 crisis, this gave further impetus to
the strategy of economic opening. Thus, the banking system was opened to foreign capital,
while restrictions on foreign portfolio investment were abandoned. And in very short order
the economy began growing again, rapidly. Five years after the crisis, the economy was
one-quarter larger than it had been before.
3.
Now, Korea is an industrialized country, specializing in the production of
advanced technology products. But looking ahead to the next 50 years, new challenges
loom on the horizon. On current trends, potential growth will slow considerably, in large part
because the population is aging rapidly. Moreover, the benefits of economic growth are no
longer flowing through to the entire population, since a growing portion of the labor force can
only find nonregular jobs, at lower pay and with greater job insecurity.
4.
How can Korea deal with these challenges? This question formed the crux of this
year’s Article IV consultation discussions. But first, there are near-term issues that need to be
dealt with, since the economy is slowing.
I. HOW CAN KOREA NAVIGATE THE SHORT-TERM?
5.
For most of the period since the previous consultation, Korea has enjoyed a
“Goldilocks” economy, with growth strong and inflation low (Table 1). From the second
quarter of 2005 through the first quarter of 2006, growth had been running at a 6 percent
annualized rate, on the back of rapid export growth. One reason why exports have been
doing so well is that nearly 40 percent consists of electronics, and the global electronics sector

5
has experienced a renewed upswing (Box
1). Another reason is that Korea has been
benefiting from the boom in neighboring
China, as the two countries have been
rapidly restoring their historically close
economic ties (Box 2).

Investment, however, has remained
sluggish, especially in construction, the result of strict measures introduced to control housing
speculation, including levying heavy capital gains taxes of up to 55 percent on sales of
secondary homes.

7.
The favorable situation has attracted large capital inflows (Table 3). The impact of
these flows on the exchange rate has been partially tempered by a shrinking external current
account surplus, which halved to 2 percent of GDP last year and essentially vanished this

Electronics exports have performed very well in
recent quarters, but some slowdown is expected.
Global demand for all lines of electronics products
surged in the summer of 2005, initially spurred by
advances in consumer electronics and later
complemented by higher corporate investment,
particularly in the United States. While export
performance has so far remained resilient, analysts see
a moderation in U.S. demand going forward, which
could be partly compensated by higher-than-expected
growth in Europe.

Feb-05

The spectacular growth of Korea’s electronics
exports exemplifies the country’s successful
integration into world markets. Over two decades
starting in the mid-1970s, Korea rose from the ranks
of the smaller international players to become a global
leader in many key electronic product lines. This
success did not come about by chance. Businesses
made a massive capital investment and the education
system produced large numbers of well-qualified
engineers. The sector has now become a key part of
the Korean economy, accounting for 40 percent of
total exports last year.

In the medium-term, Korea is very well placed to take advantage of global shifts in the
electronics sector, particularly in memory products. Korea holds a commanding 60 percent share
of global sales of flash memory products, which might prove decisive as flash memory progressively
replaces DRAM and hard drives on many lines of electronics hardware.1 Korean electronic
manufacturers are investing heavily to take advantage of these opportunities, both in Korea and
abroad. Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics and Hynix plan a combined capex spending of some
$15 billion in 2006, comparable to 2005. Early indications show that, while most of capex spending
will be done in Korea, capex spending abroad will rise as Korean firms try to cut costs and position
themselves closer to final demand. For instance, in the case of Hynix the share of total capex done
abroad will rise from 10 percent in 2005 to a planned 35 percent in 2006.
Profits are high—although the stronger won has chipped away some—and market participants
are upbeat about future profitability trends. In the wake of the ascending won, net profits fell by
30 percent in 2005 at Samsung Electronics and by 55 percent at LG Electronics, while they increased
by a modest 7 percent at Hynix. However, profits are still high: 2005 net profits at Samsung
Electronics fell just short of $8 billion. Looking at forward-looking indicators of sectoral profitability,
the IT sub-index of the KOSPI has fallen some 15 percent since April together with the overall
market, but it remains 25 percent above July 2004 levels.

DRAM and flash are two types of memory chips. While DRAM has the advantage of fast memory retrieval,
DRAM chips are volatile, meaning that any information stored is lost when the power is turned off. Flash is
gaining market share because it is nonvolatile, a very convenient feature for fast-growing items such as handsets
and MP3 players. Flash is quickly closing the gap with DRAM in terms of capacity, speed, and cost.

Box 2. Economic Integration Between Korea and China
In recent years, Korea’s trade with China has been expanding rapidly. Korea’s exports to China
have grown on average 18 percent per annum during the last five years, to the point where Korea is
now the second largest exporter to China after Japan and China is the most important export
destination for Korea. These exports are mostly capital goods and industrial supplies, mainly for
Korean companies operating in China. About half of these exports are estimated to be re-exported to
the G-3 countries, reflecting the successful integration of the economies into the regional production
chain. Nevertheless, the share of Korean exports locally consumed in China is also reportedly rising
(from very low levels) as Korean brands, particularly in electronics, are gaining popularity. Imports
from China to Korea have also increased significantly, reaching 14 percent of the total in 2005, with
capital goods and industrial supplies forming the

Although for the most part China’s integration
has helped to boost Korea’s exports and growth
prospects, China’s rapid emergence has also
raised concerns in some sectors. Korea’s steel
industry, for one, is experiencing adjustment
pressures in the wake of China’s rapid emergence as
a net steel exporter, as it has been forced to accept
deep price cuts. Traditional export manufacturers
such as in textiles and leather and import competing
domestic firms are also losing market share due to
both the appreciating won and competition from
China. Hollowing out pressures from China are one
contributing factor behind the sluggish pace of
corporate investment and widening gap between
large and small companies.

Korea has also emerged as China’s largest foreign
direct investor, as Korean companies have shifted
basic production to China. While large Korean
companies used to dominate the FDI to China in the
early 1990s, more recently Korean SMEs have
caught up, and their share in total FDI to China has
increased to over 50 percent by 2005. China’s
overseas FDI to Korea has also increased, reaching
$1.2 billion in 2004, concentrated in larger strategic
mergers and acquisitions.

To better serve the needs of the region, the
government aims to transform Korea into a logistics,
business, and financial hub. In financial services, the government plans include fully liberalizing the
capital account, deregulating the capital markets, and overhauling the legal and regulatory system.

generally allowing the external value of the currency to be determined in the market, while
intervening to slow the pace of appreciation when inflows became particularly intense.
Accordingly, foreign exchange reserves have increased 7 percent over the year to July,
reaching $226 billion, exceeding total external debt.
8.
As the won has appreciated,
inflation has fallen. The won’s
appreciation has contained the impact of
international oil price increases, while
amplifying the benefits of low imported
inflation (especially from China) and
declining regional food prices. As a result,
from late 2004 to early 2006 both core and
headline inflation fell steadily, reaching a
low of 1½–2 percent, below the 2½–
3½ percent target range.

9.
In the past few months, however, signs have emerged suggesting that this
“Goldilocks” period might be coming to an end. Headline inflation has been creeping up,
and in August surged to nearly 3 percent, the center of the target band. Meanwhile, the
economy has been slowing, as the export and consumption booms have begun to mature,
while higher global oil prices have also begun to take a toll on the world’s fourth largest oil
importer. In recent months, production, leading indicators, and sentiment have all turned
down.
10.
Looking ahead, the staff team anticipates a soft landing. Under the central
scenario, export growth will slow somewhat as the electronics cycle progresses, while private
consumption—which has been racing ahead of household income—will slow to a more
sustainable pace. Accordingly, GDP growth would decline from 5 percent in 2006 to
4¼ percent in 2007, marginally below the team’s estimate of potential growth (Table 4).
However, the risks are to the downside, arising from:
•

Slower growth in the United States. A serious slowdown would have a major
impact, since exports are 40 percent of GDP and the United States is Korea’s secondlargest market after China.

•

High and volatile oil prices. A sustained 10 percent increase from the $75/barrel
forecast could reduce growth by 0.2 percentage point according to the Bank of Korea,
an estimate with which the staff agrees.

•

Tighter global financial market conditions. The impact of a rise in global risk
aversion should be manageable because Korea’s fundamentals are strong: reserves are

9
large, public debt low (36 percent of GDP), and financial and corporate balance
sheets are healthy (Appendix I; Tables 5 and 6).1 Even so, the effect on growth could
still be significant, because U.S. interest rates are highly correlated with longer-term
Korean rates, and higher domestic rates would put renewed pressure on the highlyindebted household and SME sectors.

based on two main motivations. To begin
with, they have been trying to raise interest rates to what they regard as a more neutral level,
as a pre-emptive move against inflationary pressures. Also, they have been concerned about
the emergence of real estate speculation, as apartment prices in Seoul have increased by
9 percent in the year to July, fueled by an 11 percent (y/y) rise in bank loans to households.

As the economy has slowed, however, the Bank has indicated that monetary
policy considerations are now finely balanced. The team asked whether recovery might
now be the greater risk. It noted that inflation seems firmly under control: the August surge
was due to temporary factors (flooding led to a sharp rise in food prices), while core inflation
is a modest 2¼ percent, unit labor cost growth is similarly subdued. Consequently, inflation
would remain low, even under the team’s

10
through supply-side measures to alleviate the shortage of modern apartments in Seoul, rather
than monetary policy.
13.
The Bank responded that their inflation projections were somewhat more
pessimistic. But they agreed that the economy was slowing, and that future rate adjustments
would need to be data-dependent.
14.
The team and the Bank agreed that in such circumstances, where monetary
policy was at a cross-roads, clear communication of the central bank’s intentions will be
essential. Partly for this reason, the central bank announced that from 2007 it would be
shifting its target from core to headline inflation, a measure that is more widely understood
and has a greater impact on expectations. The team supported this shift, which brings Korea
into line with most advanced inflation-targeting countries, but noted that it runs a risk, since a
renewed surge in oil prices could render a headline target impossible or inappropriate to
achieve. In these circumstances, the best solution, the team and authorities agreed, would be
to explain the situation clearly to the public.
15.
At the same time, the team recommended three additional refinements to the
inflation targeting framework. First, quantitative surveys of the expected inflation rate
could be introduced, so that the central bank could check to see if expectations are in line with
the target. Second, the three-year assessment period (under which performance is only
evaluated at the end of three years) could be eliminated, so that if the target were to be
breached an explanation would be provided relatively quickly. Third, the central bank could
provide periodic detailed explanations of what it is doing to achieve the inflation target in the
interval between inflation reports, which are published only every six months.
16.
The team commended the authorities for adhering to their flexible exchange rate
policy. Some public commentators have expressed concern that the won’s significant
appreciation has had a serious effect on competitiveness, pointing to the fall-off in exports by
small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the recent declines in the profitability of
larger firms. But in the authorities’ view, shared by the team, overall competitiveness remains
appropriate (Box 3). For one, export growth remains rapid and Korea’s share of world trade
has actually been increasing over the past several years, to record levels. And while corporate
profitability has declined, profit levels still remain near historically high levels, as do stock
prices, suggesting that the market believes that the strong performance will continue into the
future. A key reason for market optimism is that productivity has been advancing rapidly in
the export sector, so that the real effective exchange rate based on unit labor costs is not
particularly high when viewed in a longer-term context. Finally, the difficulties of small-

Since 2004 the Korean won has appreciated
significantly, more than any other currency in
Asia. The cumulative appreciation against the U.S.
dollar from October 2004 through August 2006
amounts to more than 15 percent, and the real
effective appreciation has been of similar
magnitude. Strong capital inflows were met with
large and sustained interventions during 2003, but
more recent interventions have been shorter-lived
and aimed at smoothing the speed of appreciation
rather than preventing appreciation altogether.

An increase indicates appreciation. Data for August 2006 is as of August 18.

Despite recent appreciation, the exchange rate
remains broadly in line with fundamentals.
Econometric analysis by the Consultative Group on
Exchange Rates—with which the staff team
agrees—suggests that the won appreciation is
consistent with Korea’s strong productivity growth
relative to its trading partners, implying large
Balassa-Samuelson effects.

Overall, exports are holding up well. Exports of
capital-intensive goods such as machinery and
electronics have performed very well in recent
months, reflecting Korea’s competitiveness in these sectors and the strength of global demand.
Exports of small and medium enterprises (SMEs)—often labor-intensive goods—have lagged behind
those of large corporates despite some recent improvements. While this reflects long-standing
structural problems in the sector rather than pure exchange rate pressures, currency appreciation may
exacerbate the polarization between SMEs and large corporates.
Corporate profits are falling due to the stronger currency; nonetheless they remain high, and
markets are pricing good future profitability. Overall, the non-financial sector’s net savings fell
from 9.5 percent of GDP in 2004 to 8.5 percent in 2005, still a historically high level and
substantially higher than the 5 percent level in Taiwan Province of China. Moreover, forward-looking
indicators such as stock prices have performed well over the period of the won appreciation, with the
KOSPI gaining around 50 percent from end-2004 to August 2006.
Imports of goods and services have surged, but this is only partly due to the higher won. Higher
oil prices account for one-third of total import growth since 2004, while the domestic demand
recovery accounts for another third, according to staff estimates. The final third can be attributed to
the higher won, which has undoubtedly stimulated some imports. For example, travel abroad by
Koreans rose by more than 35 percent between the first half of 2004 and the first half of 2006.
Finally, it is worth considering whether the won might actually be undervalued. The case,
however, is difficult to make, since the current account balance is not far from estimates of longerterm equilibrium, while corporate profits are not exceptionally high by advanced country standards.

12
and medium-sized exporters pre-date the appreciation, are deep-rooted, and are best handled
through structural measures (spelled out in the 2004 Article IV consultation).
17.
On the budget side, there was broad agreement that a neutral fiscal stance would
be appropriate for this stage of the economic cycle. The government has budgeted a deficit
(excluding social security funds, and including the supplementary budget) of 1¾ percent of
GDP for 2006, compared with last year’s actual outcome of ¾ percent of GDP (Table 7). But
the authorities stressed that the actual deficit could be closer to last year’s outcome, because
expenditures will likely remain below budgeted levels. A similarly neutral fiscal stance was
planned for next year, as well.
18.
On the financial policy side, the key task, the team noted, would be to guard
against the dangers arising from a renewed rise in global risk aversion. For such sentiment
could quickly spread to Korea, prompting local lenders to raise their lending rates. And this
would put renewed pressure on two major groups of borrowers. First, consumers, whose debt
amounts to around 140 percent of disposable income (higher than in the United States), the
bulk of which is at variable interest rates. Second, SMEs, which have an average debt/equity
ratio of 141 percent, well above the 86 percent ratio for Korea’s large corporates. Should the
creditworthiness of some of these borrowers deteriorate, banks might respond by clamping
down on credit, which could have a serious effect on growth.2
19.
One way to mitigate these risks, the team noted, was by improving the flow of
information. Specifically, greater provision of positive credit information (on how well
borrowers are servicing their debts) would allow lenders to respond in a more precise and
graduated fashion. Currently, such information remains scarce, partly because it can only be
transmitted to credit bureaus with the permission of credit card customers, which is complex
and costly to secure. To eliminate this constraint, the team proposed two measures. One would
be to require customers to provide permission before they can get their cards renewed. Another
would be to shift to an “opt out” system, as in the United States, where customers are deemed
to have agreed unless they specifically object to the new credit terms. The authorities
welcomed this suggestion, noting that they have been trying to encourage the development of
credit bureaus. But they noted that such measures could run up against the public’s strong
demand for privacy.
20.
The team also proposed measures to control risks at the mutual savings banks.
These institutions, though currently small (holding only 3 percent of financial system assets),
have been taking advantage of their relatively light regulation to expand their loan portfolios

2

A rise in defaults would affect banks’ profitability, but would not threaten their stability since they are well
capitalized (average capital-adequacy ratio of 13 percent), loans are short-term and variable-rate, and loan-to-value
ratios for mortgages average just 52 percent. These buffers worked well during the credit card crisis: while profits
fell temporarily, they soon rebounded, and in the interim banks’ credit standing was maintained.

13
rapidly, especially for mortgages and to SMEs. To contain the risks, the team recommended
subjecting these institutions to the same prudential regulations as those imposed on banks,
including loan-to-value limits on mortgages and the use of forward-looking criteria (i.e.,
assessments of firms’ future cashflows) when provisioning on loans. In response, the
authorities indicated that they were also concerned, and would take steps to rein in their credit
growth.
21.
Another issue relates to foreign exchange lending by domestic banks, which
increased by $8½ billion in the first half of 2006.3 Although the amounts remain relatively
modest, they are still of concern to the authorities because these loans are largely unhedged,
with many of the borrowers banking on a won appreciation. The authorities consequently plan
to monitor this trend closely—a strategy the team endorsed.
II. HOW CAN KOREA SPUR LONG-TERM GROWTH?
22.
Beyond these immediate challenges, longer-term problems loom. One problem
relates to the labor force. The population

Assuming these trends continue,
potential output growth would slow

14
crisis; by mid-century, it could fall to just 2 percent, an estimate that is broadly in line with the
authorities’ own projections.4 And this matters because Korea’s per capita income, for all of its
tremendous progress over the past 50 years, is still only about 70 percent of the OECD average
(in purchasing power parity terms). So, a key longer-term question—perhaps the key
question—is how can current trends be reversed, so that Korea can catch up quickly to the most
advanced countries. In the government’s view, the answer lies in advancing the process started
half a century ago: further integrating Korea into the world economy, by deregulating and
opening up the financial sector, the service sector, and the labor market. But how should this be
done?
A. How Can Korea Build an Advanced Financial Sector?
24.
Consider first the financial sector. While the sector is sound, and the banking sector
40

has advanced, capital markets remain

the longer-term bond market (beyond three
years). Related to this, secondary bond market turnover is low.
25.
This underdevelopment is costly because an advanced financial sector could help
solve a number of Korea’s long-term problems. It could invigorate Korea’s investment by
providing mechanisms for corporations to transfer risk to the wider investing public. It could
foster start-ups and advanced technology companies, which will become increasingly important
as Korea becomes more knowledge and technology intensive. In addition, the more developed
the financial sector, the better it will be at allocating capital to its most productive uses, thereby
stimulating productivity.
26.
But how can such an advanced financial sector be built? The government’s vision is
to integrate Korea’s financial system into the global economy, eventually building a financial
hub for Northeast Asia. In the current stage, the plan is resting on two main pillars, the first of
which is the deregulation of the capital market. Under the planned Financial Investment
Services and Capital Market Act, the government will remove the restrictions that currently
4

The team’s projections assume that participation rates are unchanged (the recent trend), the capital stock grows at
the rate of the past five years, productivity growth in services does not improve, and manufacturing productivity
growth gradually slows to advanced economy levels. See Chapter I of the Selected Issues.
5

See Chapter II of the Selected Issues.

15
separate the companies involved in capital market activities, thereby redividing the financial
system into three subsectors: banks, insurance companies, and investment banks. At the same
time, the sector would be shifted from a positive system of regulation to a negative one, in
which all activities not expressedly forbidden would be allowed. The team supported this
reform, noting that it will bring Korea into line with international trends, and promote
competition and innovation. But it will also give rise to risks.
27.
Prominent among these will be the risk of conflict of interest. And dealing with
these potential conflicts of interest will be critically important, for if there is misconduct
following the deregulation, this could damage confidence in the capital market, thereby setting
back its development and defeating the purpose of the reform. To discourage misconduct, the
team suggested increasing legal penalties for those who violate the law, allowing class action
lawsuits for conflict-of-interest violations, and in cases of severe violations, banning the
offenders from the industry for life. All of these measures could deter fraud, and bring Korea’s
system closer to the standards in financially advanced countries. The authorities agreed, and
said they were already planning similar measures.
28.
The team asked how the authorities were planning to deal with the potential
conflict between underwriters, who will be trying to sell newly-issued bonds and equity,
and asset managers, who will be buying them. The authorities explained that they planned to
erect “Chinese walls”, so as to block the flow of information and staff between these two
entities. The team cautioned, however, that such walls have proved porous even in the most
financially advanced countries. Consequently, it might be useful to adopt reinforcing measures,
such as maintaining a legal separation between underwriters and asset managers (e.g., separate
subsidiaries), as practiced in all the top global investment banks.
29.
The team also stressed that it would be important to refrain from allowing
industrial groups to take controlling stakes in banks. The team noted that such a measure is
superficially attractive in that it could allow cash-rich corporates to develop the banking
system. But it could actually amplify risks because it would open the door for the most
damaging conflict of interest of all: connected lending between banks and their owners. The
authorities noted that Korea has changed radically since the 1990s: the chaebol were now
borrowing little from banks, and in any case supervision has improved. The team agreed, but
noted that the chaebols’ financing needs could change, while even the countries with the most
advanced supervision are wary of allowing industrial firms to own banks.6 For this reason, it
would be advisable to maintain the current wall.
30.
The second pillar of the financial hub strategy is the complete liberalization of the
foreign exchange system. Recently, a major step in this direction was taken when the
government swept away many of the lingering restrictions on capital account transactions, and

6

See Chapter III of the Selected Issues.

16
accelerated the timetable for complete liberalization to 2009.7 The team welcomed these
actions, noting that they have helped the market grow deeper and more liquid: foreign
exchange transactions grew by 15 percent (q/q) in the second quarter. Consequently, it
proposed building on these steps by taking measures to improve the domestic money and bond
markets.
31.
Specifically, the team recommended three measures. First, to develop the money
market, participation in the overnight call market could be restricted to banks, forcing others to
use longer-term “repo” transactions. Second, incentives could be given to primary dealers to
provide liquidity in the bond market. Third, to improve transparency, primary dealers could be
required to report publicly all transactions to the dealers’ association within 15 minutes,
without exception. The authorities broadly agreed.
B. How Can Service Sector Productivity be Improved?
32.
Now, consider the nonfinancial service sector. The sector is large and growing,
accounting for about half of GDP and almost two-thirds of employment. But it is not very
productive. Labor productivity is only about half that in manufacturing, the largest gap in the
OECD, essentially because the sector has been sheltered from competition, both domestically
and globally. For example, only nonprofit institutions can establish schools or hospitals. Small
establishments find it difficult to grow, since regulations limit the type of collateral they can
use when applying for loans. Meanwhile, the retail sector is dominated by inefficient “momand-pop” shops because land use restrictions prevent the proliferation of larger outlets, while
labor market rigidities make it difficult for workers to find regular jobs. (See Section C.)
33.
What can be done to address this problem? The team and authorities agreed that the
best way to do this is by further integrating the sector into the world economy. That is why the
government is considering opening up and deregulating services, notably in the medical,
educational, and business services areas. Amongst these, deregulating education is perhaps the
most critical, since high levels of human capital are essential for a knowledge-based economy.
In some ways, Korean human capital is exceptionally high: the proportion of high school
graduates is the highest in the OECD. Still, problems exist: surveys of academics and
employers give low marks to Korean universities. Accordingly, the OECD has recommended
deregulating universities and promoting competition amongst them, not least by opening the
market to foreign providers. Such measures, however, face considerable domestic political
opposition.
34.
As one strategy for advancing service sector deregulation, the government is
negotiating free trade agreements with the United States and other countries. The team
noted, however, that it would be important to ensure that the sectoral openings under these
bilateral agreements be as nondiscriminatory as possible, so as to simplify implementation and

17
minimize the risks of trade diversion. It also stressed that the greatest stimulus from trade
liberalization would come from a multilateral liberalization under the Doha development
round. The authorities agreed, but noted that a successful conclusion to Doha would require a
greater consensus amongst the largest trading blocs. In the meantime, they reached an
agreement with trading partners in the most difficult area, rice imports. In-quota imports will be
doubled to 8 percent of consumption by 2014, in line with the overall strategy of shifting from
import protection to direct support to farmers—although, for the moment, agricultural tariffs
still average 52 percent.
35.
In addition to educational and trade initiatives, creating a knowledge-based
economy will require ways of encouraging the growth of small but promising service
firms.8 For it is striking that while Korea is very successful compared to other countries in
creating new firms, these firms find it unusually difficult to grow. One reason is the current
financing system. To secure bank loans, small firms usually need to pledge land as collateral
(or obtain government guarantees). But many small firms, especially knowledge-based ones, do
not really have any land; what they possess is intellectual property and contracts with other
firms to supply their services. Thus, the civil code needs to be amended to allow them to use
these assets as collateral, and commercial credit insurance developed so that this collateral will
be accepted by banks. The authorities concurred, explaining that they planned to deregulate
commercial credit insurance, allowing banks and insurance companies to enter the field to
compete with government agencies.
C. How Can Korea’s Labor Market be Fixed?
36.
As Korea shifts toward a knowledge-based economy, labor market flexibility will
become increasingly important. Already, Korean firms have been trying to overcome the
inflexibility of the regular labor market by replacing permanent employees with fixed-term
staff. Consequently, over the past four years alone, the share of nonregular (i.e., fixed-term)
employment has grown by 10 percentage points to 37 percent of salaried employment, more
than double the OECD average. At the same time, involuntary self-employment has increased,
notably in the “mom-and-pop” retail sector.9

These shifts in employment have been accompanied by a significant increase in
income inequality. To be sure, much of this increase in inequality has been caused by other
factors, including global trends to which Korea has not been immune. But the changes in Korea
have been more dramatic than elsewhere. Since 1997, for example, the Gini coefficient has
risen by more than four percentage points, compared to less than one percentage point in
countries such as the United States

38.
What can be done to address Choi, Korea Development Institute.
this problem? The key ingredients of a solution are two: less costly dismissal conditions and
better social safety nets. Currently, firms are reluctant to hire regular workers because the cost
of laying them off, should market conditions change, is very high: conditions for mass
dismissals are strict, while consultation periods with trade unions are mandatory and long.
These requirements need to be relaxed, either by changing the current system or perhaps by
introducing a new contract, while “grandfathering” those already employed under the existing
one. Such changes, the team argued, could trigger an increase in new regular jobs and thereby
reduce polarization. The authorities indicated that they have been trying to reduce dismissal
costs, but this has proved an intractable problem because it requires social consensus, which
was very difficult to obtain.
39.
The authorities agreed that improving the social safety net was a priority. They
planned to introduce an Earned Income Tax Credit in 2008, to ensure that all wage earners
would have a minimum standard of living. In addition, they had expanded the proportion of
workers eligible for unemployment benefits to 85 percent from 66 percent in 2003, though
because of compliance problems actual coverage remained much lower.
D. How Can the Long-Term Fiscal Issues be Addressed?
40.
Finally, even if the longer-term growth and polarization issues are addressed, one
major long-term challenge will remain: the prospective deterioration of the fiscal
position. Under current parameters, the aging of the population could raise the cost of health
and long-term care by 8½ percent of GDP by 2050, and deplete the assets of the pension

19
system, requiring annual budgetary transfers of close to 7 percent of GDP (according to OECD
projections).10
41.
Given these looming fiscal burdens, the team noted, it will be helpful to preserve as
much “fiscal space” as possible to deal with them. The authorities agreed, explaining that
they were framing medium-term fiscal policy so as to ensure that the debt/GDP ratio remained
around its current ratio (30 percent of GDP under their definitions), thereby ensuring that future
taxpayers will not need to bear a large interest burden, on top of the heavy health and pension
costs. To achieve this target, they would carefully examine the scope for offsetting the costs of
new expenditure programs by reducing other expenditure.
42.
The team asked about the specific measures being taken to tackle the health care
and pension problems. The authorities stated that they were introducing new mechanisms to
contain health care cost pressures, including by revamping the pricing mechanisms for health
services and pharmaceuticals. They had also recently proposed reducing the replacement ratio
(the ratio of benefits to wages) of the National Pension Fund to 40 percent from the current
60 percent, while raising contribution rates to 12–13 percent from the current 9 percent, a step
that should go a long way in restoring the system to financial health. But this proposal, they
noted, had encountered considerable resistance in the National Assembly, where the
government lacks a majority.
43.
Even with such determined efforts to control spending, the authorities noted,
expenditure was still likely to rise over the medium-term. Apart from the pressures from
population aging, the growing social polarization is fueling demands for additional social
spending, which remains much lower than in most OECD countries. Consequently, they are
now considering how to increase revenues, preferably without raising tax rates. The team noted
that the greatest scope for this would seem to come from the personal income tax, which at
3 percent of GDP is well below the OECD average of 10 percent, largely because deductions
are extensive and audits infrequent. The authorities responded that efforts were currently being
made to step up enforcement, particularly against those with scope to understate their income,
such as professionals and the self-employed. For example, penalties for tax fraud are being
increased, and high-income self-employed will be required to use business bank accounts for
all business transactions.
44.
Finally, the team flagged the risks arising from off-budget spending, notably from
the increasing use of Build-Transfer-Lease (BTL) projects. The mission noted that such
projects are appealing in an environment of fiscal restraint, since they avoid the need for
immediate outlays, which are funded by the private sector. Yet the cash costs are not
eliminated: they are merely postponed until the time when the lease obligations begin to fall
due. Consequently, fiscal transparency would require a clear accounting of the value of these
future obligations. The authorities stated that the capital value of the projects would be made
10

See Chapter VI of the Selected Issues.

20
public, but noted that a full solution would need to await the move to accrual budget
accounting, which would take place over the medium term.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
45.
It is now been half a century since Korea joined the International Monetary Fund.
During this period, the country has developed from a poor agrarian society into a modern
industrial power, a transformation that has been so rapid, thoroughgoing, and unusual that it
has been termed the “Miracle on the Han River”. This transformation was achieved by
integrating the manufacturing sector into the global economy. But other sectors—the financial
and service sectors, and the labor market—have remained regulated and sheltered from foreign
competition, stymieing their development and keeping Korea’s per capita income below that of
the richest nations.
46.
Moreover, looking ahead to the next half century, major challenges loom. Potential
growth is slowing as the population ages, while social polarization—that is to say, the gap in
incomes and job security between those who have good jobs and those who do not—is
growing.
47.
How can Korea deal with these challenges? The government firmly believes that the
solution lies in furthering Korea’s integration into the world economy. Just as the government
thrust the manufacturing sector into the global arena a few decades ago, now it plans to apply
the same remedy to the other sectors. The staff strongly supports this strategy. Consequently,
its recommendations have focused mainly on tactics, on specific measures to achieve these
broad objectives.
48.
But before addressing the medium-term issues, there is a question of how to
navigate the short-term difficulties. For after a comfortable period when growth was rapid
and inflation low, the economy is now slowing while inflation has been creeping upwards.
Moreover, further complications arise because growth in the United States has softened, oil
prices are high and volatile, while global financial conditions are tightening. In these
circumstances, what policy stance should the authorities take?
49.
On macroeconomic policy, the authorities have been scaling back their policy
stimulus as the recovery progresses. But the monetary policy rate may now be close to
neutral levels, while the greater risk seems to be to the recovery, rather than to inflation, which
is likely to remain at low levels. Consequently, policy will need to be data-dependent, with the
rationale communicated clearly. In this endeavor, the recent shift to targeting headline inflation
should help, by making it clear that Bank of Korea is aiming at the same cost of living measure
used by the general public. Beyond this, some other steps could be taken to improve the
efficiency of monetary policy, notably introducing surveys of quantitative inflation
expectations, providing periodic explanations of the central bank’s strategy between inflation
reports, and (to improve accountability) eliminating the three-year period for assessing
monetary policy.

21
50.
The staff commends the authorities’ policy of allowing the won’s external value to
be determined in the foreign exchange market, limiting intervention to smoothing
operations. Despite the won’s rise and the sharp fall in the current account balance,
productivity increases have ensured that overall competitiveness remains appropriate, as shown
by the rise in Korea’s share of world trade to record levels. While SME exports have fallen,
this reflects long-standing problems, which should be dealt with through structural measures.
51.
On the financial policy side, the key task would be to guard against the dangers
arising from a renewed rise in risk aversion. For such sentiment could prompt lenders to
raise their lending rates and curb their credit, which could have a serious impact on growth.
One way to mitigate this risk would be by improving the flow of information to credit bureaus,
so that lenders can monitor and respond in a more precise fashion. At the same time, mutual
savings banks, which have been expanding loans rapidly, should be monitored carefully and
subjected to the same prudential regulations as those imposed on banks. And since banks have
been expanding foreign currency loans rapidly, supervisors should ensure that these institutions
are monitoring borrowers’ cashflow carefully.
52.
On the structural side, the staff warmly welcomes the plans to develop an
advanced financial sector. The plan to deregulate the capital markets, in particular, should
prove a major spur to competition and innovation. But its needs to be accompanied by strong
measures to contain risks. Specifically, the staff recommends maintaining a legal separation
between investment banks and asset managers, while increasing legal penalties and allowing
class action lawsuits for conflict-of-interest violations. It will also be important to maintain the
policy of preventing industrial groups for owning banks, because such ownership could lead to
connected lending, the most damaging conflict of interest of all. At the same time, the plan to
fully liberalize the foreign exchange system should be complemented by measures to improve
the domestic money and bond markets, specifically to boost repo transactions, encourage
primary dealers to provide liquidity to the market, and improve transparency in transactions.
53.
The staff supports the government’s strategy trying to spur productivity in
nonfinancial services by opening up and deregulating the sector. In particular, it supports
the strategy of opening sectors through trade liberalization. But it notes that bilateral trade deals
need to be as nondiscriminatory as possible, and urges Korea—with its large stake in the future
of the global trading system—to take a leadership role in advancing multilateral liberalization
under the Doha Development Round. Beyond this step, measures are also needed to improve
the financing of small but promising service firms, notably by allowing intellectual property
and supply contracts with other firms to be used as collateral.
54.
As Korea shifts toward a knowledge-based economy, labor market flexibility will
become increasingly important. Already, since the regular labor market is inflexible, firms
have been replacing permanent employees with fixed term staff—a trend that has exacerbated
income inequality and social polarization. The staff strongly recommends, therefore, that the
government revive its efforts to ease conditions of regular employment, while continuing to
expand and strengthen the social safety net.

22
55.
Finally, even if the growth issues are addressed, a long-term fiscal issue would
remain. This is because the aging of population will raise health care costs and, under current
parameters, deplete the assets of the pension system. To deal with this problem, it will be
important to preserving as much fiscal space as possible by adhering to the plans of
maintaining the government debt/GDP ratio at its current, low, level over the medium term. At
the same time, the long-standing plans to restore the national pension system to viability by
raising contributions and reducing replacement rates need to be implemented swiftly, because
the longer the adjustments are delayed, the larger and more painful they will need to be. On the
tax side, the staff endorses the authorities’ plans to also broaden the personal income tax base,
to bring it closer into line with that in other OECD countries.
56.
To sum up, Korea has come a long way over the past 50 years. How will it fare over
the next fifty? There are challenges, to be sure, and many seem daunting. But Korea has faced
even more daunting challenges in its past, and has overcome each one. The staff is confident
that the same will occur this time, because Korea is heading in the right direction, towards
greater deregulation and greater integration with the world economy. This strategy, applied to
manufacturing, produced the “Miracle on the Han” in the 20th century. And by applying this
strategy now to the other sectors, Korea should be able to create another “miracle”: a
knowledge-based, advanced technology, economy for the 21st century.
57.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

APPENDIX I: KOREA—SOUNDNESS OF THE KOREAN FINANCIAL SYSTEM
Korea’s banks are doing well. They have improved their profits significantly over the past
five years, and pushed their returns to equity above 18 percent by 2005 (see tabulation next
page), high by most standards. Their balance sheets and capital have strengthened also:
nonperforming loans have declined, provisions have remained above 100 percent, and the
average capital adequacy ratio stood at 13 percent at end-2005, significantly higher than the
minimum 8 percent required by Basle core principles. While some temporary factors,
including reversal of overprovisioning, have played a role, the key underlying factor for this
strong performance has been the significant transformation of the banking system since the
Asian crisis. In particular, prudential regulations were revamped, most of the banks were
reprivatized, and the banks’ orientation was switched away from the industrial
conglomerates. These steps in turn have led banks to seek and benefit from more profitable
and sound lending opportunities.
These favorable results also reflect the recovery from the recent credit card crisis.
Korea’s credit card industry had expanded rapidly from 1999 to 2002, but that boom had
come to an abrupt end as household delinquency rates rose sharply to unprecedented levels.
Since then, a number of programs created for resolving household debts and tighter credit
standards on credit cards have helped reduce the delinquency rate (including restructured
loans) for credit card companies from its peak of around 28 percent in late 2003 to 9 percent
by end 2005. In addition, for the stand-alone credit card companies that were the hardest hit
by the consumer credit card problems, shareholders injected new funds, increasing the
average capital ratio of these companies to 19 percent at end-2005, from -5½ percent at the
end of 2003. As a result, by 2005 credit card companies became profitable once again.
Nevertheless, the size and composition of household indebtedness remain a concern.
While those households that were affected by the credit card crisis have been repairing their
balance sheets, others have increased their borrowing, in particular mortgages. In aggregate,
households’ financial debts have increased faster than their financial assets, and now their
debts compared to their assets are significantly higher than those observed in advanced
economies such as the United States, United Kingdom and Japan. Moreover, their ability to
pay their debt has weakened somewhat, because their disposable income has not grown as
fast as their debt. At the same time, their loans have become more sensitive to interest rate
fluctuations as they have increased their holding of loans with variable rates. Therefore, a
sharp increase in interest rates could push debt payments beyond some households’ ability to
pay, and thus increase delinquencies.
Another area of concern is mutual savings banks. In 2005, mutual savings banks have
sharply increased their loans, especially for construction and housing purposes. However,
they have been doing this by often exceeding the loan-to-value ratios that are imposed on
commercial banks, in many cases providing second mortgages. These savings banks’ profit
structure is already in a precarious state, reflected by more than half of them registering a
deficit last year, with a significant number of them for at least two more years before that.
Moreover, their capital base is not as strong as the commercial banks, their nonperforming
loans are large, and provisions are insufficient. Therefore, a substantial increase in
delinquencies will likely hit the mutual savings banks first and further weaken their already
fragile position.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

Korea’s exchange rate system is classified as “independently floating.” Previously,
the exchange rate against the U.S. dollar was allowed to float only within specified margins
around the previous day’s weighted average exchange rate in the interbank market. The
margins were widened five times between March 1990 and November 1997 (most recently to
+/-10 percent), and on December 16, 1997 were eliminated altogether. On September
8, 2006, the exchange rate was W 956.3=US$1. Korea maintains restrictions on transactions
by certain individuals, groups and organizations in accordance with UN Security Council
resolutions against the financing of terrorism. A 144 notification of these measures will be
issued shortly.
VIII.

Last Article IV Consultation:

Korea is on a 12-month consultation cycle. Staff discussions for the 2004 Article IV
consultation were conducted on a mission to Seoul during October 13–28, 2004. The
Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on January 21, 2005. In
addition, two staff visits took place during May 30-June 7 and November 9–17, 2005.

IX.

FSAP and ROSC Participation:

MFD: The final FSAP mission was conducted during October 2002. The mission
completed the FSAP by assessing the short-term vulnerability of the financial sector to
macroeconomic and sectoral shocks and analyzing overall financial sector soundness and
developmental challenges, including issues arising from the draft standards assessments. A
follow-up technical assistance mission on the supervision of derivatives markets was held in
Seoul during January 9–20, 2003. The Financial System Stability Assessment report has been
published (IMF Country report No. 03/81) and is available on the web through the following
link: http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2003/cr0381.pdf
FAD: Discussions on fiscal transparency were held in Seoul during June 2000, and a
report was drafted and finalized in November 2000, with input from APD staff. The report
has been published and is available on the web through the following link:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/rosc/kor/fiscal.htm
STA: Discussions on Korea’s data dissemination practices against the IMF’s Special
Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) were held in Seoul during April 2001, and a report was
drafted and finalized on November 28, 2001. The report has been published and is available
on the web through the link: http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2003/cr03127.pdf

Technical Assistance:

FAD: A technical assistance mission visited Seoul during January 8–19, 2001 to
evaluate current practices in budgeting and public expenditure management and to provide
advice on setting up a medium-term fiscal framework. A mission visited Seoul during
August 31–September 16, 2005 to provide technical assistance on the reform of tax policy
and administration.
MFD: A mission conducted a high-level technical seminar during May 16–22, 2000
on the development of the foreign exchange market. The seminar covered issues in
supervision, market monitoring, derivatives instruments, and market microstructure. A
technical assistance mission visited Seoul to provide advice on macroprudential and
derivatives supervision during October 27–November 7, 2005, and on the reform and
development of the foreign exchange market during March 30–April 13, 2006.
STA: A technical assistance mission visited Seoul during March 29–April 12, 2000
to provide advice on balance of payments and external debt statistics, with a view toward
improving the recording of financial derivatives and developing an international investment
position statement.
XI.

Resident Representative:

The resident representative office in Seoul was opened in March 1998. Mr. Kenneth
Kang has been the Resident Representative since September 2003. Meral Karasulu will start
as the new Resident Representative in Seoul on September 11, 2006.

34
APPENDIX III: KOREA—STATISTICAL ISSUES
Korea’s macroeconomic statistics and statistical base are adequate to conduct effective
surveillance and the country subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).
Real Sector
The overall structure of the national accounts mainly follows the 1968 System of National
Accounts (1968 SNA). While the delineation of the economy, the valuation rules, and the
production and asset boundaries are in line with the 1968 SNA, classifications are broadly in
accordance with the 1993 SNA. The Bank of Korea (BOK) plans to begin a gradual shift to the
1993 SNA. The data collection program is not being fully exploited to compile the national
accounts and there is scope to improve certain surveys. While the size of the informal sector is
not known, informal activities (including some illicit activities) are expected to be reflected in
the next revision of the national accounts. The commodity flow technique could be improved
by moving to the Supply and Use Table framework, but there have been difficulties in
obtaining the basic data required.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) covers 36 urban city areas (about 82 per cent of the urban
population) and is defined to exclude single person and farm and fishing households. The CPI
could be further improved by also including single-person households and by and extending its
coverage to sample from rural areas. The basket is updated every five years. New weights and a
new market basket using the 2000 Household Income and Expenditure Survey were introduced
in the CPI for January 2002. The geometric mean of price changes would be a suitable
alternative to the ratio of arithmetic average prices as the formulas at the elementary level
where products aggregated are not homogeneous.
The scope of the Producer Price Index (PPI) covers all domestic industrial activities and a
large segment of service activity, as well as free trade zones and bonded warehouses. The PPI
could be improved by imputing missing prices using those of similar commodities, rather than
carrying forward the last reported price, as is sometimes the case.
Fiscal Sector
Two sets of government finance statistics (GFS) are compiled for the central government,
using national definitions and using internationally recognized standards. Concepts and
definitions used in the latter generally follow the recommendations of the Manual on
Government Finance Statistics 1986 (GFSM 1986). The data cover the budgetary units of the
central government (including social security funds owned and/or managed by the government)
and the extra-budgetary funds owned or managed by these units. These statistics are produced
from the National Financial Information System (NAFIS), which integrates the preparation of
budget data, accounting reports, and the generation of fiscal statistics on a monthly basis. The
NAFIS provides for automatic crosschecks at different levels of the compilation process.

35
Consolidated GFS on the general government consistent with international standards are not
compiled, with the central government accounting for about 75 percent of general government
operations. Korea recently updated its 2002-05 GFS, and these data are expected to be
published officially in the 2006 edition of the GFS Yearbook.
Monetary Sector
The overall quality of monetary statistics is generally sufficient for policy formulation.
Following the recommendations of the 2001 data ROSC mission, revised monetary aggregates
have been compiled since early 2002. These aggregates almost fully comply with the Monetary
and Financial Statistical Manual (MFSM 2000). The analytical usefulness of data relating to
foreign assets and foreign liabilities is affected by the BOK’s practices of valuing its financial
assets and financial liabilities at book value (rather than at market value) and revaluing its
foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities twice yearly (rather than on a monthly
basis). Also, some banks are using nationality rather than residency to distinguish between
resident and nonresident individual and household accounts, affecting the accurate
measurement of net foreign assets of the banking sector. The authorities have begun reporting
monetary data to STA using the new Standardized Reporting Forms.
External Sector
The overall quality of balance of payments data is good. The BOK implemented the fifth
edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5) in early 1998, but some deviations
remain in the classification and sectorization of balance of payments transactions. Following
liberalization, the coverage of the balance of payments statistics has become less
comprehensive, as residents were permitted to conduct transactions via accounts with banks
abroad. There is also incomplete coverage of transactions via intercompany accounts,
nonresident won-denominated accounts with domestic banks, and noncash transactions. The
BOK has developed an array of statistical techniques and collection systems to improve the
coverage, classification, and timeliness of source data, including timing and valuation
adjustments to trade statistics compiled from customs documents, grossing of certain services
transactions, and recording long-term construction contracts under direct investment.
The quality of external debt statistics has greatly improved since the financial crisis. However,
until September 2003, the statistics were not compiled on a residency basis, and certain
external liabilities are excluded from the disseminated data. Hence, the external debt statistics
were not comparable with the balance of payments statistics, or with external debt data
disseminated by other countries. In September 2003, the BOK started to release external debt
statistics on a residency basis according to the SDDS specifications; a debt service schedule, an
encouraged item in the SDDS, is not disseminated. The BOK has released annual data on
Korea’s International Investment Position (IIP) for 2001–04.
Data dissemination on international reserves and foreign currency liquidity generally meets the
SDDS specifications for periodicity, timeliness, and advance release calendar. In late April
2006, the authorities decided to disseminate foreign reserves on a monthly basis rather than
twice a month, as had been done since 1997.

Statement by the Staff Representative
September 29, 2006

1.
This statement provides additional information that has become available since the
circulation of the staff report. The information does not change the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
2.
Recent data continue to suggest that the economy is headed for a soft landing. In
August, the consumer sentiment index fell to a two-year low, but a rebound in large-store
retail sales eased fears of a sharp worsening in consumption. At the same time, external
demand remained very strong, with exports increasing by 16 percent (y/y) on average in the
last three months.
3.
The Bank of Korea kept its key interest rate unchanged at 4½ percent in
September. The Bank noted that the economy was slowing while inflation remained
subdued but warned that pressures could pick up if growth or oil prices rebound.
4.
The government announced the highlights of the draft budget for 2007. The draft
budget envisages a deficit of 1½ percent of GDP, the same as budgeted for 2006, with
broadly unchanged levels of spending and taxation (relative to GDP). However, the
composition of spending will be shifted toward the social safety net and away from
infrastructure and public administration. Meanwhile, revenues from VAT and personal
income tax are expected to increase rapidly on the back of measures to widen the tax base,
while the share of excise taxes and taxes on transportation and securities in GDP would
decline.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 11, 2006

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with Korea
On September, 29, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Korea.1
Background
For most of the period since early 2005, Korea has enjoyed the benefits of strong growth and
low inflation. Output growth reached 6 percent, propelled by double digit export growth on the
back of an upswing in the global electronics sector. Consumption also rose rapidly as
households, which had been heavily overindebted following a credit card boom, advanced in
repairing their balance sheets, helped along by a sharp rise in the local stock market and a
pick up in housing prices.
These favorable conditions encouraged large capital inflows and the won strengthened
considerably. This was only partially tempered by a shrinking current account balance, which
has essentially vanished this year as the oil bill increased and domestic demand improved.
The substantial won appreciation and falling regional food prices lowered inflation throughout
2005 and much of 2006, bringing inflation to the bottom of the Bank of Korea’s 2½–3½ percent
target band. Nonetheless, with output growing rapidly, the central bank gradually raised
benchmark interest rates by 125 basis points starting in October 2005 to counter inflationary
pressures pre-emptively, and to respond to mounting upward pressures on asset prices.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.
1

2
However, recent signs show that the period of high growth is coming to an end. The economy
is slowing as the consumption recovery is maturing, while the export boom—notably in
electronics—may abate as the U.S. economy slows.
Staff anticipates a soft landing, with GDP growth easing from 5 percent in 2006 to 4¼ in 2007,
while inflation remains low. This baseline scenario has risks however, which are tilted to the
downside. In particular, the U.S. economy could experience a sharper than expected
slowdown. This would have a major impact on Korea, given that exports account for
40 percent of GDP and the United States is Korea’s second largest export market after China.
Also, while ample reserves and healthy financial and corporate balance sheets would help
cushion Korea, should global risk aversion increase, the associated increase in lending rates
would hurt Korean households and small and medium enterprises given their high leverage.
While the performance of the Korean economy over the last year and a half has been
encouraging, daunting challenges loom on the horizon. In particular, the population is aging
rapidly, capital accumulation is decelerating, and overall productivity growth is falling. If these
trends continue, potential output growth will slow substantially by mid-century, and strong fiscal
pressures will emerge.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors lauded the remarkable progress Korea has made since its first
consultation with the IMF 50 years ago: over this span, the country has developed from a poor,
agrarian society into a prosperous advanced economy. By integrating the manufacturing
sector into the global economy, while maintaining prudent macroeconomic policies, Korea has
been able to enjoy a prolonged period of strong growth and low inflation, which offers lessons
for other countries. Looking ahead, Directors were confident that the Korean authorities would
succeed in tackling the underlying long-term issues related to an aging population,
decelerating capital accumulation, and falling productivity growth.
Directors noted that the Korean authorities have been tightening macroeconomic policies as a
pre-emptive action against inflation. In recent months, the economy has begun to decelerate,
and while a soft landing is expected, prospects could weaken if the slowdown in the United
States proves sharper than expected, oil prices rebound, or global financial conditions tighten
further. Meanwhile, inflation should remain subdued. In this environment, Directors considered
that it would be appropriate to maintain a neutral fiscal stance. Similarly, they believed that any
further monetary policy tightening should be data-dependent, based on signs of inflation.
Directors endorsed the Bank of Korea’s decision to shift to targeting headline inflation, a step
that would improve transparency because this index is the one used and understood by the
public.
Directors commended the authorities for adhering to their flexible exchange rate policy and
allowing the won’s value to be determined in the foreign exchange market, while limiting
intervention to smoothing operations. They considered that overall competitiveness remains
appropriate, as reflected in the sustained increase of Korea’s share in global export markets.

3
With respect to financial stability, Directors noted the strengthening of Korea’s banking system
in recent years. However, they cautioned that mutual savings banks have been expanding
loans rapidly, a situation that requires careful monitoring and steps to subject them to the
same prudential regulations as banks. Directors endorsed the authorities’ close monitoring of
domestic foreign exchange lending, which has also been expanding rapidly. In addition, they
recommended improving the flow of information to credit bureaus to help lenders respond to
risks in a more timely and accurate fashion.
Beyond these immediate challenges, Directors emphasized the need to tackle longer-term
problems. On current trends, potential growth will slow considerably, largely because the
population is aging rapidly, while productivity growth has proved disappointing, especially in
the services sector. The authorities’ strategy to deal with this challenge is to open the services
sector to more domestic and external competition, which Directors strongly supported.
Directors welcomed in particular the plans to develop the financial sector by integrating it
further into the global and regional economy. They supported the planned deregulation of
capital markets, noting that this measure will spur competition and innovation. Directors
stressed, however, that this reform will need to be accompanied by measures to contain the
accompanying risks, notably by imposing stronger sanctions against conflict-of-interest
violations, and continuing to prevent industrial groups from owning banks. Many Directors
favored maintaining a legal separation between investment banks and asset managers.
Directors also welcomed the plans to open up and deregulate the nonfinancial services sector.
They emphasized the importance of multilateral trade liberalization in these efforts, urging the
authorities to take a proactive role in advancing the Doha Development Round. Directors
stressed that as Korea opens up its services sector, labor market flexibility will become
increasingly important. They noted that the lack of flexibility in the regular labor market has led
firms to replace permanent employees with fixed-term staff, which has exacerbated income
inequality and social polarization. Directors therefore strongly recommended a renewal of
efforts to secure a social consensus to ease conditions of regular employment, while
continuing to strengthen the social safety net.
As a final longer-term challenge, Directors cautioned that Korea’s traditionally strong fiscal
position will gradually come under pressure from the aging of its population. Expenditure
pressures will grow as health care costs climb, while pension costs will rise and eventually
deplete the assets of the pension system under current parameters. Directors strongly
endorsed the authorities’ plans to keep the debt-to-GDP ratio low by creating fiscal space,
putting the pension system back on a sustainable track, and containing health care
expenditures. However, they stressed that the key to success was prompt action, especially on
pensions, for the longer corrective actions are delayed, the more painful the measures would
ultimately need to be.

Statement by John Nam Oh, Executive Director for the Republic of Korea
and Jong-Won Yoon, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
September 29, 2006

My authorities are most grateful to staff for their productive discussions and the high-quality
papers covering impending and structural, longer term issues. There is a broad consensus
between the staff and the authorities on most aspects of diagnosis of and policy
recommendations for the Korean economy. My authorities highly value the Board’s and the
staff’s views on Korea’s reform agenda, which will help pave the way for resilient and
sustainable growth into the future.
Given that the report adequately reflects the shared views between the authorities and staff
regarding Korea’s policy needs, we will focus on providing some background information on
the economic outlook and macroeconomic policy responses, structural reform agenda to
enhance the growth potential, and longer term issues, including population ageing and related
fiscal issues.
Macroeconomic outlook
Growth at its potential level, low inflation, and modest current account surplus have
been achieved since the second half of 2005. With the orderly resolution of the household
debt bubble and helped by strong global demand, the Korean economy showed a resilient
recovery, especially with consumption continuing to grow in tandem with income.
Notwithstanding adverse shocks including high oil prices and rapid exchange rate
appreciation, this year’s growth is expected to reach around 5 percent, with a balance
between domestic demand and net exports. While recent data show some signs of slowdown
in industrial and service activities, they seem mainly to reflect temporary factors, and the
authorities anticipate that the economy will get back on track, once these factors recede, with
steady consumption and brisk exports.
Looking ahead, however, the authorities are vigilant of downside risks. Volatile oil
prices, a possible deceleration of the US economy, and tightening global financial market
conditions could adversely affect the Korean economy. Worsened terms of trade could also
limit consumption recovery by impairing the purchasing power of consumers. While growth
would moderate due to these uncertainties, my authorities agree with the staff that a soft
landing can be expected, with growth rates staying close to their potential.1

According to the authorities’ projections based on the traditional production function approach, potential
growth rates for 2006-2010 were estimated at the high 4 percent, compared to the mid- to low 4 percent by the
staff. While growth projections are subject to uncertainties and vary depending on underlying assumptions, the
authorities expressed concern that the staff’s low growth projections based on somewhat conservative

Short-term policy responses
The authorities are broadly in line with the staff’s view on macroeconomic policy
directions. While the policy stance was accomodative to support the much- needed recovery
until last year, it has gradually moved to a neutral one commensurate with the closing of the
output gap. With downside risks looming ahead, the authorities are now closely monitoring
market developments, and stand ready to maneuver in the event that such risks materialize.
Fiscal policies have been largely neutral. This year’s budget envisaged a slight deficit at
1½ percent of GDP, with no frontloading of expenditures. While a supplementary budget
was implemented in August with flood-related spending to the tune of ¼ percent of GDP, the
actual outturn is expected to be a deficit at less than 1 percent of GDP.
As agreed between the staff and the Bank of Korea, future adjustment of policy rates
would be data-dependent. As the policy rate was gradually raised by 125 basis points to
the current 4.5 percent, it now seems to have approached its longer-term average. The Bank
of Korea is prepared to respond flexibly to future market developments so as to guard the
economy against output risk as well as inflationary pressure. Regarding the staff’s
recommendation on refining the inflation targeting framework, the Bank of Korea agrees in
principle on removing the three-year assessment period. However, under the current
situation where the inflation targeting system has not been firmly established, such a
refinement could hamper flexibility in maneuvering monetary policy.2 Therefore, the
possibility of further refinement will be reviewed over the longer-term horizon, based on a
careful assessment of the status of the inflation regime’s stability.
The authorities have continued and are firmly committed to a flexible exchange rate
policy. While there was a rapid appreciation of the exchange rate early this year due to
expectation of further appreciation and large capital inflows, it has since stabilized,
fluctuating at around 950 won vis-à-vis US dollar. In an attempt to alleviate pressures on the
exchange rate coming from capital account surpluses and, more importantly, to deepen the
foreign exchange market, my authorities have taken bold measures to remove remaining
restrictions on capital account transactions and announced a timetable to accelerate complete
liberalization by 2009. My authorities are confident that the liberalization measures would
expedite the development of the foreign exchange market, a key element of the financial hub
strategy.

assumptions could exacerbate economic sentiment and result in a low-growth equilibrium by affecting
expectations.

Under the current situation where inflation regime is not yet very stable, the abolition of the 3-year assessment
period could press the Bank of Korea to stick to the target constantly, which could result in its rigid operation.

3
On financial policy front, my authorities agree with staff that the financial markets
should be guarded against potential dangers resulting from a renewed rise in global
risk aversion. My authorities have moved forward on a greater provision of positive credit
information, and plan to provide financial institutions with positive credit information held
by the public sector. In the case of individual credit information, a private credit bureau has
already begun to provide positive credit information. Also, my authorities agree with the
need for curbing risks at the mutual savings banks (MSBs). Applying the same prudential
regulations as banks to MSBs, however, will be carefully reviewed, taking into account the
absorptive capacity of the MSBs based on their operational and financial status. Meanwhile,
enforcement of the current prudential regulations will be strengthened, with continued efforts
to restructure them.
Long-term growth potential and structural reform
My authorities broadly concur with the staff that the growth potential might slow over
time with lower factor input, coupled with population ageing and stagnant total factor
productivity. Therefore, the priority of government policy is moving more towards
enhancing growth potential and addressing structural and longer-term issues, which include
greater integration with the world, expediting structural reforms, and raising productivity of
small and medium-sized enterprises and service industries, as well as coping with long-term
risks including the graying of the Korean society and related fiscal issues.
Inviting competition through greater integration into the world economy will be
pursued as a key to enhancing growth potential and strengthening competitiveness.
Toward this end, the government is proactively working to achieve multilateral and bilateral
cooperation with the world economy. The Korea-EFTA Free Trade Agreement became
effective in September 2006. FTA negotiations with major countries including ASEAN,
Canada, and more recently with the United States are now underway. My authorities
anticipate that the ongoing FTAs will contribute not only to the expansion of Korea’s
overseas markets and but will also enhance the competitiveness of domestic industries by
bringing in greater competition and meeting global standards.
My authorities share with the staff that an advanced financial sector plays a pivotal role
in promoting efficiency and stimulating productivity. The government has been
implementing the financial hub policy, for which a roadmap was drawn up in 2003, as an
effective apparatus to advance the financial market. The legal and institutional framework
has already been set up, and concrete policy measures are being implemented, including the
establishment of the Korea Investment Corporation in 2005, the opening of the accounting
market planned for 2007, and the deregulation of the capital markets. These efforts, together
with the introduction of a retirement pension scheme and the building of foreign investorfriendly environments, aim to accelerate the globalization of Korea’s asset management
industry.

4
To integrate Korea’s financial system into the global economy, the authorities are
pursuing fundamental reform of the capital markets. A new bill on capital market
consolidation, to be submitted to the National Assembly this fall, will bring together the
Securities and Exchange Act, Futures Trading Act, and other capital market-related laws
under a single Act. The bill, once passed, will serve to promote financial innovation and
competition through deregulation and stronger investor protection, thereby streamlining some
300 financial regulations to 190. With regard to this initiative, the staff suggested the
maintenance of a legal separation between underwriters and asset managers so as to
minimize the potential conflict of interests. While my authorities are well aware of the risk,
they are concerned that a strict legal separation would unduly limit the scope of the intended
synergy effect. Instead, my authorities believe that financial institutions themselves should
decide whether to place both businesses in-house or to run separate subsidiaries based on
their cost and benefit of synergy effect, examples of which can easily be found in advanced
countries.3 In order to minimize the potential risk, however, my authorities intend to impose
stronger institutional arrangements than in most advanced countries, which include an
obligatory setup of internal control systems, restriction of staff and informational exchange,
and strong legal penalties for conflict-of-interest violations.
My authorities are fully aware of the importance of greater labor market flexibility and
improving social safety nets. The government has been preparing the legal groundwork for
advanced labor relations with the participation of management and labor unions, which
incorporates both enhancing flexibility and strengthening protection for the working
vulnerable in the labor market.4 With a view to expand social safety nets, the coverage of
unemployment benefits was widened, and the Earned Income Tax Credit is planned to be
implemented in 2008. Regarding the introduction of a new employment contract proposed
by staff, the authorities will carefully review its feasibility.
Recognizing the significance of the service sector in the economy, my authorities are
pushing forward with measures to open up and deregulate the non-financial service
sector, notably in the business, educational, and medical services areas.5 As noted by the

Many top global investment banks are legally practicing both businesses as a single legal entity in such
advanced countries as the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Australia, which include UBS Global
Asset Management Inc., Merrill Lynch Fund Managers Limited, Fidelity Investment Services Limited, HSBC
Investment Funds Ltd., and Citibank International Plc.

The law proposes: a single bargaining channel for multiple trade unions at a workplace, no wage payment to
full-time union officials, rationalization of arbitration by authority and emergency adjustment processes,
diversified relief programs for unfair dismissals, and easing of the layoff requirements for managerial reasons.
5

A legal framework for foreign lawyers is being set up to ensure their sound activities in Korea. Rules on
setting up and operating foreign schools have been eased. The school system has also become more diversified
through the introduction of innovative public schools and independent private high schools. External investment
in hospitals is being encouraged and steps will be implemented to prevent a sudden rise in medical costs and
retain the competitiveness of the medical services sector.

5
staff, further integration of the sector into the world economy will help improve the sector’s
productivity, and a successful conclusion of the FTA with the United States will provide an
impetus to this endeavor. When it comes to collateral for bank loans, my authorities will
assess the possibility of intangible assets such as contracts being used as collateral, while
intellectual property is currently allowed under the civil code. Also, my authorities are
drawing up blueprints to allow banks and insurance companies to enter the commercial credit
insurance market over the medium term.
Long-term risks and fiscal issues
The staff noted that the rapid pace of population ageing and low fertility would not only
impair long-term growth potential but also aggravate the fiscal position over time.
Being mindful of the grave consequences of delayed reform, my authorities enacted a Basic
Law in 2005, and are closely overseeing the socioeconomic strategies on how to prepare for
the graying of the Korean society. A comprehensive plan to cope effectively with these longterm risks has been drawn up, with concrete policy measures set into action. The policy
package aims to: (i) provide incentives for childbirth; (ii) establish a social foundation for
women to carry on both professional and family work so as to promote greater economic
participation of females; (iii) cultivate ageing-friendly industries; and (iv) expand the
socioeconomic infrastructure for elderly welfare.
My authorities agree with the staff that early and effective reform measures should be
implemented in the areas of pension, health and long-term care so as to avoid
undesirable fiscal consequences. A proposal to help bring the National Pension Fund back
to financial health has been put forward, and the health care system is being revamped to
contain its cost pressures. While it takes some time to reach public consensus, the much
needed adjustments are expected to be made in the near future.
Korea is well-known for its sound and prudent fiscal position, and my authorities are
fully committed to keeping its sustainability over the medium and long term. In order to
address increasing expenditure pressures, my authorities have been strengthening efforts to
consolidate expenditures and increase revenues. As for revenue measures, my authorities are
focusing on broadening the tax base by removing various exemptions and strengthening
enforcement rather than raising tax rates, which the staff supports. Off-budget spending will
also be properly accounted for in the budget with the adoption of accrual budget accounting
in the near future.
Conclusion
Korea is at a crossroads. While Korea has made remarkable success in the last 50 years of
development history, the challenges we are now facing are entirely different in their nature
from those in the past. We are faced with a rapidly ageing population, the speed of which is

6
unprecedented, widening economic and social disparities; diminishing growth potential, and
ever fierce global competition. Deeply mindful of the gravity of these challenges, my
authorities have already moved forward in tackling them. Through maintaining sustainable
government finances and sound monetary policy, greater integration with the global
economy, and building an institutional environment conducive to growth by continued
structural reform, we believe, Korea will make another giant leap forward and succeed in
transforming itself into a knowledge-based, advanced country in the 21st century.
