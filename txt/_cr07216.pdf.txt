KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—NETHERLANDS
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives
For the 2007 Consultation with the Netherlands
Approved by Juha Kähkönen and Michael T. Hadjimichael

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background. A three-party coalition government—comprising the Christian Democratic Party, the Labor Party,
and a small Christian Party—took office in February 2007. The recovery is firmly entrenched, and recent growth
has been above the euro area average. In addition, inflation is low, the external position is strong, and financial
sector stability is continuing to benefit from the macroeconomic upswing. Though the general government balance
moved into surplus in 2006, a deficit is projected for 2007, injecting significant fiscal stimulus at a time of emerging
capacity constraints.
Key issues and recommendations.
● Near-term outlook. Growth prospects are bright, with staff and official projections falling within a narrow range:
2.8–3.0 percent for 2007 and 2.7–2.8 percent for 2008. Inflation is expected to stay in check.
● Fiscal policy. Staff broadly supported the new government’s target of a general government structural surplus of
1 percent of GDP by 2011. Staff and most interlocutors acknowledged the benefits of identifying and implementing
other sustainability-enhancing measures as quickly as possible to close the remaining fiscal “sustainability gap”
(about 2½ percent of GDP). In circumstances of political compromise, in which the coalition parties span a wide
political spectrum, the new government intends to take additional structural measures to close about one-third of the
remaining gap. With a significant portion of the gap left unfilled, and to lessen resource pressures and take
advantage of robust economic growth, staff recommended erring on the side of a higher-than-targeted surplus in
executing fiscal policy, also urging a frontloading of fiscal adjustment by locking in any unexpected saving in 2007
and in the context of the 2008 budget.
● Structural policies. The authorities plan to raise the rewards from work and further reduce the cost of doing
business. However, with an eye toward closing the sustainability gap faster and easing the tight labor market, staff
suggested additional structural measures. In particular, further measures to boost labor supply and enhance labor
market flexibility merit serious consideration.
● Financial sector issues. Stress tests indicated that the sector could weather adverse macroeconomic shocks. In
addition, the design and implementation of the risk-oriented, cross-sectoral, approach to financial supervision are, in
many respects, international best practice. Nevertheless, high household indebtedness and housing market
distortions are among the key concerns. The code of conduct on mortgage lending is meant to prevent households
from overborrowing. While there was insufficiently broad political support for housing market reform, staff
believes that such reform should remain on the discussion agenda.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
The discussions took place against a background of strong economic
performance. The recovery is firmly entrenched (Figure 1 and Table 1). Recent economic
growth compares favorably in a European context (Figure 2). Economic expansion and rising
stock prices have contributed to a cyclical strengthening of the financial sector, especially
pension funds and insurance companies (Figure 3).
2.
With the large current account surplus, and exports and overall growth doing
well, external competitiveness would appear to be satisfactory (Figure 4). Improvements
in the macroeconomic and business environments and technological innovation have
contributed positively to Dutch competitiveness (Table 2). In terms of export components,
domestically produced exports have lost market share in recent years. However, this loss of
market share is overstated (Box 1), the growth of reexports has been very strong, the loss of
market share for total exports has been smaller than in most regional peers, and the external
sector is contributing positively to economic growth. Importantly, staff’s multilaterallyconsistent measures of equilibrium exchange rates suggest that the real exchange rate for the
Netherlands is broadly in equilibrium, if not undervalued (Text Table).1

3.
Recent fiscal performance was impressive (Table 3). The general government
balance shifted from a deficit of 3.1 percent of GDP in 2003 to a surplus of 0.6 percent of
GDP in 2006. This adjustment had a large structural component, estimated by staff at over
3 percentage points of GDP. The adjustment reflected contributions from expenditure cuts
(including nearly a percentage point of GDP reduction in transfers and a ½ percentage point
reduction in the wage bill) and revenue measures (including higher excise duties, social
insurance contribution rates, and environment taxes); larger gas revenues also contributed.

Box 1. The Netherlands: Competitiveness
•

A CPB study1 adjusts market growth for total exports in two ways: including only those goods
in domestically produced exports (“package correction”); and adjusting (using rough
estimates) for the overestimation of market growth because of double counting due to
reexports generally when calculating the relevant world trade for the Netherlands (“blow-up
effect”).

•

As the figure below shows, domestically produced exports were broadly in line with adjusted
market growth until 2000. Afterward, market share declined, but by considerably less than an
“unadjusted” analysis would suggest.

•

It is difficult to assess the competitiveness of Dutch reexports, because many countries do not
have reliable statistics related to reexports. In addition, because competition is based on the
prices and quality of the associated services provided by shipment centers, analysis based on
comparing export growth to the growth of trade is problematic.

•

Nevertheless, reexports—which account for about half of total exports and mostly represent
machinery, computers, and chemical products sold in Europe—would appear very competitive
in light of their strong growth; reexports also generate services income.

While one of the major challenges facing policymakers is addressing population
aging, the Netherlands is in a comparatively favorable position to deal with it. Two
contributing factors are the Netherlands’ favorable initial fiscal position and demographics
(Text Table). In addition, the existence of a large, fully funded, second pension pillar helps
mitigate the burden of aging. The CPB has calculated, as a benchmark, that achieving fiscal
sustainability would require either a structural general government surplus equivalent to
nearly 3½ percent of GDP by 2011 or other sustainability-enhancing measures to close the
“sustainability gap”—that is, to compensate in present value terms for any shortfalls from
achieving the surplus of 3½ percent.2

Monetary conditions tightened in 2006. This reflected both a rise in interest rates
and real exchange rate appreciation (Figure 5).
6.
The financial sector has benefited from the economic recovery, but some
vulnerabilities remain. Bank capital adequacy is well above minimum requirements, and
pension funds and insurance company’s coverage ratios have recovered to around 2001
levels (Tables 4 and 5 and Figure 3). Nonetheless, low profit margins in the banking sector
and EU measures to promote pension mobility suggest that foreign penetration of the Dutch
financial system could increase, posing challenges for supervision. High indebtedness in both
the nonfinancial corporate and household sectors (the latter prompted by the tax deductibility
of mortgage interest payments) makes them vulnerable to rising interest rates. It has also led
to the introduction of a code of conduct setting limits on mortgage lending to prevent
households from overborrowing, but the code’s effectiveness remains to be seen. The

housing market, more broadly, is also impacted adversely by distortions affecting supply
(e.g., rent control).
7.
Issues arise in the labor market (Figure 6). In particular, the employment rate
measured in hours is low, and employment protection is high.
II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
8.
Besides the near-term outlook, the discussions focused on: (i) fiscal policy during
the new government’s term, including assessing policies to address population aging and
achieve fiscal sustainability; (ii) safeguarding financial stability; and (iii) reviewing
progress in structural reforms to raise participation and productivity, which would also
have favorable effects on potential growth and fiscal sustainability. Annexes II and III
summarize, respectively, past analytical work by staff and the implementation of previous
IMF recommendations.
A. Near-Term Outlook
9.
Projections for 2007 fell within a relatively tight range (Text Table). Export
growth is expected to remain strong provided external competitiveness, as projected, does not
deteriorate significantly. With high consumer and business confidence, the momentum of
domestic demand is expected to carry into 2008. Output is expected to rise above potential
(Text Figure), providing further impetus to investment while exerting upward pressure on
inflation. Staff projects inflation around 2 percent by 2008. The CPB projection is lower,
largely because it assumes lower oil prices.

Unemployment and Vacancies
10.
Upward pressure on wages seemed

inevitable. The unemployment rate has
declined over the past year to 4.1 percent,
8
while vacancies have been increasing (Text
Figure). Moreover, it was noted during the
discussions that when conditions tightened

wage increases (and the lagged response of

wages to the cyclical downturn) undermined
external competitiveness and contributed to

agreed, underscoring the point by noting that
wage growth in competitor countries was expected to be moderate.

11.
Other risks to the baseline were apparent. All agreed that the possibility of higherthan-projected oil prices, a further significant euro appreciation, and slower-than-expected
trading partner growth could dampen the upswing. While the authorities saw downside risks
predominating, staff noted that the strong world economic outlook presented upside
potential, too. For example, reexports (and related services income) could be higher than

anticipated. And, with a favorable domestic economic outlook, private consumption could
also be higher than projected—though resulting higher inflation would dampen real incomes
and domestic demand.
B. Fiscal Policy
12.
The new government announced a target of a general government structural
surplus of 1 percent of GDP by the end of its term (2011). While staff supported the
target, which was consistent with Fund recommendations during the previous Article IV
consultation, a sustainability gap of some 2½ percent of GDP remained. As before, staff
stressed the benefits of identifying and implementing other sustainability-enhancing
measures as quickly as possible to close this gap. Doing so, by avoiding bigger interest
payments than would otherwise occur from higher debt, would provide a larger margin for
addressing the aging problem, in addition to better protecting intergenerational equity. The
Study Group on the Budget Margin and the Social and Economic Council (SER) made the
same recommendation.4
13.
Measures proposed by the new government envisage closing part of the
sustainability gap. The proposed measures—aimed at raising participation (through a more
effective design of the income tax credit and especially by gradually reducing the
transferability of the general tax credit from a non-working to a working partner), limiting
increases in health care spending, and introducing a special tax on higher-income
pensioners—would close 0.7 percentage point of GDP of the gap. The new government is
basing its policy on the CPB’s calculations and expects the next two cabinets to take
remaining measures to close the gap. While staff would have preferred measures to close the
gap more rapidly, and greater specificity on policy details (many parts of the coalition
agreement are general, and policy details were only starting to be determined during the
mission), it also viewed favorably the widespread acceptance of the need to contain health
care expenditure and increase the supply of labor. Nevertheless, staff felt that several
additional labor market reforms (discussed in Section D) deserved serious consideration,
partly with a view to raising participation further.
14.
Staff urged the authorities to take any available opportunities to lock in
a higher-than-targeted surplus by 2011. Staff indicated that a higher structural surplus
would lessen resource pressures and act as insurance against the uncertainties inherent to
long-term projections and analysis, also noting that the case for a higher surplus was stronger
because a significant portion of the sustainability gap remained unfilled. At the same time,
staff recognized the difficulty in overhauling the fiscal target after the complex negotiations
to finalize the coalition agreement in circumstances in which the coalition parties span a wide

10
political spectrum. Moreover, the plans of the authorities, as they noted in the discussion,
compare favorably with those of other European countries in terms of feasibility and
ambition. The countries in the Text Table below have fiscal targets mostly below the Dutch
target. While it is difficult to compare the remaining needs for measures to achieve
sustainability (estimates of the sustainability gap, similar to the one calculated for the
Netherlands, are unavailable), the Netherlands seems relatively well placed, needing
comparatively less adjustment to achieve its 2010/11 target. Also, projected debt levels in
2050 are, for the most part, lower in the Netherlands.5 In addition, Dutch analysts have
identified and quantified specific measures needed to achieve sustainability (Appendix I)—
though the current government plans would close only part of the gap.
15.
From a near-term perspective, the fiscal stance seemed to be moving in the
wrong direction. Following the fiscal surplus in 2006, staff projected a small deficit in 2007
(about 0.1 percent of GDP), implying significant stimulus (Table 3). This was in line with the
authorities’ projections of a deficit of 0.1–0.3 percent of GDP. The projected deterioration
mainly reflected lower nontax revenues.6 The authorities noted that some budget
components—related, for example, to gas revenues, health spending, and local government
activities—were either inherently volatile or not fully under central government control in the
given year. Thus, some of the outcome for 2006 reflected higher oil, and therefore gas,
prices, and revenues that would start to unwind in 2007. Also, with information limited, they
assumed that the better-than-expected outturn for local governments in 2006 reflected oneoff items that would not recur in 2007.
16.
The importance of the 2008 budget returning to a course of fiscal consolidation
was well recognized. The coalition agreement includes specific revenue measures
frontloaded for 2008, broadly offset by (unidentified) revenue reductions in later years. From
this standpoint, it seemed highly likely that the fiscal balance would revert to a significant
surplus. Indeed, the CPB projected a surplus of 0.7 percent of GDP without incorporating
measures in the coalition agreement, with higher revenues reflecting both cyclical factors and
an increase in health insurance premia. On the expenditure side, the forthcoming budget
for 2008 will define the annual expenditure ceilings through 2011. While the coalition
agreement envisages specific measures over 2008–11 that would increase expenditure by
1.1 percent of GDP, this was to be mostly offset by a commitment to reductions in other
expenditures, with an important role for significant efficiency savings in the civil service.
While there is a risk that the latter could yield more modest savings than expected, it is
encouraging that ministry-level planning has already begun.

Detailed debt sustainability analysis was contained in the staff report for the 2006 Article IV consultation, IMF
Country Report No. 06/283 (July 2006), Appendix IV.

6

The reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 29.6 percent to 25 percent is offset by a broadening of the
tax base, including by limiting deductions.

normative scenario with aging costs at 4 percent of GDP (IMF Country Report No: 06/438). Net worth calculations
were only readily available for Germany; staff projections based on a sustainable path were only available for the
other countries.

17.
The importance of tight spending control was also recognized for continued
improvement in the underlying fiscal position. Thus, while the coalition agreement
envisages broadly offsetting revenue and expenditure measures, deficit-reducing measures
would be frontloaded. The authorities also saw considerable room to save on health care
costs, in light of the variation across health care providers. Against this background, the

12
authorities were working on the details of what they called “yardstick competition,” which
would regulate average prices per hospital (not individual prices), with scope for hospitals
and insurers to negotiate prices.
18.
The authorities remain committed to their fiscal framework. The framework is
anchored by multiyear real expenditure ceilings and set with reference to the targeted
structural fiscal balance. The authorities emphasized that the framework had served them
well, providing discipline to fiscal policy and preventing “big policy mistakes.” For its part,
staff reiterated that the 2006 fiscal ROSC (Report on the Observance of Standards and
Codes) found that the Netherlands achieves or exceeds good practice standards. Moreover,
many of the new refinements to the framework—for example, enlarging the safety margin for
the Maastricht deficit ceiling, placing interest payments outside the expenditure ceilings, and
better management of the resources of the budgetary fund on gas revenues and reporting of
tax expenditure—are in line with earlier staff recommendations.
C. Financial Sector Issues
19.
Discussions with the authorities and financial sector participants highlighted
both cyclical and structural improvements in the stability of the financial sector
(Figure 3 and Tables 4 and 5). Pension fund and insurance company balance sheets have
especially benefited from increases in equity prices and long-term bond yields (Text Figure).

20.
DNB stress tests suggest that most financial sector participants could weather
even fairly sharp adverse macroeconomic shocks. The tests also indicate, however, that
pension sector portfolios are particularly sensitive to interest rate and asset price
7

Pensions are required to achieve a coverage ratio sufficient to meet nominal obligations with a 97.5 percent

13
developments, underscoring the need for high coverage ratios. DNB also noted that real
coverage ratios (i.e., assuming full inflation indexation of benefits) were substantially lower
than the nominal ratios (excluding indexation), again arguing for aiming for high coverage
ratios.
21.
Discussions also addressed potential concerns related to mortgage lending and
private equity funds. The mortgage code of conduct, which came into effect in
January 2007, is intended to limit household mortgage debt service to 25–30 percent of
borrower income, in order to protect borrowers from becoming over-leveraged.8 Despite
a shift towards long-term fixed rate mortgages, around one-third of households remain
exposed to interest rate risks, and all are exposed to capital risks. DNB indicated that it is still
too early to tell whether the code will be effective and that, if it is not, a more obligatory
approach may be needed. Private equity finance in the Netherlands is not seen as a significant
concern at this stage, reflecting the small scale of such financing, the due diligence that
private equity firms are exercising, and the limited credit risk to lending banks. Nonetheless,
DNB is preparing guidelines to ensure that institutional investors exercise due diligence with
regard to their investment in such funds.
22.
Beyond the cyclical improvement in the position of the financial sector,
institutional developments are making deeper structural improvements in financial
stability. The new financial sector supervisory framework, giving prudential supervision to
DNB and conduct of business supervision to the AFM (Authority for Financial Markets), has
already begun to improve the quality of supervision and risk management practices of
financial firms.
23.
In many respects, the design and implementation of the supervision in the
Netherlands represents best international practice. In particular, the discussions revealed
that: (i) supervisors and financial institutions agree that both are benefiting from the
integration of macro-prudential financial stability analysis with risk management; (ii) DNB
has developed and begun using a systematic risk-based supervision framework (FIRM).9 It
allows supervision to be tailored to the specific risk characteristics of institutions, and in line
with DNB’s overall risk management strategy for the sector; (iii) the AFM has developed
self-assessment templates for financial firms to identify their own performance on conduct of
business issues, and for use in prioritizing supervision across issues and firms; (iv) DNB and
the AFM coordinate supervision under a covenant agreement. Some “teething troubles”
experienced early in the implementation of the new framework were resolved under the
covenant, and supervised institutions praised the openness of the supervisors to suggestions

for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of supervision; and (v) the Dutch financial
sector is ahead of most countries in implementing new standards for capital adequacy, risk
management, and auditing, including Basel II, Solvency II, and IFRS (International Financial
Reporting Standards).
24.
Although the overall strength of the financial sector is high and the supervisory
framework commendable, staff flagged a few areas:
●
The AFM has had a substantial expansion of responsibilities in response to both
domestic legislation and EU directives. Improving the execution of its core responsibilities
risks being delayed if it is given additional responsibilities too quickly. The authorities
acknowledged the point, but suggested that no new major responsibilities were expected to
be given to the AFM.
●
The potential cross-border merger of a large Dutch bank would have important
supervisory implications. For example, if a cross-border bank were established, the relocation
of important bank functions could entail corresponding changes in supervisory arrangements
and, as the Dutch authorities have acknowledged, necessitate close cooperation between
home and host supervisors.
●
EU directives may lead to increased competition from foreign-based providers in the
pension sector. Staff emphasized that a high degree of transparency and mechanisms to
provide comparability between plans would help employers and unions to make wellinformed choices. The authorities agreed, but also noted that the sectoral organization of
pension funds might protect the Dutch industry from foreign competition.
●
The plan to provide a simple rating of pension plans is likely to benefit consumers.
However, it is important to ensure that the ratings are based on prudent assessments of
financial strength and take into account the degree of inflation indexing to which each fund is
committed. The ratings may be assuming excessively high returns on equity investments,
which could be reconsidered at the next review.
25.
The housing market is affected by several major distortions, with adverse effects
on housing access and affordability, labor mobility, and household financial leveraging.
Staff argued that mortgage interest deductibility promotes high mortgage debt and boosts
housing prices, harming access and affordability for low-income earners. These effects are
compounded by supply measures such as rent controls and other restrictions on the supply of
new housing. These distortions lead to a chronic shortage of housing, impeding labor
mobility. The authorities acknowledged this view, but also indicated that, at this point, there
was insufficiently broad political support for such reforms.

15
D. Structural Reforms and Other Policies
26.
All agreed on the importance of addressing inactivity traps and making work
pay. As the authorities noted, the coalition agreement contains several measures to raise
participation.
27.
The discussions highlighted the need to carefully design measures. For example,
various measures focus on particular groups, whether low-income, women, or senior
workers. In implementing tax breaks for these groups (for example, through earned income
tax credits), the labor supply incentives facing other groups must be taken into account to
avoid unintended side effects. Potentially, one of the most effective measures to raise the
rewards from work is the phasing-out of the transferability of the general tax credit from
a low or no income partner to the higher earner. However, reflecting political compromise,
the phase-out period is 20 years.
28.
While a range of structural measures has been aimed at boosting productivity
and sustainable growth, staff saw scope for further measures to promote both higher
participation and productivity. In addition to summarizing recent reforms, Table 6
highlights staff recommendations in various areas.
29.
The authorities enthusiastically support overseas development assistance (ODA),
continuing to exceed the United Nations’ target of 0.7 percent of GNI.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
The Dutch economy is performing well. The recovery is firmly entrenched, while
economic expansion and rising stock market values have contributed to a cyclical
strengthening of the financial sector. Much has been achieved on the fiscal front: since
breaching the Maastricht deficit ceiling in 2003, significant structural fiscal adjustment
contributed to a general government surplus in 2006. In addition, competitiveness is
satisfactory, though continued wage moderation is important for maintaining it. The strong
macroeconomic environment provides a favorable backdrop for dealing with the important
challenges that lie ahead.
31.
One of the major challenges facing policymakers remains an aging population.
Thankfully, the authorities are well aware of the policy requirements for securing fiscal
sustainability in the face of aging based on the extensive background work by the CPB.
32.
While the new government’s target of a general government structural surplus
of 1 percent of GDP by 2011 is broadly appropriate, other sustainability-enhancing
measures are needed to ensure fiscal sustainability. Moreover, identifying and
implementing measures as quickly as possible to close the sustainability gap would minimize
the cost of aging from the standpoint of lowering debt and interest payments, and provide
greater assurance of achieving the policy goal of intergenerational equity. Significant

16
progress has been made recently in several, oftentimes difficult, structural areas, among them
reform of health care and disability benefits, and the strengthening of the administration of
social benefits. But it is important to build on this progress: indeed, the current situation of
robust economic growth and a tightening labor market offers a favorable environment for
further fiscal consolidation and additional measures to enhance labor market flexibility and
participation. From this standpoint, a more ambitious approach to closing the sustainability
gap would have been welcome.
33.
The near-term fiscal stance is a concern. Fiscal stimulus this year would be
unhelpful in a context of emerging resource constraints. Thus, it is advisable to tighten the
fiscal stance as soon as possible, both by locking in any unexpected saving in 2007 and in the
context of preparing the budget for 2008. It is important that the 2008 budget return to the
course of fiscal consolidation, making decisive and significant progress toward securing the
2011 fiscal surplus target. The electoral cycle only strengthens the case for early action
toward securing this target.
34.
Continued improvement in the underlying fiscal position requires tight spending
control—including, in the context of preparing the 2008 budget, setting prudent
expenditure ceilings through 2011. The commitment to the highly commendable fiscal
framework provides reassurance that fiscal policy will stay disciplined and transparent.
However, before the envisaged spending increases are implemented, the offsetting
expenditure-reducing measures should preferably be in place, with a view to minimizing the
risk of underperformance. Moreover, spending overruns remain a perennial risk in the health
sector. While the efforts to restrain costs—through introducing greater competition and
“yardstick benchmarking”—are welcome, careful monitoring will be required, with a view to
timely remedial actions if needed.
35.
Longer-term considerations warrant erring on the side of higher surpluses in
executing fiscal policy and setting the expenditure ceilings. A higher structural surplus
would help lessen resource pressures and act as insurance against the uncertainties
surrounding key macroeconomic and reform parameters of the long-term projections and
analysis of aging. The case for a higher surplus is strengthened because a significant portion
of the sustainability gap remains unfilled.
36.
The stability of the financial sector is continuing to benefit from the
macroeconomic upswing as well as improvements in supervision and risk management.
While pension funds have seen a marked recovery in financial positions, further increases in
their coverage ratios would, as noted by the authorities, better protect the real value of
pensions. Overall, the implementation of the risk-oriented, cross-sectoral approach to
financial sector supervision is impressive: in many respects, the design and implementation
of supervision in the Netherlands are international best practice.

17
37.
The lack of progress in reforming the housing market stands in sharp contrast
with the Netherlands’ willingness to tackle other difficult areas. The adoption of the
mortgage code of conduct to limit excessive household indebtedness is welcome, but does
not address the underlying tax incentive to maximize mortgage debt. More generally,
beginning the task of reforming the numerous distortions adversely affecting the housing
market would be beneficial for the economy.
38.
Efforts on a broad front to increase labor supply are of considerable urgency,
and there is scope to further boost sustainable growth by raising productivity. Such
labor supply efforts would help to ease the tight labor market and address aging-related
challenges. While phasing out the transferability of the general tax credit is potentially one of
the most effective measures to raise the rewards from work, this measure would have
a significant and more immediate impact if phased out over a much shorter period than the
envisaged 20 years. More generally, it is important to address other inactivity traps with
carefully designed measures that avoid unintended side effects. Although politically difficult,
other policies—including a shorter duration for unemployment benefits and raising the
retirement age in line with increases in life expectancy—merit serious consideration. The
success of official efforts to encourage productivity and innovation will depend,
fundamentally, on taking further steps to provide an environment conducive to
entrepreneurship and competition. The successes in increasing the role of market forces in
various sectors, strengthening the investigative powers of the competition authority, and
reducing red tape are welcome, as is the new government’s goal of a further red tape
reduction of 25 percent. Further efforts to reduce employment protection legislation would be
beneficial, as this acts as a tax on new hiring, not only reducing labor participation, but also
hampering the movement of labor toward areas of high productivity and innovation. Finally,
greater wage differentiation would help attract labor to higher productivity companies and
sectors, while strengthening the incentives for human capital investment, one of the
government’s goals.
39.
The demonstrated commitment to ODA, by continuing to exceed the United
Nations’ ODA target, is highly commendable.
40.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with the Netherlands remain
on the 12-month cycle.

1/ The introduction of the new healthcare system in 2006 resulted in a shift in health care expenditure from private to public consumption, thereby
lowering private and raising public consumption without changing overall GDP. In a related vein, government revenues rose and private disposable
income fell, without affecting the financial position of the public sector or households in net terms. This is because public expenditure for health care
also rose, while the fall in private disposable income was offset by a similar fall in private health consumption, which is now taken care of in the public
domain.

1/ The introduction of the new healthcare system in 2006 did not affect the overall balance, but permanently increased
both revenue and expenditure by 1.6 percentage points of GDP.
2/ Personal income taxes and social contributions are collected together. Although data on the aggregate is reliable, an
accurate breakdown between the two items is available only with a lag of four years.
3/ The calculation of the structural balance is based on the standard methodology, which uses fixed elasticities with respect to
GDP. Biases can occur, in particular in the context of asset price boom and busts (as discussed for the Netherlands in
IMF Country Report No. 04/301). Progressiveness in the tax system can also result in an overstatement of structural adjustment
when GDP growth is high.
4/ The increase in expenditure growth in 2006 largely reflects the introduction of the new health care system,
as in footnote 1.

Further reform came into effect in January 2006, aimed at introducing
a distinction between fully disabled and partially disabled. Reform entails:
strengthened eligibility criteria, including a medical definition of full
disability and strengthening work incentives for partially disabled.

Effective October 2006, the maximum duration was cut from 60 to
38 months. Existing (non-means tested) benefits at the social assistance
level when the right to the initial unemployment benefits ends was altered
for people becoming unemployed at an age over 60 in the sense that this
benefit is no longer partner-income tested.

To lessen significant traps, changes in the real estate tax and
amendments to the child credit (which came into effect in 2006) reduced
spikes in marginal effective tax rates. Scheduled increases in the earned
income tax credit are expected to further reduce poverty traps.
Furthermore, the tax credit for working parents was raised as were
childcare subsidies (see below).

To increase female participation in circumstances in which full-time
participation is low and the cost of childcare facilities has increased
significantly, the government increased childcare subsidies by €130 million
in 2006 and a further €125 million in 2007. Another important development
concerns the provision of preschool and after-school childcare. The
cabinet will introduce legislation requiring primary schools to make
arrangements for child supervision between school hours and the opening
hours of certified childcare providers from the beginning of the 2007–08
school year.

Area

The phasing of childcare subsidies is important, to lessen the
implicit tax on the middle class by instituting a more gradual fadingout of the subsidies as income increases. The authorities should
also take into account the effects of a high minimum wage on the
demand for labor and costs of childcare.

Reform of rent subsidy arrangements could have a particularly large
effect in making work pay for lower-income earners. It is also
important to examine the minimum wage, which is high, and its links
to several social benefits, with an eye to finding ways of further
lessening traps and stimulating the demand for low-skilled labor.

The shortened duration limit remains high by international
comparison, and staff has recommended consideration of
a maximum period much shorter than three years, which would be
sufficient for unemployment benefits to serve their purpose from the
standpoint of job search. In addition, while high replacement rates
can be justified in the initial months of unemployment, a decline in
benefits over time would encourage a rapid return to employment
and avoid benefits dependency. The additional benefits instead of
and above social assistance further weaken incentives to find a job.

While staff accepts that the replacement rate for the fully disabled
may be increased, in line with social preferences for a “true”
disability program, it has recommended, in light of past abuses,
reassessment of the existing stock of disabled, rather than only
those younger than 45 years.

Staff Position and Recommendations

Effective October 2006, the LIFO principle for worker dismissal was eased.
Also, effective March 2007, the need for dismissal for economic reasons no
longer has to be checked by the Centers for Work and Income (CWI) if
employer and employees have agreed on the necessity of the dismissal.
Effective October 2006, dismissed workers no longer have to prove they
resisted being laid off to get unemployment benefits.
At the time of the 2006 Article IV consultation, the EPL was under active
discussion in the Social and Economic Council (SER). Though the different
parties could recognize the benefits from less strict EPL (for unions, up to
a certain extent), no consensus was reached on reforms because of
different views on how to proceed.

Significant progress has been made to improve the functioning of product
markets, and the competition agency (NMa) has been increasingly effective,
becoming formally independent in July 2006. Significant progress was made
towards meeting the previous government’s goal of reducing red tape by
25 percent by the end of its term (2007), including by reducing the number of
permits and license system that can adversely affect innovation and
experimentation.

Employment
protection
legislation (EPL)

Productivity

Measures are needed to further reduce barriers to
entrepreneurship and innovation. Thus, staff supports efforts to
reduce license and permit procedures, and continued government
efforts to reduce red tape, including the new government’s goal of
another 25 percent reduction. It also sees the NMa as important
and therefore welcomes efforts to strengthen its investigative
powers. In addition, staff encourages the social partners to allow
for greater wage differentiation in collective labor agreements,
with a view to helping attract labor to higher productivity
companies and sectors, while strengthening the incentives for
human capital investment.

EPL on regular contracts remains high by international
comparison. Because such legislation can hamper firms’ ability to
adjust quickly enough to market conditions, act as a tax on new
hiring, and hamper innovation, staff urges a further easing of
EPL.

Care needs to be taken that the new “life-course scheme” does
not merely substitute for past subsidized routes to early
retirement.1 In addition, taking into account changes in life
expectancy in determining the official retirement age deserves
serious attention.

Staff Position and Recommendations

1/ The scheme is a voluntary savings arrangement that allows individuals to save to fund leave, in agreement with their employers, for various activities like
childcare and mid-career training, or for early retirement.

Fiscal incentives were removed as of January 2006.

APPENDIX I. THE NETHERLANDS: POSSIBLE MEASURES TO REDUCE
THE SUSTAINABILITY GAP
In light of the wide-ranging political debate on aging in the Netherlands, various measures
that would more than close the sustainability gap have been suggested by different political
parties and evaluated by the CPB. These measures and their effects are shown in the table
below.

The Netherlands: Possible Sustainability-Enhancing Measures and Their
Effects in Reducing the Sustainability Gap
(In percent of GDP)
Reforming aging-related institutions
Increase of retirement age from 65 to 67 years
Reduction of the old-age related deduction in income tax
Reduction of cost of health care (higher contribution rates)
Increasing labor participation
Shortening of unemployment benefit from 3 to 1.5 years
Individualization of the general tax credit 1/
Phasing out tax deductibility of mortgage interest payments 2/

1/ In the present tax system, only one person in each household—the one with the lowest
income––has the right to the general tax credit (i.e., an allowance up to €1,990 per person).
This acts as a disincentive for the lower income member of the household to participate
fully on the labor market if the combined income tax of the household is then above the
threshold of the allowance. By individualizing the general tax credit, both partners can get
the allowance while lessening the disincentive to increased labor participation.
2/ Full details not available.
3/ This measure calls for high income earners to pay social contributions on their pension
savings (presently, pension savings are not subjected to social insurance premiums in the
Netherlands).

ANNEX I. THE NETHERLANDS: FUND RELATIONS
(As of April 30, 2007)

The 2007 Article IV discussions were held in Amsterdam and The Hague during
March 29–April 10, 2007. The staff team comprised Messrs. Feldman (head), Nadal
De Simone, Moore (all EUR), and Roger (MCM). It met with the minister of finance,
the governor and other representatives of the central bank (DNB) and financial
supervision, senior staff of several government ministries and agencies, including the
Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (CPB), the Competition Authority (NMa), and
the Social and Economic Council (SER), representatives of labor unions, employer
organizations, and parliament, the financial sector, including banks and pension funds,
and academics.
The Netherlands has accepted the obligations of Article VIII. It subscribes to the
SDDS, and economic data are adequate to conduct effective surveillance
(Appendix II).
The authorities released the mission’s concluding statement, organized a press
conference at the end of the mission, and agreed to the publication of the staff report.

ANNEX III. THE NETHERLANDS: PAST FUND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
AND IMPLEMENTATION
Fiscal Policy: Past recommendations included structural fiscal adjustment of at least
½ percentage point of GDP per year during the previous government’s term (2004–07),
closer coordination between central and local governments, and refinements to the fiscal
framework. Structural fiscal consolidation of over 3 percentage points of GDP was achieved
in 2004–06. The authorities have improved coordination between various levels of
government. In addition, the new government announced a target of a structural fiscal surplus
of 1 percent of GDP by 2011, broadly consistent with IMF recommendations during the 2006
Article IV consultation. The new government also made several refinements to the fiscal
framework in line with staff recommendations.
Labor Market Reform: Broadly in line with Fund advice, but sometimes to a lesser extent
than recommended, unemployment benefits were tightened; fiscal incentives for early
retirement abolished; inactivity traps gradually reduced; disability revamped; and reform of
employment protection legislation (EPL) is being discussed. Recommendations not yet
adopted include adjusting the minimum wage and taking into account life expectancy in
determining the retirement age. Calls for greater wage differentiation have not resulted in
notable changes.
Product Market Reform: The Fund has generally supported the authorities’ liberalization
program, including the unbundling of the energy market, the reduction in required licenses
and permits, and, more generally, the efforts to increase competition. The powers of the
competition authority have been increased. It is expected that the administrative burden will
have been reduced by the targeted 25 percent by 2007; the new government is aiming for a
reduction of the same size during its term.
Financial Sector: The authorities have made substantial progress in stress testing and
implementing risk-based supervision.

ANNEX IV. THE NETHERLANDS: STATISTICAL ISSUES
April 26, 2007
The Netherlands publishes a wide range of economic and financial statistics. Specifically,
annual and quarterly national account data are provided by the Central Bureau of Statistics;
financial and balance of payments data are provided by De Nederlandsche Bank; and fiscal
data are provided by the Ministry of Finance. These data are increasingly available in
electronic form. Macroeconomic data are generally of high quality.
As a one-off matter, a number of institutional reforms had a significant impact on national
account and other data in 2006. Most importantly, the reform of health care insurance caused
a significant reclassification of private consumption into public consumption. This shift had a
big impact on the growth rates of the components concerned, but overall GDP was not
affected.
The frequency and timeliness of the availability of the statistical indicators required for Fund
surveillance purposes are summarized in the attached table. The authorities subscribe to the
Special Data Dissemination Standard, providing information about their data and data
dissemination practices on the IMF Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. In addition,
they have committed to a ROSC data module mission tentatively set for later this year.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
June 13, 2007
1.
This staff statement provides information on developments that has become available
since the preparation of the staff report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation. The new
information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Recent data are broadly in line with staff projections. Real GDP in the first
quarter of 2007 was 0.6 percent higher than in the previous quarter (2.5 percent higher than
a year earlier). Meanwhile, consumer and producer confidence have remained strong through
May 2007; unemployment has continued to fall, with the number of unemployed in
April 2007 reaching the lowest level in four years; and year-on-year CPI inflation in May
(HICP basis) was 2.0 percent.
3.
The 2007 fiscal deficit is now officially projected to be larger than reported in
the staff report. In particular, in the Spring Memorandum (a document sent by the ministry
of finance to parliament in late May that contains a midyear overview of the current budget),
the authorities project a 2007 general government deficit of 0.7 percent of GDP (versus their
earlier projection of a deficit of 0.1–0.3 percent of GDP as noted in the staff report). This
widening of the projected deficit mainly reflects lower natural gas revenues and health sector
overruns. The revision strengthens the staff report’s case for early remedial actions to tighten
the fiscal stance and return to a course of fiscal consolidation.

Statement by Age Bakker, Executive Director for
Kingdom of the Netherlands—Netherlands
June 13, 2007

I thank staff for their to-the-point assessment and I would like to convey the appreciation of
the authorities for the open and in-depth discussions during the mission.
After several years of headwind, the Dutch economy has been advancing above potential
growth since last year. Although major structural reforms have been carried out in the past
years, challenges remain. The new coalition government, which took office in February, is
well aware of these challenges. It has put forward several additional measures, focused on
increasing labor participation and improving the long-term sustainability of public finances.
Economic outlook
Following a kick-start driven by exports in the first part of the cycle, economic growth is
now broad based, with domestic demand fuelled by increasing consumer and producer
confidence. Although it has not yet reached the levels that were registered at the turn of the
century, consumer confidence has steadily increased since 2003. Household consumption is
forecasted to grow rapidly this year, but is still only marginally above its long-term average.
Investment grew rapidly in 2006, bolstered by a steady positive trend in producer confidence,
increasing profits, and accelerating production. This year, investment growth is expected to
decelerate somewhat, before picking up again to high levels. In general, the short term
outlook for the Dutch economy is positive: economic growth is forecasted to remain well
above potential and the output gap is expected to turn positive in 2008.
Fiscal policy
The Netherlands has a well-developed pension system, including a significant (funded)
second pillar, and is, as rightly noted by staff, relatively well-placed to cope with the
budgetary cost of ageing. Nevertheless, the government is committed to further improve the
long-term sustainability of public finances. Budgetary consolidation, in combination with
structural reforms, is planned to deliver such an improvement and to reduce the so-called
sustainability gap.
Previous governments have achieved a reduction of the debt ratio from close to 80 percent in
the mid-nineties to well below 50 percent nowadays. The new government is committed to
build on this achievement and has defined its budgetary policy agenda in light of an ageing
population. The authorities have decided to set a target of a structural surplus of 1 percent of
GDP in 2011, as previously recommended by staff. In conjunction with the measures aimed
at higher labor participation, this is expected to lead to a decrease in the sustainability gap by
approximately one third.
The Coalition Agreement of the new government provides for concrete measures to improve
the fiscal position. On the revenue side, environmental taxes will be increased and the tax
system will be revised with a view to enhance labor participation. On the expenditure side,
gains are to be realized mainly through efficiency-enhancing measures. The most eye-

2
catching example is the significant reduction in the number of civil servants by
approximately 13,000, to be achieved before 2011. This figure amounts to 7 percent of the
work force of the government, resulting in an expenditure reduction of € 630 million.
Since the completion of the Article IV mission, short-term setbacks in the fiscal position
have appeared, resulting in a reversal from a budgeted surplus to an expected deficit of 0.7
percent GDP in 2007. Compared to the budget in September, this means a worsening of the
balance by 0.9 percent of GDP. This can mainly be explained by lower gas revenues (0.5
percent of GDP) and expenditure overruns in the health care sector (0.2 percent of GDP).
These setbacks in the fiscal position do, however, not alter the medium-term outlook. The
government’s aim is to once again register a budgetary surplus in 2008. To this end, the
upcoming budget will include, among other things, measures to contain health care
expenditures. Moreover, the authorities have reiterated their commitment to a structural
surplus of 1 percent of GDP in 2011.
In the 2006 fiscal ROSC, the budgetary framework of the Netherlands was found to meet or
exceed the principles of the fiscal transparency code. To achieve further improvement, the
authorities have recently implemented some of the recommendations of the 2006 article IV
consultation and the fiscal ROSC. These measures include a larger safety margin to avoid a
breach of the EMU budgetary rules by lowering the signal value for the deficit from 2.5
percent of GDP to 2 percent of GDP. Moreover, interest payments have been brought outside
the expenditure ceilings, the tradition of cautious growth assumptions has been replaced by
using best (realistic) forecasts, and measures have been taken to improve the management of
the resources in the government’s savings fund for infrastructural outlays.
Financial sector
The report gives an accurate overview of the current state of the financial sector and financial
stability in the Netherlands. I am pleased with staff’s finding that the Dutch supervisory
framework and implementation represents best international practice. Staff rightly expresses
words of caution on the expansion of responsibilities of the Netherlands Authority for the
Financial Markets (AFM) as a consequence of new domestic and EU legislation. The AFM is
currently fully capable of executing its tasks, but the authorities agree that adding new large
tasks could negatively impact the execution of its core responsibilities and note there is no
intention to broaden the mandate of AFM.
Staff rightly notes that cross-border banks require intensified coordination with supervisors
in other countries. Because of the strong internationalization of the Dutch financial sector,
the authorities gained a lot of experience in this respect, both within and outside of the
European Union. It is expected and needed that coordination and cooperation among
supervisors and other authorities will be strengthened in the future. Staff also signals a
possible increase in competition in the pension sector from foreign-based providers and the
need for measures to increase transparency of pension supervision in the EU. I agree that
transparency is a key issue in this matter. It is crucial that all parties involved have a
complete and thorough view of the consequences of differences in supervisory regimes in EU
Member States.

3
Structural reforms
The structural reforms of the past years, like the overhaul of the disability scheme, continue
to pay off. Labor participation increased by one percentage point in 2006 compared to 2005
and is expected to increase further one percentage point in 2007. Although the effect is
waning in 2007 and 2008, the additional labor supply stemming from policy measures is still
estimated at 50,000 persons. Last year, the Dutch competitive position increased for the first
time since 2000. The structural reforms and the improvement of the competitive position
have helped Dutch companies to take full advantage of the favorable development of the
world economy. The return-on-equity has steadily improved over the past few years and is
currently at the highest level since the mid-eighties.
Notwithstanding the increase in labor supply, labor market tensions are reappearing in some
segments. Labor market shortages which would lead to substantial wage increases would
prevent a significant improvement in the Dutch competitive position and limit the extent to
which the economy can grow in the current economic upswing. Further increasing labor
supply by fostering labor participation is therefore of utmost importance. A key goal of the
government is to increase participation in society in general and in labor markets more
specifically. In the past three years labor market dynamics have already gone in the right
direction. New and filled vacancies have been increasing since the second quarter of 2003.
The government plans various measures which should help to further enhance labor
participation. Measures will be specifically targeted at groups currently underrepresented in
the workforce, notably older workers, women, and foreign-born workers. The measures
foreseen include a reduction of the possibility to transfer the general tax credit from the nonworking to the working partner and the introduction of an earned income tax credit to make
low-paid work more attractive. Moreover, the tax credit for the working elderly will be
increased and stronger incentives in the state pension will be introduced. These measures aim
to increase the attractiveness of continued employment at an older age. At the same time, the
government intends to improve labor-market participation of young people in co-operation
with the private sector.
Conclusion
The structural reforms implemented over the past few years continue to pay off. The
flexibility and competitiveness of the economy have improved, the structural budgetary
position has significantly improved, and with domestic demand picking up, economic growth
is now broad based. Although the expected deterioration in the fiscal position in 2007 is
disappointing, it does not change the medium-term and long-term fiscal outlook. The
authorities are committed to put forward measures in the 2008 budget to again achieve a
budgetary surplus. Moreover, the target of a structural surplus of 1 percent of GDP in 2011,
combined with the planned structural reforms, is expected to address one third of the
sustainability gap. The reforms in the labor market will also help to alleviate upward pressure
on wages. All in all, this makes the Netherlands relatively well-placed to reap the benefits of
the current benign international economic environment and to cope with the budgetary cost
of ageing.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with the Kingdom of
the Netherlands — Netherlands
On June 13, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Kingdom of the Netherlands — Netherlands.1
Background
Economic performance has been strong. The economic recovery is firmly entrenched and
compares favorably in a European context. The unemployment rate has declined significantly
while inflation has stayed in check—though resource constraints are emerging. Economic
expansion and rising stock prices have contributed to a cyclical strengthening of the financial
sector, especially pension funds and insurance companies.
With the large current account surplus, and exports and overall growth doing well, external
competitiveness would appear to be satisfactory. Improvements in the macroeconomic and
business environments and technological innovation have contributed positively to Dutch
competitiveness. Though domestically produced exports have lost some market share in
recent years, the growth of reexports has been very strong, and the external sector is
contributing positively to economic growth.
Recent fiscal performance was impressive. The general government balance shifted from a
deficit of 3.1 percent of GDP in 2003 to a surplus of 0.6 percent of GDP in 2006. This

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
adjustment had a large structural component, reflecting contributions from expenditure cuts
and revenue measures; larger gas revenues also contributed.
A major challenge for policymakers is addressing population aging. As in other countries in the
region, the Netherlands faces a rising dependency ratio in coming decades. The Netherlands
is comparatively well placed to address aging, in the sense of having the advantages of a
favorable initial fiscal position and a large, fully funded, second pension pillar. Nevertheless,
ensuring fiscal sustainability still requires a combination of further fiscal consolidation and
other sustainability-enhancing structural reforms.
The financial sector has benefited from the economic recovery, but some vulnerabilities
remain. Bank capital adequacy is well above minimum requirements, and pension funds and
insurance company’s coverage ratios have recovered to around 2001 levels. Nonetheless, low
profit margins in the banking sector and EU measures to promote pension mobility suggest
that foreign penetration of the Dutch financial system could increase, posing challenges for
supervision. High indebtedness in both the non-financial corporate and household sectors
make them vulnerable to rising interest rates. It has also led to the introduction of a code of
conduct setting limits on mortgage lending to prevent households from over-borrowing, but the
code’s effectiveness remains to be seen. The housing market, more broadly, is affected
adversely by distortions, including the tax deductibility of mortgage interest payments and rent
controls.
Against this background, the consultation focused on the near-term economic outlook; fiscal
policy during the new government’s term, including with a view to addressing population aging
and securing fiscal sustainability; safeguarding financial stability; and structural reforms to
raise participation and productivity, which would also have favorable effects on potential
growth and fiscal sustainability.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the significant fiscal adjustment achieved in
recent years and for their implementation of difficult structural reforms. They also welcomed
the continued strong and broad-based growth performance of the Dutch economy. In the
current situation of robust economic growth and a tightening labor market, Directors stressed
the importance of further fiscal consolidation, not only to reduce potential overheating risks, but
also to further efforts to address the fiscal implications of population aging. In addition, they
underscored the benefits of additional structural reforms to enhance labor supply and flexibility.
Directors observed that this year’s fiscal stance could add stimulus at a time of emerging
resource constraints. They accordingly encouraged the authorities to tighten the fiscal stance
as soon as possible, locking in any unexpected saving in 2007, and ensuring that the 2008
budget makes decisive progress toward securing the medium-term fiscal surplus target.
Directors emphasized that continued improvement in the underlying fiscal position requires
tight spending control. They recommended that the authorities implement offsetting

3
expenditure-reducing measures before putting in place envisaged spending increases; set
prudent expenditure ceilings through 2011, in the context of preparing the 2008 budget; and
carefully monitor health care, in order to counter a tendency toward overruns in the sector.
Directors supported the new government’s target of a general government structural surplus of
1 percent of GDP by 2011. They also commended the authorities’ commitment to maintaining
the fiscal framework, which is anchored in multiyear real expenditure ceilings and has imparted
discipline and transparency. However, with planned measures closing only part of the fiscal
sustainability gap, Directors underscored the importance of identifying and implementing
additional sustainability-enhancing measures, in order to provide a larger margin for
addressing the aging problem and better protecting intergenerational equity. In the same vein,
Directors encouraged the authorities to err on the side of a higher-than-targeted surplus in
executing fiscal policy.
Directors welcomed the strength and stability of the financial sector, stemming both from the
macroeconomic upswing and from improvements in supervision and risk management. In this
context, they commended the risk-oriented, cross-sectoral approach to financial sector
supervision, pointing out that, in many respects, the design and implementation of supervision
in the Netherlands are international best practice. While welcoming the adoption of the
mortgage code of conduct, intended to limit excessive household indebtedness, Directors
nevertheless observed that it does not address the underlying tax incentive to maximize
mortgage debt. In addition, Directors generally saw benefits from rectifying distortions
adversely affecting both the supply and demand side of the housing market.
Directors attached considerable urgency to efforts to increase labor supply, both to ease the
tight labor market and to address aging-related challenges. They noted that the elimination of
the transferability of the general tax credit would have a more significant near-term impact if
phased out over a shorter period than the envisaged 20 years. Directors also encouraged
consideration of other policies to boost the supply of labor—including a shorter duration for
unemployment benefits and raising the retirement age in line with increases in life expectancy.
Measures to enhance labor supply would contribute to a continuation of wage moderation,
needed to maintain competitiveness and take full advantage of the favorable external
economic outlook.
Directors saw scope to boost productivity and the sustainable growth rate. They welcomed
actions to increase the role of market forces in various sectors, strengthen the investigative
powers of the competition authority, and reduce administrative burdens. They urged further
efforts to make employment protection legislation less stringent, with a few Directors
highlighting the benefits of greater wage differentiation.
Directors commended the authorities for their commitment to Official Development Assistance.
