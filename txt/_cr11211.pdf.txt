Staff Report for the 2011 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2011 Consultation with France
Approved by Ajai Chopra and Tamim Bayoumi
July 8, 2011
Executive Summary
Context: Supportive policies and reforms contributed to a gradual recovery from the crisis, but the
unsettled external environment continues to pose risks, especially related to possible spillovers from
the euro area crisis. Moreover, current growth prospects allow only for a gradual reduction in the
high unemployment. Progress is being made in fiscal consolidation but more efforts might be needed
to reach the 2012–13 targets. The financial sector is gaining strength while risks linked to rapid
house price increases and direct exposures to euro area crisis countries seem at this stage contained.
Challenges: The main challenges for French policy makers are to strengthen the recovery and
reduce unemployment while safeguarding financial sector stability. Achieving these objectives
would require measures to bring down the public debt in a sustainable manner; regulatory reform to
improve the resilience of the financial sector and vigilance on housing market developments; and
structural policies to enhance competitiveness and boost inclusive growth.
Policy Recommendations: Preparing specific contingency measures is important to ensure reaching
the 2012–13 fiscal targets in case growth is less strong than foreseen by the authorities while
adopting a fiscal rule would enhance credibility of the consolidation strategy. Improving resilience
of the financial sector requires implementation of Basel III regulatory reforms and reduction of the
contribution to systemic risks from global systemically important financial institutions. Structural
reforms to strengthen incentives for work, increasing economic efficiency, and innovation are
needed to enhance competitiveness and boost inclusive growth.
Authorities’ response: There was general agreement on the policy measures to be taken. The
authorities were determined to achieve their fiscal consolidation objectives and have introduced a
draft law to establish a fiscal rule. They were also committed to making the financial sector more
resilient, but noted that international discussions were still ongoing and cautioned about a possible
negative impact of some regulatory reform proposals. Building on the progress made in recent years,
they intended to continue structural reforms but noted that some of these were politically
challenging.
Mission team: Ms. Gulde-Wolf (head), Mr. De Vrijer, Mr. Cheng, Ms. Poirson Ward, Mr. Hallaert
(all EUR), and Mr. Sy (MCM).

I. GRADUAL RECOVERY AMID GLOBAL UNCERTAINTY AND STRUCTURAL CHALLENGES
1.
Supportive policy measures and reforms contributed to a gradual recovery from
the crisis. In terms of both output and employment losses during the crisis, France has fared
better than most advanced economies and the euro area as a whole. However, real GDP
growth of 1½ percent in 2010 was below that in other core euro area countries and the
rebound in employment was weaker. Notwithstanding the strong growth in 2011:Q1, both
output and employment still remain below their pre-crisis levels.

The recovery in 2010 and early 2011 was largely driven by robust consumption
and stock-building. Consumption was spurred by purchases and orders of automobiles just
before and delivery after the expiry of the car scrapping scheme at end-2010. Fixed
investment has begun to pick up from 2010:Q2 as construction spending recovered and
purchases of new houses increased. Activity in early 2011 also benefited from a catch-up
effect from the strikes and cold weather at end-2010. The contribution of net exports to
growth was positive but small in 2010 and a drag on growth in 2011:Q1, reflecting sluggish
export growth as a result of declining foreign market shares together with dynamic import
demand.

The unemployment rate has started to decline but remains high. Compared to
output, employment has recovered much less from the downturn. After reaching a trough of
around 7¼ percent in the first quarter of 2008, the unemployment rate climbed to above
9½ percent by 2009:Q3, and thereafter declined gradually to around 9 percent by early 2011.
Staff estimates that the increase in the unemployment rate since 2008:Q2 has resulted in
some further increase in its structural component, thereby holding back potential growth
going forward.

The external environment has remained unsettled. Specifically,



Euro area financial risks—France has thus far not been affected much by the
turbulence in European sovereign debt markets, but concerns over euro area
sovereign debt persist. Indeed, sovereign bond spreads (vis-à-vis Germany) and
sovereign CDS spreads remain somewhat higher than in the first part of 2010, likely
reflecting increased market awareness of high public debt in the euro area and of
French banks’ exposure to some euro area crisis countries (Box 1).



Commodity price hikes—Strong demand for commodities by emerging market
countries coupled with the events in the Middle East and North Africa region and the
disaster in Japan have prompted a world oil and food price hike that pushed up annual
headline inflation in France to 2 percent in March 2011 (Box 2). Although core
inflation remained subdued—in light of the still sizable output gap and high
unemployment—higher headline inflation could undermine consumer confidence and
erode purchasing power.

5.
At the same time, France faces a number of well-known structural challenges.
The policy response to these would impact on the speed and strength of the recovery as well
as long-term growth. In particular, there is a need to:


Lift structural obstacles to stronger competitiveness on world markets;



Facilitate employment of young and low-skilled workers; and



Deal with the impact of an aging population in a sustainable manner. The recent
pension reform is an important step in the right direction.

6
Box 1. Co-movement Between French and Selected Sovereign Yield and CDS Spreads
Amid heightened sovereign risks in the euro area, France’s sovereign CDS spread and its 10year government bond yield spread (relative to the German Bund) have increased during 2010.
The extent of increases of the 10-year bond yield spread, however, has been much more moderate than
those of the sovereign CDS spread, likely reflecting the shallowness of the CDS markets. Compared to
the euro program countries (Greece, Ireland, and Portugal) and also to Italy and Spain, the increase in
France’s sovereign CDS spread has been much more moderate—by around 80 basis points from trough
to peak as opposed to a range between 180 and 800 basis points for these other countries. The comovement between sovereign CDS spreads of France and these countries has increased during the past
few years, while the co-movement of the bond yield spread has increased much less.
In early 2011, French and German spreads have moved in a different direction than those of
Greece/Ireland/Portugal: while sovereign CDS and bond yield spreads of Greece/Ireland/Portugal
continued to steadily increase during the first four months of the year, the French/German and
Italian/Spanish CDS spreads declined during this period. However, co-movement increased in
June 2011 amid renewed concerns about the euro area sovereign debt.

Box 2. Pass-Through of Food and Energy Prices
In tandem with international commodity price hikes, domestic energy prices in France have
surged, although food price increases remained subdued. After declining from a peak of over
3½ percent in the summer of 2008, annual headline inflation hovered around zero throughout 2009.
By 2011:Q1, headline inflation has gradually climbed above 2 percent, over half of which has been
directly due to increases in fuel prices with food prices playing only a minor role. Core inflation has
remained low.

Looking forward, headline inflation risk is on the upside, while core inflation should remain
relatively moderate. Given structural commodity supply-demand imbalances and potential geopolitical
factors, international oil prices are subject to upside risk, which, if realized, will likely exert upward
pressures on headline inflation. The risks to core inflation, however, should be less significant given the
still large output gap and the historically low pass-through.

Domestic demand is expected to remain the engine of growth, with net exports
playing a minor role in the near term. Private consumption growth is expected to remain
dynamic in 2011–12, but is likely to face the headwind of the expiration of the car scrapping
scheme, high unemployment, and uncertainty about headline inflation. Both business and
household investment are expected to increase in 2011 as construction spending and housing
markets recover. However, excess capacity and uncertainty about credit availability are
likely to weigh on business investment. Net exports are unlikely to propel growth in the next
few years, in view of the fiscal consolidation throughout Europe, competitiveness issues and
the appreciation of the euro.

Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. Downside risks are particularly
related to possibly renewed concerns about sovereign risks in the euro area in light of
France’s high public debt and the significant exposure of French banks to the euro area
periphery. A swing in investor sentiment could affect the availability and cost of financing to
banks and the sovereign. A slower-than-expected recovery in trading partners linked to the

dampen the recovery in France, especially if second round-effects prompt the ECB to raise
interest rates faster than otherwise. On the upside, a stronger-than-expected recovery in
trading partners, linked to resolution of the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area, could
bolster exports while business investment could turn out stronger than foreseen. Visible
progress in the reform agenda, including fiscal consolidation, financial regulation, and
structural measures, would inspire confidence, induce investment, and boost demand.

Box 3. Growth Spillovers to France1
In the context of the crisis, examining international economic and financial linkages has
become more important. France’s growth performance is affected by growth shocks from
abroad through both trade and financial linkages. In particular, growth spillover risks from the
U.S. and large southern euro area countries to France are significant. France is highly
vulnerable to growth spillovers from a shock in Spain while spillover effects from Italy are also
relatively large. The contagion threat from the U.K. is generally small, except during financial
crises when U.K. growth spillovers become more elevated. As autonomous domestic demand
in Germany is rather stable and its final domestic expenditure has a low import propensity, the
impact of growth shocks originating in Germany has historically been small.2 However,
Germany, by far France’s largest trade partner, is an important transmitter to France and its
other trading partners of shocks originating both within and outside the EMU, given its
relatively high sensitivity to external shocks and high import propensity exports. France has
little exposure to growth shocks originating in Japan in view of the limited trade linkages.

Results are based on a reduced form VAR estimation for 17 countries, which allows for both trade and financial
channels of transmission. Identification is obtained via weighting different plausible orderings, and results are
summarized by the average impulse response. Results for “normal times” are based on regressions that include a
crisis dummy for 2008Q4–2009Q1, while the framework without the crisis dummy also reflects the relationship
across growth rates in crisis times. The estimate of the role of third-country effects in the transmission of
U.S. shocks for France and other European countries is based on a counterfactual analysis. See Poirson, H. and S.
Weber, “European Growth Spillover Accounting from Crisis to Recovery”, forthcoming IMF Working Paper.

B. Medium- and Long-term Growth
9.
Boosting potential growth requires a comprehensive strategy. The financial crisis
is estimated to have resulted in a permanent potential output loss of around 1–3 percent over
the medium term due to lower capital accumulation, higher structural unemployment, and
reduced total productivity (Box 4). Over the longer term, the potential growth rate would
converge to around 1¾ percent, a rate that would have been attained in the absence of the

10
Box 4. The Impact of the Crisis on Potential Growth
The impact of the crisis on potential output in France is bigger than that of Germany, but smaller
than that of the United States. Unlike the United States, France was not the epicenter of the financial
crisis and, as a relatively closed economy, was not directly exposed to a market collapse or speculative
attacks during the crisis. On the other hand, compared with Germany, the losses in employment during
the crisis have been more pronounced in France (see Selected Issues Paper for more details). Against this
background, France is estimated to have suffered a permanent output loss of around 1–3 percent, in
between those of Germany and the United States.
The loss in output and slower potential growth during 2008–15 reflects the repercussions of the
recession and financial stress. First, the sharp contraction of investment has resulted in a slowdown of
capital accumulation, which directly lowered potential growth and indirectly reduced labor productivity
and efficiency, thereby lowering total factor productivity (TFP) growth. Second, the sharp rise in
unemployment and the slow job gains during the recovery suggest that the unemployment has an
increasing structural component. This is also likely to reduce labor productivity and TFP growth going
forward as displaced workers lose their skills.
Over the longer run, potential growth is likely to be lower than the level during the past two
decades, regardless of whether the crisis had occurred. The lower long-run potential growth rate
reflects the aging population and the associated decline in labor force growth.

financial crisis. This long-term potential growth rate is lower than the average rate of around
2 percent attained over the past few decades. The decline of the potential growth rate reflects
the impact of an aging population, although the recent pension reform is likely to lift the
labor market participation rate of seniors. Current growth prospects still fall short of what is
needed to significantly reduce the unemployment rate which is projected to gradually decline
to about 8 percent by 2016, and deal with the costs of population aging. A comprehensive
strategy, comprising measures to improve the functioning of the labor market, entice higher
labor market participation, and strengthen incentives to invest and innovate, is needed to
increase potential growth over the medium term (see Section III.C).

Authorities’ views
10.
The authorities considered that from 2012 onwards the economy was set to
achieve higher growth than projected by staff. They expected the current momentum to
carry over in 2012, with real GDP growth increasing to 2¼ percent—above current
consensus. For 2013–14, more dynamic private consumption would lift the annual growth
rate to 2½ percent. Over the medium term, the authorities projected potential growth at a rate
of 2 percent, mainly reflecting higher total factor productivity growth than under the staff
baseline.
III. POLICY CHALLENGES: SAFEGUARDING FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY, ENSURING
FINANCIAL STABILITY, AND INCREASING GROWTH
11.
Fiscal, financial sector, and growth challenges are closely interlinked. Fiscal
policy needs to strike a balance between fiscal sustainability and confidence-enhancing
measures on the one hand and growth considerations on the other. Financial sector policies
and regulatory reform should help to further strengthen the sector’s capacity to finance the
economy and make it more crisis-resistant. A more competitive and growth-oriented
economy is essential to raise employment, and help restore fiscal health. This places a
premium on improving incentives for work, investment, and innovation through further labor
and product/services markets reforms as well as a growth-friendly tax reform.
A. Achieving Fiscal Sustainability
Fiscal Consolidation Seeks a Balance between Competing Considerations
12.
A large fiscal consolidation has been set in motion. Crisis-related costs―including
the fiscal stimulus, revenue losses, and financial sector support―and declining trend growth
have pushed France’s government deficit and public debt to above the levels typical of other
European AAA-rated countries. Aging-related spending pressures (although less than in

other advanced countries) further add to sustainability concerns. While the 2010 pension
reform enacted in December will improve the public debt dynamics, under current policies
projected health care spending growth will push up the debt ratio in the coming years. To
underpin France’s AAA-rating and to avoid that rising public debt would negatively affect
growth, the government considers a large and determined fiscal consolidation as critical.
13.
The French Stability Program strikes an appropriate balance between growth
and sustainability concerns, and aims to reduce the overall fiscal deficit to 3 percent of
GDP by 2013 and 2 percent of GDP by 2014. This planned fiscal adjustment is large both
by historical standards and relative to that in other countries. The authorities seek to mitigate
adverse effects on growth through a package of measures that: increases the efficiency of
public services through implementation of the second phase of the review of public
expenditures (Révision Générale des Politiques Publiques, RGPP); ensures the viability of
the social security system by arresting the surge in aging-related spending; contains local
government current spending through a freeze on transfers; raises public investment in
innovation-related projects, including through public-private partnerships; and cuts wasteful
tax expenditures. Moreover, the authorities expect the increase in the retirement age to raise
potential growth through higher labor force participation. Staff observed that achieving the

13
fiscal targets would enhance credibility and be an important down-payment towards reducing
the public debt to 60 percent of GDP by the middle of the next decade.
14.
Following the fiscal stimulus in 2009/10, progress is now being made in restoring
fiscal sustainability. The fiscal outcome in 2010 was better than foreseen by almost
¾ percent of GDP because of higher-than-expected revenues (0.4 percent of GDP—including
from real estate transaction taxes levied by local governments), lower-than-expected
spending on unemployment benefits; and capital expenditure cuts at the local government
level. Instead of the expected fiscal expansion, the overall deficit was reduced to 7.1 percent
of GDP from 7.5 percent in 2009, implying a small negative fiscal impulse.
15.
Building on this, the 2011 budget and 2011–14 multi-year fiscal framework
provide for about 2.8 percent of GDP in adjustment measures over 2011–13. These
measures trim the overall fiscal deficit to below 6 percent of GDP in 2011, yield a permanent

The adjustment is front-loaded and tilted toward expenditure-containment

France cannot risk missing its medium-term fiscal targets given the need to
strengthen implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) and keep borrowing
costs low by securing France’s AAA-rating. Staff’s baseline projections, based on less
sanguine macroeconomic assumptions, suggest additional adjustment needs of about
0.2 percent of GDP in 2012 and 0.6 percent of GDP in 2013. The authorities’ determination
to achieve their fiscal objectives would thus be supported by preparing specific contingency
measures that would secure the targeted consolidation in case growth and revenue outcomes
fall short of the authorities’ projections. With limited scope and desirability for raising tax
rates, further efforts will need to rely mainly on limits on spending

growth and a growth-oriented restructuring of the tax system. In this context, increasing the
revenue yield of existing taxes through further base-broadening measures could support both
cuts in the overall high labor tax wedge and provide insurance against expenditure slippages
(as discussed in Section III.C).
18.
Achieving the envisaged consolidation is critical to put the public debt-to-GDP
ratio on a downward path. In the staff’s baseline fiscal projections, high deficits in
2010–12 are likely to result in further increases in the public debt ratio, which would peak at
about 88 percent of GDP in 2013. In a scenario where interest rates are permanently higher
by one-half standard deviation, debt would peak at almost 90 percent of GDP in 2013, and if
both interest rates are higher and growth is lower, debt would continue to rise to 95 percent
of GDP by 2016. Under the authorities’ fiscal consolidation plan, the public debt ratio starts
to fall after 2012.

19.
A credible fiscal package of additional measures to achieve the necessary
consolidation and lay the foundation for a more growth-friendly tax system could
include:


Curbs on local government expenditure growth, including through an extension of the
RGPP to regional and local authorities and implementation of the recommendations
of the Balladur Committee to rationalize responsibilities of departments, regions, and
municipalities;



Improved targeting of family, housing, and other social transfers. To enforce a tighter
budget constraint on spending by social security entities, consideration could be
given to replacing earmarked “social taxes” (which account for almost a third of
social security resources) with subsidies. This would result in less open-ended
spending mandates in the social security budget and greater ability of the central

17
government to control the expenditure growth of social security entities and other
public agencies.


Reducing the VAT policy gap through a gradual elimination of VAT exemptions and
incentives (including reduced rates). An ambitious VAT reform could yield up to
3.3 percent of GDP and be combined with the introduction of a carbon tax (Box 5),
higher revenue from fuel, alcohol, and tobacco taxation, gradual hikes in recurrent
inmovable property taxes, and improving the efficiency of the personal income tax
while further reducing personal income tax allowances to lower the still high labor
tax wedge at the average wage level.4

Institutional Reforms Can Aid Fiscal Sustainability
20.
Staff encouraged the authorities to push ahead with their efforts to adopt a fiscal
rule consistent with the planned EU directive. A fiscal rule this would entrench fiscal
credibility and support euro area-wide efforts to boost fiscal discipline. With a second large
core country adopting a fiscal rule, the credibility of the euro area’s SGP would be
significantly strengthened. The authorities have prepared a draft law that envisages

4

Earlier reforms aimed at decreasing employer-paid social security contributions paid at low wage levels
(between 1 and 1.6 times the minimum wage) have already significantly lowered the tax wedge at the bottom of
the income distribution.

18
Box 5. Should France Introduce a Carbon Tax?1
Implementing a carbon tax in France would initiate an economy-wide carbon pricing strategy that
ramps up over time in coordination with the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), in which France
already participates. The 2009 carbon tax proposal remains attractive in several respects, and its impact
on vulnerable categories and motorists could be mitigated through targeted transfers and more finely-tuned
fuel taxes. Reasons to consider a carbon tax include:
First, the tax targets emission sources outside of the ETS, e.g., fuel used in homes, small- and
medium-sized companies, and motor vehicles, which together account for around two-thirds of CO2
emissions in France. With continued ETS participation, most possibilities for reducing carbon emissions
would thus be exploited. Moreover, the proposed tax rate of €17 per ton of CO2 was in line with prevailing
emissions prices in the ETS. Price harmonization promotes cost-effectiveness by equating the cost of the
last ton reduced across ETS and non-ETS emissions. The emissions price is also broadly consistent with
recommendations derived from an estimate of the future damages from CO2 emissions.2
Second, the tax would provide annual revenue of around €4 billion (about 0.2 percent of GDP). This
revenue could be used to support the planned fiscal consolidation, or recycled to finance reforms aimed at
reducing labor taxation. While any employment gains from revenue-recycling would tend to be offset as
higher energy costs cause a slight contraction in economic activity,3 overall the revenue-recycling would
keep the costs of the tax modest.
Third, a carbon tax removes uncertainty related to the future emissions price. In contrast, volatile
allowance prices in cap-and-trade systems may deter clean technology investments.
The 2009 carbon tax proposal was rejected by the Constitutional Court in 2010 on the grounds that
it had too many exemptions and would have adverse distributional and competitiveness effects.
However, the majority of exempt sources were already covered by the ETS. Helping low-income
households and vulnerable firms through targeted adjustments to the broader tax and benefit system, is
generally preferred to holding down energy prices below levels warranted on environmental grounds. In
April 2011, the EU proposed a minimum carbon tax (for heating and transport fuels) of €20 per ton which
is yet to be approved. Denmark, Ireland, and Finland already impose carbon taxes (mainly on
transportation and heating fuels) of €12, €15, and €20 per ton, respectively, while Sweden imposes a much
higher tax of €108 per ton.
The tax would increase (by about €0.04 per liter) the burden on motorists, who already pay excise taxes
of €0.61 per liter for gasoline and €0.43 per liter for diesel. However, high taxation of vehicle use is
warranted because of other adverse side-effects (e.g., traffic congestion), though fuel taxes could be partly
replaced with more finely tuned taxes to address other side-effects of vehicle use (e.g., per mile tolls that vary
with location and time of day according to the degree of road congestion).

enshrining a fiscal rule comprising the general government in the constitution.5 In line with
the recommendations of the Camdessus working group6, the draft law would provide for:


A binding medium-term budget framework, including multi-year expenditure
ceilings and minimum annual revenue measures, and restriction of new tax measures
to budget laws. The 2011–14 multi-year fiscal framework already specifies objectives
for budgetary aggregates, consistent with the European fiscal rules, and since
June 2010 a directive of the Prime Minister ensures the monopoly of budget laws on
tax policy. However, enshrining those provisions in a national fiscal rule will lend
greater credibility to the fiscal targets, ensure continuity of policy across
governments, and reduce the uncertainties associated with consolidation.



A post-consolidation anchor for fiscal policies. The medium-term budget
projections under the proposed fiscal rule would need to be consistent with a return to
general government structural balance, ensuring that any temporary deficits are
eventually corrected.7 Unlike Germany’s debt-brake rule, the target year for
achieving budget balance would not be set in the constitution but would be implied
by the consolidation path voted by parliament.

21.
To enhance its credibility, the multi-year budget should be based on independent
macroeconomic forecasts and be backed by contingency spending and revenue plans.
EU experience suggests that the impact of fiscal rules on budgetary outcomes depends on the
strength of enforcement mechanisms (Box 6). Staff encouraged the authorities to establish an
independent public institution or fiscal council to provide forecasts that would be mandatory
for budget preparation and medium-term planning. Alternatively, the council could review ex
ante government projections of macro-economic variables and tax revenues to ensure their
realism and credibility; however, this option would enhance policy credibility only to the
extent that mechanisms are in place to enforce the council’s recommendations.8 The same
institution could also assess the long-term sustainability of public finances on a regular basis,
to increase public awareness of fiscal challenges.

5

The draft law has been approved by the National Assembly and is being considered by the Senate. Once
passed by the Senate, the constitutional change will require a three-fifths majority vote in Congress to become
law.

Local governments already have a “golden rule,” allowing them to borrow only to finance investment.
However, this rule does not ensure the consistency of their fiscal policy with the Stability Program.

8

An independent technical group of the national economic committee already prepares alternative
macroeconomic forecasts, which are compared with those of the government in the economic, social, and
financial report annexed to the draft budget bill. The budget however relies on government-prepared forecasts.

Box 6. Numerical Fiscal Rules in the EU

67 national fiscal rules were in place, up from less than 20 in 1990. About half of the total
number of rules applied to the general and central governments in 2008, up from a quarter
in 1990. More than a third of the existing fiscal rules in the EU countries are budget balance
rules (including golden rules) while expenditure and debt rules represent about a quarter each.
Revenue rules (that pre-define the allocation of windfall revenues) account for the remainder.
Expenditure rules apply more often to the central government and social security funds, and are
evenly distributed between nominal ceilings and targeted growth rates. Local governments are
more often subject to budget balance and debt limits according to repayment capacity.
The strength of fiscal rules depends to a large extent on its institutional features. To
capture the influence of these features, the European Commission has developed a fiscal rule
strength index, which is based on: (i) the statutory base of the rule; (ii) room for setting or
revising its objectives; (iii) the body in charge of monitoring implementation of the rule; (iv)
the enforcement mechanisms relating to the rule; and (v) the media visibility of the rule. Strong
rules (with a value of the fiscal rule strength index above the median) are in place in Denmark,
Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the U.K. Weak rules apply in Austria,
Belgium, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, and Portugal.
Only few EU rules include independent monitoring and enforcement mechanisms in case
of non-compliance. Strong rules, enshrined in law or constitution, with broad coverage, and
supported by pre-defined enforcement mechanisms, seem to have a larger impact on borrowing
costs than weak rules, suggesting that market participants favorably discount the effect of the
rules on fiscal discipline. Strong rules are also associated with more favorable budgetary
outcomes.

Securing long-term fiscal sustainability will require deeper reforms of key
pension and health care parameters.
On the pension side, further increasing the legal retirement age in the future in line
with life expectancy would prevent continued fiscal pressures from increases in time
spent in retirement as medical advances continue to lengthen life spans.9 With the
tenth-highest worldwide life expectancy and one of the lowest effective retirement
ages in the OECD, French workers spend the longest time in retirement among
advanced countries. Further efforts to increase senior workers’ labor force
participation rate, including through targeted tax incentives, would also help
moderate the fiscal and growth consequences of aging (as discussed in Section III.C).
Another evaluation of the long-term financial viability of the pension system is
planned for 2013.

Authorities’ views
23.
The authorities reaffirmed their full commitment to the fiscal adjustment path
outlined in France’s Stability Program. They considered that growth could surprise on the
upside and noted that their macroeconomic forecasts in recent years had proven realistic.
Strong revenue performance on the back of the increasing employment could result in a
slightly better-than-expected budgetary outcome in 2011. Should downside risks materialize,
there was room for contingency measures (including further cuts in tax expenditures). The
authorities agreed in principle on the desirability of “green taxes”, including a carbon tax, but
9

French workers now spend about two and half times as many years in retirement as they did in the early 1970s.
The effective retirement age will remain below the OECD average even with the planned increase in the
retirement age to 62 (assuming labor market exit continues to occur close to the retirement age).

22
viewed the scope for raising consumption taxes as limited in light of the potential negative
impact on demand and inflation. They were confident that the 2010 reform of the local
business tax and the legislated freeze in transfers would limit local government spending
growth. Social security finances would benefit from the positive impact of the recent and
previous pension reforms, the labor market recovery, and cost containment measures under
way in health care. Although current borrowing costs were still exceptionally low from an
historical perspective, the authorities considered the current spreads versus Germany to be
higher than warranted by France’s credit fundamentals, and expected tighter spreads as the
crisis is resolved.
24.
The authorities highlighted the recent advances made in strengthening the
medium-term budgetary framework. In the near term, they considered that the current
fiscal framework―including the approval of the Stability Program by parliament, the
“golden rule” at local government level, and strictly enforced spending rules for the central
government (along with the pension reform and the tightened health care spending growth
norm)― provided strong safeguards against the risk of fiscal slippages. They noted the broad
support for the proposed fiscal rule. It is nevertheless uncertain whether the required supermajority for a constitutional change will be secured ahead of the presidential elections
in 2012.
B. Financial Stability: Further Strengthening the Financial Sector
25.
Earnings of major French banks have recovered strongly in 2010 and
profitability now exceeds its pre-crisis level. Operating profit more than doubled in 2010 to
reach 14 percent of equity as banks continued to recover from the financial crisis. Both
operating profit and net income now exceed their 2007 level. Return on equity averaged
9.5 percent for the largest French banks, in line with their European peers. France has
requested an FSAP update, which is planned to start in late 2011.
26.
The major French main banks have reduced their reliance on wholesale funding
but it remains high. By mid-2010, the share of wholesale funding in total bank funding
remained above the average level of euro area, U.K., and U.S. banks. Deposits account for
85 percent of loans, comparable to the funding pattern of the largest European banks but still
lower than pre-crisis levels and much lower than for U.S. and U.K. banks. Short-term
funding relies heavily on U.S. dollar liabilities from U.S. money market funds. One-fourth of
the 2011 medium- and long-term issuance needs of the major French banks were already
covered by mid-February.

Capital adequacy has improved but major French banks remain less capitalized
than their European peers. Although their

28.
Asset quality is still below its pre-crisis level. Impaired loans at the main banking
groups increased slightly in 2010 to reach about 5 percent of gross loans. Coverage ratios
have been decreasing as banks expect the economic recovery to improve borrowers’ credit
risk. French banks have inherited limited legacy exposures on U.S. underlying assets from
the crisis, which they are actively reducing. The French (and Belgian) authorities have put in
place a guarantee mechanism for potential losses on the legacy assets of a small bank in case
such losses would exceed $4.5 billion.
29.
Overall credit growth remains sluggish but mortgage lending is recovering at a
fast pace. Corporate and consumer credit growth have both moved to positive territory
in 2011 and bank surveys indicate a willingness to lend. At the same time, residential
mortgage loans grew by 8.3 percent in February 2011 (y-o-y, from 4.1 percent a year ago) as
households locked in low fixed-term interest rates and took advantage of fiscal incentives to
invest in the property markets (such as the 2009 Loi Scellier).

31.
Risks from the regained exuberance of the French property market are
mitigated by banks’ lending practices and moderate household indebtedness. French
banks rely less on the value of collateral and more on the income of borrowers to assess
credit risk, and do not extend home equity loans. Banks typically offer mortgage products to
their own clients, which is another way to mitigate credit risk. Mortgages have long-term
fixed-rates which reduces interest rate risk for borrowers. Moreover, mortgage loans account
for about 40 percent of French GDP in 2010, less than half of the levels in the U.K. and
Ireland, and lower than the European average.

earliest advanced economies—along with Australia—where house prices recovered.

The ratio of house prices to household disposable income (affordability ratio) was one of the
highest among the advanced economies. Furthermore, unlike most other economies that saw houses
becoming more affordable after the crisis, France saw a small increase in the affordability ratio.

The resilience of France’s housing market has reflected a confluence of fundamental and
macroeconomic factors:


Fundamental factors—Housing supply has been structurally constrained by insufficient production
capacity in the construction sector, reflecting scarcity of buildable land in dense area metropolitan
areas and regulatory barriers to new housing construction. On the demand side, the strong increase
in the number of households in recent years—reflecting the trend of de-cohabitation and an aging
population (as seniors tend to live alone)—has further exacerbated the housing market imbalances.

26

Box 7. The French Housing Market During the Crisis and Recovery (concluded)


Macroeconomic factors—Home purchases have been partly spurred by the very low interest
rate environment. Furthermore, certain tax incentive schemes—notably the Loi Scellier—have
further encouraged home purchases.



Asset allocation factors—In view of relatively limited financial investment opportunities and
heightened risk aversion after the financial crisis, investors appear to consider real estate an
attractive safe haven.

Despite the recent increases in housing prices, the risk to financial stability remains
moderate:


Household debt is moderate—Despite an increase in household indebtedness in recent years,
household debt remains sustainable in France—at 93 percent of disposable income—and is
well below the levels in other advanced countries.



Bank lending practices are sound—Mortgage lending conditions in France are based on the
borrower's capacity to service the loan until maturity, and therefore on the stability of the
borrower's income. French banks

owners are less likely to default
when the interest rate rises. Against this background, residential mortgage loss rates incurred
by lending institutions have been structurally low in France.



Adverse macro-financial repercussions of a price drop should be limited. In France, unlike
the case in the U.S. and the U.K., mortgage lending takes the form of recourse loans. This
implies that borrowers have no incentive to default even when the market price of the house
falls below the loan value. Second, French households cannot make mortgage equity
withdrawals against their property. This suggests that the wealth effect of house prices is not
amplified and the negative effect of a house price decline on real activity would be smaller.

27
32.
Yet in a highly competitive mortgage finance market, risks to the financial
sector need to be contained. French banks have been extending mortgages at historically
record low interest rates and lengthened maturities. In an environment of monetary
tightening, the authorities should stand ready to use appropriate micro-prudential tools to
ensure sound lending practices and sound risk management. Should house price increases
continue and cause broader concerns macro-prudential measures (such as loan-to-value
ratios) could be useful. In this regard, further work to build a macro-prudential framework
would be helpful. In the context of limited supply, public policies to support house purchases
may need to be reviewed to avoid putting additional pressures on already high prices.
Regulatory barriers and other disincentives to new housing construction should also be
reviewed.
33.
French banks are significantly exposed to peripheral euro area countries and
are second only to those of German banks. French banks’ total exposure (including other
exposures) to Greece, Ireland, and Portugal

38 percent of Tier 1 capital (excluding Italy,
13 percent) as of April 2011. These data do
not take into account indirect exposures of French banks to peripheral Euro countries. For
instance, Belgian and Portuguese banks’ exposures to Greece reached 14 and 9 percent of
Tier 1 capital, respectively, according to last year’s CEBS stress test. The extent of spillover
effects from a widening of the sovereign debt crisis depends on the related impact on the
corporate and banking sectors in these countries.11 French banks also have large global
banking and capital markets activities. The major groups have subsidiaries in Russia and
other Central and Eastern European countries, Turkey, and North Africa. These operations
constitute an outward spillover channel from France to the rest of the world.
1/ Other exposures data are from the BIS and include the positive market value of derivatives,

2/ Other exposures data not available for Italy.

34.
Comprehensive, stringent, and transparent stress tests should help reduce
uncertainty about asset quality and sovereign risk. The 2010 Committee of European
Banking Supervisors stress tests found that adverse shocks would lead to a limited reduction
in the Tier 1 capital of the four largest French banks of 0.5–0.7 percentage points relative to

28
their starting level at end-2009. The European Banking Authority (EBA) is coordinating new
stress tests of the major European banks and publication of the results is expected in mid2011. The stress tests will assess credit and market risks of the banks under hypothetical
adverse economic conditions in 2011–12 with a special focus on sovereign risk. Results from
national stress tests undertaken by the French authorities and shown to the mission indicate
that the French banking system is resilient to shocks that could emerge from direct exposures
to European crisis countries. Indirect effects, however, are not taken into account and may
pose additional downside risks. The forthcoming FSAP will provide an opportunity to further
review the resilience of the French banking system to a wide range of shocks in light of the
vulnerabilities identified above.
35.
The authorities continue to adapt the supervisory framework. The unification of
banking and insurance supervision and the addition of a consumer protection mandate in the
Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel, and the creation of a national systemic risk board (Conseil
de Régulation Financière et du Risque Systémique) have further strengthened the supervisory
arrangements in France. The newly created European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) and
European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) will have additional benefits for the operating
environment.
36.
Going forward, French banks will need to reduce their reliance on short-term
wholesale funding. Options include increasing deposits, especially for banks that are not
part of mutual groups, and acquisitions. In the shorter-term and depending on market
conditions, banks can improve their liquidity position by lengthening maturities when
refinancing existing debt. In addition, further reducing legacy assets would not only improve
asset quality but also raise cash.
37.
On liquidity rules, a number of calibration issues remain to be decided at the
international or European level. Basel III liquidity requirements, still being worked out,
point to some notable differences with current liquidity rules set by the Banque de France,
which would require French banks to raise additional liquidity. For instance, off-balance
sheet commitments under the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) carry a 100 percent
factor compared to 5 percent under current French rules. Another operational issue is that the
Basel III Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) will require additional liquidity for French banks
because of their practice to book life assurance products—42 percent of overall household
financial investments at end-2009—in their insurance arms rather than having these longterm deposits on their balance sheets. The Basel Committee will use the observation period
in place until 2013 to perform quantitative impact studies based on country submissions to
determine whether any recalibration is needed.
38.
French banks should adapt swiftly to emerging international capital adequacy
regulations. Major French banks have increased their capital since the crisis but capital
levels need to increase further to reach Basel III levels. Banks and the supervisor agree on a
timetable to reach Basel III capital levels by 2013/14, and supervisors should continue to

29
ensure that the banks implement their announced capital augmentation programs. Frontrunning the Basel III capital targets, both in timing and magnitude, would add to the
credibility of the process, and reduce potential downside risks from the direct and indirect
exposures to European program countries. Also, France’s major banks are large and of global
systemic importance (G-SIFIs). Ongoing international discussions point to the need to
mitigate systemic risk through tailored and internationally consistent measures.12
39.
With key parameters of regulatory reform still to be defined, France should play
a constructive role in the international and European debate (Box 8). A range of rules
under Basel III, in particular on liquidity, as well as the prospective Capital Requirement
Directive 4 (CRD4)—the transposition of Basel III to the EU level—remain to be agreed
upon. CRD4 should implement Basel III swiftly and without exceptions with capital
requirements set ambitiously high to reflect prevailing balance sheet uncertainties, a high
degree of interconnectedness and the lack of an effective resolution framework for banks
operating cross-border. Capital regulations must also be sufficiently flexible to allow for the
introduction of macro-prudential tools to mitigate systemic risk. International collaboration
between macro-prudential bodies will be important to ensure home-host coordination and
reciprocity where appropriate. As an important party in these debates, France should work
toward an ambitious package of international reform along these lines, and thus help achieve
early clarity for the French financial sector on the nature and scope of future regulations.
Authorities’ views
40.
The authorities supported improving global and European regulatory standards.
They stressed that the Basel III capital standards constitute a significant advance that
harmonizes the definition of regulatory capital and strengthens the prudential framework for
banks, thereby helping to avoid the significant costs of financial crises. However, they also
emphasized the key role of supervisory arrangements, the importance of an internationally
level playing field, and the need for sufficient phase-in time to allow systems to adapt
without excessive economic costs. Regarding globally systemically important financial
institutions, they remain actively involved in the ongoing international discussions.

12

Measures would include: (i) a methodology for assessing systemic importance based on size,
interconnectedness, lack of substitutability, global (cross-jurisdictional) activity, and complexity; (ii) an
additional Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital requirement ranging from 1 percent to 2.5 percent, depending
on a bank's systemic importance, and an additional 1 percent capital surcharge to provide a disincentive for
banks facing the highest charge to increase materially their global systemic importance in the future; and (iii)
phase-in arrangements in parallel with the Basel III capital conservation and countercyclical buffers between
January 1, 2016 and year-end 2018.

30
Box 8. Financial Sector Reform
France is actively involved in the major initiatives to reform the financial sector in the
aftermath of the global financial crisis. One of the key priorities of the French presidency of
the G20 is to strengthening financial oversight. In addition to EU regulatory bodies, France is
also a member of the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision and the Financial Stability
Board (FSB).
At the national level, the French authorities have adopted a number of key measures.


A new supervisory structure to respond to the need for systemic supervision, the Autorité
de Contrôle Prudentiel, was established in 2010 by merging banking and insurance
supervision, licensing, and consumer protection.



The Conseil de Régulation Financière et du Risque Systémique also created in 2010 is one
of the first systemic board to be created in Europe and includes all relevant supervisors
and government bodies, as well as independent board members. Its main role is to improve
cooperation between the relevant regulatory bodies and strengthen financial stability
oversight.



One-time taxes on bonuses granted in 2009 were introduced, and G20 recommendations
for sound compensation practices implemented. France is also planning to impose a
financial levy to protect taxpayers for the costs of future potential financial crises.

At a multilateral level, progress has been made on the regulatory front but important
steps with implications for the French financial system remain outstanding. The FSB and
Basel Committee have adopted stricter rules for banks on capital and liquidity, to be
implemented over the next several years. Key outstanding issues include measures to:


Limit the risks from global systemically important financial institutions;



Calibrate the proposed liquidity requirements under Basel III;



Set a high common bar for minimum capital requirements that minimizes the scope for
regulatory arbitrage in the EU Capital Requirements Directive (CRD4) that will translate
Basel III for the EU; and



Establish a European framework for crisis prevention, management, and deposit insurance,
with a European Resolution Authoritiy backed by an area-wide fiscal backstop.

41.
The authorities agreed that house prices were relatively high but stressed that
the risk of negative fallout from a correction in the property market were low, given
sound lending practices and intrusive banking supervision. They noted that the systemic risk
board (Conseil de Régulation Financière et du Risque Systémique) is a useful forum for all
relevant supervisors and government bodies to continue monitoring property market
developments, and consider tools, including macro prudential ones, to manage associated
risks.

C. Promoting Inclusive Growth
42.
Lifting inclusive trend growth will have significant effects on living standards
and fiscal sustainability. To this end, a comprehensive strategy is needed that shifts
incentives in the economy towards work, investment in more productive activities, and
innovation. Staff estimates suggest that further labor and product market reforms that would
bring France in line with best practices could raise growth by about ¾ percent per year over
the medium term.
Strengthening competitiveness
43.
Strengthening the competitiveness of the French economy is an important
ingredient in a growth strategy. Like most advanced economies, France has experienced a
decline in foreign market shares over the last decade as emerging market economies have
expanded their presence on world markets. However, French export performance over last
decade also lagged compared to its main competitors while relatively few new products gain
market share. The overall exchange rate assessment based on CGER methodologies suggests
that there may indeed be some real effective exchange rate overvaluation. This is driven in
part by the dynamics of euro, but it also indicates the need for wage moderation and cost
containment. In addition, non-price factors have been significant in explaining French export
performance until the crisis when demand factors became dominant. Restoring
competitiveness along these dimensions calls for promoting innovation and creating
favorable conditions for business to better penetrate growth markets and sectors.

44.
Efforts to foster innovation should be pursued in a cost-effective manner. The tax
credit for research and development activities (Crédit Impôt Recherche) provides generous
incentives and the Grand Emprunt supports a variety of university-based and other research
efforts. While spurring innovation has the potential to increase competitiveness and growth,
the cost effectiveness of these measures needs to be evaluated within an appropriate time
frame. In addition, other obstacles to innovation should be evaluated, such as those possibly
arising from the relative paucity of medium-sized firms.
45.
Restoring competitiveness and achieving higher potential growth will also
require policies to improve competition, notably in the service sector. Welcome steps
have been taken to increase competition in the electricity, telecommunications, and retail
sectors but the regulation of product and services markets remains more restrictive in France
than in many other countries.13 Notably, professional services have become more regulated
over the past decade, in contrast with the deregulation of this sector in most other advanced
countries. France is transposing the EU services directive into national law, but has—like
other European countries—not yet fully done so. The activities of the Competition Authority
should be focused on areas where progress has so far been limited. Increasing competition in
the services sector, in particular professional services, would contribute significantly to
productivity growth in the whole economy and to job creation. Empirical studies estimate
that if France aligned its regulation to best practices in the OECD, the long-run employment
rate would increase by 1.2 percentage point and multifactor productivity would increase by
between 0.2 and 0.6 percent per year over the medium term.14

Tax Reform
46.
Closer EU integration and globalization have led to pressures to reform France’s
labor and business income taxation. Last year’s reform of the local business tax (taxe
professionnelle) is an important first step but staff noted that a more comprehensive tax
overhaul to improve incentives for employment and growth is warranted. The main concerns
include: (i) a still high labor tax wedge at the average wage level, due to a heavy reliance on
social security contributions, which hampers job creation and participation; (ii) a relatively
high corporate tax rate faced by firms which do not benefit from special allowances and
incentives; and (iii) the bias of the present system toward certain sources of finance and
sectors, which is prone to encourage excessive financial leverage, contribute to a dearth of
equity financing for innovative projects, and discourage firms’ growth. A reform that offsets
tax cuts by base broadening and improved compliance, including through the removal of the
least efficient tax expenditures, would ensure that growth-friendly tax reforms support fiscal
consolidation.15
47.
Reducing high tax wedges could decrease aggregate unemployment and boost
employment prospects. France’s welfare arrangements require a relatively high level of
social security contributions and social welfare taxes, resulting in the fourth-highest tax
wedge for singles in the OECD. Empirical studies for EU countries find that a high tax
wedge increases unemployment by reducing incentives for formal sector employment and by
inducing higher wage claims by unions.16 A reduction in labor taxes by 1 percentage point
could lower unemployment by 0.3 percentage points. The impact of the tax wedge on
unemployment is even higher when high and long-lasting unemployment benefits―as
present in France―further reduce incentives for job search.
48.
To maximize labor supply dividends, a reform of the tax-benefit system could
target work incentives for elderly workers and women with school-age children. The
participation rate of workers aged 55–64 years in France is the lowest among advanced
countries; and while the employment rate of prime-aged women (30–54 years) has increased
in line with that of other OECD countries, French women’s mean hours worked have
declined markedly since the late 1970s. The U.S. experience illustrates the scope for a supply
response, with almost a quarter of the increase in hours worked between 1977 and 2007
explained by higher participation of older workers (55–74 years) and about 10 percent by
higher hours worked of employed prime-aged women.17 Work incentives targeted at these

35
high labor supply margins are likely to be most effective and cost-efficient.18 They can be
implemented by making earned income tax credits more generous for older workers (as in
the Netherlands) and for women with school-aged children. Alternatively, employers could
receive special credits for social security contributions paid for these categories of workers.
Based on the experience of other EU countries, further increases in the retirement age to
ensure long-term equilibrium of the pension system could also have a favorable impact on
labor force participation.19
49.
A corporate tax reform that reduces the statutory rate along with base
broadening would make the system fairer and simpler, and deter profit- and
investment-shifting. Staff noted that the relatively large elasticity of profit shifting offers an
argument in favor of harmonization and, in this context, welcomed the authorities’ intention
to seek convergence with Germany.20 A lower statutory rate across the board would reduce
the need for special rates and tax treatment, e.g. for SMEs and innovative firms, and reduced
complexity would make the system less biased against small firms which do not have the
resources to engage in extensive tax planning and fiscal engineering. Reducing the debt bias
from interest deductibility would facilitate banks’ deleveraging and promote greater reliance
on equity finance (which could ultimately boost innovative investments).
Labor Market Reforms
50.
Labor market policies should focus on re-absorbing the unemployed and on
increasing labor force participation.


Further strengthening activation policies and the unified job placement agency (Pôle
Emploi) would better support the unemployed in their job search and broaden training
opportunities, and should be accompanied by strict enforcement of job-search
requirements. Efforts to foster apprenticeship programs are well placed. In addition to
reducing the labor-tax wedge, consideration should be given to easing the high

18

Simulations of a tax benefit model for the U.K. find that the overall hours elasticity for the age 30–54 group
(i.e., the decrease in hours worked in response to a 1 percent increase in implicit tax rates) ranges from 0.3 to
0.44. Women with children have higher elasticities of around 0.5 on average. See Blundell, R., 2010, Tax by
Design: The Mirrlees Review, Earnings Taxation and Work Incentives, available at www.ifs.org.uk.

19

According to simulations for the Netherlands, increasing the retirement age by 3 years could raise the
employment rate by 1.6 percent and the labor supply by 0.8 percent. See Euwals, R., R. de Mooij, and D. van
Vuuren, 2009, “Rethinking Retirement: from Participation towards Allocation,” No. 80, CPB Netherlands
Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis.

20

Germany’s 2008 corporate tax reform is estimated to have lowered the tax burden on corporations by about 9
percentage points to below 30 percent, boosting its attractiveness as a location for enterprises. The reform has
also reduced complexity and the unintentional heterogeneity of the tax burden across firms.

36
employment protection, in order to entice firms to create more jobs.21 Reducing the
comparatively long duration of unemployment benefits or a lowering of the benefit
level over time could strengthen incentives for job search and increase the effective
labor supply.


Policies to draw young and low-skilled workers into the labor force should be stepped
up. The high minimum wage (SMIC)22 bars especially young and low-skilled workers
from employment. Tax relief and reduced social contributions have lowered the labor
cost for low-skilled workers and halted the decline in their share in total employment.
Also, over the past 5 years, the authorities have not granted discretionary increases in
the SMIC (coup de pouce), thereby increasing the distance between minimum and
median wages. Because the SMIC is indexed on inflation, the progress achieved
could be jeopardized by current inflationary pressures, especially in light of an
overall wage moderation led by the wage freeze for civil servants. Hence, the
indexation formula of the SMIC should be reviewed.



The phasing out of pre-retirement benefits, relaxation of constraints on combining
employment and retirement benefits, and pension reform have succeeded in lifting the
labor force participation of seniors, despite the crisis. However, the participation rate
of seniors remains one of the lowest in Europe and efforts in this area should
continue.23

Authorities’ views
51.
The authorities broadly agreed with the need for structural reform to boost
competitiveness and growth but cautioned that the political environment is not always
conducive. They were convinced of the large growth potential of measures to stimulate
innovation and agreed that the cost effectiveness of current policies will need to be
evaluated. The authorities reiterated their commitment to transpose the EU Services
Directive into French law, indicating that the sectoral approach taken requires time and that
liberalization of regulated services can be politically challenging. Although there are signs
that labor market reforms are starting to bear fruit, it is difficult to assess their contribution to
the rebound in
21

COE Rexecode, “Mettre un terme à la divergence de compétitivité entre la France et l’Allemagne,” January
2011, notes that as a result of relatively high labor costs and labor market rigidities, French firms are reluctant to
grow and the average French firm employs just 14 people compared with 35 in Germany.

22

The SMIC was increased in January 2011 to€9 per hour (€1,365 gross or €1,073 net for a 35 hour work
week).

23

The labor force participation rate of senior workers (55 to 64 years) increased despite the crisis from
38.1 percent at end-2007 to 40.3 percent in early 2011.The average participation rate of seniors is 46.5 percent
in the European Union and 46.0 percent in the Euro area.

employment during the recovery. While acknowledging the need for reforming
unemployment benefit schemes, the authorities stressed the political difficulties in doing so.
52.
The authorities concurred with the need to modernize the tax system, although
they were cautious on the timing of a broad-based reform in the midst of fiscal
consolidation. They also noted the limited scope for further decreasing the tax wedge for
low-wage earners, and were doubtful that a reduced tax wedge for mostly higher-earning
workers would have a large impact on employment and growth. However, they reaffirmed
their commitment to lifting tax obstacles to competitiveness, in particular through seeking
increased harmonization of the corporate tax base and statutory tax rates with Germany and
other European countries.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
53.
Supportive policy measures and key reforms contributed to a gradual recovery
from the crisis. The French economy started to expand in mid-2009, and 2011 outcomes to
date surprised on the upside. Unemployment remains a problem, but employment is
increasing and confidence also benefited from stronger activity in core Europe. Adoption of a
key pension reform in 2010 and earlier structural measures to increase labor supply are
starting to bear fruit. Macroeconomic risks remain, however, amid lingering problems on
European sovereign debt markets, and uncertainty about energy and commodity prices.
54.
The fiscal stimulus during the crisis was appropriate but debt sustainability and
market perception now call for credible consolidation. The impact of the crisis weakened
France’s fiscal position, bringing the debt burden to above 80 percent of GDP, and debt
servicing costs to about 2½ percent of GDP in 2010. As an AAA-rated country, France’s
fiscal position remains subject to high scrutiny, while the rating itself is an important factor
for keeping borrowing costs low. French banks’ strong exposures to some of the euro area
crisis countries have renewed market attention to French sovereign debt. Against this
background, a broad consensus among policy makers in support of consolidation has
emerged.
55.
The consolidation targets set out in France’s Stability Program and the 2011–14
multi-year budget framework strike the right balance between speed and sustainability.
The fiscal outcome in 2010 was better than foreseen and a sizeable upfront adjustment is
being made in 2011 to restore healthy public finances. Preparing specific contingency
measures is important to ensure reaching the 2012–14 fiscal targets in case growth is less
strong or spending of local governments and social security is more buoyant than foreseen by
the authorities. Achieving the fiscal targets and further entitlement reform are important to
lower the public debt to 60 percent of GDP by the middle of the next decade. A fiscal rule
currently debated in the Senate would help to unequivocally signal the authorities’
commitment to the adjustment path. Other measures, such as using independently prepared

39
growth forecasts to estimate future adjustment needs, or establishing an independent fiscal
council would further support the credibility of the adjustment path.
56.
The French banking sector has overcome most of the crisis legacies and has
returned to strong profitability. Stress tests undertaken by the French authorities and
shared with the mission attest to the overall resilience of the system, including to shocks that
could emerge from exposures to European crisis countries. The unification of banking and
insurance supervision and the addition of a consumer protection mandate in the Autorité de
Contrôle Prudentiee (ACP) and the creation of a national systemic risk board have further
strengthened the supervisory arrangements in France. The newly created European
Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) and the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) will have
additional benefits for the operating environment.
57.
Financial stability risks linked to rapid house price increases seem at this stage
contained but vigilance is required. House prices in France increased rapidly over the past
year, particularly in urban areas where supply remains constrained. While low household
debt and conservative lending practices limit risks, supervisors should continue to use
appropriate micro-prudential tools. Should house price increases continue and cause broader
concerns, the authorities’ intention to use macro-prudential tools is appropriate. In the
context of limited supply, public policies to support house purchases may need to be phased
out. Regulatory barriers and other disincentives to new housing construction should also be
reviewed.
58.
French banks should adapt swiftly to emerging international regulations. All
French banks have increased capital since the crisis. But capital levels need to increase
further, and should reach Basel III levels by 2013/14, a timeframe well before the end of the
phase-in period, but nevertheless sufficiently long to avoid excessively negative impact on
lending. Both banks and the supervisor support this timetable; the supervisor should continue
to ensure that banks implement their announced capital augmentation plans. Liquidity risk
should be limited by reducing reliance on wholesale funding markets. France’s major banks
are large and of global systemic importance. Ongoing international discussions point to the
need to mitigate systemic risk through tailored and internationally consistent measures,
including capital surcharges.
59.
Broad efforts are needed to increase employment, especially for the young,
unskilled, and senior workers. Structural unemployment remains high and, in the context of
falling unemployment, renewed emphasis should be placed on addressing the particular
problems of groups with the highest levels of unemployment, including through targeted job
search support and training opportunities. While the employment of seniors has increased,
efforts to further lift the participation rate of senior workers should be sustained. Continued
minimum wage moderation would support employment creation. Further modernization of
the French tax system could reduce reliance on labor based taxes and help increase labor
demand.

40
60.
The medium-term prospects for the French economy depend on improved
competitiveness. Exchange rate based measures of competitiveness suggest only a minor
overvaluation, driven in part by the dynamics of the euro. Yet, the world market share of
French exports has been declining and comparatively few new French products gain market
share. A multipronged strategy is needed to improve competitiveness of the economy and lift
potential growth, including through keeping real wage increases in line with productivity
improvements, increasing labor market participation and raising productivity growth. Critical
elements of a growth strategy are already under way, in particular in supporting innovation.
Fostering more competition in growth-critical services would increase potential growth.
61.
It is proposed that the next Article IV should be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

IMF Country Report
No. 01/196, 11/05/01

Fiscal Transparency—Update

IMF Country Report
No. 04/345, 11/03/04

Summary: The report found that France has achieved a high level of fiscal transparency and
has introduced a number of improvements in coverage and presentation of fiscal information.
Notable areas of progress include the development in the final accounts publication to
include more complete information on government assets and liabilities as well as disclosure
of contingent liabilities. Accounting standards have been changed to reflect accruals
principles in a number of areas, and these standards are clearly explained. The staff suggested
that further steps could be taken to identify and report quasi-fiscal activities in the budget
presentation, provide a more consolidated picture of fiscal activity outside the appropriation
process, and improve the reconciliation of stated policies with outcomes at the general
government level.
These issues have been addressed in the Loi organique aux lois de finance (LOLF), which
has become fully effective on January 1, 2006. In addition to the annual appropriations, the
first multi-annual fiscal framework law was adopted in January 2009, and contains fiscal
objectives for the period 2009–12. The budget is organized along missions and provides

5
details on the level of appropriations for each mission and performance indicators by which
the expected results of the mission will be assessed ex post. The State Audit Office has been
given the new assignment of certifying the public accounts, and implementation of accrualsbasis accounting has been confirmed. Parliamentary oversight powers have been
strengthened.

Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies—Update

IMF Country Report
No. 02/248, 11/13/02

Summary: The 2000 ROSC noticed that transparency of financial policies is accorded a high
priority by all financial agencies assessed, and they are in observance of the good practices of
the Code of Good Practices on Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies. The major
agencies disclose their objectives, their legal and institutional frameworks, and have open
processes of policymaking and regulation. The principles of transparency are observed by
dissemination of relevant information to the public and in the agencies’ arrangements for
internal conduct, integrity, and accountability. However, the staff noted that the framework
for supervision and regulation applicable to mutual insurance firms is not as well defined and
suggested to improve its transparency. The transparency of monetary policy was not assessed
by the Fund team as the Banque de France is a member of the European System of Central
Banks and no longer conducts independent monetary policy.
Subsequently, the framework for supervision and regulation applicable to a specific group of
mutual insurance firms was modified in a number of steps. In August 2003, legislation
created a single supervisory body, the Commission de Contrôle des Assurances, Mutuelles et
Institutions de Prévoyance (CCAMIP) by merging the regular insurance supervisor (CCA)
and mutualities’ supervisor (CCMIP). Coordination with the banking sector supervisors was
strengthened and the powers of the supervisory authorities extended.

Summary: The report found that France is in observance of the Fund’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS). In particular, the mandate of INSEE and the Banque de
France for the production of the six macroeconomic datasets is clearly defined, with the
reporting burden and the confidentiality provisions given special consideration notably
through the CNIS. Professionalism is central to the statistical operations of the two
institutions, internationally and/or European accepted methodologies are generally followed,
the degree of accuracy and reliability of the six datasets is remarkable, statistics are relevant
and provided on a timely basis, and they are accessible to the public.
The report made a number of suggestions for further improvements: the responsibility of
INSEE as the producer of government finance statistics should be clarified; data sharing
between the Banque de France and the rest of the French statistical system improved;
classification and valuation methods in balance-of-payments statistics reviewed; consistency
between the current account of the balance of payments and the goods and services account
in the national accounts improved; the timing of revisions in the quarterly and annual
national accounts aligned; and identification of data production units of INSEE facilitated.
France continues to implement several of the 2003 ROSC Data Module recommendations,
including by promoting a broader understanding of statistical data revisions, making greater
use of firm-level data to improve the measurement of changes in stocks, and intensifying
work on portfolio investment income with the objective of starting to record those
transactions on an accrual basis.

Summary: The report concluded that France’s financial sector is strong and well supervised.
No weaknesses that could cause systemic risks were identified. The strength of the system is
supported by the financial soundness indicators and the strong conformity to the supervisory
and regulatory standards approved by the Basel Committee, IAIS, IOSCO, FATF, and CPSS.

7
The degree of observance of the transparency code is high in all relevant areas. The French
banking sector has been modernized and restructured over the past two decades and is well
capitalized. Systemic vulnerabilities in the important insurance sector are well contained.
Securities markets are large and sophisticated.
Notwithstanding the strengths of the French financial sector, a number of issues emerged
from the FSAP, including (i) concentration in banking may have reached a point where
further consolidation could intensify concerns over the scope for collusion and long-term
stability where many banks could be considered “too big to fail;” (ii) banks’ large and
growing portfolios of fixed-rate residential housing loans could represent a longer-term risk
in the event of large increases in funding costs and/or a significant fall in real estate prices;
(iii) some administered savings schemes and other policy measures give rise to costs and
impede financial market innovation. These schemes are not well targeted to achieve intended
social goals and are not well aligned with current priorities, such as strengthening the pension
system; (iv) the banking system’s rapid accumulation of capital strengthens banks’ resilience.
This accumulation is harder to control for mutual banks, given their legal restrictions on
remuneration of their members. And, for all banks, it could encourage expansion through
expensive takeovers and risky new ventures; (v) the supervisory system of the financial
sector is composed of specialized segments. Coordination mechanisms need to be further
adapted. Additional steps should be considered in the future as cross-sectoral financial
groups become more prevalent; (vi) the consolidation of the French stock and futures
markets with others in Europe has increased the importance of effective cooperation across
national jurisdictions. Moreover, the authorities face the challenge of adjusting to and
effectively implementing the significant regulatory overhaul that took place in late 2003; and
(vii) the infrastructure for the clearing and settlement of payments and securities is generally
sound and modern. However, there is some room for improvement in the clearing and
settlement of retail payments and securities, where the multilateral netting systems lack fully
adequate safeguards to ensure timely settlement in case of default.

8
ANNEX II. FRANCE: STATISTICAL ISSUES
The economic database is comprehensive and of high quality, and data provision to the Fund
is adequate for surveillance. The authorities regularly publish a full range of economic and
financial data, and calendar dates of main statistical releases are also provided. France
subscribes to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. The transmission of data in
electronic form from INSEE (Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques)
and the profusion of data from various institutions (Banque de France, INSEE, ministry of
finance, ministry of labor and solidarity) have helped to build an infrastructure, in which all
data can be easily accessed through the Economic Data Sharing System. A data ROSC
mission conducted an assessment of the statistical system in March 2003, and the report was
published in October 2003. A factual update to the main report was published in November
2004.
France’s monetary and banking statistics methodology conforms with the European Central
Bank framework, which provides comparable details as the Standardized Report Forms
developed by STA. Statistics for International Financial Statistics on banking institutions
and monetary aggregates are prepared on a monthly basis and are timely. Monetary data are
also disseminated in the quarterly IFS Supplement on monetary and financial statistics.
France follows the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts 1995 (ESA95). Data
for GDP and its expenditure components are available from 1978 onwards. Both annual and
quarterly accounts provide reliable information, although estimates from the two accounts
differ slightly before the quarterly accounts are revised to be aligned to the annual ones. In
2005, national accounts estimates were rebased to 2000 prices.
Government finance statistics have been strengthened recently. Both central and general
government data are presented in a more comprehensive fashion than previously and the data
for 2006 and 2007 also reflect the various impacts of recent budgetary reform. Although the
source data is collected by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, INSEE is principally
responsible for the compilation and dissemination of fiscal data in a framework that is
consistent with ESA95. INSEE’s website has recently been enhanced; in particular, it
includes expenditure tables and government revenues by subsector (central government,
miscellaneous central government agencies, local governments, and social security
administration).
Balance-of-payments statistics should be interpreted with caution, given large errors and
omissions. Greater coherence between the external current account and the rest of the world
account in the national accounts is needed. In this regard, work with promising early results
has been undertaken on the transportation account.

Following stronger-than-foreseen activity in early 2011, growth appears to have
weakened over the second quarter. Incoming data indicate a slowdown in household
consumption and industrial production as well as weaker business confidence. Meanwhile,
annual headline inflation rose to 2.1 percent in June, mainly reflecting higher food prices.
Staff has revised 2011 real GDP growth to 2.0 percent from 2.1 percent, reflecting an official
downward revision of first quarter growth by 0.1 percent.

to the 5-percent threshold.



A draft bill to incorporate a national fiscal rule in the constitution has been approved
by Parliament on July 13. However, the draft law will require either a three-fifths
majority vote by Congress or a national referendum vote, both to be called by the
President, to enter into force.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with France
On July 25, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with France.1
Background
The gradual recovery of the French economy is progressing, with growth in 2011 expected to be
around 2 percent. Although the unemployment rate remains high at 9½ percent, employment
has been increasing and confidence benefited from stronger activity in core Europe. Growth in
early 2011 was led by robust private consumption and stock-building, and supported by a
recovery in investment, although net exports have remained lackluster. An unsettled external
environment continues to pose risks, especially related to possible spillovers from lingering euro
area sovereign debt problems, and uncertainty about energy prices.
A sizeable fiscal consolidation has been set in motion. The fiscal deficit in 2010 was 7.1 percent,
better than foreseen, and a sizeable upfront adjustment is being made in 2011 to restore
sustainable public finances. The overall budget deficit is to be reduced to 3 percent of Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) by 2013 and 2 percent of GDP by 2014. The planned adjustment is to
be implemented through binding multi-year restrictions on more than three-quarters of central
government expenditures and minimum yearly targets for the reduction in tax expenditures. The
ability to achieve the targeted adjustment also hinges on the pace of the economic recovery,
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
and more efforts might be needed to achieve the 2012–13 targets if actual growth outcomes fall
short of the authorities’ projections.
The French banking sector has overcome most of the crisis legacies and has returned to strong
profitability. Bank capital remains below some European peers, but is increasing, and the major
French banks should be able to meet the Basel III capital requirements by 2013/14. At the same
time, the large French banks remain highly reliant on wholesale funding and exposed to
peripheral Euro countries. Institutional reforms, including the unification of banking and
insurance supervision and inclusion of consumer protection mandates, as well the creation of a
national systemic risk board have further strengthened the supervisory arrangements in France,
which will also benefit from the ongoing European reforms aimed at strengthening cross-border
elements of supervision. House prices in France increased rapidly over the past year, but
financial stability risks linked to rapid house price increases seem at this stage contained.
Going forward, France is challenged to lift potential growth and reduce unemployment, in
particular the lack of jobs for young, unskilled, and senior workers. The reduction in
unemployment is, in part, due to labor market reforms. A number of government programs
provide incentives for education and innovation. Efforts are also under way to improve
competition in product and services markets where progress remains limited.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that supportive policy measures and key reforms in the pension
system and labor market have underpinned a gradual, more broad-based recovery.
Consumption has been robust, investment has picked up, and employment is rising. Directors
noted that, while the economic outlook is favorable, risks are tilted to the downside, amid the
sovereign debt crisis in the euro area, and uncertainty about energy and commodity prices. The
main policy priorities are to restore fiscal sustainability, safeguard financial sector stability, and
reduce unemployment. At the same time, it is important to build on the momentum of structural
reforms to promote competitiveness and inclusive growth.
Directors stressed that credible fiscal consolidation is necessary for debt sustainability. They
agreed that the consolidation targets set out in France’s Stability Program and the 2011–14
multi-year budget framework strike the right balance between growth and sustainability
considerations, with front-loaded and expenditures-based measures. Directors recommended
preparing specific contingency measures in case growth outcomes fall short of expectations,
and using windfall revenue to accelerate deficit and debt reduction. They looked forward to the
enactment of a fiscal rule, signaling France’s commitment to fiscal sustainability. Using
conservative growth forecasts and capping the autonomous spending of local governments and
social security would further enhance the credibility of the adjustment strategy. Directors
encouraged deeper reforms of the pension and health care systems, building on recent
progress.

3
Directors welcomed the overall resilience of the French financial system, as confirmed by stress
tests undertaken by the European Banking Authority. They commended the authorities for
further strengthening supervisory arrangements, particularly the unification of banking and
insurance supervision, the introduction of a consumer protection mandate, and the creation of a
national systemic risk board. While acknowledging that risks related to rapid house price
increases seem contained at this stage, Directors called for continued vigilance, and in this
regard welcomed the authorities’ readiness to take measures as necessary, including macroprudential tools. Directors agreed that banks would benefit from swiftly raising their capital
levels, with the aim of meeting Basel III requirements by 2013/14, ahead of the official
implementation period. Given the global systemic importance of France’s major banks, there is
a need for tailored and internationally consistent measures, including capital surcharges.
Directors welcomed France’s active involvement in the ongoing international debate on financial
regulatory reform.
Directors highlighted the importance of pressing ahead with the structural reform agenda to
boost competitiveness, job creation, and productivity growth. They supported an ambitious
multi-pronged strategy, carefully articulated in light of the ongoing fiscal consolidation. Key
elements should include keeping real wage increases in line with productivity improvements,
increasing labor force participation, and fostering competition in the service sector. Sustained
efforts are also needed to reduce high structural unemployment, focusing on targeted job
search support and training opportunities, and modernization of the tax and benefit systems.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
