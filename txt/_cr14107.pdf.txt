MAURITIUS
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 7, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context: The Mauritian economy has grown steadily despite weak activity in Europe, its
main trading partner. Growth was supported by fiscal stimulus and accommodative
monetary policy. The economy is operating slightly below potential, domestic investment
has fallen, and the planned medium-term fiscal consolidation has been delayed.
Outlook and risks: The economic outlook for 2014 is broadly positive with growth
projected at 3¾ percent and inflation at 4½ percent. The main short-term risk would be
renewed Euro area financial stress; medium-term risks relate to weak future reform efforts.
Fiscal policy: The 2014 fiscal stance is neutral. Staff recommended initiating fiscal
adjustment already in 2014 to smooth the planned medium-term adjustment. Staff projects
debt to be sustainable, but recommended additional medium-term fiscal adjustment
efforts to safely reach the legally-mandated 2018 debt target.
Monetary policy: The moderately accommodative monetary policy is appropriate but
should be forward looking to anticipate inflationary pressures. Excess liquidity has to be
removed to improve the monetary transmission mechanism despite likely, but justified,
losses for the Bank of Mauritius. Staff suggested sharing the cost of monetary policy.
External sustainability: Standard quantitative measures together with a persistently high
current account deficit, weak export performance, and wage growth in excess of
productivity suggest a moderate overvaluation. International reserves appear adequate.
Long-term growth: Staff suggested fiscal adjustment and structural reforms to reduce
external vulnerabilities and improve long-term growth. Reforms to public enterprises, social
safety nets, pensions, local governments, and the general business environment could lift
longer-term growth rates to reach high income status faster than projected.
Financial sector: The financial sector remains well-capitalized and profitable. Stress tests
show a broad resilience of the system. BOM started using macro-prudential tools and is
improving coordination with the nonbank supervisor.

INTRODUCTION
1.
The Mauritian economy has been growing steadily despite weak activity in Europe—
its main trading partner. This resilience has been supported by successive fiscal stimuli together
with increased diversification of export destinations. However, the economy still operates slightly
below potential and domestic investment has been falling. Going forward renewed reform efforts
are needed to accelerate the country’s objective of attaining high-income status. Addressing
infrastructure gaps and enhancing the efficiency of the public sector (particularly state-owned
enterprises, SOEs) would support further productivity gains.
2.
Mauritius’ institutions are among the strongest in Sub-Saharan Africa, and have
been continuously ranked number one by the Mo Ibrahim Foundation. Doing Business
indicators suggest that the country provides an environment that facilitates business and
economic development. The country ranks 12 out of 189 economics in terms of protecting
investors, and has recently improved the ease of getting credit. Its corruption perception score
and transparency are also favorable. Mauritius also ranks high in terms of infrastructure, at 37 for
ground transport and 69 for ICT infrastructure, both out of 140 countries.
3.
Previous recommendations regarding gradual fiscal consolidation were delayed, but
monetary policy was broadly in line with recommendations. Difficult external conditions,
urgent investment needs, and one-off events have delayed medium-term fiscal adjustment in
2013. Monetary policy was moderately accommodative in the context of declining inflation
pressures as recommended, but little progress was made in removing excess liquidity and sharing
the cost of monetary policy. There has been some progress in better targeting social protection,
and improving efficiency of SOEs, but more could be done particularly regarding phasing-out
subsidies and incorporating extra-budgetary (special) funds into the budget.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Economic activity expanded at a moderate pace in 2013 and inflation stayed
subdued, but unemployment remained a concern. Real GDP growth was lower than expected
at 3.1 percent in 2013, mainly due to weak demand for construction, sugar and tourism. With
subdued international prices and despite large public sector wage increases, inflation fell to
3.5 percent. The unemployment rate is estimated to have increased marginally to 8.2 percent.
Moody’s maintained the country’s credit rating at Baa1.
5.
The fiscal policy stance was more expansionary than planned because of one-off
and cyclical factors but also slippages. The structural primary balance excluding grants
(SPBEG)—a measure of the fiscal impulse—deteriorated by over 2 percent of GDP relative to 2012
rather than the planned neutral stance. While revenues in 2013 were broadly unchanged relative
to GDP, expenditures increased by 2 percent of GDP, of which ¾ percent of GDP were related to
the flash floods in Port Louis. There also were unplanned transfers to local governments and

public enterprises. Wages increased as expected by 1 percent of GDP reflecting the
recommendations of the Pay Research Bureau’s (PRB) report, which adjusts wages beyond the
annual inflation adjustment every five years. Also, capital spending including the special funds was
1 percent of GDP higher, partially due to cost overruns. Gross public sector debt reached almost
60 percent of GDP at end-2013 (55 percent of GDP for public debt law purposes).
6.
Monetary policy was somewhat accommodative during 2013, but inflation declined
nevertheless. Pass-through of the public sector wage increases into private sector wages was
limited and inflation expectations remain well anchored; helped by sluggish domestic demand
and low international price pressures. The Bank of Mauritius (BOM) maintained the policy rate at
4.65 percent, following a 25 basis point reduction in June 2013. The nominal effective exchange
rate has been relatively stable (see Figure 1); the rupee depreciated by 0.4 percent in real effective
terms last year.
7.
The trade balance improved slightly, but the current account deficit increased
mainly on account of a decline in service exports. Exports of goods and services increased by
only some 3 percent in dollar terms (tourism receipts dropped by 9 percent related to a slow
European recovery). Imports of goods and services increased marginally by 2 percent. The decline
of net income, particularly from the GBC sector (possibly related to low global interest rates),
contributed to widen the current account deficit from 8 percent of GDP in 2012 to 10 percent in
2013. The BOM accumulated additional net international reserves and the reserve cover of
imports of goods and services remained at 4.4 months at end-2013.
8.
The banking system remained profitable and BOM strengthened macro-prudential
measures. Banks capital—at 14.6 percent of Regulatory Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets
in June 2013—remains, well above Basel II and proposed Basel III requirements. Banks have
remained profitable with 15 percent return on equity, despite low leverage ratios. BOM is
consulting with banks on implementation of Basel III regulations. BOM continued to publish its biannual CAMEL ratings for all domestic banks. Non-performing loans (NPLs) increased slightly to
3.7 percent by June 2013. The BOM implemented macroprudential measures aimed at addressing
emerging NPLs in the construction and real estate sectors as well as rising indebtedness.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
9.
Growth is projected to accelerate modestly in 2014 consistent with an improving
external environment. Staff projects that real GDP growth in 2014 will increase to 3.7 percent,
remaining slightly below potential reflecting still subdued demand from Mauritius’ main markets
and low investment. Growth could turn out stronger if the implementation of the public investment
program is stronger than currently projected or private investment picks up. In subsequent years,
real GDP growth is expected to converge to its medium-term growth potential of about 4 percent.
CPI inflation is projected to accelerate to 4.5 percent in 2014, still below the traditional implicit
inflation target of 5 percent. The current account deficit is projected to narrow gradually, falling to
about 6½ percent of GDP by 2019, reflecting reforms to improve external competitiveness.
10.
While fiscal consolidation has been delayed, debt related risks appear manageable.
After expenditure increases in 2013, the 2014 budget keeps spending at historically high levels,
above the levels consistent with achieving the 2018 debt limit. However, the medium-term budget
includes fiscal adjustment starting in 2014. While the public debt stock, at around 60 percent of GDP
in gross, undiscounted terms, is somewhat high for an emerging economy, exposure to risks are
limited by the debt profile—low external debt, generally from multi- and bilateral sources (financed
at long maturities and favorable interest rates) and a relatively well developed domestic financial
market. Key risks relate to the ability to achieve the targeted medium-term fiscal adjustment and the
need to resist spending pressures ahead of elections scheduled for 2015.
11.
A protracted period of slower growth in Europe could reduce growth (see Risk
Assessment Matrix, Table 7). The main linkages to Mauritius would be through reduced tourism,
trade, and FDI inflows. In addition, the persistently large current account deficit is a vulnerability. In
both cases, relying on the flexible exchange rate regime should be helpful. Capital and financial
flows into Mauritius have been stable compared with larger emerging markets that were affected by
the emerging market volatility in 2013 and early 2014. Other international financial flows are an
additional source of vulnerability, as large capital flows linked in large part to the GBCs could prove
to be more volatile than historically although the impact on the real economy appears small. A
revision of the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) with India should have a moderate
impact on growth and capital flows in part because there already has been some reorientation of
GBC flows towards Africa.
12.
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s assessment of the outlook and
associated risks and policy options. They believe a higher growth rate is possible over the medium
term, but they are cognizant of the need to advance structural reforms and initiate fiscal
consolidation to improve growth prospects and reduce external imbalances.

MACROECONOMIC POLICIES FOR 2014
Discussions centered on the appropriate stance of fiscal policy from a cyclical and medium-term
perspective; risks to the inflation outlook and the related monetary policy stance; and
improvements to the monetary policy framework in preparation for a move to more formal
inflation targeting.

A.

Fiscal Policy

13.
The 2014 fiscal policy stance is projected to be broadly neutral, with historically high
spending. While the fiscal stance presented in the budget document is expansionary, staff projects
that with the public investment program and contingency reserve implemented at historical levels
the overall deficit and structural primary balance excluding grants would be largely unchanged
(Figure 2). The budget aims to support employment and economic growth, expand social safety
nets, advance the public infrastructure program, and foster the activities of emerging sectors of the
economy. Domestic revenue will increase marginally, supported by new revenue measures on
excises on cars and tobacco and expected dividend payments from SOEs. Current spending would
remain at broadly the same level, with lower transfers offsetting a small wage increase related to the
PRB. Total investment spending would increase somewhat, due to a ½ percent of GDP increase in
net spending from the special funds. Fiscal adjustment is now postponed into 2015—an election
year.
14.
Staff suggested advancing some fiscal consolidation into 2014. Delaying fiscal
adjustment into 2015 as currently planned will make it harder to achieve the primary fiscal balances
needed to address external imbalances, and reduce debt vulnerabilities. In fact, staff currently
projects debt to be on a declining path, but that the 2018 debt law target of 50 percent of GDP
would be missed. Moreover, fiscal adjustment has been postponed in previous years already. Thus,
staff recommended reducing the fiscal deficit already in 2014 through reducing transfers to SOEs,
further restricting recourse to the contingency reserve, and limiting spending from the special funds.
Given the low fiscal multipliers in a small open economy, the output cost should be marginal and
this would help to smooth and achieve the needed adjustment over time.
15.
Should the external environment deteriorate significantly it would be appropriate to
let automatic stabilizers work. The experience from the global financial crisis showed that this
could be quite effective and growth did not decline as much as in other countries. Also, staff
recommended including all extra-budgetary funds in the budget to increase fiscal transparency and
better measure the fiscal stance. In addition, passing the new Public Financial Management (PFM)
Act, which has been developed with Fund technical assistance, should alleviate some of the budget
execution difficulties that have led the authorities to create the special funds.

16.
The authorities agreed with the staff’s analysis, but explained that it would be difficult
to limit spending in 2014. They pointed out that a substantial part of the deficit is related to
urgent capital spending. They also reasoned that a large part of spending was relatively rigid and
would be difficult to reduce, particularly given the electoral calendar. They also explained that the
wage bill would decline gradually until the next PRB decision in every three years, which should
moderate wage spending. They also reaffirmed their commitment to reach the 2018 debt targets. In
the meantime the authorities are working to identify efficiency savings in the area of social
protection (together with the World Bank) and SOEs (with AFRITAC South).

B.

Monetary Policy

17.
The current somewhat accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate, but
inflationary expectations and external developments should be monitored in a forward
looking framework. While inflation expectations appear to be well-anchored according to inflation
surveys, pressures may arise from: higher imported prices (fuel or food); via exchange rate passthrough; or adjustments of administrated prices. Staff currently forecasts headline inflation to
remain below the traditional implicit inflation target of 5 percent in 2014. However, the authorities
should stand ready to tighten monetary conditions if inflation accelerates, initially through the
removal of excess liquidity, which should be done irrespectively (see below). The first round effect of
any administrated price increases could be accommodated, but a tighter monetary policy stance
would likely be needed to help contain inflationary expectations and limit second-round price
effects, which will also depend on the estimated output gap and fiscal policy stance.
18.
A persistent disconnect between the policy rate and the interbank rate hinders the
monetary transmission mechanism. The interbank rate has been persistently below the policy rate
for several years (165 basis points at end-2013) and there is little short-term relationship to the
policy rate (Figure 3), because of fluctuating excess liquidity or excess cash holdings of banks (Figure
4). While reserve requirements were increased in two increments from 6 to 8 percent to remove
excess liquidity, most recently in October 2013, staff considers this to be a second best policy
response because of the increased cost of credit intermediation. Excess liquidity is not overly
worrisome from an inflation perspective now because international prices appear stable and the
output gap is slightly negative. However, the persistent gap makes monetary policy less effective.
While the repo rate influences bank deposit and lending rates (partly through moral suasion), the
low interbank rate contributes to financial disintermediation since banks have little incentive to raise
deposits which cost more at the margin than they can earn. Moreover, the excess liquidity might be
inducing banks to engage in riskier lending.

19.
Staff proposed a mechanism to share the cost of monetary policy and provide
incentives to eliminate the structural excess liquidity. Excess liquidity has arisen due to the
decision to increase external fiscal financing while building international reserve buffers. Concerned
about potential losses on its income statement, the BOM has not fully sterilized the resulting excess
liquidity, issuing just 20 billion rupees of its own short-term paper. Staff suggested giving BOM the
authority to issue government paper to remove excess liquidity and to discontinue the issuance of
its own paper. This would also help develop the government securities market by using one risk-free
instrument rather than two. The BOM would start paying interest on government deposits, but at a
lower rate than that paid on BOM bills, thus resulting in a cost sharing. This would also reduce
government’s incentive to place deposits outside the BOM, which is its current nonstandard practice
motivated in part by the non-payment of interest.
20.
Staff discussed the potential benefits of moving to a formal inflation targeting (IT)
regime. The current monetary policy framework of implicit IT has served Mauritius well, but moving
to a formal flexible IT framework (consistent with recent MCM TA recommendations) could better
anchor inflation expectations and, thus, provide greater short-run flexibility for output stabilization.
Although Mauritius has already most elements for formal IT in place, additional strengthening of key
institutions would be beneficial, particularly the BOM’s forecasting capacity, where improvements
are underway with the help of MCM TA. It would also be useful to clarify BOM’s primary objectives
and strengthen its accountability mechanisms by revising the central bank act (in line with recent
LEG recommendations). Staff encouraged the authorities to determine the appropriate explicit
medium-term inflation target and the band around it in the Mauritian context.
21.
The authorities agreed with much of staff’s analysis, but provided some caveats
regarding implementation. On monetary policy and the inflation target, BOM was relatively more
concerned about rising inflationary pressures and favors a lower inflation target than the current

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

MAURITIUS

implicit 5 percent target. MOFED in contrast would like to see further analysis regarding the optimal
inflation target. There was widespread agreement regarding the need to withdraw excess liquidity
and the cost-sharing mechanism, but the details (including the interest rate paid on government
deposits) remain to be worked out. The authorities saw benefit in modernizing the central bank act,
although there remains a difference of views regarding some details, particularly regarding central
bank independence and accountability.

C.

External Sector Assessment

22.
Staff analysis suggests that the real effective exchange rate (REER) is moderately
overvalued (Appendix II). CGER-type models indicate an overvaluation of 7 percent on average for
2014, declining to 4 percent by 2018 (Text Table 1). The estimates are subject to considerable
uncertainty—all ranges of estimates include zero overvaluation—but all estimates point in the same
direction. Other competiveness indicators also point to some overvaluation: the persistently large
historical current account deficit,1 loss of market share in export sectors like tourism, weak long-term
export growth, and wage growth in excess of labor productivity. Capital flows to finance the current
account deficit have been relatively stable. GBC transactions have a large impact on the BOP
financing and fluctuate significantly from year to year; partly because of timing issues (see Appendix
IV). FDI and other private investment flows have been the most important for BOP financing
historically and are projected to continue.

Most tourism-dependent economies tend to have large inward FDI flows, leading to weak current account balances.
Also, there is some evidence that financial services earnings related to the Global Business Companies (GBCs) might
be underestimated.

23.
External imbalances need to be addressed by increasing national savings and
structural reforms to foster competitiveness. Over the 2000s Mauritius experienced a significant
fall in national savings from over 25 percent of GDP in the early 2000s to 13 percent in 2011 with a
corresponding increase in the current account deficit since investment was relatively stable. Fiscal
consolidation, as envisioned by the authorities, can contribute to the needed adjustment in savinginvestment balances, but private sector savings also need to rise, for example through pension
reform (see below) and reforms that encourage savings. Efforts to improve competitiveness are also
crucial, such as investments in infrastructure to remove bottlenecks, and in human capital to reduce
skills mismatches, and wage policies that align real wage increases with productivity improvements.
24.
Reserves levels appear comfortable when measured against the traditional thresholds
and adequate relative to the IMF composite indicator (Appendix II). Reserves are above the
traditional benchmarks (3 months of imports, 20 percent of M2, and 100 percent of short-term
external debt). Reserves are 125 percent of the IMF composite indicator at end-2013, which is in the
middle of the recommended range (100 to 150 percent). However, if the external liabilities of the
GBC sector were taken into consideration, the IMF metric would drop well below the comfortable
range. While the extent to which GBC liabilities should be taken into account for reserve adequacy
purposes is difficult to assess, the BOM’s reserve reconstitution program targets a further
accumulation of reserves to about 150 percent of the IMF metric by 2019. Staff agreed that a further
gradual accumulation of reserves would be prudent, with intervention focused on reducing the
volatility of the rupee. The Mauritian economy has so far not been very affected by the increased
volatility in international capital flows since last summer.2
25.
The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment and intend to address the economy’s
falling competitiveness. They believe that fiscal adjustment can help reduce external imbalances,
but more importantly that their medium-term reform program can improve export competitiveness,
and that education and labor market reforms help boost productivity.

MEDIUM-TERM MACROECONOMIC AND STRUCTURAL
POLICIES
Discussions centered on debt sustainability and the specifics of medium-term fiscal consolidation;
local government finances, the pension and social protection system, the role of the global
business sector; and policies to increase longer-term growth.

Mauritius continues to maintain an exchange system free of multiple currency practices and of restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.

Fiscal Consolidation and Public Sector Reforms

Fiscal consolidation
26.
Fiscal consolidation is needed to address external imbalances, lower vulnerabilities,
and meet the debt law. The updated debt sustainability analysis (DSA) shows a reasonably positive
debt outlook for Mauritius, similar to the previous DSA, although slightly weaker (Appendix I). Both
total public debt and external debt are on sustainable trajectories and the results of stress tests
indicate that debt dynamics are resilient to several shocks. However, based on current policies, staff
projects that total public debt would not fall to below 50 percent of GDP by 2018 as required by law.
Staff noted that a debt ratio of 50 percent of GDP is close to the sustainability risk threshold for a
typical emerging market, but, as a financial center, Mauritius might need larger policy buffers. Staff
therefore recommended advancing some fiscal consolidation into 2014 and accelerating the
adjustment over 2015-18 to safely reach the debt target. The authorities recently received TA on
their medium-term debt strategy from MCM, which suggested to update and publish the
authorities’ debt strategy to provide market participants with more guidance regarding the
government’s financing strategy.
27.
Given the large investment needs, medium-term fiscal consolidation should focus on
current expenditure rationalization and include revenue raising measures. There appears to be
room for reducing expenditures through better targeting of social assistance and reduction in
subsidies, and from improving efficiency in SOEs and local governments. However, the consolidation
should not come from spending alone—priority spending, such as health and education, and
maintenance spending may need to increase, and new infrastructure investment is needed. Thus,
some focus on revenue raising measures would seem a better adjustment mix than concentrating
on spending only in the authorities’ plans. Increases in the revenue-to-GDP ratio could be achieved
through better tax administration and growth-friendly and environmentally-sustainable taxes.3

Local government finances
28.
Reforms to increase local governments’ own resources and improve spending
efficiency should contain fiscal risks and improve efficiency (Appendix V). Local governments
rely heavily on Grant-In-Aid (GIA) central government transfers, which do not reflect expenditure
needs or revenue raising capacity. The authorities are considering changing the GIA formula with
assistance from AFRITAC South to reduce local government imbalances and provide greater revenue
mobilization incentives. The existing own-revenue instruments are used inadequately. Staff advised
to increase reliance on real estate taxes over the medium term since they tend to increase local
government accountability as local payers tend to monitor local service delivery more closely. Staff
also suggested reviewing spending assignments, since local authorities spend most of their outlays
3

Taxation of fuel products could be raised and combined with a carbon tax, both serving environmental and external
balance objectives. VAT and import tariff exemptions should be phased out. Over the medium term, GPS-based tolls
could replace road taxes and car import duties. Real estate taxes could be introduced for local governments.

on wages, which leaves little fiscal space for service delivery. Staff advised to phase in reforms slowly
with proper planning and consultation.

Pension reforms
29.
The authorities have implemented important pension reforms, but there are still
significant challenges (Box 1). Major recent steps were the increase in retirement age and the
creation of a new system for civil servants. Further reforms could help reduce the fiscal cost of the
system, increase savings, and contribute to a better social protection system. Creating the capacity
for pension modeling with the World Bank’s PROST model is welcome.

Potential for an earned income tax credit
30.
An earned income tax credit (EITC) is theoretically appealing, but unlikely to be
feasible at this time (Appendix VI). With an EITC, low-income workers receive a refundable tax
credit instead of paying taxes. This can help alleviate poverty, especially for families with children,
and provide greater incentives for unemployed youth and women to work without placing an
additional burden on employers. On the other hand, an EITC would be relatively expensive and
would not fit into the current fiscal framework without offsetting cost savings or revenue measures.
In addition, implementing EITC would incur significant administrative costs on the Mauritius
Revenue Authority (MRA) because only ¼ of personal income taxpayers are required to file tax
returns. Moving to an EITC would force MRA to divert its limited resources away from high-risk,
high-income taxpayers and could lead to serious revenue losses. Staff and authorities agreed that an
EITC would not be advisable at this time, but could be kept under consideration as a longer-term
option as part of an overall review of the social safety net.
31.
The authorities supported much of staff suggestions but pointed to implementation
difficulties. Regarding fiscal adjustment they preferred to base as much as possible on expenditure
measures in order to preserve their relatively efficient tax system, which they see as one of
Mauritius’ attractions. They explained that in the current political situation major reforms would be
difficult, but that technical work to prepare the ground for future reforms would continue.
Regarding local governments they appreciated AFRITAC South’s assistance, but stressed that real
estate taxation would have to be carefully prepared to be successfully implemented. On pensions,
they were receptive to several ideas including the merging of the new civil service system, but
stressed that reforms should be studied further using the World Bank’s PROST model.

Box 1. Mauritius: Further Pension Reforms
Rising pension expenditure in Mauritius reflects rising dependency ratios. Increasing longevity and
declining fertility rates contribute to rising dependency ratios (Box Figure 1). The cost of the current system is
projected to increase by 2 percent of GDP by 2040, mainly due to the public sector (civil servants) (Box
Figure 2), despite optimistic assumptions for the basic retirement program (BRP).

The authorities implemented two bold reforms; but challenges remain. The retirement age for both males
and females was increased from 60 to 65 years. In 2013, a new defined-contribution (DC) system was
introduced for all new public sector employees. However, tackling the transition cost (40 percent of GDP in
NPV-terms) remains a challenge since the new system will only generate savings in about 35 years. Previous
reforms aimed at means-testing the BRP were reversed.
Further reforms could render the system fully sustainable. Measures could include (i) indexing the
retirement age to life expectancy; (ii) linking benefits to inflation instead of wages (iii) decreasing incentives for
early retirement; (iv) linking accrual rates to the real investment returns; and (v) reducing job categories
eligible for early retirement. In addition, the BRP could be converted into a true poverty pension. Regarding
the National Pension Fund (NPF) for the private sector, increasing contribution rates could support higher
replacement rates, which at 35 percent are only half that of the public sector. Additionally, pension fund
returns could be improved by diversifying into low cost international passive strategies. These reforms could
help increase national and fiscal savings while possibly allowing for an increase in pensions for lower income
workers.
Merging the new public sector system with the NPF should be considered. The DC system unnecessarily
shifts all risks to pensioners. A prefunded defined benefit system, as the NPF, might achieve higher investment
returns through more professional management and higher risk-taking capacity. Risk sharing would eliminate
longevity risk. Pensioners could receive higher and more secure pensions for the same fiscal cost, and mobility
between private and public sectors would improve.

Financial Sector Issues

32.
The Mauritian banking system is well-capitalized and resilient against a range of
shocks according to stress tests (Appendix III). Banks’ profitability and comfortable capitalization
provide valuable cushions against a range of shocks to their credit portfolios. Direct exchange rate
and interest rate risks appear to be low. Risks on concentration of lending have eased, but need

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MAURITIUS

continuous monitoring. Liquidity ratios have improved somewhat, and the banking sector as a whole
still has sufficient liquid assets to sustain a hypothetical bank-run. An analysis of possible cross
border contagion suggests that severe shocks to some large European banks would have
considerable negative effects on external funding for Mauritian banks, but the overall impact should
be manageable.
33.
The BOM should continue its supervisory efforts, including through FSC coordination.
Rising non-performing loans, insufficient collateral values, and credit exposures to large borrowers
might be of concern for banks, although it appears that most real estate lending was wellcollateralized. Regular meetings between BOM and FSC have been held to address supervisory and
statistics coordination issues. The BOM and the FSC should continue to strengthen their
collaboration, particularly on assessing the inter-linkages between banks, non-bank financial
institutions and GBC sector, and regulatory overlaps and gaps. Threats to financial stability posed by
a Ponzi-like scheme in 2013 were contained successfully, and the regulatory framework was
subsequently improved.4
34.
Further work is required on a deposit insurance scheme (DIS), particularly regarding
linkages with bank resolution. A draft DIS Bill was prepared by the BOM in consultation with
stakeholders, but the draft could be strengthened to ensure its consistency with bank resolution
procedures. Further technical assistance from the IMF and the World Bank is planned.
35.
The GBC sector contributes increasingly to the economy, but there are risks associated
with its activity (Appendix IV). The linkages of GBCs with the domestic economy are not easily
quantified. GBCs employ highly qualified employees directly and indirectly and might contribute
some 3 percent of total GDP. The authorities have strengthened the statistical coverage of the sector
with help from STA and are channeling more supervisory resources to it. The likely revision of the
double taxation avoidance agreement (DTAA) with India could reduce GBC earnings (see Risk
Assessment Matrix). However, the sector is diversifying, including into providing financial services to
Africa.
36.
The authorities welcomed the results of the staff’s stress testing exercise, which
complement the BOM’s own stress testing. They noted that they have introduced macroprudential measures to address vulnerabilities in the banking sector. The authorities welcomed staff
suggestions on the DIS and the global business sector, and they have requested further TA from the
Fund in these areas.

4

The scheme was uncovered in early 2013. The BOM acted swiftly to involve law enforcement, to gather information
on the fraudulent (and unlicensed) entities and transactions, and to provide information to the public and register
complaints. BOM set up a "hotline" to provide information and register complaints (by end-2013, some, 3.400
complaints totaling almost Rs 1 billion had been received). BOM and FSC launched education campaigns to
encourage due diligence by investors. Experts from the Reserve Bank of India were enlisted to help close regulatory
gaps and MCM TA provided information on international best practices in combating such schemes.

Raising Potential Growth

37.
Over the last decade or so, Mauritius’s trend growth has softened while total factor
productivity (TFP) has fallen. During 1960-2013, Mauritius grew by 5 percent on average each
year. Growth accounting models suggest that human-capital-augmented labor contributed
2½ percentage points, physical capital 1½ percent, and total factor productivity 1 percentage
points.5 Thus, Mauritius’ impressive past growth performance relied heavily on labor, which—given
population dynamics—will be less important, although there is a role for human capital. Growth
accounting suggests that growth over the next 20 years might be around 3 percent in the absence
of further structural reforms. Nonetheless, with virtually no population growth, a 3 percent percapita growth rate is very respectable and would allow Mauritius to reach high income status in
about a decade.
38.
Long-term growth prospects could be improved by addressing aspects of the cost of
doing business— infrastructure bottlenecks, limited air access, and high communication costs.
Carefully planned investments in physical and human capital should raise growth directly and
indirectly through improved productivity, but should avoid fiscal contingencies. Comprehensive
reforms including increased private involvement in the water, transport, and energy sectors should
help remove infrastructure bottlenecks and improve productivity.
39.
Labor market policies could increase potential growth by building human capital
qualitatively and quantitatively. Unemployment is relatively high and predominantly affects the
young, women, and the low-skilled. Policy measures should primarily target the employability of
low-skilled Mauritian youth, for example through subsidized training (as already started with the
Youth Employment Program). In addition, the wage setting mechanisms should be reviewed with
the objective of aligning real wages with labor productivity. Finally, consideration should be given to
attracting skilled foreign labor to fill skill gaps and to help transfer skills to the Mauritian work force.
40.
The authorities appreciated staff’s analysis but thought that it was unduly pessimistic.
While agreeing that trend growth in Mauritius had likely declined, they argued that the long-term
potential was significantly higher than estimated by staff, as they considered that reform efforts
would be continued vigorously, yielding higher TFP growth.

D.

Statistical Issues

41.
Mauritius’ macroeconomic statistics are adequate for surveillance. Statistical capacity
continues to be strengthened and the authorities aim to subscribe to SDDS Plus. Staff supports the
Statistics Mauritius’ initiatives to improve its website and communication to the public in general.
There is a need to improve labor statistics, particularly regarding unemployment, and labor

5

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MAURITIUS

productivity. Monetary statistics could benefit from expanding coverage to Other Financial
Companies (OFCs), including pension funds and insurance companies.
42.
Coverage of the GBC sector should be strengthened. Looking forward, BOP and
international investment position (IIP) statistics should increasingly improve coverage, frequency,
and timeliness of data sources, with particular focus on the coverage of GBCs.

STAFF APPRAISAL
43.
The macroeconomic outlook for 2014 is broadly positive. Real activity is expected to
strengthen to close to potential, while inflation is projected at about 4.5 percent with a stable
outlook. Mauritius has been resilient to a variety of shocks in part because of prudent
macroeconomic policies and strong institutions.
44.
Delays in beginning the intended medium-term fiscal consolidation complicate the
achievement of the debt target. With the output gap expected to close further, a tighter fiscal
stance in 2014 would help smooth the planned consolidation. Debt is projected to decline, but staff
recommended additional moderate fiscal adjustment over the medium term to lower debt
vulnerabilities and ensure that the 2018 debt target would be met.
45.
An overhaul of the SOE sector and improvements of the already efficient tax system
should also contribute to medium-term fiscal consolidation. Considerable fiscal resources are
devoted to relatively inefficient SOEs, which should be reformed to operate more on fully
commercial principles, particularly through comprehensive policy reforms of the regulatory
framework of the water and energy sectors. Improving tax administration and broadening the tax
base by reducing the list of VAT and import exemptions, introducing a true carbon tax, and moving
to GPS-based road taxes could create further fiscal space.
46.
The current moderately accommodative monetary policy is appropriate. Inflation
dynamics, mostly determined by imported goods prices and inflation expectations, appear stable,
but the authorities should be forward looking in their response to potential inflationary pressures.
While most elements of formal inflation targeting are in place, additional steps to strengthen
institutional arrangements and forecasting would allow for a greater forward orientation in setting
monetary policy and an eventual adoption of formal flexible IT.
47.
Reducing excess liquidity in the banking sector is necessary to improve the monetary
transmission mechanism despite likely but justifiable losses for the BOM. Aligning the key
policy rate and the interbank rate would improve the transmission mechanism through tighter links
between interest rates and better signaling. Moreover, banks would have more incentives to attract
deposits and less to engage in unsound banking practices. Absorbing excess liquidity through
issuance of government paper, rather than BOM paper, combined with paying interest on
government deposits, would result in better sharing of the cost of monetary policy.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

MAURITIUS

48.
The banking system remains well-capitalized, profitable, and resilient against a range
of shocks. Developments in the real estate sector and household indebtedness, as well as
concentration of lending should continue to be monitored closely. Whenever necessary, macroprudential measures could be used to address vulnerabilities in the banking sector. It would be
desirable to introduce a deposit insurance scheme compatible with modern bank resolution tools.
Further strengthening of the coordination with the nonbank financial supervisor would be useful to
reduce regulatory overlaps and gaps.
49.
Further reform efforts are needed to enhance external competitiveness and improve
longer-term growth prospects. Empirical models and broader indicators point to a moderate
overvaluation of the rupee that should be addressed through steps to strengthen national savings—
both through medium-term fiscal consolidation and pension reform to raise private savings—as well
as measures to enhance productivity through reducing the cost of doing business.
50.
Pension reforms could promote national savings while better achieving social
protection for the poor and the overall workforce. Pension contributions for the National
Pension Fund (NPF) could be raised in order to increase retirement income. Staff also recommended
merging the pre-funded pension system for new civil servants with the NPF to achieve better old
age protection, economies of scale in pension administration, and better mobility between the
public and private sector. The universal basic retirement program could be converted into a true
poverty pension to improve social protection and generate fiscal savings.
51.
Local government finances should be reformed to increase own resources and improve
local service delivery. In the short-term, the focus should be on improving the Grant-In-Aid
transfer formula to reduce fiscal imbalance between localities and provide greater incentives for
raising own revenues. Longer-term reforms should include appropriate expenditure assignments,
possibly reducing wage outlays, and turning real estate taxes into a reliable long-term source of
funding.
52.
Macroeconomic statistics are adequate for surveillance. The authorities’ commitment to
adopt SDDS plus is a clear sign of the importance placed on accurate timely data. Priority areas to
strengthen are the coverage of the GBC and labor statistics.
53.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent,
“medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall

APPENDIX I. DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

1

The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) shows that Mauritius’ exposure to risks from its debt profile
should be manageable. Under the baseline scenario, public debt indicators remain below their relevant
indicative thresholds over the medium term. The public debt dynamics is most vulnerable to contingent
liability, real GDP growth, and real interest rate shocks. External debt stays low and is financed by
multi- and bilateral sources at long maturities and favorable interest rates. The main risk to the debt
outlook would be insufficient medium-term fiscal adjustment to reduce the size of the debt, which at
almost 60 percent of GDP is somewhat high for an emerging market economy.

Background
The last debt sustainability analysis (DSA) for Mauritius was prepared in January 2013 and
concluded that the debt outlook was broadly positive. This exercise updates the analysis using
the new template for the DSA for market-access countries (MAC-DSA),2 which was released in 2013.
Public debt increased in 2013 for the first time since 2009, raising further the fiscal adjustment
needed to reach healthier debt levels. The ratio of public debt-to-GDP reached 59.9 percent in
2013 and is projected at 59 percent for end-2014. While moderate economic growth and one-off
spending pressures unexpectedly raised the primary deficit in 2013, the 2014 fiscal stance will likely
maintain an elevated deficit, which is planned to be reduced in 2015. With only five years left to
reach the end-2018 debt law target of 50 percent of GDP, further consolidation will have to be
implemented over these years. The authorities are cognizant of this tradeoff, although they are
somewhat more constrained in 2014, a pre-election year.
Despite somewhat elevated borrowing needs, Mauritius has not experienced financing
difficulties and funding public sector debt has remained accessible though somewhat
expensive. The 10-year bond yield spread over U.S. Treasury bonds was around 420 basis points at
the January 2014 auction, which was below the 600 basis points threshold for vulnerability.
Additional factors that contain vulnerabilities are (i) no history of debt difficulties; (ii) external debt
represents only around 20 percent of public sector debt and has very advantageous terms;3 and
(iii) less than one percent of domestic debt is held by non-residents. Moreover, the country’s

About two thirds of external debt is composed of multilateral loans (World Bank and the African Development Bank
make up the majority of multilateral debt outstanding) and the remaining third are bilateral loans (France, India, and
China are the main lenders).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MAURITIUS

domestic debt portfolio has tilted towards long- and medium-term maturities, which reduces
rollover risks and possibly borrowing costs.
The authorities continue to refine their debt management strategy. An MCM mission recently
visited Mauritius to help with revising the Medium-Term Debt Strategy (MTDS).4 Beyond
strengthening debt management and extending the maturity of domestic debt, further work remains
to develop the primary and the secondary market markets for government securities. The authorities
have set to lengthen the maturity structure and increase the attractiveness of domestic debt by
introducing benchmark securities. More could be done, including by increasing the number of
auctions held every year, by eliminating the issuance of non-benchmark securities or by considering
new debt instruments.5

Public DSA risk assessment
The most vulnerable areas are with respect to the debt profile, although none of the upper early
warning thresholds are reached (Figure 1). In fact, Mauritius is below the lower threshold for the
annual change in short-term debt and right at the lower threshold for public debt held for nonresidents. The evolution of predictive densities of gross nominal public debt remains within relative
narrow paths.

Realism of baseline scenario
The baseline macroeconomic assumptions for the present DSA are consistent with the
macroeconomic framework underlying the 2014 Article IV report (see main text). The realism of
this scenario for DSA purposes is assessed in Figure 2. Generally, the forecast errors for Mauritius for
real GDP growth, the primary balance, and inflation (deflator) have been low or at least below the
median, which provides confidence in the forecasts.


Growth. Economic activity is projected to accelerate gradually over the medium term,
reaching 4 percent in 2018, which is in line with the historical record.



Deflator. Inflation and the deflator should converge to the traditional inflation target of
5 percent, from 4½ percent in 2014.

4

The debt strategy is being developed by the MoFED in cooperation with the BOM. It covers both domestic and
external financing with the view of achieving low overall financing costs and minimizing financing risks, while at the
same time developing the domestic debt markets.
5

Government securities are comprised of Treasury Bills, Treasury Notes and Treasury Bonds. T-bills are sold with
maturities of 91, 182, 273 and 364 days. T-notes have maturities of 3 and 5 years, while T-bonds come at 10 years and
15 years. T-bills are all sold at a discount. T-notes and bonds are coupon securities. There is one annual auction for a
15-year inflation indexed bond.

30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MAURITIUS



Fiscal adjustment. Fiscal consolidation is expected to resume in 2015, with a reduction in
the primary deficit from 3 percent of GDP in 2013 to around ½ percent over 2015–19.6
Adjustment is projected to focus on current expenditure rationalization, including through
better targeting of social assistance and reduction in subsidies, and from improving efficiency
in SOEs and local governments. Against cross-country historical experience, the consolidation
of the cyclically-adjusted primary balance over the last three years of some 1½ percentage
points of GDP falls into the 4th lowest decile, which seems reasonable.



Boom-bust analysis. Mauritius has had a cumulative increase of 17 percent of GDP in
private sector credit over 2010–13, which in some countries has been an indicator of an
elevated risk of a future downturn. However, risk appear low in Mauritius: there is a negative
output gap and growth is projected to increase only slightly over the projection period in line
with estimated growth potential; and stress tests on the banking system (Appendix III)
suggest that the Mauritian banking system appears to be resilient against most shocks.
Moreover, lending has been well collateralized and banking supervision is relatively sound so
that growth shocks emanating from a collapse in lending or property values should be small
and manageable.



Current account deficit. The current account deficit is expected to gradually narrow from an
estimate of 9 percent of GDP in 2013 to about 6 percent by 2018. The trade balance should
improve over the projection period as the services surplus recovers from the 2008 crisis.

Baseline Scenario
The projection is based on the borrowing requirements identified in the budget. In line with the
authorities’ financing assumptions, external financing is mostly based on previously committed
disbursements. Domestic financing has the objective of tilting the issuance towards longer-term
instruments. The amount of domestic financing is in effect the residual of total financing need minus
available external financing, which is assumed to be mostly on favorable terms.
Under the baseline scenario, Mauritius’ debt outlook has deteriorated slightly but remains
broadly positive (Figures 1 and 2). The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline from 59.9 percent
in 2013 to about 53 percent by 2019. A high primary balance in 2014 and somewhat elevated real
interest rates are the principal debt-creating flows in the forecasting period, but the overall debt
trajectory is sustainable. The need for short-term domestic financing stays broadly stable implying
some rollover risk but government’s access to funding has not been a problem historically.

6

The primary balance concept used in the DSA is the primary balance (including grants and excluding net lending)
shown in the fiscal table plus transactions in financial assets/liabilities (mainly net lending to SOEs).
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MAURITIUS



Debt levels (Figures 3 and 4). Mauritius’ increase in gross debt by 2 percentage points of
GDP relative in 2013 is mainly explained by the deterioration in the primary balance and by
slower growth. Despite a projected improvement of growth in 2014, the primary deficit
remains broadly at the elevated level of 2013. Over the projection period, the fiscal
consolidation planned for 2015 underpins the decreasing debt-to-GDP ratio.



Maturity and rollover (Figures 1 and 4). The need for short-term domestic financing stays
broadly stable implying some rollover risk, but government’s access to funding has not been
a problem historically. In fact, the banking system currently has excess liquidity and
government securities auctions have been oversubscribed.

The 2018 debt target mandated by the Public Debt Management Act of 2008 might be missed
given current projections. The target is a 50 percent debt-to-GDP ratio, although some debt to
state-owned enterprise (SOEs) is allowed to be discounted for the purposes of the debt law ceiling if
the SOEs are run mainly on commercial principles. Staff currently projects public debt for debt ceiling
purposes of 51 percent of GDP in 2018. To safely reach the mandated target, the primary deficit each
year would need to be about ¼ percent of GDP lower than currently projected, which should be
feasible.
Alternative scenarios highlight the need to increase the primary balance to avoid adverse debt
dynamics (Figure 4). Assuming a constant primary balance from 2014 onward would lead to public
gross financing needs at around 12 percent of GDP by 2019, and a gross nominal debt of 59 percent
of GDP. Hence, an insufficient medium-term fiscal adjustment is an important risk to the debt
outlook. Under the historical scenario, the debt outlook is more favorable than the baseline.7 This
reflects better real GDP growth and primary balances in the historical period than under the baseline,
although the effective interest rate would be slightly higher.

Stress tests
Most stress test would leave end-of-projection results at lower or close-to-initial values (Figure 5).
The most severe stress tests relate to the contingent liability shock, and the real GDP and real
interest rate shocks.


Contingent liability shock. This shock is significant reflecting Mauritius’ role as a financial
center. In a scenario, that simulates the risk of a banking crisis due to implicit or explicit
guaranties to banks, public debt would jump from about 60 percent of GDP in 2014 to some

7

Real GDP growth, the primary balance, and real interest rates are set at their historical average; while other variables
are the same as in the baseline.

32

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MAURITIUS

90 percent in 2015, but decline gradually thereafter. However, the banking system is well
capitalized and resilient to most shocks (Appendix III), so the risk of this shock materializing
should be small.


Growth shock. A lower real output growth by 1 standard deviation for 2 years starting in
2015 would have significant impact on the level of debt, which would reach 59.5 percent of
GDP in 2016 compared to 56.8 percent under the baseline.



Real interest rate shock. An increase in the sovereign risk premia by somewhat more than
200 basis points (bps) starting in 2015 would raise the effective interest rate paid on public
debt by about 80 basis points in 2016 and by about 230 basis points in 2019, reflecting a
maturity structure that is tilted toward the medium term.



Primary balance shock. A scenario involving a deterioration of the primary balance of about
1 percent of GDP over the next two years leaves the gross debt-to-GDP ratio broadly stable;
with a higher impact on the debt-to-revenue ratio. All ratios gradually return towards their
baseline values.



Real exchange rate shock. A real exchange rate depreciation starting 2015 and
corresponding to the estimated overvaluation in 2014 of 7 percent, would have little effect
on debt or gross financing needs.



Combined shock. In a scenario with all the above shocks combined into a single scenario,
the debt-to-GDP ratio would rise to about 63 percent in 2015 and would only decline
marginally by 2019 to about 62 percent. Similarly, debt-to-revenue ratios and gross financing
needs would remain at elevated levels over the projection period. Most of the deviation from
the baseline would be driven by the growth and real interest rate shock.

External Debt Sustainability8
External debt dynamics remain sustainable under the baseline scenario (Figure 6 and Table 1).
External debt is estimated at 25 percent of GDP at end-2013. Gross bank external liabilities are not
included in the external debt figures as they are matched by external assets almost twice as large. As
standard practice in many international financial centers, it would be misleading to include bank
external liabilities in the country’s external debt measure for DSA purposes. External debt is projected
to increase slightly initially and then decline to 24 percent of GDP by 2018, as authorities continue to
take advantage of concessional long-term financing from multilateral and bilateral sources.

8

The first year of the projection period is 2013 as final external data are only available for 2012.

MAURITIUS

The external debt outlook is vulnerable to shocks on non-interest current account and large
exchange rate depreciations. Sensitivity analysis suggests that Mauritius’ external debt remains
resilient to interest rate and growth shocks, but a 30 percent real depreciation would push the
external debt-to-GDP ratio to 35 percent in 2018. A current account deficit that is 3 percentage
points larger than projected in the baseline would also cause the debt-to-GDP ratio to increase to
close to 34 percent by 2018. Hence, moderating the non-interest part of the external current account
balance would be important to maintain external debt sustainability.

Conclusion
The public debt outlook remains broadly positive, although it has weakened somewhat
compared to the last DSA. Further improvements to this outlook could derive from the planned
medium-term fiscal consolidation and further structural reforms to improve growth prospects and
competitiveness.

APPENDIX II. EXTERNAL COMPETITIVENESS ASSESSMENT

1

Exchange rate assessment
The Mauritian rupee depreciated by an average of 0.4 percent in real effective terms during 2013,
but continues to be at historically high levels (Figure II.1). After the continuous real appreciation of
the rupee from 2007 to 2012, the BOM started intervening occasionally in the foreign exchange market
after June 2012 to smooth the fluctuation of the rupee and build reserves. The BOM continued to
intervene in 2013, smoothing the volatility in the nominal effective exchange, although the nominal and
real effective exchange rates edged up marginally over the course of the year.
Figure II.1. Mauritius: Bilateral and Effective Exchange Rates, 2001-13

Source: Mauritius authorities and IMF staff estimates.

The rupee is estimated to be moderately overvalued based on analytical methods. Staff applied
the three Consultative Group on Exchange Rate (CGER) Issues methodologies: (i) macroeconomic
balance (MB); equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER); and external sustainability (ES). All three
approaches consistently give point estimates of a moderate overvaluation, which ranges from about
3 percent on average for the medium-term (Table II.1) to 7 percent for 2014. The level of confidence in
the individual estimates is not very high since all methodologies include zero-overvaluation in the bands
(Figures II.2 and II.3). The results from CGER methodologies are also consistent with two additional
approaches, the purchasing power parity (PPP) approach and the fundamental equilibrium exchange
rate (FEER) approach, which point to mild or zero overvaluation in 2014. The numerical estimates are not
very large, but they all point in the same direction, which gives a little bit more confidence in the results.
Table II.1 summarizes the current and medium-term exchange rate misalignment computed under the
five different methodologies. Some results are sensitive to the estimates of the elasticity of the current
account with respect to the real exchange rate. The estimates used are Mauritius-specific because as a
small open economy, Mauritius is estimated to have higher import and export elasticities (Text
Table II.1.) If standard CGER elasticities (exports = -0.71; imports = 0.92) were used instead of Mauritiusspecific elasticities, implied exchange rate misalignments would be larger for the MB and the ES
approaches. However, the error bands for the MB approach would also be larger and zero misalignment
of the current account would still be within the error band.

overvaluation. The equilibrium CA deficit is estimated

The ERER approach does not suggest a
significant misalignment. The ERER approach
signaled a mild overvaluation of the rupee by
about 7 percent in 2013-14, but the average real
exchange rate is within the 90 percent confidence
interval estimated by this methodology. The
rupee is projected to stay constant in real
effective terms over the medium term, which
would narrow the level of misalignment over the
medium term due to a moderate improvement in
fundamentals (Figure II.3).

Equilibrium REER

The ES approach estimates the level of the CA balance that stabilizes the level of net foreign
assets (NFA). It shows that the rupee is projected to be overvalued by about 11 percent in 2014 and
7 percent over the medium term due to a projected decline in the CA deficit (Figure II.4). The estimated
overvaluation under the ES approach is slightly larger than that of the MB approach because of the
difference in the CA norms.
The results from CGER methodologies are in line with the results from the two other approaches.
The PPP approach shows that the current level of the real exchange rate is close to its historical average.

The fundamental equilibrium exchange rate (FEER) approach is conceptually similar to the ERER
approach; it also seeks the long-term relationship between exchange rates and a set of economic
fundamentals, including terms of trade, government consumption, and openness. Instead of running
panel regressions (as in the ERER), the FEER uses a longer time series of Mauritian data to identify
potential misalignments. The FEER results suggest that the exchange rate overvaluation declined
between 2012 and 2014 to 8 percent, but stayed within the statistical error bands during recent years
(Figure II.5).

Competitiveness assessment
Mauritius’s share in world tourism has been
generally stable but fell after the global
financial crisis (Figure II.6). A possible explanation
for losing share over the recent few years could be
that the impact of the financial crisis was largest in
Europe, the largest source of tourists going to
Mauritius.

with all other countries and a group of tourismdependent economies (Text Table II.2). Higher
rankings (lower numbers in deciles) in each indicator imply greater competitiveness of Mauritius
compared with the other countries (or other peer tourism-dependent countries). The scorecard shows
that Mauritius is in the 8th lowest decile in the group of tourism-dependent country, which can be
interpreted as having relatively low competitiveness against its peer group or median competitiveness
from a global perspective.

A comprehensive competitiveness assessment suggests that the rupee is moderately overvalued
from a structural point of view. Although Mauritius had a current account surplus from 2001 through
2003, the current account deteriorated gradually to an elevated level. The competitiveness scorecard
also points to a loss of competitiveness, because of (i) loss of export volume and market share;
(ii) higher costs of production factors; and (iii) appreciation of the currency, Mauritius’ competitiveness
scores on the low side among peer tourism-dependent countries. Furthermore, over the past few years,
wages have risen faster than labor productivity, resulting in higher unit labor costs, and exports have
fallen as a share of GDP. These measures of competitiveness suggest that the rupee is moderately
overvalued from a structural point of view. This vulnerability will need to be addressed through
structural measures to restore competitiveness.

APPENDIX III. BANKING SECTOR AND SPILLOVER ANALYSIS

1

Financial Soundness Indicators (FSI) and bank health heat map
FSIs show that the Mauritian banking system is
healthy at the aggregate level. The capital
adequacy ratio (CAR) has increased following the
global financial crisis and stands well above the
regulatory minimum of 10 percent (Figure III.1).
Also, the overall liquidity ratio rose from 17 percent
at end-2012 to 20 percent in June 2013, but it has
not fully recovered to the level of 2008 and 2009. In
recent years, it was mainly the offshore (Segment B)
sector that contributed to the decrease of liquidity,
while the onshore (Segment A) sector broadly
maintained its liquidity ratio.

Profitability and NPLs of banking have suffered
somewhat in recent years. Several indicators
including ROE show a decline of bank earnings and profitability, although from relatively comfortable
levels. The non-performing loan (NPL) ratio is at a low level by international comparison, but it has
increased slightly to 3.9 percent in June 2013, mainly because of difficulties in the construction, tourism
and GBC sectors (although GBC NPLs are still at very low levels).

Bank health heat map indicators show that large banks tend to be healthier. The heat map shows
the bank health index of banks based on the BankScope database (Text Table III.1). The bank health
index is defined as the average of five normalized financial ratios (i) capital adequacy; (ii) NPLs;
(iii) return on assets; (iv) liquidity; and (v) tangible common equity to tangible assets (inverse of leverage
ratio).2 Larger banks in Mauritius do better mainly because of higher CARs and profitability. The larger
Mauritian banks continue to have a comparable or slightly better level of soundness than major global
banks.

Stress-testing the banking system
Stress tests suggest that bank capital remains sufficient to withstand a wide range of shocks. Staff
updated the stress tests for 18 of the 21 Mauritian banks based on June 2013 data. Banks were divided
into four analytical groups: (1) three large banks serving both domestic and non-residents; (2) three
large banks serving primarily non-residents; (3) six medium-to-small banks serving both domestic and
non-residents; and (4) six medium-to-small banks serving mostly residents. Three smaller banks were

The value of each ratio is normalized by the three-year mean and standard deviation among all banks to obtain a zscore. The sample consists of 12 Mauritian banks and 5 largest international banks as a reference group.

excluded because they are primarily equity-funded, which would have distorted results. Banks would
meet the Basel II capital adequacy requirement under credit shocks, macroeconomic shocks, exchange
rate shocks and interest rate shocks. Appendix IV assesses the impact of shocks to the GBC sector on
Mauritian banks under the same stress testing framework.

above (below) the average of the banks in this sample. A positive (negative) value is relative, and does not imply
that the bank is financially healthy (unhealthy) in an absolute sense.

The banking system appears to be resilient to credit risk shocks. A 100 percent increase in NPLs in
proportion to existing loans, would only lead to limited drops in CARs (Figure III.2, Panel 1). After the
shock, all banks would still have CARs above 10 percent (the domestically set higher criteria of capital
requirement), thanks to relatively low NPLs ratios and adequate capital in the banking system.
Banks have sufficient capital buffers against external growth shocks. One stress test scenario
envisaged a major slowdown in trading partners, notably in Europe, that would lead to a 2 percentage
point drop in real GDP growth in Mauritius for 2013 (Figure III.2, Panel 2). The impact on Mauritian
banks would be mainly through their exposures to the export sector (sugar, textile and tourism). All
banks would be resilient to this external growth shocks (i.e. have CARs of above 8 percent), an
improvement over last’s year’s result, when one smaller bank saw its CAR drop marginally below
8 percent.
Concerns about exposure to large borrowers have lessened to some extent. The median CAR
decline related to a 50 percent loss from their largest borrowing group would be largest among the four

stress scenarios, at 2.3 percentage points (Figure III.2, Panel 3). Exposure concentration had been a
concern for smaller banks. However, all banks would maintain at least a CAR of 8 percent this year,
compared to last year when one type-3 banks would have seen its CAR drop below 8 percent.

Direct exchange rate and interest rate risks are small, but credit risk may arise from severe
interest rate shocks. The net long positions in foreign currency and FX loans to non-exporting
companies continue to be small for most banks. Thus, a rupee depreciation equal to the most severe
depreciation over the last 10 years would result in a small gain (Figure III.2, Panel 4). The impact on bank
capital related to an increase in the policy interest rate would be small because most deposits and loans
have floating interest rates. However, a severe interest rate increase could affect banks’ capital indirectly
through increases in NPLs.
Liquidity is sufficient under most stress situations. Staff applied a hypothetical 5-day bank run on all
banks, assuming that 15 percent of domestic demand deposits and 10 percent of foreign demand
deposits would be withdrawn each day. Three out of the 18 banks would run out of liquid assets in the

48

MAURITIUS

absence of any interbank borrowing or external support, but the banking system as a whole would still
be liquid, with the liquid assets-to-total assets ratio at 13 percent by the end of day five.

Banking and sovereign stress spillover analysis
The direct spillovers to Mauritius from stress in international banks were assessed using the Bank
Contagion Module developed by the IMF’s Research Department. The module estimates the
vulnerability of Mauritian banks stemming from international banks that operate in Mauritius or are
involved in direct cross-border lending, based on the BIS banking statistics. Based on the default rates
specified in the tables below, the module estimates the reduction in the availability of credit for
Mauritian banks, since international banks that do not hold enough capital to cover such losses, would
have to deleverage (reduce their foreign and domestic assets) to restore their required CARs, thus
squeezing credit lines to Mauritius and other countries.3
A default on the sovereign debt of selected European countries would only moderately affect
foreign credit availability to Mauritius. The banking systems of Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and
Spain have already experienced market pressures. Although the assumed default rates are very high
(Text Table III.2), the impact of the simulated losses of international banks actively lending to Mauritian
banks would be limited except the case of Italy where the impact on credit availability is moderate at
some 1.5 percent of GDP.

Foreign credit availability for Mauritian borrowers would be affected considerably by large losses
of international banks in European countries. The simulations assume a default on 10–30 percent of
international bank assets, which would be a very severe shock. The largest direct impact of the various
scenarios would stem from a combined loss in selected European countries and would reduce foreign
bank credit to Mauritian banks by about 50 percent of GDP (Text Table III.3). Among these countries, the
impact from the UK would be the largest (about 28 percent of GDP), because UK banks constitute about
39 percent of banking assets in Mauritius, followed by Germany and France (about 9 percent of GDP

each). This suggests that an emergence of a severe crisis in large European countries could impact
Mauritian banks beyond their direct asset exposure to the region.

Development of macro-financial risks and conditions of Mauritius
The Mauritian financial sector has become less risky over the past two years. The Country Financial
Stability Map developed by the IMF’s MCM department describes the development of macro-financial
risks and conditions in a particular country, with four risk indices (macroeconomic risks; inward spillover
risks; credit risks; and market and liquidity risks) and two macro-financial condition indices (risk appetite;
and monetary and financial conditions). Each index is calculated by taking into consideration various
macroeconomic and financial indicators that affects risks of financial sector in each country. Figure III.3
shows that the macro-financial conditions have improved as both the risk appetite index and monetary
and financial conditions index indicate lower risks in the second quarter of 2013 compared with two
years earlier. This improvement is likely mainly due to the improvement of economic and financial
conditions in Europe, Mauritius’ main trade partner. In addition, market and liquidity risks appear to
have declined, while macroeconomic risks edged up, with credit and inward spillover risks basically
stable. The largest risk exposure was related to market and liquidity risks.

APPENDIX IV. OFFSHORE FINANCIAL SECTOR ASSESSMENT

1

The offshore financial sector in Mauritius has become an important part of the overall financial
sector, but its impact on the domestic economy and on external stability is not fully understood
because of lack of data availability. Global Business Companies (GBCs) make up the offshore financial
sector of Mauritius. GBCs transact mainly with external entities and benefit from low tax rates. All GBCs
are licensed and regulated by Financial Services Commission (FSC). They are administered by
Management Companies (MCs) that provide services to them, for example applying for licenses or
providing other administrative procedures. Unfortunately, comprehensive sectoral data of assets and
liabilities and transactions has only become available recently. The Government of Mauritius started an
annual survey on GBCs in 2010/11, but the quality of the data still needs to be improved. This appendix
discusses the GBC sector’s impact on the domestic economy and external stability of Mauritius using
currently available data.
There are two types of GBCs: GBCs holding license #1 (GBC1s) and GBCs holding license
#2 (GBC2s). GBC1s are considered tax residents of Mauritius and the conduct of their business has to
be managed and controlled from Mauritius.2 Foreign investors investing in India or other countries with
which Mauritius has Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs) can benefit from low corporate
income tax rates and a zero capital gains tax if they invest through GBC1s in Mauritius. But GBC1s can
invest in or hold shares of onshore Mauritian companies, so they are not pure offshore entities. GBC2s
are required to have a registered agent in Mauritius, which shall be a MC. They are not considered tax
residents, therefore GBC2s cannot benefit from DTAAs. Since a GBC2 does not pay taxes on its worldwide profits to the Mauritian government, the GBC2 license is often used for setting up Special Purpose
Vehicles (SPV) for holding shares abroad. As of end-2012, a total of 7,833 GBC1s and 8,531 GBC2s were
licensed, a decline from end-2011, when 9,758 GBC1s and 14,166 GBC2s were registered.
The GBC sector is increasingly focusing on Africa to capture the high growth of the region.
Traditionally, most investments in the GBC sector in Mauritius have been directed to India. At the end of
2012, about 59 percent of total value of investments outward from GBC1s was to India. However, the
destination of new investments has shifted to African countries. More than half of new investments were
to African countries in 2012, and outstanding stock of investments to Africa has risen from 4.1 percent
in June 2010 to 14.0 percent in June 2013. The more geographical destination is diversified, the more
resilient the Mauritian offshore sector should be against idiosyncratic shocks in individual countries,
such as possible revision of the DTAA with India.

Linkage between offshore sector and onshore sector
GBCs’ contributions to the real economy are important but not dominant. The total output of GBCs
is not measured reliably in the official statistics; and the national account estimates currently exclude the
output of GBCs when calculating gross domestic product (GDP). The statistical services estimated that
the contribution of GBCs, comprising banks involved mainly in offshore (Segment B) activities and MCs,

GBC1s are required to have at least two Mauritian resident directors, maintain their principal bank account in Mauritius,
keep accounting records in their registered office in Mauritius, and have financial statements audited in Mauritius.

MAURITIUS

was about 3.5 percent of GDP in 2012. Direct employment created by GBCs at end-June 2012 totaled
1,169 jobs (about 0.2 percent of total employment). It should also be noted that the indirect
contribution to national output and job creation could be more significant, since other domestic
companies provide financial, legal or accounting services to GBCs. Considering that Mauritius has a
relatively diversified economy compared with peer small island countries, the offshore sector’s
contribution to the Mauritian economy is not dominant.
Financial spillovers from the offshore sector to the domestic financial sector through loan
exposures should be manageable. The stress test measures used in Appendix III were applied to
assess the soundness of banking sector in case of turmoil in the GBC sector. Under the stress scenario
that 30 percent of banks’ exposures to the GBC sector become non-performing loans, all banks
including those that serve primarily non-residents and/or the GBC sector maintain at least an 8 percent
CAR after the shock (Figure IV.1). Owing to the well-diversified lending portfolio of banks and adequate
level of initial CAR, the banking sector should be resilient against shocks to GBC sector. However,
turmoil in the GBC sector could also have an indirect impact on domestic financial sector through other
channels, though it is hard to quantify such indirect impact.

External capital flows through GBCs and reserve adequacy assessment
External capital flows through offshore sector are large and significantly bigger than those of the
onshore sector. Data on external financial flows through GBC sector have been available only for a few
years. The Bank of Mauritius included financial flows and foreign asset and liability positions of GBCs

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

53

MAURITIUS

into external statistics beginning with 2009 data.3 Financial flows related to asset or liability transactions
of the GBC sector are much larger than that of non-GBC sector (Figure IV.2). For example, in 2011, both
liability and asset transactions of GBCs in the BOP financial accounts were in excess of US$50 billion
(about 440 percent of GDP) compared to about US$ 4 billion for the non-GBC sector. Therefore, the
GBC sector needs to be taken into account when analyzing the stability of capital flows for Mauritius.
Most capital flows into and out of GBC sector are naturally hedged, so Mauritius should be
resilient against external shock of capital flows. The right panel of Figure IV.2 shows the breakdown
of the financial account transactions of the GBC sector. The volume of investment flows fluctuates
significantly from year to year possibly due to measurement problems or the fluctuating nature of
individual investment projects.4 For example, direct investment abroad by GBCs was some US$ 60 billion
in 2011, but “only” US$ 20 billion in 2012. However, by nature most GBC investments are equity
investments that are first channeled into Mauritius and then flow out as direct investments in other
countries. Funds stay in Mauritius for only a limited time and except for timing issues inflows and
outflows should be closely matched, which appears to be the case by comparing direct investment
abroad and direct investment in Mauritius in the right panel of Figure IV.2. Even portfolio flows are more
or less match in the historical data.

Moreover GBC flows are related to long-term direct investments, which should add to stability.
The majority of investment flows are related to direct investments which are longer-term and more
stable than portfolio and other investments. To the extent that GBCs are used as vehicles through which
foreign investors invest into Indian and other markets, the assets and liabilities of investment flows
should be matched with several months of lag. Moreover, as equity investments gains or losses would
affect Mauritius only indirectly through taxes paid and would have much less risks as debt financed
investments.

Only GBC1s are currently included in the balance of payment statistics in Mauritius. The authorities are working on
including GBC2s into the BOP statistics supported by technical assistance of the IMF Statistics Department (STA).
4

Due to data quality concerns, staff presents GBC transactions as a net figure in the other financial flows category in the
BOP instead of showing them under their respective category because the net figure is likely to be measured more
accurately than the individual positions. As data quality improves, this practice might be changed.

The activities of the offshore sector have some impact on prudential holdings of net international
reserves. Reserves appear comfortable in terms of the traditional thresholds of import cover (above
four months against the benchmark of three months) and percent of broad money (about 27 percent
against the benchmark of 20 percent) (see Figure IV.3, left panel). On the other hand, reserves are only
slightly above the traditional benchmark of 100 percent of short-term external debt, which includes the
short-term liabilities of the offshore banking sector. Since it is not certain that short-term liabilities of
the offshore banking sector would be covered by the international reserves of Mauritius in the event of
external shocks, the 100--percent criteria of short-term liabilities might be quite prudent.
Some further reserve accumulation might be justified due to Mauritius-specific factors. Reserves
appear adequate relative to the IMF composite indicator,5 which might be more representative of the
multidimensional sources of external risks. At an estimated 125 percent at the end of 2013, reserves are
in the middle of the recommended range (100 to 150 percent) when the liabilities of GBC sector are
excluded from the metric. However, if the external short-term debt and other liabilities of the GBC
sector were taken into consideration, the IMF metric would drop well below the comfortable range. It is
difficult to quantify to which extent GBC liabilities should be taken into account both because it is
unclear to which extent reserves are needed for the protection of the sector and because of some
uncertainty regarding the reliability of data on GBCs. However, to the extent that GBCs have investments
in or do business with the domestic economy, the external capital flows through GBCs could affect
reserves in the context of a shock. Moreover, given the presence of a large financial center in Mauritius
and some exposure to natural disasters, it may be useful to continue accumulating reserves as outlined
in the BOM’s reserve reconstitution program.

APPENDIX V. REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE ASSIGNMENTS OF
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

1

Local governments in Mauritius are heavily reliant on the central government and the current
arrangements pose significant fiscal risks. To contain such risks and avoid spillovers on the central
government, fundamental reforms are necessary. Reforms should encompass revenue generation, a more
transparent and objective transfer system, coupled with clear spending responsibilities for local
governments. Improved budgeting would also foster greater transparency and accountability. These
reforms should be properly designed, prioritized, and phased in over time.

Current intergovernmental fiscal arrangements
Mauritius has a two-tier government system, comprising the central government and municipal
councils (urban) and district councils (rural). Councils are governed by elected councilors and their
main functions are the provision of local public goods.
The current process gives councils some autonomy for their recurrent budget. The councils in
principle have to submit a balanced recurrent budget to the parent ministry for approval. However,
councils often send their budget to the ministry with significant deficits and the final approved budget
is then an iterative process. Capital budgets are dealt with separately on a case by case basis.
There is a significant divergence between the revenue raising powers of councils. Municipal
councils have more revenue raising instruments than district councils and their tax base is broader as
well. At the same time, some of the revenues that could accrue to the district councils are claimed by
other government institutions or the central government. It also appears that councils are not fully
aware as regard their own revenue raising powers.
The current revenue raising instruments are inadequate. For municipalities, the main source of own
revenue is the property tax, but the tax yield is meager (about 10 percent of total revenues). Low tax
yields reflect mainly administrative inadequacies tied to an outdated cadastre and valuations of
property, and low collection efforts. Fees and permits raise little revenue, while generating considerable
administrative and political costs. Additionally, several councils have revenue arrears, in part reflecting
weak administrative and enforcement capacity.
Councils are heavily reliant on the central government, but the current Grant-In-Aid (GIA)
formula is flawed. Almost 70 percent of council revenues come from GIA (Figure V.1). The current
formula, however, suffers from three major flaws. First, it is linked to historical spending and thus
benefits municipal councils that traditionally have had higher spending. Second, it ignores the revenue
raising ability of councils. Municipal councils receive a larger share despite having greater revenue
raising abilities. Third, the GIA does not provide incentives to mobilize own revenue.
Expenditure responsibilities are not clearly defined. There is significant overlap in the provision of
services between councils and various ministries. Several welfare services for the youth and elderly are
provided by both the councils and the related ministries. Similarly, there is an overlap as regard the
maintenance of coastal areas.

Rising risks
The decision to split district councils and the government’s wage policy has exacerbated
structural spending pressures. The administrative split has burdened councils with new overhead costs
in a context of a relatively fixed resource envelope. Moreover, the recent wage increase at the central
level was adopted by local governments, with the result that wage and pensions now account for
70 percent of spending (Figure V.2). This has crowded out other priority expenses, like capital
investment and street maintenance. These spending pressures could be further exacerbated by longerterm spending needs associated with increasing pension obligations.
Rising expenditure and sticky revenues have contributed to a deterioration of the financial
situation of local councils (Figures V.3 and V.4). All the councils had deficits in 2013, and most of
them ran out of funds in the fourth quarter. Since councils have very limited borrowing capacities, some
councils partly financed the overrun by dipping into previous savings, but all councils had recourse to
the central government.

* Based on preliminary 2013 data.

Absent a coherent revenue mobilization strategy, councils have relied on ad-hoc low-yield
measures. Councils have recently turned to permits and licenses to generate revenue. However, given
the narrow base this represents, the revenue mobilized remains marginal and comes at a significant
political and administrative cost. Other options being considered by councils—such as charging for
services—have not received the approval of the parent ministry.
Balanced budget constraints have also increased the incentives for window dressing. For instance,
some councils inflate spending in the budget proposed to the ministry to get an amount closer to their

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

57

MAURITIUS

needs. Some councils have used such a strategy in the past to run a surplus, which has been kept
outside of the normal budget process. Secondly, some councils have re-prioritized their spending
toward more immediate items at the expense of their pension contributions.
The current financial situation of local councils also pose health and safety risks. Taken in the
context of a relatively rigid resource envelope, the rising spending pressures can impact on the ability of
councils to deliver the basic services (road maintenance and refuse collection). With 70 percent of the
budget directed towards personnel, the risk of crowding out priority service delivery is real. There are
already large differences in the frequency with which some areas are serviced. Also, the maintenance of
infrastructure is often postponed when the budget constraint becomes binding.

Reform options
Fundamental reforms are required for both revenues and spending, but a comprehensive
strategy should be phased in gradually. Reforms need to be broad based to be effective and fair and
should be phased in gradually to increase political acceptability. Some big-ticket items can deliver
significant gains at low cost. To ensure these reforms gain political traction, a proper communication
strategy focusing on the overall risks and the gains to be achieved needs to be articulated. Improving
service delivery will also be a critical component in sustaining the success of a reform strategy.
The reforms also require improved coordination between the parent ministry and the councils.
While the legal framework allows for councils to raise their own revenue, this is somewhat constrained
by both the existing instruments and arrangements. Currently, councils are required to seek the
approval of the minister before implementing any measure. To ensure a level playing field across
councils, and increase the autonomy of councils, it would be useful to clarify which revenue raising
instruments councils can use. Additionally, to limit tax competition, the ministry should consider setting
the rates within bands. Councils operating within the defined bands should then not have to seek the
approval of the ministry when using such instruments. This would also go a long way towards
harmonizing the tax instruments across councils.
Revenue reforms
Reforming the GIA formula is an immediate priority, but the new formula should be phased in
gradually. Ongoing efforts to revise the formula (with AFRITAC South support) should be accelerated
with a view to fostering increased transparency and equalization. The first formula element aimed at
program-based budgeting items should reflect actual service needs and increasing quality incentives.
The other elements could be based on equalization criteria such as population, inverse of income per
capita, spending needs or fiscal capacities. It will also be important to ensure that the change to the GIA
does not adversely impact on the running of councils, particularly those that stand to lose from the
implementation of the new formula.2
License and other fees should be revised on a yearly basis. Recent efforts to increase the trade fees
have highlighted the risks of leaving rates unadjusted for an extended time period. In particular,
notwithstanding the real decline in revenue over time, the rare increases seem steeper. To avoid such

2

To foster political buy-in, some countries have adopted a “hold-harmless clause,” by transforming the existing amount
of the transfer into a lump-sum transfer fixed in nominal terms, based on data in the year preceding the reforms, but
applying the new formula for future increases. This ensures that no entity would be made worse off.

situations, yearly revisions to the fees, for instance by linking them to inflation, would likely be more
acceptable and efficient.
Local administrative and enforcement capacities should be strengthened. Low revenue mobilization
is also a reflection of inadequate capacity for monitoring the tax base and revenue collections. Low tax
compliance and increasing revenue arrears also reflect the limited enforcement.
Real estate taxes have significant potential for the medium term. Properly designed, real estate
taxes can offer a stable and significant tax base. It is also fairer since it is generally based on the value of
properties and can be designed so as minimize the impact on the poor. The forthcoming update of the
local authorities’ valuation and information management system (LAVIMS) offers a good opportunity to
reconsider real estate taxes. The design of such a tax should place particular emphasis on its structure,
the tax base and objective exemptions criteria, while also scaling up administrative and enforcement
capacities. Transition arrangements to the new taxes and collection arrangements could also be
considered.
Expenditure reforms
The expenditure assignments of councils should be clarified to eliminate overlaps and improve
program-based budgeting (PBB). As things stand, despite the PBB in place, the mandates of local
councils is unclear due to the overlaps with other ministries. At the same time, this would also facilitate
the allocation of funds through the GIA.
A benchmarking exercise across councils would be useful. Such an exercise should be undertaken at
the earliest opportunity to create benchmarks and identify improvement needs for potentially inefficient
councils. A staffing-need analysis should also be undertaken in view of the high share of spending
devoted toward personnel. Most councils spend about 70 percent of their budget on personnel,
compared to international benchmarks of 40-50 percent.
In the medium term, it is important to ensure that the pension obligations of councils are funded.
It is imperative to address the nonpayment of pension obligations by local councils to contain
contingent liabilities for the central government.
The above reforms need to be complemented with public financial management reforms and an
overall strengthening of the budget process. To facilitate budget preparation, it would be useful if
the overall envelope available to each council could be made available in advance. The budget
classification across councils should be harmonized to facilitate monitoring and consolidation with the
fiscal accounts. A standard template could be generated in this regard and legal provisions could be
enacted to ensure reporting on a quarterly, half-yearly and yearly basis.

APPENDIX VI. CONSIDERATIONS FOR INTRODUCING
AND EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT IN MAURITIUS
1

Earned income tax credits (EITC) have been used to encourage labor participation and provide social
assistance. EITC is a refundable personal income tax credit which provides a subsidy to earnings up to an
income threshold. Variations of the system are used in the U.S., U.K., Australia, Finland, Ireland, Canada,
New Zealand, Lithuania, Korea, etc. The EITC is the largest cash antipoverty program in the U.S. providing
benefits of up to $6,000 per year to families with children in 2013.
Low youth and female labor participation rates remain a challenge in Mauritius and there are gaps in the
poorly targeted social safety net. It would appear that an EITC might play a role in addressing these
problems. However, the costs and benefits of an EITC need to be assessed carefully and evaluated in the
context of available fiscal space and overall social welfare reforms. Staff currently believes that it would be
premature to introduce an EITC in Mauritius, but it could be considered as a longer-term option.

Motivation for introducing an EITC in Mauritius
An EITC has two main objectives. It augments the income of the working poor and encourages labor
force participation and employment, as only the working individuals are eligible. These two benefits
could potentially help to address two persistent problems in Mauritius, namely the poorly targeted
social safety net system, and low youth and female labor participation. The diagram below illustrates the
typical design of the EITC, where the tax benefits vary with the income level.

Figure VI.1. A Typical EITC as a Function of Income

Mauritius’s poverty rate is low but income inequality has increased recently. The 2012 Household
Budget Survey suggests that 9.4 percent of households were below the relative poverty line in 2012 (set
at half the median monthly household income, Figure VI.2) up from 7.9 percent in 2006/07. Also, income
inequality measured by the Gini coefficient increased from 0.388 in 2006/07 to 0.413 in 2012.
Mauritius has a large but relatively inefficient social safety net system, and there is a scope for
more targeted programs. The numerous programs are managed by different agencies, which results in
high administrative overhead. The universal basic pension is the largest program (Figure VI.3) but is not

targeted at all. The Social Aid Program is also poorly targeted with only one-third of the benefits going
to households in the poorest decile, while the wealthier half of households also receive one-third.2

Low participation and high unemployment among the young and women are a salient character
of Mauritius’s labor market. This is especially striking compared to OECD countries (see Figures IV.4
and IV.5). While policy measures targeting the employability of this population are important, a
mechanism like EITC could also help encourage labor participation. Studies from other countries
suggest that the size of the stimulating effect varies, so a careful assessment of the potential impact in
the Mauritian context would be very important before implementing an EITC.

Costs of implementing EITC
Introducing an EITC would impose a significant administrative burden on the Mauritius Revenue
Authority (MRA). The Mauritian tax system has been simplified over the years and the personal income
tax has a low 15 percent flat rate. With high exemption thresholds above 275,000 Rs (US$9,000) per
year, normally only some 150,000 persons (¼ of the formal work force) file annual tax returns.
Introducing an EITC would require processing 400,000 new returns. While this could be mitigated by
electronic filing (90 percent of individual taxpayers already file electronically), it would require significant
training for the new taxpayers. The potential for noncompliance and fraud would also increase.
Moreover, distributing welfare payments is not MRA’s strength and the resulting distractions might lead
to revenue losses and less taxpayer satisfaction and compliance, which would be problematic.
An EITC would have a high fiscal cost. The cost depends on the parameters and the objectives of the
EITC. Four scenarios are simulated using data from the 2012 Household Budget Survey (Figures VI.6 and
VI.7). For different cost envelopes, the Scenarios I and III favor employment participation by providing
higher benefits as incomes rise (and therefore more hours worked), up to a threshold. Scenarios II and
IV favor income augmentation by providing high initial subsidies to the working poor. With a cost of
0.3 percent of GDP, Scenario I could provide a maximum monthly support of about 1,000 Rs (US$33) per
household, while a cost envelope of 0.5 percent of GDP would raise the maximum monthly credit to
about 1,500 Rs (US$50) per household in Scenario II. These credits are not very large compared to the
poverty threshold of about 9,000 Rs per month, so in practice the cost of EITC could be higher.
The fiscal space for an EITC could be created in the context of broader social safety net reforms.
Given the government’s fiscal consolidation plans to achieve its medium term public debt target, fiscal
space for the EITC could be created by replacing other small and poorly targeted social welfare
programs. Such a comprehensive reform of social safety nets would allow the government to achieve
cost savings and improve poverty alleviation. For example, some estimates suggest that introducing
income means-testing for the basic pension and targeting the 40 percent of poorest elders could save
1 percent of GDP. Broaden the tax base over the medium term could also provide the necessary fiscal
space for a program like EITC.

Key Design Considerations
There are a number of factors to consider in designing an EITC, and in practice countries design
their EITC systems to serve different objectives. There is no single rule for the parameters; the system
can be more or less generous, and the design is dependent on the available fiscal space and the
interaction with other policies. The parameters usually also evolve over time.


What is the main objective of the EITC? If the main objective is to augment the income of the
working poor, the design would give more generous subsidies to the lower end of the income
distribution. However, if the main objective is to stimulate labor participation, the design would
target those workers above the minimum working hours so as to avoid disincentives to work.



Should EITC be provided to the self-employed? In principle, self-employed workers should be
covered by the EITC on the ground of fairness. However, this could disproportionally increase the
administrative costs and in some cases be difficult to implement and monitor.



Should there be an hour (or earnings) threshold? The U.S. EITC applies from the first dollar of
earnings, while the U.K.’s Working Tax Credit (WTC) imposes a threshold of hours. The rationale for
the hours threshold reflects the desired objective of stimulating labor market participation.
However, an hour threshold incurs potentially significant additional administrative costs as hours
information, which is normally not required for filing income tax, needs to be collected.



Are the overall social welfare, tax and labor market policies conducive to a successful EITC
program? The U.S. EITC’s success is often attributed to (1) relatively low minimum wages, which
results in lower cost for the same benefit coverage, (2) low social benefits (if other social welfare
benefits are dependent on income, then incentives to work created by an EITC may be offset by
reductions in other benefits caused by an increase in income), and (3) low tax rates (the higher are
existing marginal tax rates, the more costly it is to impose high phase-out rates). On these aspects,
Mauritius seems to have similar characteristics as the U.S.



Are there alternative or complimentary programs to EITC? For example, the government could
pay the social security contribution of the low-income workers, thus augmenting their take-home
income and provide an incentive to work. This could be a more cost-effective alternative because it
utilizes the existing social security system. Introducing an economy-wide minimum wage, which has
not existed in Mauritius previously, could provide similar income benefits to poor workers, but the
impact on employment tends to be negative if the threshold is set too high.

Concluding remarks
On balance, while EITC is theoretically appealing it is likely not suitable for Mauritius at this
stage. An EITC system could help alleviate poverty, especially for families with children, and provide
greater incentives for unemployed youth and women to work without placing additional burden on
employers. However, the current fiscal framework does not provide sufficient fiscal space for EITC. In
addition, implementing EITC would incur significant administrative costs on the Mauritius Revenue
Authority as only ¼ of personal income taxpayers are currently required to file tax returns through the
streamlined personal income tax.
EITC should only be considered as a longer-term option and only in the context of an overall
review of the social safety net. Longer-term social safety net options and the potential role for EITC
should be considered. Alternatives such as using the social security system to achieve some of the
objectives associated with EITC should also be explored. Among other things, the government needs to
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

63

MAURITIUS

determine the main objectives of the EITC, and assess the sizes of the potential benefits, the
administrative costs, and whether the medium term fiscal framework would allow sufficient fiscal space
for it. Given the large cost of social spending in Mauritius and its relatively poor targeting, a reform of
the social safety net is desirable, independent of the question of whether EITC would have a role in the
new system.

Exchange Rate Arrangement
Starting in July 1, 2010, Mauritius intervened occasionally in the foreign exchange market to
smooth excess volatility and the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified from free
floating to floating. Mauritius has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Section 2, 3, and 4. It
maintains an exchange system free of multiple currency practices and of restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. Mauritius also maintains
a liberal capital account. On March 19, 2014, US$1 was equivalent to MUR 30.10.
Article IV Consultation
Mauritius is on the standard 12-month cycle. The last Article IV consultation staff report (Country
Report No. 13/97, March, 2013) was completed by the Executive Board on April 3, 2013. A

THE JMAP BANK-FUND MATRIX (2014)
(As of March 20, 2014)
The IMF and World Bank Mauritius teams met on January 22 to discuss a Joint Managerial Action
Plan (JMAP). The team from the World Bank comprised of Mr. Muñoz (Country Representative),
and Mr. Revilla (lead Economist and sector leader), and from the IMF of Messrs. Petri, Inui,
Thakoor, Touna Mama and Xiao (all AFR).
The IMF’s work program entails continued engagement through the Article IV consultation
process as well as technical assistance in: public financial management, tax administration, and
economic forecasting provided through AFRITAC South (AFS); financial sector stability, monetary
policy frameworks, and central bank legislation through the Monetary and Capital Markets
Department (MCM) and Legal (LEG) Departments, and enhancements to macroeconomic
statistics with the support of the Statistics Department (STA).
The World Bank Group’s work program entails continuing work on infrastructure,
competitiveness, public sector reform and social sectors. The World Bank Country Partnership
Strategy for Mauritius up to 2015 aims at helping the Government to deal with (i) short-term
trade shocks and (ii) the transition to a more competitive and diversified economy, while
minimizing negative social impacts along the transition. On-going and planned Bank assistance
to Mauritius is:


Infrastructure. The Mauritius Infrastructure Project signed in December 2009 seeks to
support the government investment program in transport, water and electricity.



Preparation of a Grid Code, Feed-in-Tariffs & Model Energy Supply Purchase
Agreements for Renewable Energy Systems Greater than 50kW through a SIDS DOCK
Grant will seek to promote investment in renewable energy infrastructure, contribute to
energy security, reduce GHG emissions, and encourage household-private sector
investment in renewable energy technologies.



Policy Reforms. The Bank is expected to approve in 2014 a new DPL series. Building on
the reforms supported by the previous programmatic DPL series, the proposed operation
advances the competitiveness agenda through reforms to (i) improve the efficiency and
impact of public services aimed at private sector business development, (ii) underpin the
access, stability, and integrity of the financial system, and (iii) support transition to a
knowledge-based, entrepreneurial economy.



Analytical support. The Bank is preparing a report on poverty and income disparity to
analyze the impact that recent economic growth has had in income distribution in the
country. Technical assistance provided as part of the preparation of the DPL series will

aim to improve competitiveness and economic diversification in areas of higher value
added such as ICT and financial services.


Strengthening Public Sector Performance. The Strengthening Governance and AntiCorruption in Mauritius technical assistance will aim at strengthening governance and
anti-corruption in Mauritius through support to performance management, M&E and
institutional strengthening across the public sector, with a focus on strengthening M&E
at the MoFED.



Preparation of a Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD). As part of the preparation of
the upcoming strategy of the Bank with Mauritius, the new Country Partnership
Framework foresees the preparation of a SCD. This diagnosis exercise will be prepared by
WBG staff in close consultation with national authorities and other stakeholders.



International Finance Corporation (IFC). The IFC has focused its intervention in
Mauritius in the financial services sector along three axes: (i) supporting the banking
sector with access to long term funding to offset local banks’ difficulty in accessing long
term foreign exchange to support trade finance, cross-border south–south initiatives and
long term investments in key infrastructure; (2) investing in regional private equity funds
to increase regional integration with investments mainly along the Madagascar-Mauritius
axis; and, (3) supporting IFC clients to improve internal capacity by providing specialist
training to bank’s SME loan officers and SME-Owner managers to improve financial and
managerial literacy.

RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT
BANK GROUP
(As of March 24, 2014)
The African Development Bank (AfDB)’s 2014–2018 Country Strategy Paper (CSP) for Mauritius
will provide the framework for its partnership with the country in the given period. The objective
of this CSP is to help Mauritius build its competitiveness and resilience to exogenous shocks so
as to enhance the quality of growth and accelerate the country’s transition to a High Income
Country. In line with the Bank Group’s Strategy for 2013-22, this CSP focuses on interventions
that promote ‘green’ and ‘inclusive’ growth. It is designed to explore new ways of doing business
in Mauritius by focusing Bank support on deepening technical and knowledge advisory services
and catalyzing private investments to drive growth and create jobs. The CSP seeks to support
interventions in Mauritius under two complementary pillars - Pillar I: Building Infrastructure and
Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) and Pillar II: Deepening Skills and Technology Development.
Within the first pillar, the lending program focuses on infrastructure development particularly
energy, transport, and water and sanitation. Within the framework of a customized presence, the
Bank’s Infrastructure Investment Specialist will be resident in Mauritius to provide technical
advisory services and strengthen the Government of Mauritius’ capacity to structure PPPs. The
interventions are designed to inform policy dialogue and provide green and inclusive
infrastructure investment options to the government. The lending program within the second
pillar will support actions and policy reforms that will contribute to improving the quality and
relevance of education particularly higher education and Technical, Vocational, Education and
Training (TVET) and strengthen human capital. The Bank will also use this pillar as a platform to
facilitate skills and technology transfer to mainland Africa in areas where the country enjoys
competitive advantage such as financial services and governance. To further support policy
reforms, capacity building and studies in specific areas within the framework of the two strategic
pillars, the Bank will be providing grants from its Middle Income Countries Technical Assistance
Fund (MIC TAF). The grants will be used to fund the following activities: (i) study to inform multimodal climate resilient transport solutions; (ii) study on land-use planning and environmental
threats; and (iii) baseline study on e-education and adaptive learning. The Bank will continue to
collaborate very closely with other development partners including the World Bank, EU, AFD and
UNDP in supporting structural reforms through its policy based lending. The Government of
Mauritius acknowledges the important role the Bank is playing in Mauritius. In particular the
Bank’s approval to extend the Competitiveness and Public Sector Efficiency loan and providing
the Infrastructure Investment Specialist to play an advisory role on PPPs is a timely support to the
Government’s US$10 billion infrastructure program. A mid-term review of the CSP is
programmed for 2016 to review progress and assess continued relevance of the Bank’s strategic
orientation.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Mauritius
On April, 21, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Mauritius.
A stable macroeconomic environment was maintained in 2013, despite difficult external
developments. Real GDP growth was lower than expected at 3.2 percent in 2013, mainly on
account of construction, sugar and tourism. With subdued international prices, inflationary
pressures declined in 2013, despite the public sector wage increases, and year-on-year
inflation fell to 3.5 percent. The unemployment rate was unchanged compared to 2012 at
8.0 percent. Credit to private sector growth remained robust. On the external front, the
current account deficit widened to almost 10 percent of GDP in 2013. The reserve cover of
imports of goods and services stayed constant at 4½ months with the Bank of Mauritius
(BOM) accumulating additional net international reserves.
The fiscal policy stance was more expansionary than planned because of cyclical and one-off
factors but also slippages. The structural primary deficit was broadly unchanged relative to
2011. The overall deficit including extra-budgetary funds is estimated at 4½ percent of GDP.
While revenues remained broadly unchanged in proportion of GDP, expenditures increased
by over 2 percent of GDP. As expected wages increased following the Pay Research
Bureau’s (PRB) report, which increases civil servant salaries beyond annual inflation
adjustments periodically with the next adjustment expected in 2016. Additional spending was
also related to the flash floods in Port Louis as well as unplanned transfers to local
governments and public enterprises. Finally, capital spending including by the special funds
was 1 percent of GDP higher, though partially due to cost overruns.
Monetary policy was somewhat accommodative. Throughout the year, while a sluggish
domestic demand and low international inflationary pressures helped anchor inflation

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

expectations. The public sector wage increase related to the PRB report did not lead to strong
private sector wage pressures. In this context, the BOM maintained the policy rate at 4.65
percent in September 2013 and February 2014, following a 25 basis point reduction in June
2013. In October 2013, reserve requirements were raised from 7 to 8 percent to curb excess
liquidity in the banking system. The authorities continued building international reserves and
used limited interventions to moderate excessive fluctuations of the rupee. The banking
system remained well-capitalized and resilient in a strong regulatory context. Regulatory Tier
I capital to risk-weighted assets are well above Basel II and the proposed Basel III
requirements. Non-performing loans (NPL) increased slightly in 2013, but banks remained
profitable with a 20 percent return on equity, despite low leverage ratios. However, liquidity
ratios have worsened in recent years and are on the low side in international comparisons.
BOM is consulting with banks on implementation of Basel III regulations and continued to
publish its bi-annual CAMEL ratings for all domestic banks. It implemented macroprudential
measures aimed at addressing emerging NPLs in the construction and real estate sectors as
well as rising indebtedness. Threats to financial stability posed by a Ponzi-like scheme in
2013 were contained successfully, and the regulatory framework was subsequently improved.
Mauritius has established a track record as a reformer with strong institutions and a dynamic
private sector. The Africa Training Institute (ATI) is set to open in June 2014 in Ebene. The
country statistical capacity continues to be strengthened, including ongoing work on
Monetary and Financial Statistics (MFS) as well as balance of payments (BOP) and
international investment position (IIP) statistics. Mauritius subscribed to the IMF’s Special
Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in February 2012, being the second Sub-Saharan
African country to do so and is working on subscribing to SDDS Plus.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They noted that Mauritius’
prudent policies and strong institutions have delivered steady growth, well-anchored inflation
expectations, and continued financial stability. The near-term growth outlook is generally
favorable, but an uncertain external environment carries risks. Against this background,
Directors encouraged the authorities to consolidate recent macroeconomic gains, strengthen
policy buffers, and pursue greater economic diversification through structural reforms to
enhance the resilience of the economy.
Directors generally considered it appropriate to start tightening fiscal policy this year to
smooth adjustment and increase the likelihood that the 50 percent target for the debt-to-GDP

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any
qualifiers used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

ratio is achieved by 2018, as mandated by law. They encouraged the authorities to articulate
an ambitious consolidation strategy centered on better prioritizing public expenditure,
strengthening tax administration, and broadening the tax base. Subsidy reforms and an
overhaul of public enterprises, as well as an improved framework for fiscal devolution,
including a better use of real estate taxes, could also underpin the budgetary adjustment over
the medium term.
Directors agreed that the current monetary stance is broadly appropriate, but cautioned that a
withdrawal of accommodation might be necessary if inflationary pressures intensify. They
also suggested strengthening the institutional and operational arrangements that would
support the eventual adoption of a formal inflation targeting framework.
Directors noted that the banking system remains well-capitalized, profitable, and resilient to
shocks. They observed, however, that persistent excess liquidity in the banking system has
hindered the monetary transmission mechanism, while also encouraging disintermediation
and riskier lending. To address this issue, Directors encouraged the authorities to consider an
approach to liquidity management involving additional issuance of government paper for
monetary policy purposes and—more broadly—closer collaboration between the government
and the central bank. Similarly, coordination between the central bank and the nonbank
supervisor should continue to be strengthened to ensure the soundness of the overall financial
system.
Directors took note of the staff’s assessment that the rupee appears to be modestly
overvalued in real effective terms. To bolster Mauritius’s international competitiveness and
durably reduce the large structural current account deficit, they recommended greater
exchange rate flexibility, well-prioritized infrastructure investment, and stepped-up reforms
to address labor and product markets rigidities. Directors also agreed that the external
adjustment could benefit from further pension reforms that would boost national savings
while strengthening social protection.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to adopt the Fund’s SDDS Plus, and supported
ongoing efforts to improve the collection of financial and labor market statistics.

Statement by Mr. Kossi Assimaidou, Executive Director for Mauritius
April 21, 2014
On behalf of my Mauritian authorities, I would like to express their appreciation to
the staff for the constructive and engaging dialogue during the conduct of the 2014 Article IV
Consultation. The staff report provides an insightful analysis of the economy and helpful
advice, focused on policies to preserve macroeconomic stability and keep advancing towards
higher and sustainable growth. My authorities would also like to express their gratitude to
Management and staff for the high quality of technical assistance provided. This has been
crucial in the development of the appropriate economic and financial policies and their
implementation. The technical assistance provided, over the years, has been instrumental in
the economic progress achieved.
The Mauritian economy continued to perform moderately well in 2013, with a
broadly appropriate policy mix. Real GDP grew at 3.1 percent, as growth slowed down in
the construction, tourism, and information technology sectors. Inflation remained low at
about 3.5 percent, in spite of the public sector wage increases. The trade account improved
but the current account deficit increased due to decline in service exports, mainly income
from the Global Business Companies (GBC) transactions. The nominal exchange rate of the
Mauritian rupee remained broadly stable and the central bank continued to build international
reserves buffers.
Fiscal policy was slightly more expansionary than planned, due mainly to lower tax
revenue and unexpected outlays related to the early 2013 floods. Capital expenditure was
also higher than budgeted due to cost overruns. As a result the fiscal deficit and the public
debt ratio increased.
Monetary policy was appropriately accommodative. Inflation declined compared
to the previous year. However, an important concern of the authorities was the excess
liquidity in the economy. The Bank of Mauritius increased reserve requirements twice last
year in its efforts to remove excess liquidity. Presently, this excess liquidity is not putting
pressure on prices as the output gap is negative and there is little demand for domestic credit.
However, the situation does raise concerns as it is contributing to financial disintermediation
and banks are not encouraging new deposits as they become more costly for them. The low
interest rates and the excess liquidity are causing an increase in riskier lending, particularly in
some segments of real estate. In this regard, the Bank of Mauritius issued guidelines to
contain the expansion of loans toward the real estate sector and the increase in household
debt. Notwithstanding these developments, the banking system remains strong and profitable.
Banks are well capitalized, well above the Regulatory Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets of
Basel II and Basel III, and non-performing loans remain low.
Structural reforms were pursued. Measures that were budgeted have been
implemented. They are mostly in the transportation and water sectors with the aim to remove
infrastructure bottlenecks and improve productivity.

2
Economic Outlook for 2014 and the Medium-Term
Policies going forward will continue to focus on raising economic growth with
the objective of reaching high income status within a decade. Efforts will focus on
reducing external imbalances through, among others, fiscal consolidation and reforms to
remove infrastructure bottlenecks and improve productivity. Prudent investments in physical
and human capital should help raise total factor productivity, in spite of a zero population
growth. The authorities are of the view that their policies of encouraging economic
diversification, supporting domestic demand, and attracting foreign investors will result in a
higher growth rate than projected by staff. In this regard, they would note their successful
efforts at diversifying their tourist markets towards Africa and Asia, and also diversifying the
financial service sectors, especially the GBCs towards Africa. Together with the further
development of the maritime sector (seafood, transshipment, ships registration, etc), and the
expected recovery in their traditional export markets, the authorities expect real GDP growth
to strengthen over the medium term.
Fiscal Sector
The 2014 fiscal deficit is projected to be about the same as the previous year.
New measures like excise on cars and tobacco should help raise revenue. Current expenditure
is not expected to increase. However, total spending will increase as the authorities expand
capital spending, mainly investment spending in public infrastructure, strengthen social
safety nets, and foster the activities of the emerging sectors of the economy. More broadly,
given the weak economic activity in the country’s main trading partners, the authorities are
of the view that their policies, without being too expansionary, will help support economic
growth and employment.
Over the medium term, the authorities intend to pursue policies aimed at fiscal
consolidation in order to reduce external imbalances, and meet the debt target.
However, in trying to reduce the fiscal deficit, the authorities prefer to focus their adjustment
efforts on expenditure containment rather than revenue-increasing measures. They view the
present tax system that has been put in place over a number of years as being simple and
broadly efficient and one that attracts investors. However, they agree that the revenue system
can be improved, and in that context are planning to harmonize the customs and excise taxes
with Fund TA. They are also requesting Fund TA to develop and implement a system of real
estate tax. They have taken good note of the recommendations of staff regarding better
targeting of social assistance, and subsidies, and improving the financial performance of
state-owned-enterprises (SOEs) and local governments. As regards the latter the authorities
have greatly appreciated the presentation of staff during the Article IV Consultation. At the
same time, the authorities view with appreciation the work done by staff on pension. Many of
the recommendations of staff are under consideration and the technical work to prepare the
ground work for future reforms has started.
The debt outlook remains positive. The results of the debt sustainability analysis
indicate that public debt is sustainable over the medium term. The debt ratio has been on a
declining trend since 2003, but the stimulus implemented to counter the adverse effects of the
global financial crisis and the slowdown in economic growth have caused the debt ratio to

3
increase slightly. The authorities remain fully committed to the objective of bringing the
debt ratio down to 50 percent of GDP, and are confident that they will be able to reach this
objective with further fiscal consolidation over the medium term. Moreover, a strengthening
of real GDP going forward, based on both domestic measures, including public sector
investment, and better growth in trade partners will also contribute to a lowering of the debt
ratio.
The authorities are committed to reducing its involvement in State Owned
Enterprises (SOEs). The Mauritian authorities share the view of staff that a strengthening of
the financing of SOEs can both reduce government expenditure and ensure that the debt
target is met. In this regard, they have already started work on strengthening the financial
framework of the SOEs. A public sector governance office has been set up. It is responsible,
among others, to review the performance of the SOEs and to propose restructuring plans,
including privatization. In this regard, it is to be noted that the Development Bank of
Mauritius (DBM) is already being privatized. A system of Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
has been set up and is being monitored by the EU, under its budgetary support. The aim
eventually is for the private sector to become majority share owners of these enterprises and
for the government to use the proceeds from the sale to further reduce the public debt.
Monetary and Financial Sectors
The Bank of Mauritius will pursue its prudent monetary policy aimed at
maintaining price stability and orderly and balanced economic development. It will
continue to monitor external and domestic price developments closely and will tighten
monetary conditions, if the situation warrants it. The current “hybrid inflation targeting”
framework is serving Mauritius well and has helped to bring inflation down. It remains the
intention of the authorities to move to a full inflation targeting framework in the future.
The authorities are giving their full attention to the excess liquidity issue in the
economy. Over the past few weeks, representatives of the Bank of Mauritius and the
Ministry of Finance have met regularly to discuss the best ways to address the issue and the
modalities of a cost-sharing mechanism, as suggested by staff. In the meantime, both parties
have come to an agreement as to what level of excess liquidity could adversely affect the
economy. The Bank of Mauritius increased the reserve ratio for banks in March. The
Ministry of Finance has for its part decided to frontload its borrowing requirement for this
year, and to sell Treasury notes directly to the public and bear the associated costs. Moreover,
it has cancelled a substantial contingency loan from the African Development Bank. The
central bank is monitoring the situation carefully and future actions will be taken promptly,
as necessary.
The banking system remains strong. It is well capitalized and, as staff note, it is
resilient against a number of shocks according to stress tests. Nevertheless, additional macroprudential measures have been introduced to address possible vulnerabilities in the banking
sector. The central bank is continuing its work on a deposit insurance scheme (DIS). A draft
DIS Bill has been prepared after consultation with stakeholders, but will be strengthened with
further technical assistance from the Fund and World Bank before its presentation to
parliament. Moreover, in view of recent weaknesses that have appeared in the regulatory

4
framework of the non-bank financial sector, the Bank of Mauritius is strengthening its
coordination with the non bank financial supervisory institution, the Financial Services
Commission (FSC), to address those issues. Although there are important links between the
global business and onshore sectors, through notably job creation and provisions of services,
the contribution of the global business sector to the Mauritian economy is rather small and is
not a risk to the economy. Nevertheless, as the sector expands, the risks associated with their
activity could increase, and the authorities are taking steps to strengthen the statistical
coverage of the Global Business Companies (GBCs) and the regulatory framework.
In conclusion, while the economy is performing rather well, the authorities are
well aware of the challenges and risks to the outlook. They are in broad agreement with
the staff’s assessment and with the policy recommendations. They will continue to monitor
closely developments, both external and domestic, and will continue to implement reform
measures aimed at achieving a higher level of inclusive growth in an environment of
macroeconomic stability. In this regard, the authorities are working closely with the private
sector to develop a “blueprint” for the next six years to accelerate economic growth and
enable the country to reach high income status.
