Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation

Consultation and team. The 2010 Article IV Consultation discussions were held in Douala and
Yaoundé (March 18-April 1) and in Washington DC (April 25-27). The mission team met with
Prime Minister Yang, State Minister at the Presidency Esso, Finance Minister Menye, Economy
Minister Motaze, several other Cabinet members, BEAC National Director Mani, senior officials,
local authorities, the business community, donors, and representatives of labor and civil society
organizations. The team comprised Messrs. Mecagni (head), Nsengiyumva, Samake (all AFR),
Vidon (SPR), Yehoué (MCM), Ms. Muthoora (FAD), and Mr. Kpodar (Resident Representative).
World Bank and African Development Bank staff participated in the discussions.
Consultation focus. Policy discussions focused on the domestic impact of global economic
developments, the near-term heightened risks to financial and fiscal stability, and medium-term
macroeconomic prospects. The global crisis weakened economic activity, fiscal revenues, and the
external position in 2009, but by less than earlier anticipated. However, public expenditure and
treasury management worsened significantly, creating a serious systemic risk to the banking
system. The legacy of poor fiscal management in 2009 and uncertainty about the availability of
financing weigh on the 2010 budget execution.
Policy advice. The staff report recommends (i) strengthening public financial management as a
key priority; (ii) continuing efforts to improve nonoil revenue mobilization; (iii) reviewing
spending plans for 2010 in the light of pressure from unsettled payment obligations, the likely
contingencies in budget outlays, and the financing that can realistically be mobilized; (iv) closely
monitoring the conditions of the banking system in coordination with the regional supervisors;
and (v) creating a more conducive environment for private sector-led growth.
The authorities’ position. The authorities shared the staff’s assessment of risks and
vulnerabilities. They committed to addressing weaknesses in public expenditure and treasury
management and to preserving the stability of the banking system. Initial steps were taken to this
end. Nonetheless, a strategy to address the financing gap in the 2010 budget remains unspecified.
The authorities indicated that they are working on a program of reforms—aligned to their new
PRSP—that could be supported by a new Fund arrangement, but need more time to achieve
internal consensus.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
While significant reforms were undertaken under the PRGF arrangement
completed in January 2009, Cameroon’s growth performance remained weak and the
economy vulnerable to exogenous shocks. Under the PRGF, tax and customs
administrations were strengthened, macroeconomic stability was preserved, and debt relief
under the HIPC and MDRI Initiatives helped firm up debt sustainability (Figure 1).
However, Cameroon’s growth performance remained constrained by weak infrastructure;
poor governance and business environment; limited absorption capacity; a shallow financial
sector; and obstacles to trade. In per capita terms, real GDP stagnated in 2005-09, and the
incidence of poverty remained unchanged, actually worsening in rural areas. The country
remains dependent on commodities for export earnings and fiscal revenues and thus is
vulnerable to a decline in external demand and world prices.

2.
Cameroon’s vulnerability to exogenous shocks was highlighted during the 2009
Article IV consultation. On that occasion, the Executive Board approved a
US$144.1 million disbursement under the rapid-access component of the Exogenous Shocks
Facility (RAC-ESF) to help the country weather the impact of the global crisis. Directors
underscored the critical importance of achieving greater nonoil revenue mobilization;
strengthening public expenditure management; improving governance and transparency; making
the business environment more attractive; and enhancing the role of the financial sector.

Box 1. Cameroon: Response to Previous Fund Advice
Policy Area

Fund Advice

Outcomes

Public financial
management

(i) Strengthen public financial
management;
(ii) Eliminate fuel subsidies and
take targeted measures to
protect the poor and sectors
facing difficulties.

Reforms in tax and customs administrations
were pursued, notably by removing tax
exemptions for several enterprises and
improving the computerized customs
system, but little progress was made in
reinforcing expenditure tracking. Fuel
subsidies were not eliminated. Taxes and
royalties were reduced for the forestry sector
and targeted subsidies provided to the
agriculture sector.

Financial sector
stability

Monitor closely developments
in the banking sector, in
collaboration with the regional
supervisor, and ensure timely
assessment of asset quality.

Protracted delays by the government in
settling its payment obligations, as well as
the weak regulatory framework, led to heavy
banks’ exposure to some common
borrowers.

Other structural
reforms

(i) Expedite reform strategies
for public enterprises;
(ii) Improve governance and
make the business environment
more attractive;
(iii) Urge CEMAC partners to
further liberalize trade.

Steps were taken in restructuring the airline
and the postal services companies. Efforts to
improve governance were intensified, and a
forum for dialogue between the private
sector and the government was set up to
improve the business environment. No
concrete progress was made on trade
reforms.

3.
A new poverty reduction strategy paper (November 2009) recognizes the
disappointing growth and poverty reduction record. It identifies five key priority areas
to accelerate growth: (i) infrastructure development in energy, telecoms, and transport;
(ii) development of rural and mining sectors; (iii) improvement in human resources through
health, education, and training; (iv) greater regional integration and export diversification;
and (v) financial sector deepening. The JSAN (www.imf.org) for the new PRSP was
circulated to Directors in February 2010.

7
4.
The political situation is broadly stable. However, social discontent could
reemerge, as in 2008, ahead of the presidential elections in 2011. Parliament amended the
constitution in April 2008 to allow the President to stand for a third term.
5.
Data provision to the Fund is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, but
there are important gaps in fiscal and financial sector information. Government
financial operations on a commitment basis (consistent with accounts on a cash basis) and
financial sector soundness indicators are not regularly available. The quality and timeliness
of balance of payments statistics need also to improve. The authorities have recognized
these deficiencies and have requested TA support to address these matters.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE
EXOGENOUS SHOCK FACILITY
6.
The global crisis slowed the pace of economic activity in Cameroon. Lower
demand and commodity prices affected exports and fiscal revenues, and tighter financing
conditions delayed investment projects in energy and mining. Real GDP growth decelerated
from 2.9 percent in 2008 to 2 percent in 2009 (Table 1). Food and fuel price pressures eased,
leading to a decline in headline inflation to the regional convergence criterion of 3 percent in
2009, down from 5.3 percent in 2008. Inflation continued to decelerate to a twelve-month
rate of 2.2 percent in March 2010.
7.
The impact of the crisis on external accounts was less than anticipated. Exports
of oil products plummeted, reflecting a fall in production and world prices, but light crude
petroleum imports also contracted sharply. Some nonoil exports have rebounded since
mid-2009.1 Remittances fell more than initially projected. As a result, the external current
account deficit widened by about 1 percentage point of GDP (less than the 4 percentage
points anticipated at the time of the 2009 Article IV consultation), but the overall external
balance, excluding the new SDR allocation received in 2009, remained positive (Table 4).
8.
The authorities responded to the crisis by protecting priority spending and
supporting sectors in distress. Despite lower revenues, original spending allocations to
investment, health, and education were broadly maintained. To protect the sectors most
affected, the authorities reduced taxes and royalties on timber; settled outstanding VAT
credits to the cotton sector; and subsidized inputs and fertilizers for agriculture.
9.
Performance on reforms agreed under the RAC-ESF was mixed. The authorities
removed tax exemptions for 19 large enterprises; improved the use of a computerized
customs system; introduced a GPS-based mechanism to track merchandise in transit and
reduce tax evasion; reduced the number of tax forms; stepped up prosecution efforts against

officials charged with misappropriation of public funds; and established a new forum for
dialogue between government and the private sector to improve business climate. However,
other committed measures were not implemented, including the settlement of arrears to the
national oil refinery and the elimination of fuel subsidies. The presentation of fiscal data on
a commitment basis continued to lag and little progress was made on public enterprise
reform.
10.
Fiscal accounts for 2009 show a limited overall budget deficit, on a cash basis,
despite a shortfall in total revenue (Text Table 2). Revenue including grants amounted to
18.4 percent of GDP, compared with 19.2 percent projected at the time of the RAC-ESF and
20.8 percent of GDP in 2008. The shortfall is primarily explained by the decline in oil prices
and crisis-related tax reduction measures affecting nonoil revenues. Total expenditure was
broadly maintained (18.4 percent against 18.7 percent of GDP projected) although its
composition shifted from capital to current spending. The deficit on a cash basis, after
accounting for the clearing of outstanding arrears audited in previous years, was modest
(0.2 percent of GDP).2 Reflecting deficit financing, the amortization of external and
domestic debt and the absence of an operational market for government securities, usable
government deposits at the BEAC dropped to the equivalent of one month’s expenditure at
end-2009, compared with 1.6 months targeted under the RAC-ESF.3
11.
However, public financial management (PFM) worsened significantly in 2009.
Government operations’ accounts on a cash basis give an incomplete picture of the fiscal
stance, as they do not include the surge in government payment obligations for fiscal
operations that did not reach the cash settlement stage. There were three types of unsettled
government obligations in 2009, as shown in Text Table 3 and Box 2:


Delayed payment for losses incurred since 2008 by the national oil refinery,
SONARA, on account of the fuel pricing policy. These losses reached
CFAF 98.3 billion at end-2009 (1 percent of GDP) and were estimated at about
CFAF 106 billion in March 2010. The government had committed, under the
RAC-ESF, to compensate SONARA but this commitment was not upheld.

2

Arrears cleared in 2009 were part of the stock of arrears audited in 2005 and 2007. Out of the total stock of
arrears recognized by past audits, about CFAF 120 billion remained outstanding at end-2008. The government’s
plan is to have all this stock cleared by end-2014, as agreed under the PRGF program—thus fiscal accounts
tables include scheduled flows of arrears to be cleared annually (about CFAF 20 billion).

3

Usable government deposits are those readily available (not earmarked) for government operations.

9


Unsettled payment orders (UPOs). During 2009, UPOs increased sharply, reaching
CFAF173 billion (1.7 percent of GDP). The stock of UPOs accumulated since 2006
reached CFAF 223.4 billion (2.1 percent of GDP) at end-2009.4



Expenditure committed and for which services have been provided, but no payment
orders issued (validated DENOs). The 2007 new Public Finance Law requires priority
clearance of validated DENOs incurred the previous fiscal year. Validated DENOs
incurred in 2009 are estimated at CFAF 110 billion, or 1 percent of GDP, to be settled
through a 2010 budget appropriation.

In addition, budget transparency weakened. The National Hydrocarbon Company (SNH),
which collects the bulk of government’s oil revenue, was used to fund some government
spending operations outside the normal treasury process.

UPOs are not recognized as arrears in Cameroon, regardless of the date of issue of the payment orders, and are
only recorded in the table of central government operations at the time of their payment. Cash spending in each
year reflects in part payment of previous years’ UPOs.

12.
Reflecting PFM and supervisory problems and the impact of the crisis, banking
system soundness deteriorated (Box 3).


The banking system became heavily exposed to a common borrower, the oil refinery
(SONARA), which had to turn to bank financing to compensate for the government’s
long delays in settling its obligations. This common borrower channel has become a
source of systemic risk.5



The NPLs ratio increased from 11.5 to 12.9 percent in 2009 (Table 6), reflecting both
the weaker economy in 2009 and the more aggressive bank lending behavior in 2008,
in which bank credit to the non-government sector had risen by about 15 percent in
real terms. Cameroon’s NPL ratio remains higher than the CEMAC average.



Cameroon also experienced a significant retrenchment in foreign bank loans during
the first half of 2009. The retrenchment was part of a longer-term trend of declining
international bank exposure to the country relative to GDP.

5

Long delays in government payments to SONARA strained its liquidity and magnified its bank borrowing
needs. By end-2009, SONARA had become the largest borrower for nine out of the twelve banks operating in
Cameroon. For several banks, exposure to SONARA reached more than 90 percent of regulatory capital.

11

Box 2. The Public Expenditure Chain and Arrears Issue
The normal procedure for expenditure on goods and services in Cameroon has four stages:
1.engagement (commitment) 2. liquidation (validation phase) 3.ordonnancement (payment order),
and 4. Paiement (payment).
Weak public expenditure management
can lead to the accumulation of
domestic and external arrears.
Typically, these arise between
stages 3 and 4, when payment orders
remain unsettled beyond a certain time
frame. According a CEMAC directive
adopted in June 2008, unsettled
payment orders (UPOs), known as
Treasury float or “restes à payer” in
Cameroon, should be considered as arrears after 90 days.1 This directive is not currently applied in
Cameroon and there is no systematic tracking of UPOs’ duration. Therefore, there is no clear
distinction between “normal” treasury float and arrears within the total stock of UPOs.
UPOs increased in 2009, in parallel with the clearance of a high level of previous years’ UPOs.
This could have resulted from multiple causes, including poor or fragmented cash flow planning
and management; over-optimistic revenue forecasts; deficiencies in the treasury information
system for tracking revenue and expenditure flows; the impact of extraordinary or unbudgeted
expenditures; and nonbudgeted clearance of UPOs from previous years.
Another type of government payment obligation may occur between stages 1 and 3 (DENOs).
DENOs which have been validated (between stage 2 and 3) but remain unpaid can be a source of
arrears. DENOs cannot be easily traced, especially for expenditures committed by decentralized
services of the central government. The concentration of expenditure commitments by line
ministries towards the end of the fiscal year is the major source of this type of obligations.
DENOs may also originate in exceptional procedures for expenditure or payment. A requirement
of the new Public Finance Law implemented for the first time this year is that annual budgets
contain an appropriation for DENOs incurred and validated in the previous year.
1

The definition of arrears favored by the IMF is different; an arrear arises if no settlement is made 90 days
after the delivery of the goods or services (validation phase).

12
Box 3: Risks and Vulnerabilities in Cameroon’s Banking Sector
The bank regulatory framework encourages excessive credit concentration. Current bank
regulation caps lending to a single borrower at 45 percent of regulatory capital, a very high limit by
international standards (typically 15-20 percent). In addition, upon request by banks, the regional
supervisory body (COBAC) grants every year exceptions whereby banks are allowed to lend up to
90 percent of their regulatory capital to “strategic enterprises”. Loans thus tend to be concentrated on
a small number of large debtors, mainly public enterprises. At end-2009, the five largest exposures
accounted for about 30 percent of bank loan portfolios.
The high exposure to large enterprises could also reflect some caution by banks in lending to
smaller enterprises where NPLs are already high. The manufacturing sector, which comprises
most of the large enterprises and had a low NPL ratio (6.5 percent in 2009), received 30 percent of
total bank loans in 2009. By contrast, the wholesale and retail sector, which encompasses many
small and medium enterprises, exhibits the highest NPL ratio (about 34 percent in 2009) and
received about 13 percent of total loans.
Another risk factor is connected lending. Breaches to regulatory limits on connected lending are
concentrated in banks controlled by local private shareholders. This is one factor contributing to the
distress of one commercial bank in 2009.
Cameroon experienced a significant retrenchment in foreign bank loans in recent years. This
has resulted from the impact of global liquidity conditions on lending to banks’ local affiliates.
Other country risk factors, such as a perception of higher country risk linked to the social unrest in
2008, played a role.
The decline in Cameroon’s exposure to international banks is not just a short term
phenomenon. The Bank of

banking integration is all the more
challenging for Cameroon as alternative channels of financing (like security issuance) are not yet
developed. In an environment where external private financing is becoming intensely competitive,
the same reforms that are needed to unfetter Cameroon’s productive potential, such as raising
standards of governance and strengthening oversight institutions, are also needed to help attract
sustained foreign bank inflows.

13
13.
Banking sector vulnerabilities came to the fore in late 2009. In November, a large
local bank experienced a deposit run, following the appointment of a provisional
administrator due to protracted violation of prudential regulations. The authorities’ first
response included a temporary waiver of the reserve requirement, moral suasion on large
public entities to keep deposits at the distressed bank, and emergency liquidity provision by
the BEAC. Pressures eased after the Minister of Finance announced the government’s
participation in the recapitalization of the bank. An audit of the bank has been completed,
and a restructuring plan is under consideration.
14.
Broad money expanded moderately, reflecting the slowdown in economic
activity and, consequently, in money demand. Money growth declined to 7 percent, from
13 percent in 2008. Growth of bank credit to the non-government sector slowed to
7 percent, from about 20 percent in 2008; net bank credit to the central government
expanded by 20 percent; and net foreign assets by some 3.5 percent.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS: PRESERVING MACROECONOMIC
STABILITY AND FOSTERING GROWTH

15.
The authorities recognize that the impact of the global crisis and the recent
deterioration in PFM have increased vulnerabilities. Against this backdrop, policy
discussions focused on: (i) improving PFM conditions; (ii) managing risks to the 2010
budget; (iii) ensuring stability and development of the financial system; (iv) safeguarding
debt sustainability; (v) promoting growth; and (vi) the medium-term outlook.
A. Improving PFM Conditions
16.
The authorities and staff agreed on the urgent need to correct the weaknesses in
expenditure and cash management that occurred in 2009. To mitigate the risks involved,
staff advised the following policy actions:


Clear all arrears to SONARA to avoid serious implications for the banking system,
and undertake a comprehensive audit of all outstanding UPOs;



Implement the 2008 CEMAC Directive on the definition of government arrears
(90-day rule); avoid accumulating new arrears and limit the level of UPOs by
strengthening cash management and stopping budget commitments within the
prescribed time limit to prevent spillovers on the following year’s budget;6



Prepare monthly fiscal data on a commitment basis and regular information for the
four stages of the expenditure chain to allow for tracking the level of DENOs and
UPOs, and a better assessment of the fiscal stance; and

6

The Fiscal Regime Law requires that commitments be stopped at end-November in each fiscal year.

14


Improve the cash management system by (i) preparing a periodic treasury plan;
(ii) enforcing the rule requiring the use of a Treasury single account for all
government operations; and (iii) avoiding expenditure outside the normal budgetary
procedures, including operations by SNH on behalf of the government.

17.
The authorities have started to address these challenges. Three steps have already
been undertaken. First, a reconciliation of fiscal data between government departments has
been conducted to assess the nature and level of UPOs accumulated in recent years. This has
led to a downward revision of the initial estimate to CFAF 223.4 billion (2 percent of GDP).
Second, about 70 percent of this stock was settled in the first quarter of 2010. Third, the
authorities have contacted the BEAC in order to use the SDR allocation to settle the
end-2009 stock of payment obligations to SONARA.
18.
In addition, measures are being taken to deepen PFM reforms initiated with
support from various donors. A medium-term plan for the modernization of PFM was
adopted in 2009, together with institutional arrangements for its implementation. In this
context, staff underscored the need to address existing shortcomings in the budget execution
process, notably by:


Establishing effective mechanisms to track expenditure flows through the budget
execution process and bring into control the level of UPOs, DENOs, and other payment
obligations to prevent the emergency of new arrears in the future;



Enforcing the Public Procurement Code to ensure that the procurement process is
competitive and that public entities do not rely on single-source contracts;



Improving the public investment budget by enhancing programming in line ministries;
coordinating work between central (Economy and Finance) and line ministries; and
building continuity for investment financing through multi-year commitment
appropriations; and,



Strengthening the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) to facilitate the
translation of PRSP priorities into the annual budget preparation process.

The authorities agreed that the current budget preparation and execution processes needs to
be strengthened to ensure that budget allocations are consistent with the PRSP objectives,
and to enhance transparency, accountability, and efficiency in the use of public resources.
They stressed the need for sustained donor technical assistance in the PFM area.
B. Controlling the Risks for the 2010 Budget
19.
The 2010 budget, approved in December 2009, critically relies on mobilizing
domestic revenues and financing, as well as an improved execution rate for public
investment. Projected revenue is based on an optimistic real GDP growth assumption
(3.9 percent). Budgeted expenditures (19.2 percent of GDP, compared with 18.4 percent of
GDP in 2009) provide for higher wages and salaries, subsidies (including for fuel), and a
large increase in capital spending. The budget also includes a provision to clear DENOs
accumulated in 2009. The overall budget deficit is projected at about 3 percent of GDP. The
budget relies on two main sources of domestic financing: (i) drawings of CFA 205 billion
(1.8 percent of GDP) from government deposits at the BEAC; and (ii) issuance of

15
government bonds for CFAF 200 billion (about 2 percent of GDP) on a not-yet-operational
regional market for government securities.
20.

The 2010 budget framework is problematic, for the following reasons:



Domestic revenues are likely overestimated, owing to overstated oil production and
nonoil GDP growth projections.



The large increase in infrastructure-related spending (to about 6 percent of GDP, from
4 percent of GDP in 2009) is unrealistic in view of Cameroon’s record of low public
investment execution (about 50 percent on average over the last three years) and
persistent absorption capacity problems.



Based on current WEO projections for world oil prices, budgeted fuel subsidies could
fall short by about CFAF 60-70 billion (0.5-0.6 percent of GDP).



There is no provision for contingent spending linked to the government’s
commitment to participate in the recapitalization of a large commercial bank.



The budgeted drawing on bank deposits exceeds the stock of usable deposits
available. Moreover, the delayed launch of the regional bond market has prompted
the authorities to limit the issuance of bonds on the shallow domestic financial
market.

21.
Against this background, staff advised the authorities to revise the 2010 budget,
preferably through a supplementary budget. While no decision has yet been taken, the
authorities agreed that the following considerations should be taken into account:


The allocation for fuel subsidies should prevent any further accumulation of arrears to
the oil refinery. A lasting solution to this problem would require reassessing the
current fuel price policy including by restoring the mechanism for the automatic
adjustment of retail fuel prices; streamlining taxes on petroleum products; and
replacing fuel subsidies by a more targeted social safety net. However, the authorities
viewed staff advice as difficult to implement in the current social and political
context.



A provision of CFAF 20 billion (0.2 percent of GDP) for the government’s
participation in the recapitalization of the distressed bank was discussed with the
authorities. This may underestimate the fiscal costs of the bank restructuring, given
the still uncertain participation of private investors.



The execution rate for public investment should be realistic, taking into account the
country’s record, and concrete actions being taken to improve absorption capacity.



Recourse to accumulated deposits should be considered carefully to avoid further
weakening an already reduced fiscal buffer for government operations in case of
exogenous shocks. The use of BEAC statutory advances, aside from their high cost,
could send inconsistent signals at a time when the central bank plans to promote the
development of a regional market for government securities as a replacement of this
instrument. However, it could constitute a last-resort source of financing.



Because of limited absorption capacity of the domestic financial market, staff stressed
the need to conduct the planned issuance of bonds by pre-announcing the schedule of
sales, and testing the market reaction to a limited initial tranche. The authorities are
discussing the issuance with domestic financial institutions.

22.
The discussions led to revised projections for 2010, but a financing gap close to
2 percent of GDP still remains (Tables 2 and 3). The authorities have yet to decide on their
strategy to close the residual gap. They indicated that they need more time to explore and
agree on the best options. Given the past record of execution and the existing infrastructure
gaps, staff cautioned on the risks for the investment budget to bear disproportionately the
burden of fiscal adjustment, as this would jeopardize the objective of reducing the
constraints to growth. Staff advised that sustained efforts for greater revenue mobilization
and a gradual phasing out of fuel subsidies could contribute to closing the financing gap in
2010–12.
C. Safeguarding Financial System Stability
23.
The authorities recognize that the concentration of bank credit is an important
source of vulnerability. Liquidity problems at large common borrowers—typically
state-owned enterprises—due to protracted delays in settling government’s obligations

17
could severely affect the health of the banking system. The authorities broadly agreed with
staff on the urgency of mitigating risks by:


Using the SDR allocation to clear the stock of arrears to the oil refinery to SONARA.



Closely monitoring with COBAC the evolution of banking system vulnerabilities, and
requiring COBAC to strengthen oversight of systemic risks and aggregate exposures
of major borrowers.



Facilitating a quick emergence of restructuring plans for financial institutions in
difficulty; the fiscal cost of such plans should be kept to a minimum and recognized
in the budget.



Engaging COBAC in lowering the prudential ratios on risk concentration (Box 2) and
eliminating the practice of exempting strategic enterprises, with a view to gradually
reduce existing large exposures and facilitate syndication and diversification of bank
exposures.

24.
Financial intermediation and access to bank credit remains hampered by a
poorly functioning judicial system and limited information on creditworthiness of
borrowers. The authorities agreed to accelerate the implementation of their action plan to
deepen financial intermediation. The plan, which is based on the recommendations of the
2007 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update mission, intends to (i) improve
credit information by supporting the BEAC in finalizing implementation of the central credit
registry; (ii) introduce financial instruments appropriate to small and medium enterprises
such as factoring, leasing, and venture capital; and (iii) improve contract enforcement by
setting up a court dedicated to commercial matters and facilitating out-of-court settlements.
Staff advised against creating specialized financial institutions (for agriculture and SME
financing) that inherently involve vulnerable and undiversified sectoral loan portfolios.
D. Preserving Fiscal Sustainability
25.
The medium-term fiscal anchor in Cameroon should be the nonoil primary
deficit, taking into account the nonrenewable nature of oil revenue and the need to
scale-up public investment to address the severe infrastructure gaps. Financing the
ambitious PRSP agenda may initially translate into higher fiscal deficits and debt.
However, growth dividends from resolving the severe infrastructure bottlenecks could be
important to maintain a sustainable fiscal position. Staff concurred with the authorities that
there is some fiscal space to accommodate much-needed capital spending. A coherent
strategy would involve: (i) pursuing efforts to improve nonoil revenue mobilization;
(ii) raising the execution rate of the public investment budget and developing public-private
partnership in investment projects; (iii) keeping the buffer of usable government deposits at
an appropriate level (at least one month of total spending); and (iv) strengthening debt
management with a view to maintain a prudent borrowing policy.

18
26.
Mobilizing nonoil revenue continues to pose a challenge. Nonoil revenue
performance is still among the weakest in the region.7 Given that tax rates on capital income,
labor, and consumption are already high, broadening the tax base through tax administration
reforms is a key priority.8 The authorities agreed that priority should be given to:


Strengthening the large enterprises division (DGE), and the tax centers offering
accounting and tax advice to small and medium size enterprises;



Simplifying and easing tax and customs procedures by, in particular, continuing to
reduce the number of tax forms;



Streamlining exemptions and other incentive-producing tax regimes by establishing
eligibility criteria, harmonizing tax benefits, and improving monitoring of recipients;



Continuing to combat customs fraud by a more effective tracking system to monitor
transit trade;



Reducing the time limit for paying VAT refunds, with a view to shore up the private
sector’s compliance with the VAT and improve the business climate.

Implementation of these actions, together with the projected growth in nonoil activity, is
expected to generate an improvement in the nonoil revenue to nonoil GDP ratio.
27.
The joint Bank-Fund debt sustainability analysis (DSA) suggests that
Cameroon’s risk of debt distress remains low. This assessment is broadly unchanged
from the 2009 DSA, though the baseline debt trajectory is less favorable because of recent
borrowing developments and the revised fiscal outlook. However, all external debt ratios are
projected to stay below the relevant thresholds under the baseline and the stress tests. The
public debt burden indicators do not suggest increased concerns for debt sustainability. The
authorities shared the low risk assessment. As addressing infrastructure deficiencies is
considered a key priority, they see the low debt vulnerability as providing some space for a
reasonable increase in debt-financed public investment.
28.
Staff reiterated the need for continued prudent external borrowing. This should
rely on grants and highly concessional resources (where available) to finance government
operations and on improved PFM conditions to avoid domestic arrears. Alternative sources
of financing should also be developed to reduce vulnerability. Staff encouraged the

average for nonoil low-income SSA countries.

The current VAT and most excises are already set at the maximum allowed by the CEMAC directives. The
prevailing VAT rate is 19.25 percent. The standard rate for excises is 25 percent. The Corporate income tax
rate is 38.5 percent. Personal income tax rates range from 10 to 35 percent. The oil and forestry sectors are
subject to additional taxes through special regimes applicable for these activities.

authorities to continue to work with BEAC and take action to develop a regional market for
government securities.
E. Boosting Competitiveness and Economic Growth
29.
Boosting growth is the key pillar of the new PRSP. The authorities intend to
tackle the key constraints, including underinvestment in critical infrastructure, unfavorable
business climate, poor public financial management, and weak regional trade integration.
The new PRSP envisions significant investment in energy, roads, port infrastructure, water
supply, and information technology.9 It also plans to improve the business climate and
accelerate regional integration.
30.
Cameroon’s exchange rate appears to be broadly in line with fundamentals, but
competitiveness is hampered by nonprice factors linked to a weak business
environment. The real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated by 1.3 percent in 2009
(annual average) as the appreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate (following the
appreciation of the euro against other major currencies during most of the year) was partly
offset by the modest negative inflation differential between Cameroon and its trade partners.
Based on the Consultative Group on Exchange Rates (CGER) approach, the REER appears
broadly in line with fundamentals (Box 4). External sustainability estimates, however,
indicate a moderate overvaluation. This could be corrected if the euro current weakness is
sustained. Survey data on the business environment show that Cameroon ranks in the
bottom quartile for most indicators (Figure 2). The 2009 Enterprise Survey highlights
multiple constraints faced by investors. All these indicators show that improving
Cameroon’s business environment remains a major challenge.

9

Large projects have been identified in the new PRSP for key sectors of the economy and most of them are
expected to be funded through public–private partnerships. These include energy (Kribi natural gas power
station, Lom Pangar hydropower dam); transport (rehabilitation and upgrading of existing road network, deep
sea port in Kribi, construction of new railway facilities); and water distribution (rehabilitation and extension of
existing infrastructure).

20
Box 4. External Competitiveness and Real Exchange Rate Assessment

Based on medium-term nominal growth
projections, the REER would need to depreciate by about 8 percent to stabilize NFA-to-GDP. Alternative
methodologies seek to take into account the specificity of oil-producing economies, by estimating the
return on oil wealth. In Cameroon, the nonoil current account deficit is larger than the expected return on
oil wealth. Conclusions in terms of exchange rate misalignment are however blurred by uncertainty over
total hydrocarbon (oil and natural gas) reserves.

The equilibrium real exchange rate approach models the medium-run equilibrium value of the REER
as a function of fundamental factors which cause temporary but persistent deviations from long-run
purchasing power parity. Panel estimation over 182 economies for the period 1973 through 2009 indicates
that REER dynamics are primarily driven by variations in terms of trade, productivity, government
consumption, and remittances inflows. The country specific model estimation suggests a 1 to 3 percent
overvaluation for Cameroon.
Survey data analysis provides qualitative information on structural obstacles to competitiveness. The
2009-10 Global Competitiveness Index ranks Cameroon 111th out of 133 countries. The 2010 Doing
Business Report places Cameroon at 171st of 183 countries, with particularly low rankings for Starting a
Business (174th), Enforcing Contracts (174th) and Paying Taxes (170th). The 2009 World Bank Enterprise
Survey provides a very similar picture. All these indicators underscore that Cameroon’s overall business
environment is holding back its competitiveness.

The recent Euro depreciation, if sustained, would contribute to improving the price competitiveness of
Cameroon.

31.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ initiatives to strengthen the dialogue between
the government and the private sector, in particular the Cameroon Business Forum.10
It emphasized the need, however, to support these efforts with PFM reforms that would
reduce, and eventually eliminate, government arrears, and to sustain public enterprise
reforms.11 Efforts under way to improve governance, ensure the transparency of the
government budget, and hold managers of public resources accountable, could reduce the
uncertainty that surrounds the regulatory and judicial framework.
32.
Progress in trade liberalization remains key. The currently high customs duties
are a disincentive to private investment and productivity growth. Staff emphasized the need
to (i) pursue negotiations with the other CEMAC member states with a view to reduce the
level and range of the common external tariff (CET), in particular regarding imported
machinery and equipment; (ii) accelerate efforts supporting regional integration by
harmonizing the rules of origin and streamlining CET exemptions; and (iii) conclude a
regional economic partnership agreement with the European Union. The authorities broadly
agreed with staff recommendations. However, they noted difficulties in coming to an
agreement with their regional partners on trade issues.
F. Medium-Term Outlook
33.
Staff concurred with the authorities that Cameroon’s economic outlook is likely
to improve, although less than anticipated in the new PRSP. The positive outlook is
driven by the expected recovery of the global economy, the projected increase in public
capital spending, and ongoing initiatives to improve the business climate.12


Oil production is expected to contribute to real growth during 2012-14, with SNH
projections pointing to an average annual increase in oil production of about
20 percent during that period, followed by a resumption of the declining trend. The
projected increase reflects ongoing oil investments, after successful exploration
efforts over the last three years.

10

The Cameroon Business Forum was created in early 2009 with IFC assistance and held its first session in
February 2010. It has pushed for concrete measures to improve the business climate, notably by simplifying
procedures and creating a one-stop window to start a business.
11

The airline company has a new management since February 2010. A bidding process for the
telecommunication company was launched in 2009 but was unsuccessful. A new privatization strategy, through
a public-private partnership, is being prepared. Restructuring options for the postal services company
(CAMPOST) are being explored with a key development partner.
12

The baseline scenario assumes a gradual moderate increase in private investment from 12.4 percent of GDP
in 2009 to 13.5 percent in 2015.

23


Nonoil sector growth is expected to gradually respond to structural reforms and
alleviation of infrastructure gaps.13

Overall, staff’s projections envision a gradual but sizeable increase in overall growth (from
2.6 percent in 2010 to close to 5 percent in 2014, followed by a decline in 2015 under the
effect of projected lower oil production (Text Table 4). The external current account deficit
would widen in 2011, but would thereafter narrow gradually to reach close to 1 percent of
GDP in 2014. Efforts to tackle infrastructure bottlenecks should result in a relatively high
nonoil primary deficit (around 5 percent of GDP) but a steady flow of oil revenue will
gradually lower the overall budget deficit and eliminate the financing gap by 2013.14 Inflation
is expected to remain below the regional convergence criteria of 3 percent, barring new
exogenous shocks.

Recent staff assessment of the growth-accounting framework points to the need to boost productivity through
structural reforms and investment in infrastructure, and improving human capital (IMF Country Report No.
07/285, August 2007).
14

The medium-term framework assumes that the level of UPOs will be stabilized to less than 5 percent of total
non-interest expenditure by end-2010, consistent with a normal amount of float from treasury operations, and
maintained at this level throughout 2015. Liquidated DENOs to be paid each year are factored in each spending
item and not shown separately in the 2011-15 projections.

24
34.
The medium-term macroeconomic framework is subject to significant downside
risks. These include: (i) the uncertain pace and strength of global recovery; (ii) the fiscal
framework hinges on the coverage of financing gaps that may not materialize; (iii) a
vulnerable banking sector that may generate contingent fiscal liabilities; and (iv) delays in
the implementation of reforms in a pre-election environment.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
After a slowdown in activity as a result of the global crisis, there are signs that
Cameroon’s economy has started to recover. Growth is expected to increase, helped by a
pick-up in external demand, public investment in basic infrastructure, and ongoing
initiatives to improve the business environment. However, there are risks to the projected
favorable outlook stemming from (i) uncertainty on the strength and duration of the global
recovery; (ii) lack of financing to cover the projected fiscal gap; and (iii) possible delays in
the implementation of reforms ahead of the upcoming elections.
36.
Strengthening PFM is critical to maintain fiscal and financial sector stability.
Weaknesses in budget management that came to the fore in 2009 need to be decisively
corrected. The authorities are encouraged to strengthen expenditure and treasury
management, audit outstanding arrears comprehensively, and set in place processes to limit
the accumulation of unsettled payment obligations. This is key to reducing adverse spillover
effects on other sectors, and to enhancing policy credibility.
37.
The authorities need to be vigilant against banking sector risks. While domestic
banks have been relatively insulated from the global financial crisis, the excessive
concentration of bank exposure to a few large enterprises, especially the national oil
refinery, continues to pose systemic risks. These risks have been exacerbated by protracted
delays in settling government obligations, and by inadequate supervisory standards. In
collaboration with the regional supervisor, the authorities need to take resolute steps to:
(i) monitor banking sector vulnerabilities through regular analysis of banking sector
soundness indicators; (ii) promote a sound and rapid restructuring plan for a sizeable bank in
difficulty; and (iii) foster the adoption of best practices on prudential ratios on risk
concentration, eliminate existing exceptions in favor of some enterprises, and implement
gradually but consistently these changes.
38.
The 2010 budget needs to be revised. The authorities have discussed with staff
some adjustments to the budget. To ensure transparency, a supplementary budget should be
prepared and presented to the National Assembly. This will give the authorities an
opportunity to realign non-priority spending and adopt other corrective measures that could
help reduce the remaining financing gap. It will also help prevent any undue compression of
priority public investment and the incurrence of new domestic arrears.

25
39.
Increasing Cameroon’s growth will require concrete actions to address the
existing bottlenecks. Staff recognizes the need to address severe infrastructure gaps,
thereby helping to promote private investment. Achieving these objectives will require
raising the execution rate for public investment, improving absorption capacity, and
reducing regulatory uncertainty. Cameroon’s REER appears to be broadly in line with
fundamentals, but competitiveness remains hampered by nonprice factors related to the
weak business environment. Staff encouraged the authorities to take concrete actions to
implement ongoing initiatives to improve the business climate.
40.
The updated LIC-DSA shows that Cameroon’s risk of debt distress is low. The
authorities need, however, to continue to implement a prudent borrowing policy that relies
on grants and highly concessional loans for financing their development program. They also
need to continue to work with regional institutions to develop rapidly a regional market for
government securities, a key step in reducing the current vulnerability to external financing
shocks.
41.
Close monitoring of financial sector developments is warranted. Given the
current vulnerable situation, staff recommends that the authorities closely monitor financial
sector developments to detect changes in risk factors at an early stage.
42.

Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation take place within 12 months.

Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis1
Prepared by the Staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by Seán Nolan and Dhaneshwar Ghura (IMF)
and Sudarshan Gooptu and Sudhir Shetty (World Bank)
June 28, 2010
The joint IMF-World Bank low-income country debt sustainability analysis (LIC DSA)
indicates that Cameroon’s risk of debt distress continues to be classified as low. All external
debt ratios remain well below the policy-dependent thresholds under the baseline scenario
and the stress tests; public debt indicators also remain at comfortable levels. The low risk
rating opens the possibility for some limited non-concessional borrowing. The lower capacity
assessment however implies that concessionality of any new borrowing should continue to be
assessed loan by loan. Strengthening debt management practices, enhancing nonoil revenue
mobilization, and widening the export base remain advisable in light of the anticipated
long-run decline of oil revenues.

Prepared by IMF and IDA staffs in collaboration with the Cameroonian authorities. Debt data, sustainability
issues, and the new debt limit policy were discussed with the authorities in the course of the 2010 article IV
consultation. This DSA follows the IMF and World Bank Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint
Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries, January 22, 2010 (available at
http://www.imf.org/external/pp/longres.aspx?id=4419 and http://go.worldbank.org/JBKAT4BH40). The
analysis updates the 2009 DSA (IMF Country Report for Cameroon 09/318, available at
http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.cfm?sk=23423.0 ). This DSA is conservatively undertaken on
gross (as opposed to net) basis as no data on Cameroon’s claims are available.

2
I. BACKGROUND
1.
This report updates the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) prepared in 2009
(IMF Country Report No. 09/318). The baseline scenario reflects the latest IMF Article IV
discussions with the authorities (March-April 2010). Since the 2009 DSA, Cameroon has
been adversely affected by the global crisis through lower exports and a drop in prices for
commodities. These developments have adversely affected GDP growth, with a sizable
effect on both the balance of payments and the fiscal accounts. The impact of the crisis was
however less than anticipated, thanks to the Cameroonian authorities’ policy response as
well as Fund assistance under the Rapid Access Component of the Exogenous Shocks
Facility (RAC-ESF).
2.
The DSA is based on end-2009 data provided by Cameroon’s authorities. The
debt data currently covers central government external debt, public-guaranteed debt, and an
estimate of domestic debt. Despite efforts to improve debt statistics, the coverage of public
enterprises’ liabilities, contingent liabilities of financial institutions, and overdue claims of
public enterprise and parastatal entities of the government remains uneven.
3.
Debt relief agreements with bilateral and most commercial creditors have been
finalized. To date, all bilateral agreements with Paris Club and non-Paris Club creditors
have been signed. Agreements were also finalized with most London Club commercial
creditors, whereby the stock of debt was reduced to US$1.24 million in 2009. The
authorities are making every effort to settle the outstanding debt (0.06 percent of GDP), but
are experiencing difficulties in engaging with some creditors either because of a lack of
response from them or because they no longer exist as ongoing commercial entities.
4.
Cameroon’s debt situation has sharply improved in recent years. Its public
debt-to-GDP ratio declined from 51.8 percent in 2005 to 9.6 percent in 2009
(US$2.16 billion), thanks to HIPC and MDRI relief in 2006 and prudent borrowing policies
since then (Text Table 1).2 Since the HIPC Initiative and MDRI debt relief, a further decline
in external debt has reflected the following factors: (i) a reduction in net borrowing by
public enterprises; (ii) the settlement of most outstanding loans by commercial creditors;
and (iii) valuation effects due to changes in exchange rates. On domestic debt, substantial
repayments were also made possible by the use of windfall gains from higher-than-expected

2

Debt data, after the HIPC and MDRI, exclude the debt service to France under the Debt Settlement and
Development Contract (C2D). A reassessment by Cameroon authorities of C2D related debt service accounts
for most of the decline in external debt excluding C2D between 2008 and 2009.

oil prices in 2008. In 2009 however, a partial audit resulted in an upward revision of the
stock of domestic debt.3

Until 2009 domestic debt primarily represented domestic arrears that were audited and rescheduled or
securitized in 2005.

4
The composition of external public debt is currently skewed toward multilateral debt.
Following HIPC and MDRI debt relief in 2006, the share of bilateral debt had become
predominant. However, the share of multilateral lenders has increased in 2009 with the
provision of Fund assistance under the RAC-ESF facility as well as IDA disbursements
(Figure 1).
II. THE DSA BASELINE SCENARIO
5.
Relative to the previous DSA, the macroeconomic framework incorporates the
impact of the crisis, but remains broadly unchanged regarding the medium and
long-term perspectives. More specifically, real GDP growth is expected to pick up over
the medium term, reflecting increased investment and structural reform implementation.

is expected to deteriorate,
reflecting the need to address considerable social and infrastructure needs. This deterioration
would however occur against the background of windfalls from a temporary rebound in oil
output, thus limiting borrowing requirements. New public borrowing (both domestic and
external) is assumed to increase gradually over the medium term to help finance
infrastructure investments. Growth-enhancing investment projects are also expected to be
partly financed through foreign direct investment and other private capital flows.

5
Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions for the Baseline Scenario4
Against the backdrop of a volatile oil production profile, the baseline annual growth, which is expected
to be driven by the nonoil sector, has been revised downward in 2010-11 to around 2 ¾ percent
(3.4 percent for the nonoil sector growth). Growth is expected to increase gradually to 4¾ percent by
2014 on assumptions of a temporary rebound in oil output, increased capital spending and structural
reforms in the areas of business climate, provision of public goods and infrastructure, as well as more
efficient public finance management. Longer-term growth is expected to average 4½ percent for
2016-30, driven by the nonoil sectors (agriculture, mining, and services). Consumer price-based inflation
has eased in 2009 and is expected to hold steady at or slightly below 3 percent over the medium-term, in
line with recent historical trend, and CEMAC convergence criteria.
Government revenues are projected to reflect the volatility of oil proceeds in the medium term. Non-oil
revenues are expected to rise from about 13½ percent of non-oil GDP in 2009 to about 16 percent at the
end of the projection period, reflecting sustained implementation of measures to strengthen tax and
customs administrations. Government expenditures are expected to rise in 2010-11, but stabilize around
18 percent of GDP in the longer-term. This path is consistent with a gradual increase in capital
expenditure over the medium term, control of current spending growth, and a rise in pro-poor spending.
The projected path is also assumed to be supported by improvements in public financial management,
including expenditure allocation and execution in priority areas.
Current account deficit, including grants, is expected to rise in 2010-11 and narrow temporarily in
2012-14 in relation with an oil export peak. A constant real exchange rate is assumed over the long term
projection period. The volume growth of nonoil exports (in particular timber, cocoa) is projected to
remain high (close to 9 percent in 2011–30), offsetting petroleum exports gradual decline. Import
volumes are projected to increase, as the acceleration of growth in 2011-16 would be associated with
imports of equipment and intermediate goods, in relation with the implementation of infrastructure
investment planned in the latest PRSP. The current account deficit is expected to be financed through
foreign direct investment, external public loans, and other private capital inflows.
After a peak around 2½ percent of GDP in 2010-12 (reflecting in part the projected financing gaps for
these years), new external borrowing is expected to slow down and remain around 1½ percent of GDP in
the longer-term. The rate of debt accumulation remains well below the “speed bump” (5 percent of GDP
annually) suggested by IMF debt policy guidelines.
A relatively high concessionality of new borrowing is assumed. IDA borrowing is assumed to constitute
initially ¼ of new borrowing per year, with the remainder originating from other multilateral and
bilateral creditors on less concessional terms. It is assumed that Cameroon will cross the IDA-only
threshold by 2012, implying that disbursements from the Bank will also be on less concessional terms.
In addition, it is expected that Cameroon will use in full the recent 2009 SDR allocations for the purpose
of settling domestic arrears. While this does not impact the stock of debt, it does however impact the
trajectory of interest payments.

4

Estimates and projections are in CFA francs unless otherwise indicated. The baseline is consistent with the
latest IMF World Economic Outlook assumptions and projections (May 2010).

6
III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

Baseline Scenario
6.
The LIC debt sustainability framework is guided by country-specific debt
burden thresholds for external debt, based on the strength of a country’s policies and
institutions. These thresholds reflect the empirical findings that sustainable debt levels for a
low-income country increase with the quality of its policies and institutions. Such quality is
measured by the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index, compiled
annually by the World Bank. Cameroon now ranks as a ‘weak performer’ under the joint
IMF/World Bank debt sustainability framework, based on its three-year moving average
CPIA score.5 The indicative external debt burden thresholds for countries in this category
are a present value (PV) of debt-to-exports ratio of 100 percent, a PV of debt-to-revenue
ratio of 200 percent, a PV of debt-to-GDP ratio of 30 percent, and debt-service-to-exports
and revenues ratios of 15 and 25 percent, respectively.
7.
Cameroon’s external debt appears sustainable. Under the baseline scenario, all
debt indicators remain below their

Cameroon's CPIA declined from 3.3 to 3.2 between 2005 and 2006 and remained at that level in 2007 and
2008, thus the average CPIA rating for Cameroon for the last three years is 3.2—a rating corresponding to weak
performance. The downgrade was the result of deterioration in the following criteria: business regulatory
environment; policies and institutions for environmental sustainability; structural policy cluster; and efficiency
of revenue mobilization.
6

The discount rate has been reduced from 5 percent in the 2009 DSA to 4 percent currently, in accordance with
the latest LIC-DSA template.

7

Insufficient institutional and administrative capacity has so far kept Cameroon from scaling up foreignfinanced investment above 0.5 to 1 percentage point of GDP annually.

7
 The DSA baseline scenario assumes a combination of concessional external borrowing
and BEAC financing to help fill the financing gaps associated with the resolution of
domestic arrears. Repayment of external debt could cluster in 2015-19 as the 2009
ESF-RAC is amortized. Figure 3 shows that debt service ratios would further increase
after 2020 but the debt situation would still be manageable.

Alternative Scenario and Stress Tests
8.
Alternative scenarios and bound tests show that debt indicators remain below
their thresholds through 2030.
 The historical average scenario, which is associated with past current account surpluses,
is unlikely to occur, as oil production is expected to taper off in the next 20 years. This
scenario shows a more optimistic debt ratio trajectory relative to the baseline. Thus, in
terms of the risk assessment the historic scenario is not relevant and is therefore omitted
from Figure 3.
 An export shock would be the primary source of increased debt vulnerability. The export
stress-test suggested in the DSA template (exports growth in US$ terms in 2011-12 at
1 standard deviation below the 10 year historical average) represents a major shock in the
case of Cameroon. Indeed, the 2000-09 reference period is volatile and incorporates a
sizeable export decline in 2009. Hence, that stress scenario has exports declining by more
than 8% in US$ terms in both 2011 and 2012 before returning to baseline. As a
consequence, the PV of external debt to export ratio rises dramatically in the stress-test
scenario (Figure 3.c.), without however breaching the 100 percent threshold.
IV. PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
9.
The DSA baseline shows that public debt sustainability will be preserved. It is
assumed that new domestic debt will only be generated by issuance of government
securities and BEAC financing. New government securities issuance in the domestic
markets is assumed to start in 2010 (consistent with Government plans), at conditions
similar to the issuance by Gabon of 2007. Issuance is thus projected to amount to about
1.8 percent of GDP in 2010, 0.9 percent in 2011 and at most ½ percent of GDP annually
during 2012-18, before increasing again in outer years. In the baseline scenario, the public
debt ratio will rise gradually over the long-term. This is initially driven by external
borrowing, with domestic debt issuance picking up over the longer run. In sum, the PV of
debt-to-GDP and debt-to-revenue ratios is expected to rise over time, yet debt service would
stay at a comfortable level through 2030.
10.
Alternative scenarios and bound tests indicate that all debt sustainability
indicators remain on stable paths and do not reveal particular vulnerabilities
(Table 2a). However, the scenario of a permanently lower GDP growth and the bound test

8
that stresses growth at one standard deviation below its historical average show the most
sensitive debt dynamics relative to the baseline.
11.
Despite its low risk of debt distress, Cameroon has stepped up efforts to
strengthen its debt management framework. Following joint Bank-Fund technical
assistance, the authorities are working to implement a new debt management strategy
aligned with CEMAC guidelines. The authorities have themselves started producing a DSA
and have formulated a medium-term debt management strategy for central government debt,
which has been annexed to the budget law. A National Debt Committee has been instituted
but remains to be installed. A partial audit of domestic arrears was conducted in 2009, and
another one is planned in 2010.
V. SCOPE FOR NON-CONCESSIONAL BORROWING
12.
Cameroon has some limited scope for non-concessional borrowing. Small
amounts of non-concessional borrowing are already incorporated in the baseline, as some
commitments have been signed in 2009 and early 2010, for which disbursements are
expected to be spread out over several years. Beyond that, staff has explored the possibility
for Cameroon to borrow more on non concessional terms. In particular, under an alternative
scenario (Figure 5), additional non-concessional borrowing is assumed to be required in
order to accelerate the financing and execution of already identified infrastructure projects
(as presented in the latest PRSP). Additional borrowing is set at FCFA 70 billion in 2010
(about 0.65 percent of GDP), and this amount of non-concessional borrowing is maintained
until 2015. Cameroon is thus expected to continuously borrow on non-concessional terms
over the medium-term, a realistic assumption in accordance with the new Fund debt limit
policy. The terms and conditions of new non-concessional borrowing are assumed to be
similar to those recently offered by a major bilateral lender, and still involve a significant
grant element, although less than 35 percent. To be prudent, the new borrowing is not
assumed to impact the DSA measures of repayment capacity (e.g. the growth rate is the
same as in the baseline scenario).
13.
In that alternative baseline scenario, all debt indicators remain below their
thresholds through 2030. The bound test for the PV of debt-to-exports ratio reaches the
threshold but avoids a breach in the export shock stress test. Cameroon’s low risk rating is
therefore not affected in this scenario, supporting the case for a non-zero limit on
non-concessional borrowing in the context of World Bank operations (No such limit is
required by the IMF in the absence of a Fund-supported program). Non-concessional
borrowing should however remain linked to adequate evaluation of the underlying
investment projects.

9
VI. CONCLUSION
14.
Cameroon’s risk of debt distress remains low. All external debt ratios remain well
below the policy-dependent thresholds. However, because of the reassessment of the stock
of domestic debt and ongoing new external borrowing, debt indicators are somewhat higher
than in the 2009 DSA. Debt indicators rise under alternative scenario and bound tests, but
not beyond country-specific debt burden thresholds, when assessing external sustainability,
and remain at a comfortable level in regards to public debt sustainability.
15.
The authorities shared the low risk assessment. As the removal of infrastructure
deficiencies is considered a key priority, the authorities see the low debt vulnerability as
providing some space for a reasonable increase in debt-financed investment. In that context,
a moderate use of non-concessional borrowing is being considered for projects where
concessional financing may not be available.
16.
However, persistent weakness in public finance management and insufficient
data coverage suggest caution in assessing Cameroon’s debt vulnerabilities. These
vulnerabilities include quasi-fiscal liabilities of state-owned enterprises and the build-up of
new arrears since the 2005 audit, only partly quantified in a 2009 audit follow-up. The
authorities’ efforts to improve debt management could be reinforced by steps to ensure
better coverage of public sector liabilities and by a new and more comprehensive audit of
domestic unsettled payment obligations. In addition, continued efforts to achieve greater
nonoil revenue mobilization and to widen the export base would be advisable, given the
expected long-run decline in oil revenue.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
For 2009-2014, includes mostly changes in gross foreign assets and other valuation effects and contributions from prices. Marginal changes in the outer years include also exceptional
financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
7
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3
Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4
Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5
Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6
Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Significant policy developments have occurred since the Staff Report was issued.
The authorities are taking measures to address a number of problem areas highlighted
in the staff appraisal. Staff welcomes these measures, while noting that several
important issues remain to be addressed.
On June 15, the government signed with the regional central bank a convention
for the use of the 2009 general SDR allocation. The government used the proceeds
to clear CFAF 90 billion of its CFAF 98.3 billion payment obligations to the oil
refinery, SONARA. To ensure a reduction of SONARA’s exposure to banks, the
Treasury in early July made direct transfers to the commercial banks involved, in
amounts proportionate to each bank’s exposure to SONARA. The remaining
government overdue obligations to SONARA are to be cleared in the coming days.
With this operation, a source of systemic risk to the banking system has been
mitigated.
The authorities are developing a revised 2010 budget that incorporates several
recommendations of the staff. They have revised down current spending on goods
and services; made a realistic budgetary provision for subsidies to the oil refinery;
postponed the start of some non-priority capital projects; and included a provision for
government participation in the recapitalization of a distressed bank. These planned
revisions go in the direction recommended by staff, but there is still a projected
financing gap of 1.6 percent of GDP, down from 1.9 percent in the staff report. When
the revised budget has been finalized, the authorities intend to adopt it by Presidential
Decree and present it later to the National Assembly for ratification. Staff is
collaborating closely with the authorities, and continues to encourage them to further
reprioritize spending programs; to keep a tight control over budget execution; and to
conduct a comprehensive audit of all outstanding government obligations.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Cameroon
On July 14, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Cameroon.1
Background
Cameroon’s macroeconomic stability was strengthened under the PRGF arrangement
completed in January 2009, and debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) and Multilateral Debt Reduction Initiatives firmed up debt sustainability.
However, despite the country’s vast potential, its growth performance in recent years
has remained constrained by poor infrastructure, unfavorable business environment;
limited absorption capacity; a shallow financial sector; and obstacles to trade. In per
capita terms, real GDP stagnated in 2005-09, and the incidence of poverty remained
broadly unchanged. Cameroon is highly dependent on commodities for export earnings
and fiscal revenues and thus remains vulnerable to external shocks.
The global crisis slowed the pace of Cameroon’s economic activity in 2009, mainly via
lower demand and prices for some of the main exports. Real GDP growth decelerated to
2 percent, from 2.9 percent in 2008. The impact on external accounts was, however,
less than anticipated, in part because some nonoil exports have rebounded. As a result,
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

the external current account deficit widened by about 1 percentage point of GDP and
the overall external balance remained positive.
The overall budget deficit, on a cash basis, was limited to 0.2 percent of GDP in 2009,
despite a shortfall in total revenue. However, the composition of expenditure shifted
from capital to current spending. In addition, public financial management worsened
significantly as there was a surge in unsettled government payment obligations,
including delayed payment for losses incurred by the national oil refinery, unsettled
payment orders, and expenditure for which services have been provided but no
payment orders issued. Banking system soundness deteriorated, reflecting both public
financial management and regulatory problems that have heightened excessive credit
concentration, as well as the impact of the global crisis.
Cameroon’s economic outlook is likely to improve, as a result of the expected recovery
of the global economy, the projected increase in public capital spending, and the
ongoing initiatives to improve the business climate. Barring new exogenous shocks, real
GDP growth is projected to gradually increase from 2.6 percent in 2010 to above 4.5
percent in 2014, in part reflecting the coming to fruition of recent investments in the oil
sector. Inflation is expected to remain below 3 percent, in line with the regional
convergence criterion. There are, however, downside risks to these projections, should
the global economic recovery prove to be weaker or slower than anticipated.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the incipient signs of growth recovery in Cameroon,
following the adverse impact of the global financial crisis. Growth is expected to
increase but there are significant downside risks arising from uncertain global
economic recovery and issues related to the projected fiscal financing gap.
Directors expressed concern about weaknesses in public financial management as
reflected in the surge in unsettled government obligations and the use of the National
Hydrocarbon Company to fund spending operations. They emphasized that it was
critical to strengthen expenditure and cash management to maintain fiscal and financial
stability, ensure effectiveness of public spending, and enhance budget transparency.
Directors commended the authorities for their efforts to assess the nature and level of
outstanding payment obligations and settle a sizeable proportion of these obligations.
They called for continued progress toward establishing effective mechanisms to track
expenditure flows through the budget execution process and preventing new
accumulation of domestic arrears.
Directors welcomed the steps being taken to address concerns about the viability of
the 2010 budget. They encouraged the authorities to adopt resolute measures to close
the remaining financing gap. In this regard, Directors considered it important to protect
priority capital spending, make vigorous efforts to mobilize revenues, and gradually

3
phase out fuel subsidies. They also stressed the need to avoid depleting the fiscal
buffer of usable government deposits at the regional central bank.
Directors recognized that it was necessary to scale up public investment to address
the severe infrastructure gaps which are constraining growth. They agreed that
Cameroon’s low risk of debt distress offers some space to accommodate such capital
spending. At the same time, Directors underscored the importance of exercising
prudence to preserve fiscal sustainability. They encouraged the authorities to work
with the central bank to establish a regional security market, and rely, to the extent
possible, on concessional resources to meet investment financing needs.
Directors noted that domestic banks were relatively insulated from the global financial
crisis. They welcomed the recent corrective steps taken by the authorities to reduce
bank exposure to the oil refinery. Given the still excessive concentration of bank
exposure in a few large enterprises, protracted delays in settling government
payments obligations and inadequate supervisory standards, Directors called for
further determined actions to ensure financial stability. They encouraged the
authorities, in collaboration with the regional supervisor, to closely monitor the
evolution of bank vulnerabilities and promote a gradual adoption of best practices to
mitigate concentration risks.
Directors emphasized that concrete measures were needed to tackle the structural
impediments to growth. Addressing these challenges will require in particular improving
the execution of public investment, making the business environment more attractive,
strengthening governance and accelerating regional integration. In addition improving
the quality and provision of fiscal, financial, and balance of payments data will be
crucial.

Statement by Laurean W. Rutayisire, Executive Director for Cameroon
July 12, 2010

On behalf of my Cameroonian authorities, I would like to express my appreciation to the
Executive Board and Management for their assistance to Cameroon in 2009 under the
Exogenous Shocks Facility to help them cope with the adverse effects of the global
financial and economic crisis on the Cameroonian economy. I would also like to
communicate my authorities’ appreciation to staff for their continued constructive policy
dialogue and advice. They share the view that the staff report reflects the fruitful exchanges
that took place in Cameroon in March-April and pursued in Washington DC in late April
2010.
Cameroon strengthened its macroeconomic performance under the last PRGF arrangement
which was completed in January 2009. Following debt relief in 2006 under the HIPC
Initiative and the MDRI, Cameroon has managed to maintain low ratios of external and
total debt owing to prudent borrowing policies. Careful fiscal policy allowed a significant
build up of government deposits at the regional central bank (BEAC) while enabling the
authorities to raise investment and normalize relations with creditors. Nevertheless,
Cameroon continues to face daunting growth challenges due to limited infrastructure and
declining human capacity. Growth performance falls below the potential of the economy,
which also remains vulnerable to exogenous shocks given the dependence of its exports on
external demand and world prices. As a result of insufficient growth performance, economic
indicators depict a fragile situation, even though efforts on the social front place Cameroon
above the Sub-Saharan Africa averages in social indicators.
Addressing the infrastructure and human capacity needs will require significant investments
in roads, electricity and telecommunications, as well as training and skills development,
notably in the areas of agriculture and engineering. In particular, my authorities put great
emphasis on the need to boost agricultural production, facilitate transport of products within
the country and towards neighboring countries, thereby enhancing exports and nonoil
growth and revenue. They also aim at promoting private sector development through efforts
to clear arrears and enhance financial intermediation through financial sector deepening.
These objectives and strategy have been laid out in their new poverty reduction strategy
paper and are consistent with the recommendations by the Fund’s Executive Board during
the completion of the 2009 Article IV consultation.
In view of achieving their long-term objectives, my authorities are already taking steps to
address the weaknesses identified in public financial management (PFM) and deal with the
capacity constraints facing the economy. Regarding PFM, my authorities have pursued
reforms in tax and customs administrations, notably by streamlining tax exemptions,
improving the computerized customs system and introducing a GPS-based mechanism to
track merchandise in transit and reduce tax evasion. Fully cognizant of the fiscal burden
stemming from the current fuel subsidies, my authorities are reflecting on its overhaul, with
the view to better target the most vulnerable segments of the population, while at the same
time stressing the importance of garnering the necessary social consensus in order to prevent

2

the king of social unrest that took place in 2008. On financial sector stability, my authorities
acknowledge delays in settling payment obligations due to cash flow tensions. Building on
the lessons learned, they continue to work closely with the regional supervisor (COBAC) to
find an adequate and durable solution for the distressed bank with systemic importance, by
seeking an investor with track record in banking activity. As regards structural reforms, steps
have been taken in restructuring public companies in air transportation and postal services.
My authorities have also stepped up efforts to improve governance and enhance the business
environment with the involvement of the private sector, including through concrete measures
designed during a forum for government-private sector dialogue. Moreover, they pursue
discussions with regional partners within the CEMAC to further advance trade liberalization.
My Cameroonian authorities will pursue their policy and reform agenda, fully
recognizing the remaining weaknesses in the areas of PFM, data provision, and human
capacity. They hope they can count on Fund’s enhanced technical assistance to help them
address these deficiencies. Furthermore, to help support the implementation of their
overall agenda, my authorities intend to strengthen their cooperation with the Fund, in the
form of a medium-term program which they need to reflect upon going forward.
I – RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE
The global crisis has slowed the pace of economic activity in Cameroon, through trade and
financial channels. This resulted in real GDP growth decelerating to 2 percent in 2009 from
about 3 percent in 2008. To deal with the crisis, my authorities have used fiscal space to
protect priority spending (investment, health, education) and support sectors in distress
(forestry, cotton and agriculture) while containing the overall fiscal deficit. They have
responded to the crisis by obtaining Fund assistance under the rapid access component of
the ESF, and putting in place a three-pronged strategy aimed at reducing the vulnerability of
the economy to exogenous shocks while maintaining macroeconomic stability. This strategy
include: (i) stepping up efforts to increase nonoil revenue; (ii) improving PFM in order to
achieve savings that can be reallocated to priority outlays; and (iii) developing alternative
sources of domestic financing, notably through a domestic bond market, while
strengthening the debt management capacity to preserve Cameroon’s sustainable debt
profile.
While recognizing that more efforts are needed to fully implement this medium-term agenda,
my authorities share a more optimistic view than staff, and they view the implementation
thus far of the related measures as being encouraging. In a difficult external environment and
challenging domestic social conditions, they have maintained nonoil revenue in 2009 at
around their level before the impact of the crisis (at 13.6 percent of nonoil GDP) and limited
overall fiscal deficit at 0.2 percent of GDP; achieved some gains in PFM as indicated earlier;
streamlined the number of tax forms; and strengthened efforts in the governance area,
notably by stepping up cases of prosecution against misappropriation of public funds. They
have also managed to preserve Cameroon’s low risk of debt distress.
My authorities acknowledge however the deficiencies in PFM identified by staff as well as
the resulting deterioration in the banking system soundness due to a permissive regional bank
regulatory framework. As indicated earlier, my authorities seek a durable solution to the
distressed bank for which an audit was completed and a restructuring plan is under
consideration. More broadly, my authorities recognize the macroeconomic policy challenges

3

facing the Cameroonian authorities, and they continue to seek Fund technical assistance and
policy advice in addressing them.
II – MEDIUM-TERM POLICY AND REFORMS
Going forward, my authorities strive to tackle the remaining PFM weaknesses—hoping
to count on sustained Fund and other donor assistance—and reduce impediments to
stronger growth by promoting a healthy and stable financial sector, favoring the
development of a local bond market, boosting infrastructure, enhancing human resources
and ensuring an investment climate conducive to the expansion of the private sector.
Public Financial Management
The authorities share staff’s view on the need to correct the weaknesses in expenditure and
cash management. In this vein, they have already undertaken adequate actions, notably a
reconciliation of fiscal data between government departments with the view to gauge the
level and nature of unsettled payment orders accumulated in recent years, and the settlement
of a large part (70%) of those payment orders. They intend to use the SDR allocation to settle
other payment obligations, notably those due to the national oil refinery, SONARA.
Furthermore, the authorities will address existing budget execution problems by
implementing their medium-term plan for the modernization of PFM adopted in 2009. In
the same context, they pursue efforts to enhance transparency, accountability and efficiency
in the use of public resources.
To ensure realism of the budget, my authorities stand ready to make the necessary
adjustments when required. For 2010, they are preparing a supplementary budget to take into
account notably the need to prevent any further accumulation of arrears to the oil refinery,
the government’s participation in the recapitalization of the distress bank, the country’s
absorption capacity in the execution of public investment projects, and the limited depth of
the domestic financial market in the issuance of government bonds. Following its approval
by the government, the supplementary budget will be submitted to the Parliament in
September for adoption.
Fiscal and Debt Sustainability
To ensure fiscal sustainability in the face of the considerable infrastructure needs which need
to be addressed, my authorities emphasize the need to increase nonoil revenue through
broadening the tax base, and in this vein, they share the recommendations laid out by staff in
the areas of taxation of large enterprises and SMEs, tax and customs procedures, elimination
of tax exemptions and special tax regimes, customs fraud and VAT compliance and refunds.
The space provided by the authorities’ prudent debt management since the HIPC
completion point allows for increased external borrowing to meet the country’s public
investment needs. At the same time, the authorities remain vigilant to ensure that the low
risk of debt distress is preserved. In this vein, they have stepped up efforts to strengthen the

4

debt management framework in accordance with the CEMAC guidelines and consistent
with joint Bank-Fund technical assistance. They will put in place the National Debt
Committee which has already been instituted.
Financial Sector Stability and Deepening
On financial sector stability, my authorities broadly agree with staff on the urgency of
mitigating the risks posed by the protracted arrears to state-owned enterprises, which are
compounded by the bank regulatory framework. Besides seeking solution to the unsettled
payment orders mentioned above, they continue to work with COBAC in closely monitoring
the evolution of banking sector vulnerabilities, notably systemic risks and bank exposures to
major borrowers. They also engage the COBAC in strengthening the prudential ratios on risk
concentration.
Moreover, my Cameroonian authorities will accelerate the implementation of their action
plan—based on the recommendations of the 2007 FSAP update—to deepen financial
intermediation. In the vein of mobilizing alternative sources of funding, they also pursue
their plan to develop a local bond market.
Infrastructure and Capacity Building, Structural Reforms, and Economic Growth
Enhancing growth is the key pillar of Cameroon’s new PRSP. In this vein, the authorities
intend to tackle forcefully the key impediments, notably underinvestment in infrastructure,
under-spending in human capacities, weaknesses in the business environment and
insufficient trade integration. On the latter issue, they agree with staff advice to reduce the
level and range of the common external tariff (CET), harmonize the rules of origin in
supporting regional integration, streamline CET exemptions, and conclude a regional
economic partnership agreement with the EU. They will continue to push forward issues of
regional trade liberalization with their CEMAC partners.
III – CONCLUSION
My Cameroonian authorities continue to make progress in the implementation of reforms, in
spite of a challenging international environment and difficult social conditions. To pursue
their structural agenda, they intend to move to a new Fund-supported program articulated
around the country’s new PRSP. They view such medium-term program as the reflection of a
homegrown strategy which needs to garner the broadest domestic consensus possible. In
pursuing their objectives, my Cameroonian authorities continue to count on their close
cooperation with the Fund and other development partners.
