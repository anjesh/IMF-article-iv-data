Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation, First Review Under the Stand-By

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


Costa Rica’s economy has been hit hard by the global crisis, but active policies have helped
preserve stability and mitigate the negative impact on growth. Economic activity is expected to
recover slowly, in line with the expected turnaround in trading partner countries. For 2009, staff
projects a real GDP decline of 1.5 percent, followed by positive growth above 2 percent in 2010.
Inflation is projected to decline to 5 percent at end-2009, the lowest level in more than three decades.



Performance under the IMF-supported program has been strong, with the authorities meeting
all end-June performance criteria and structural benchmarks. The 15-month Stand-By
Arrangement is expected to remain precautionary and will continue to support confidence through
the provision of a liquidity buffer. The program has been revised to partly accommodate lower-thanexpected fiscal revenues through higher deficits in 2009–10. This will help protect social spending
and support domestic demand, while keeping the domestic borrowing requirement and the debt-toGDP ratio within reasonable margins.



The medium-term outlook for Costa Rica’s economy remains generally favorable.
Consolidating domestic and external stability and sustaining high growth rates will require, however,
actions on a number of fronts.





After a very large fiscal expansion, which is supporting demand amidst the global downturn, the
authorities will need to reduce the fiscal deficit to keep the debt burden in check and avoid
crowding out the private sector.



Continuous progress in implementing inflation targeting and achieving greater exchange rate
flexibility would also be advisable to lock-in the current historically low inflation rate.



As of mid-2009, the level of the real exchange rate is considered to be broadly in line with its
equilibrium level. However, some further accumulation of international reserves seems
advisable to further increase the economy’s resilience to external shocks.



The authorities should address remaining shortcomings in the supervision, prudential
framework, and safety net for banks.

Costa Rica has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and its exchange
system remains free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
transactions. The country maintains a crawling exchange rate band regime since October 2006.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
The 2009 Article IV Consultation and First Review under the Stand-By
Arrangement (SBA) took place against the background of a global crisis that has had
considerable effects on Costa Rica. 1 Economic activity during the first half of 2009 was
severely affected by the global downturn, but domestic and external stability were generally
preserved (Figure 1).


Output growth was substantially weaker than anticipated. Real GDP contracted by
4.8 percent (y/y) during the first quarter, driven by a sharp fall in inventories and a
decline in sectors most dependent on external conditions. Although, the index of
economic activity declined on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter, it rose
1.2 percent on a quarter-on-quarter basis, suggesting that the decline in output may be
reaching an end. Inflation has remained on a firm downward path, falling from
13.9 percent in December 2008 to 5.7 percent in August 2009.



The fiscal deficit of the central government (without adjustment for TUDES) reached
1.2 percent of GDP in the first half of 2009. 2 This smaller-than-projected outturn
reflected cautious expenditure execution, which more than offset a revenue shortfall of
6 percent (C73 billion) compared to program projections. Fiscal policy nonetheless
provided strong support to domestic demand, as noninterest expenditures rose
14 percent (y/y) in real terms. The central government’s gross financing requirements,
which included large amortization payments, were met through domestic bond
issuances.



The balance of payments did not experience major pressures. During the first half
of 2009, the external current account deficit narrowed sharply to 0.2 percent of GDP
(compared to a deficit of 2.6 percent of GDP envisaged in the program), as imports
contracted much more than expected. Net capital inflows also declined, reflecting
lower foreign direct investment and the repayment of credit lines by domestic banks
and corporations, but there were no confidence-related outflows and the overall
balance of payments recorded a small surplus of US$137 million. The exchange rate
remained close to the ceiling (i.e., most depreciated end) of the currency band
throughout the period, though occasionally traded up to 2 percent below the ceiling.
Central bank (BCCR) interventions were generally moderate. In light of the strength
of the balance of payments position, the authorities did not make the first purchase
(about $500 million) of the SBA.

1

Discussions were held in San José during August 10–20, 2009. The staff team comprised by A. Bauer (Head),
R. Luzio, M. Nozaki (all WHD), and A. Thomas (SPR) was joined by J. Gramajo (OED) and F. Delgado
(Regional Resident Representative) in some of the discussions. They met with Central Bank Governor Gutiérrez,
Finance Minister Phillips, other senior officials, and representatives of the financial sector and academia.

2

TUDES are inflation-indexed bonds. The inflation adjustment of these bonds is recorded as interest expenditure
and thus affects the deficit calculated by staff.

4


Domestic financial markets were also broadly stable. Real interest rates of bank
deposits and government bonds increased, as nominal rates did not fall by as much as
inflation. In the banking system, the nonperforming loan ratio rose moderately and
profitability declined. However, liquidity and solvency indicators remained generally
adequate and banks reduced their net foreign exposure by repaying external credit
lines. In June 2009, the authorities canceled the US$500 million financial sector credit
line from the IADB, as banks showed little interest to tap this (fairly expensive)
funding source.

2.
Performance against program targets was strong. The authorities met all quantitative
performance criteria for end-June, most of them with considerable margins (see text table
below). They also implemented well ahead of the target date the benchmarks referring to daily
forecasting of systemic liquidity and monthly monitoring reports on the soundness of the
banking sector. The structural benchmark on the planned unification of money markets was
initially delayed due to operational difficulties. However, a new platform that allows the
integration of the currently segmented money markets became operational in early August.

I. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
3.
The outlook for Costa Rica’s economy is of a gradual recovery, driven by the
projected turnaround in trading partner countries. The authorities’ economic program will
remain focused on strengthening the external position, easing the adjustment to the global
downturn, and supporting the nascent recovery.


The macroeconomic framework of the program has been revised to reflect the
outturns of the first half of 2009 and changes in the global economic outlook
(Table 1). Real GDP in 2009 is now expected to decline by 1.5 percent (compared to
the 0.5 percent growth envisaged at program approval). This projection takes into
account recent signs of a turnaround in output and more favorable prospects for
technology and corporate services exports. Real GDP growth for 2010 has been
revised upward to 2.3 percent, reflecting mainly the improved outlook for the
U.S. economy. Inflation is now projected to decline to 5 percent at end-2009 and
remain unchanged in 2010 (compared to projected inflation rates of 8 percent and
7 percent, respectively, in the original program). The external current account deficit
for 2009 is expected to decline to 3.6 percent of GDP (down from 5.3 percent of GDP
at program approval), and thereafter increase to 4.8 percent of GDP in 2010, as oil
prices rise and non-oil import growth bounces back. The balance of payments is
projected to remain in overall balance in 2009 (excluding the inflow from the
SDR allocations), as lower FDI, the net repayment of external credit lines, and lower
disbursements of official loans are expected to lower the capital account surplus by
broadly the same amount as the projected decline in the current account deficit.
For 2010, the balance of payments is expected to record a small surplus.



Over the medium term, staff projects GDP to grow at about 4.5 percent. The
economy’s output gap is expected to narrow as output growth accelerates to over
5 percent by 2014, somewhat above the estimated potential rate of 4.2 percent.
Inflation is projected to fall from 5 percent to around 4 percent, broadly consistent
with average trading partner inflation. The external current account deficit is expected
to hover around 5 percent of GDP and to be fully financed by FDI inflows so that
external debt declines modestly to about 27 percent of GDP. Key for this mediumterm scenario is a significant fiscal consolidation that raises public savings (see
paragraphs 13–17) and the maintenance of prudent credit policies.

4.
Risks. Immediate risks to the program have moderated, but remain somewhat tilted to
the downside. The external current account has adjusted more quickly than anticipated,
external short-term debt has declined, and reserves have increased. The stabilization of global
and domestic financial conditions has also reduced the risk of a sudden loss in confidence that
could trigger destabilizing capital outflows. However, confidence could weaken again, and
the colón could come under pressure, if the incipient recovery falters, the situation of banks
deteriorates too fast, or the fiscal deficit gets out of control. A fiscal deficit much higher than
the revised program target for 2010, in particular, would also put pressure on domestic
interest rates, affect debt dynamics and expectations, and could jeopardize macroeconomic

7
stability. The main risk to the growth outlook over the medium term is slow implementation
of structural reforms, including approval of key laws to increase the tax revenue intake,
strengthen the monetary policy framework, and address some remaining shortcomings in
financial sector supervision and regulation. Although general elections will be held in early
February 2010, the risk of instability ahead of the elections is very low.
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Program Issues
5.
Program discussions focused on revising the fiscal targets in light of a much lower
revenue forecast. The authorities restated their interest in keeping the SBA focused on
supporting confidence through the provision of a large liquidity buffer and in maintaining the
arrangement precautionary.
Fiscal policy
6.
The authorities and staff agreed on a revised fiscal program for 2009–10 that seeks
to strike a balance between providing continued support to domestic demand and avoiding
an excessive increase in domestic borrowing and public debt.


For 2009, central government revenues are expected to fall short by C290 billion
(1.7 percent of GDP) from the original program projection. The revenue shortfall is
largely a result of lower growth and a sharper-than-expected decline in import-related
taxes. About half of the lower revenue will be accommodated through a higher deficit
to protect the planned increase in government noninterest spending (which is projected
to rise by 20 percent in real terms), including the targeted transfer program
AVANCEMOS and noncontributory pensions. 3 Overall, the revised program now
envisages a central government deficit of 4.1 percent of GDP and a deficit of the
combined public sector of 4.8 percent of GDP (compared to 3.2 and 4.1 percent of
GDP, respectively, in the original program). The additional deficit will be financed
through higher domestic borrowing and, if necessary, a drawdown of central
government deposits (which amounted to 1.2 percent of GDP as of end-August).4



For 2010, the program foresees a deficit for the central government of 4.1 percent of
GDP and a combined public sector deficit of 4.7 percent of GDP. Although these
deficits are higher than those envisaged in the original program (3.2 percent and
4.1 percent of GDP, respectively), they continue to imply a small adjustment in
structural terms. The authorities expect a cyclical recovery of revenues and are taking
additional measures to increase revenues by 0.4 percent of GDP (i.e., through a new

3

The government’s noncontributory pension program is focused on providing monetary transfers to the elderly
poor who are not covered by Costa Rica’s contributory pension systems.

investments in public sector instruments (from 65 to 70 percent of their portfolio).

8
property tax and a yet-to-be-approved tax on casinos and the virtual gambling
industry). Staff expressed concern about the continued strong growth of current
spending envisaged for 2010, and noted the risks that this may pose for
macroeconomic stability and the external position. The authorities recognized that the
envisaged fiscal expansion was large, but noted that the planned spending was central
to their objective to foster investment in human and physical capital, and felt that the
risks to stability were manageable. In this regard, to reduce the risk of crowding out
the private sector, the authorities noted that they plan to increase their reliance on
foreign borrowing, including by using the US$500 million contingent credit line from
the World Bank (currently awaiting approval in the Legislative Assembly). Overall,
the revised fiscal deficits and macroeconomic framework are expected to increase the
debt of the combined public sector to 41.6 percent of GDP in 2010, 3 percentage
points more than envisaged in the original program.
Monetary, exchange rate, and financial sector policies
7.
Monetary policy will maintain a cautious easing bias. Staff agreed that the BCCR
had a strong basis for lowering its policy rate by 100 bps to 9 percent in mid-July, given the
sharp deceleration in inflation. However, staff and the authorities agreed that the room for
further gradual cuts would depend critically on clear evidence of a further decline in inflation
and depreciation expectations (both presently at about 8 percent on a 12-month horizon), to
ensure the attainment of the inflation target, and reduce risks of pressures on the colón.
8.
The program’s NIR targets will be adjusted upwards by the amount of the
SDR allocation. While the authorities and staff agreed that the current level of reserves
provided ample room to absorb temporary exchange rate pressures, they also agreed that
Costa Rica would benefit from higher reserves coverage (see paragraph 23). Allocating their
share of the special and general SDR allocation (about US$205 million) to gross reserves was
therefore seen as a good opportunity to strengthen NIR. The program NDA targets were
correspondingly revised downward.
9.
While the banking system has fared relatively well, the authorities have to remain
vigilant and implement envisaged measures to strengthen the financial sector safety net.
Although concerns about risks to bank liquidity have eased, the superintendency of banks
(SUGEF) will continue to closely monitor developments in the banking sector, particularly
credit risks. The authorities are working on draft laws to strengthen the bank resolution
framework and create a limited deposit guarantee scheme (both structural benchmarks under
the program). In view of the complementarities between the two laws, it was agreed that it
would be preferable to submit them to the Legislative Assembly at the same time (i.e., by endDecember 2009).

9
Program modalities
10.
Current modalities for program monitoring will remain in place. In light of
continued uncertainty about the external environment and fiscal revenues, the authorities and
staff agreed to maintain quarterly program reviews for the time being. The program now
includes quantitative performance criteria through end-December 2009. Quantitative
performance criteria for end-March 2010 (the last test date under the arrangement) will be set
during the second review mission in early November. Structural benchmarks remain
unchanged, except for the above noted modification of the target date for the submission of a
draft law to strengthen the bank resolution process.
11.
Safeguards assessment. The safeguards assessment of the BCCR finalized in
July 2009 found that the bank has a generally sound operating control environment. To further
strengthen the BCCR’s safeguards framework, the assessment recommended the appointment
of an external auditor to conduct annual audits of the financial statements from 2008 onwards,
the implementation of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) by 2011, and the
establishment of Audit Committee functions. The authorities committed to implement the
assessment’s recommendations; in particular the BCCR has initiated the process to select an
external auditor and will include in the services to be contracted an analysis of the existing
gaps between the BCCR’s accounting practices and IFRS, in order to establish an action plan
for the implementation of IFRS.
B. Medium-Term Challenges
12.
Costa Rica faces several policy challenges as it recovers from the crisis and seeks to
achieve high and sustainable growth. While countercyclical fiscal stimulus has been used to
mitigate the impact of the global crisis, the government will eventually have to rein in public
spending and resume fiscal consolidation to keep public debt manageable and moderate
domestic demand growth. At the same time, the rapid decline of inflation provides an ideal
opportunity to advance in the transition to an inflation targeting regime and anchor inflation at
a low level. The crisis has also underscored the need to continue reducing external
vulnerabilities. To this end, greater exchange flexibility and a gradual build-up of
international reserve would help increase the economy’s resilience to external shocks and
continue to support investor confidence.

10
Box 1. Previous Article IV Recommendations
The previous Article IV consultation (February 2008) emphasized the need to lower inflation and
complete a reform agenda that included fully implementing the CAFTA-DR trade agreement, making
decisive progress toward the transition to inflation targeting, undertaking tax reform, and strengthening
financial regulation and supervision.
The global food and oil price shock in 2008 derailed the disinflation strategy. Inflation rose to
16.3 percent in November 2008, before falling to single digit levels in 2009. Partly due to this, progress
in the transition to inflation targeting and greater exchange rate flexibility was slow. In January 2009, the
authorities increased the rate of crawl of the upper (most depreciated) end of the currency band to
9 percent. They also issued regulations for currency hedging instruments and made progress toward the
unification of the segmented money markets. Other recommendations, such as a switch of the policy rate
or the replacement of the central bank deposit facility with reverse repos remain outstanding.
The authorities were able to obtain approval of all CAFTA-DR implementation laws by December 2008.
However, the long time it took to approve those laws caused delays for other key legislation such as the
VAT reform bill, the consolidated financial supervision bill, and the bill to recapitalize the central bank.
Some other recommendations of the previous Article IV consultation, such as the strengthening of the
bank resolution framework, are currently being pursued under the SBA.

Resuming fiscal consolidation
13.
Fiscal policy has helped support domestic demand during the downturn, but the
fiscal position has deteriorated considerably as a result. The cumulative fiscal impulse
during 2008–10 is likely to be in order of 3.5 percentage points of GDP, mostly explained by
a strong expansion of current primary spending. As a result, the combined public sector debt
is now projected to exceed 41 percent of

Staff argued that fiscal consolidation should begin as soon as the economic recovery
takes hold. The consolidation could usefully aim at lowering the debt-to-GDP ratio of the
combined public sector to the pre-crisis level of about 35 percent of GDP by 2014. This level
of debt, which is also in line with the average public debt-to-GDP ratio of investment grade
countries in the BBB/A range before the current downturn, would help rebuild room for an
effective fiscal response in case of future contingencies. Staff estimates that lowering the
public debt ratio to about 35 percent by 2014 would require policy measures of at least
2 percentage points of GDP (to be implemented in 2011–13), in order to reduce the combined

11
public sector deficit to less than 1 percent of GDP at the end of the projection period (see text
table below).

The authorities agreed on the need to achieve a significant fiscal consolidation over
the medium term. They noted that the prudent policies of previous years had provided the
scope for rapid implementation of countercyclical spending when the global crisis hit, and
recognized the need to adjust fiscal policies to bring the debt dynamics on a downward path
and regain fiscal space. However, the authorities were of the view that there was scope for a
somewhat less ambitious pace of fiscal consolidation and a higher debt-to-GDP ratio
objective since the public debt burden would remain well below historical levels for Costa
Rica.
16.
There was broad agreement that the authorities’ spending priorities and some
institutional features limit the scope for making the fiscal consolidation hinge on
expenditure restraint. A recent World Bank/IDB public expenditure review has highlighted
spending needs on transport infrastructure and secondary education. In addition, the
authorities felt strongly that the expansion of the social safety net had helped contain the
social fallout from the crisis, and was critical to poverty alleviation. The political scope for
reducing rigidities (i.e., earmarking) is also limited, and the importance of health, education,
and security sectors on the wage bill leave limited room to increase nonwage spending in the
near term. Although, staff agreed that the level of government spending was not out of line
with comparators (Figure 2), it noted that its composition was far from ideal as it did not leave
room for much needed increases in public investment. Staff also stressed the importance of
continued efforts to increase the efficiency of public spending, and welcomed the authorities’
initiatives to strengthen the budget formulation process and put in place a medium-term
expenditure framework.

Fiscal consolidation will ultimately hinge on increasing tax revenues. Staff argued
that many of the recommendations of the 2006 FAD tax policy review remained valid, and
that a combination of a broadening of the tax base, further improvements in tax
administration, and selective tax rate increases could yield about 2 percentage points of GDP
in the next few years. 5 The authorities felt that an increase of the suggested magnitude could
be feasible. They pointed to their ongoing efforts to strengthen tax administration and
indicated their preference to increase the revenue intake through the expansion of the income
and sales tax bases (including streamlining of exemptions and the incorporation of currently
untaxed incomes) rather than raising tax rates. 6 These proposals are reflected in two draft tax
reform bills, one of which (i.e., VAT reform) was submitted to the Legislative Assembly but
is not high on the legislative calendar. The authorities and staff agreed that seeking an early
consensus on the need to generate additional revenues would be essential to allow for
approval of tax reform early during the term of the next administration.
Achieving low and stable inflation
18.
The current slowdown, positive terms of trade shock, and sound policies have
combined to reduce inflation to a level not seen in over 30 years. For most of the past
decade, Costa Rica’s inflation hovered in the low double digits, considerably above the
region’s average. Staff stressed that the ongoing disinflation provides an opportunity to
achieve price stability more rapidly than previously envisaged. Staff and the authorities
agreed that advancing in the transition to an inflation targeting regime, supported by greater
exchange rate flexibility, could be useful to attain this goal by helping anchor inflation
expectations around the central bank’s inflation target. However, it was recognized that
effecting this change would be challenging 18
and require a considerable communications 16 CPI Inflation: Costa Rica vs. the Region
effort, given entrenched preferences for a

risks to the inflation outlook, including the

The recommendations of the FAD tax policy review include simplifying and eliminating exemptions for the
income tax and converting the sales tax into a broad-based value added tax.

6

Costa Rica’s efforts to strengthen tax administration will be supported by a FAD diagnostic mission in
September 2009 and the resident tax advisor of the recently established regional IMF technical assistance center
(CAPTAC-DR).

14
19.
Staff argued that monetary policy should be managed more cautiously during the
transition to inflation targeting. In particular, the central bank should stand ready to sterilize
fully the inflationary component of its quasi-fiscal deficit to avoid the large monetary
expansions observed in the past. Evidence of inflation persistence also argues for a less
accommodative monetary policy stance.

Greater exchange rate flexibility and the recapitalization of the BCCR would help
increase the effectiveness of monetary policy. The authorities emphasized that the widening
of the currency band is gradually allowing for the exchange rate to move more freely. While
the exchange rate has remained close to the upper ceiling of the band during most of 2009,
there had been some episodes of appreciation which were helping market participants realize
that the exchange rate may fluctuate within the band as external conditions improve. Further
episodes of exchange rate fluctuations would provide incentives for market participants to
develop instruments to cover for exchange rate risk. Staff suggested that the authorities clarify
the BCCR’s role in the foreign exchange market to avoid sending mixed signals about its
intervention policy. In particular, staff recommended that foreign exchange purchases on
behalf of public enterprises be conducted through the banking system rather than the BCCR,
and that the BCCR pre-announce its purchases for reserve accumulation purposes. Staff
expressed disappointment about the delay in recapitalizing the BCCR, and reiterated the
importance of repairing its balance sheet (e.g., through a one-step transfer of negotiable
Treasury securities) to enhance monetary control.
21.
Staff proposed several measures to improve the monetary policy framework. Staff
welcomed the integration of the money market under a new platform, which should help
better guide short-term market rates toward the BCCR’s policy rate and thus enhance
monetary policy transmission. In addition, staff proposed that the BCCR eliminate its public
deposit-taking facility and conduct its sterilization operations exclusively through its debt
operations. Staff argued that this would avoid conflicts between the central bank’s deposit
structure and its policy stance and increase the central bank’s flexibility to absorb liquidity.
Refocusing the BCCR’s debt management strategy to ensure that liquidity operations are
guided by monetary policy objectives rather than cost considerations would also be advisable.

15
Reducing external vulnerabilities
22.
The authorities and staff agreed that the exchange rate is close to its equilibrium
level. Staff’s econometric estimates based on the macro balance and equilibrium real
exchange rate approaches suggest that the level of the real effective exchange rate (REER) is
broadly in line with fundamentals under the baseline scenario (Box 2). Costa Rica’s actual
and equilibrium REER have moved in parallel in recent years and even though the actual
REER appreciated by about 5 percent in the first half of 2009, it remained well within its error
band. The authorities shared this assessment, adding that there is no evidence that export
competitiveness has been adversely affected by the crisis. In this regard, they noted that a
number of multinational service companies are establishing operations in Costa Rica to take
advantage of its competitive labor force for call centers and back-office operations.
Box 2. Assessment of Costa Rica’s Real Exchange Rate
Costa Rica’s real exchange rate level is appropriate according to an assessment based on standard
methodologies:


New results from a panel regression of emerging market countries based on the macro balance
approach shows that the current account norm for Costa Rica is 4¾ percent of GDP. The
current account projection for 2014 of 5 percent of GDP is within two standard errors of this
norm. This estimate assumes a fiscal consolidation over the 2011–14 period and a monetary
stance that maintains low inflation. Based on these policies, the real exchange rate is assessed to
be properly valued.



In terms of external debt dynamics, the ratio of external debt to GDP is projected to fall
modestly over the next few years and stabilize at about 27 percent of GDP. This is slightly
below levels normally associated with a sharp rise in crisis probabilities.



An alternative assessment methodology estimates the long-run determinants of the real
exchange rate. Staff and the authorities have found that the real exchange rate in Costa Rica is
cointegrated with a small set of
200
Actual and Equilibrium REER, in levels
variables including the productivity

differential between Costa Rica and
partner countries, the terms of trade, 160
and Costa Rica’s net foreign liability 140
position. These determinants suggest 120
that the real exchange rate was about
100
5 percent undervalued in 2008 (still
80
within the error bands), but that the

differential.

16
23.
Notwithstanding these positive developments, staff stressed that Costa Rica should
further strengthen its resilience to external shocks. Increased exchange rate flexibility and
higher international reserves would provide greater protection against external shocks.
Although Costa Rica’s current international reserves coverage is broadly in line with
commonly accepted benchmarks, it is somewhat below the coverage levels observed in
investment grade countries in the BBB/A range and dollarized economies from the region.

currency band.
Strengthening the financial sector
24.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ readiness to step up crisis preparedness and the
monitoring of the financial system. As the global financial crisis unfolded, the BCCR and
SUGEF sought to boost the system’s liquidity, including by modifying regulations to
encourage higher liquidity holdings, establishing a temporary facility to increase the liquidity
provision to banks, and broadening participation in the interbank money market. In addition,
the SUGEF set up a system to detect early symptoms of bank stress, and credit classification
rules were eased to facilitate loan workouts. The authorities also boosted the capital of public
banks, providing a safety margin ahead of the expected cyclical deterioration of loan
portfolios. The authorities and staff agreed that the temporary relaxation of some prudential
rules had provided a necessary breather for borrowers, but that banks should generally
maintain prudent credit standards, including with regard to safety margins to cover against
exchange rate risk.
25.
Otherwise, progress in financial sector reforms has been rather slow. While the
authorities were successful in discouraging offshore banking activity through tighter
regulation (reducing it to virtually zero by end-2008), a key bill to strengthen consolidated
bank supervision has yet to be approved by the Legislative Assembly and efforts to strengthen
the legal protection of supervisors were derailed by a court ruling. The authorities noted that
they will insist on these initiatives and are preparing regulations that will allow to implement
consolidated supervision swiftly after its legislative approval.

17
26.
Staff welcomed the SUGEF’s new strategic plan that focuses on implementing a
consolidated, risk-based approach to supervision. The authorities noted that the shift to a
risk-based approach to supervision would imply considerable changes to supervisory
practices, personnel recruitment and training, and enforcement powers and tools. Staff agreed
that the transition would need to be gradual and encouraged the authorities to seek technical
assistance in this area, including from the IMF. 7
27.
The authorities agreed that there remains room to improve bank monitoring and
data transparency. The SUGEF could improve the collection and processing of information
on the maturity structure of bank assets and liabilities and the assessment of liquidity
management procedures. In addition, ongoing monitoring efforts should be supplemented
with forward-looking stress tests on a bank-by-bank basis, to identify vulnerabilities to key
risks. To strengthen market discipline, the SUGEF could further improve the public
accessibility and scope of its bank data dissemination. In this context, staff called on the
authorities to repeal legal provisions that prohibit the dissemination of key financial
soundness indicators for individual banks, including risk-adjusted capital asset ratios.
28.
The mission discussed some of the preliminary lessons from the global financial
crisis and their relevance for financial sector supervision in Costa Rica. There was
agreement that the regulatory perimeter was comprehensive, covering also financial
cooperatives and finance companies, and did not leave out any systemically important
financial activities. The perimeter has grown with the de-facto closure of the off-shore sector,
and would expand further to cover leasing and investment banking operations once the
consolidated supervision law was approved. The authorities shared the principle of
countercyclical regulation, but indicated that applying it had been a challenge. Therefore, they
expressed interest in studying possible instruments being used in other countries. Finally, the
authorities noted that the BCCR facility established in late 2008 to provide systemic liquidity
would remain in place to deal with future contingencies.

7

The IMF has already been providing technical assistance to the SUGEF to implement a risk-based supervisory
framework for anti-money laundering/combating terrorism financing (AML/CFT) purposes.

18
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
The Costa Rican economy has withstood the impact of the global economic and
financial crisis relatively well. The authorities’ strategy to shield the economy from external
shocks through fiscal stimulus and the mobilization of contingent external financing,
including the precautionary SBA with the Fund, has helped sustain investor confidence and
financial stability. Output, especially in sectors dependent on external conditions, has
deteriorated sharply, but there is some evidence that the economy is bottoming-out.
Performance under the program has been commendable, with the authorities meeting all
quantitative performance criteria and structural benchmarks for the first review.
30.
Near-term prospects have improved and risks moderated, although they remain
somewhat tilted to the downside. Gradually improving global conditions should boost
confidence, help lift export-related activities, and restore investor risk appetite. Nonetheless,
some possibility of disruptive capital outflows remains, especially if the incipient global
recovery falters. This could result in pressures on the colón, which remains close to the ceiling
of the currency band.
31.
The authorities’ program is rightly focused on preserving stability, protecting the
external position, and supporting the nascent recovery. In the near term, fiscal policy should
aim at balancing the need for maintaining countercyclical support to domestic demand, while
keeping domestic government borrowing and the public debt in check. The authorities should
take into account that public financing requirements could eventually strain domestic debt
markets, contribute to higher real rates and tighter monetary conditions, and disrupt
confidence. To avoid this, fiscal consolidation should begin as soon as the recovery takes
hold.
32.
Inflation has reached historical lows, providing the central bank with an
opportunity to achieve durable price stability. Monetary policy will have to maintain its
cautious, gradual easing bias conditional on a decline in inflation and devaluation
expectations. In particular, continued upward pressure on the exchange rate would limit the
room for downward adjustment in nominal interest rates.
33.
Although the banking sector is sound, the authorities should remain vigilant to
remaining risks and press ahead with their well-focused agenda to strengthen supervision.
Further progress to refine early warning systems and identify vulnerabilities to key risks—
such as forward-looking stress testing— should be pursued. Staff welcomes the planned
implementation of risk-based supervision and calls for a strengthening of market discipline by
modifying legal provisions that limit the dissemination of prudential indicators for individual
banks.

19
34.
Over the medium term, policies should foster attaining sustained growth while
limiting domestic and external vulnerabilities. Following the sharp rise in government
spending in 2008–10, the fiscal deficit should be reduced to contain vulnerabilities and allow
for a gradual reduction in the debt burden. To sustain higher levels of public investment and
social services, a substantial increase in tax revenues will be necessary. While further
strengthening of tax administration could help boost the tax yield, tax reform should be a
central element of the government’s strategy. Fostering an early consensus on the need to
increase revenues would be essential to ensure that tax reform is approved swiftly.
35.
The recent decline in inflation should help strengthen monetary policy credibility
and allow important progress in the transition to inflation targeting. Staff regrets the lack of
progress in recapitalizing the BCCR, which remains critical for a sustained reduction of
inflation as it will remove a key source of monetary expansion in the economy. The
authorities are advised to take concrete actions to improve communication and the coherence
of the monetary policy framework, including eliminating the BCCR’s public deposit-taking
facility and conducting sterilization operations exclusively through debt operations; guiding
their liquidity operations primarily by monetary policy objectives; and clarifying the BCCR’s
role in the foreign exchange market.
36.
The economy has adjusted rapidly to external shocks but more can be done to
strengthen its resilience. The current level of the real effective exchange rate remains broadly
consistent with fundamentals. Nonetheless, a further, gradual build up of international
reserves over the medium term could provide an extra cushion to the economy and help boost
investor confidence.
37.
Staff recommends the approval of the first review under the SBA. Performance
under the program has been strong, and the authorities’ policies appear adequate to support
the recovery of the economy, while maintaining internal and external stability.
38.
The next Article IV consultation with Costa Rica shall take place in accordance
with the July 15, 2002 decision on consultation cycles.

Attachment I. Letter of Intent
San José, September 3, 2009

Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
1.
The purpose of this letter is to inform you about the progress in the implementation of
our economic program, which is being supported under the Stand-by Arrangement (SBA)
approved by the IMF Executive Board on April 10, 2009. The attached supplement to the
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) summarizes developments since
the inception of the SBA and describes modifications to the original program.
2.
The global crisis has hit Costa Rica hard, but the economy continues to withstand the
negative shock reasonably well. Economic growth during the first half of 2009 has been
substantially weaker than anticipated, though there is some evidence that the real GDP decline
is reaching an end. At the same time inflation has declined faster than expected, to a 30-year
low of 5.7 percent (y/y) in August. Lower growth and inflation have had a negative impact on
fiscal revenues, which declined by more than 8 percent through June. Prudent execution of the
budget, however, allowed the central government to post a somewhat smaller than projected
deficit during the same period. The external current account deficit has narrowed
substantially, and the overall balance of payments was in surplus during the first half of 2009.
The banking system has remained sound, despite some pick up in nonperforming loans and a
decline in bank profitability.
3.
Performance against the program targets was very strong. All quantitative
performance criteria for end-June were met, most with significant margins. We also have
implemented all three end-June structural benchmarks (the unification of money markets
suffered a slight delay owing to operational difficulties).
4.
In light of this performance and our continued commitment to the program, we request
completion of the first review under the SBA. Our intention remains to treat the arrangement
as precautionary. Given the sharp decline in tax revenues, we request revisions of the endSeptember quantitative performance criteria on the overall cash balance and the debt stock of
the central government. Program implementation will continue to be monitored through
quarterly reviews. The revised quantitative performance criteria for end-September, new

34
performance criteria for end-December 2009, indicative targets, and structural benchmarks
under the program are set out in Tables 1 and 2 of the attached supplement to the MEFP.
5.
We believe that the policies described in the attached supplement to the MEFP are
adequate to meet the objectives of our program. However, if needed, the government stands
ready to take additional measures. In accordance with the Fund’s policies, we will be in
continuous communication with the Fund with regard to policy actions related to this
program.

Sincerely yours,

________________/s/_________________

Attachment II. Supplement to the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
September 3, 2009
1.
Recent Developments. During the first half of 2009, economic growth was substantially
weaker than anticipated at the inception of the program. At the same time, vulnerabilities
declined as the main domestic and external imbalances corrected in a relatively orderly way.
Real GDP contracted by 4.8 percent (y/y) during the first quarter, driven by a sharp fall in
inventories and reflecting mainly a decline in sectors dependent on external conditions
(manufacturing, residential construction catering to foreigners, agriculture, and hotels). During
the second quarter, the index of economic activity (IMAE) declined by 2.9 percent (y/y) but rose
by 1.2 percent (q/q) on a seasonally adjusted basis, suggesting that the economy may have
touched bottom. Reflecting the economic slowdown, improved terms of trade, and prudent
monetary policy, inflation fell to the lowest level in several decades (5.7 percent (y/y) in August)
and the external current account deficit in the first half of the year narrowed much more than
expected (to 0.2 percent of GDP vs. 2.6 percent of GDP in the original program). Net capital
inflows also declined, reflecting in part the repayment of credit lines by domestic banks and
corporates, but were enough to cover the current account deficit and allow for an accumulation
of net international reserves (NIR) of US$137 million (compared to a US$285 million decline
allowed in the program). The banking system remained sound overall. While the nonperforming
loan ratio rose and bank profitability declined, liquidity and solvency indicators remained
adequate.
2.
Performance under the program. All end-June quantitative performance criteria and
structural benchmarks have been met.


Quantitative performance criteria. Despite sharply lower tax revenues, the cash balance
of the central government during the first six months of 2009 was C106 billion above the
program floor, reflecting cautious spending execution.



Fiscal policy nonetheless provided strong support to domestic demand, as noninterest
expenditures of the central government rose 14 percent in real terms. The debt stock of
the central government as of end-June was below the program ceiling, albeit by a small
margin as we took advantage of favorable conditions in the domestic market to
prefinance part of our remaining borrowing requirement for the year. As noted, NIR
exceeded the program floor, reflecting the larger than expected current account
adjustment. With the stronger reserves position, net domestic assets of the central bank
(BCCR) also remained well below the end-June ceiling.

1

1

The indicative target for the cash balance of the combined public sector was also met with a margin.

36


Structural benchmarks. The daily exercise to forecast systemic liquidity and the
preparation of monthly monitoring reports of the banking system were implemented
significantly ahead of the end-June target date. The unification of the money market was
slightly delayed, but the integrated platform for liquidity operations (MIL) finally became
operational in early August and the BCCR now only conducts liquidity injections through
this market.

3.
Revised macroeconomic framework. We have adjusted the macroeconomic framework
to take into account the outcome of the first half of 2009 and the revised forecasts for commodity
prices and global growth. Overall, the outlook for Costa Rica’s economy remains for a gradual
recovery, in line with the turnaround expected for our trading partner countries.


Real GDP in 2009 is now expected to decline by 1–1.5 percent (compared to the
0.5 percent growth envisaged at program approval). This forecast takes into account the
recent signs of a stabilization in output and a more positive outlook for manufacturing
exports in the second half of the year. Real GDP growth for 2010 has been revised
upward (to 2.25–2.75 percent), reflecting the improved outlook for growth in the United
States and other trading partners.



End-year inflation is now projected to be around 5 percent in 2009 (8 percent in the
original program). The program’s inflation goal for 2010 has been revised to 5 percent, in
line with the mid-point of the BCCR’s target range.



The external current account deficit for 2009 is now projected at 3.6 percent of GDP
(down from 5.3 percent of GDP at program approval). The balance of payments is
expected to remain in overall balance (excluding the inflows from the special and general
SDR allocations), as the net repayment of external credit lines by banks and lower
disbursements of official loans are projected to reduce the capital account surplus by
broadly the same amount as the decline in the current account deficit. In 2010, the
external current account deficit would widen to 4.8 percent of GDP, as international oil
prices are expected to increase and non-oil import growth bounces back with the
recovery.

4.
Fiscal policy. The lower than projected growth and inflation will compromise the
achievement of our original revenue targets. For 2009 as a whole, we anticipate a revenue
shortfall of C290 billion from the original program projection of C2,722 billion. Part of the lower
revenue will be passed on to the deficit of 2009. This will allow us to protect social spending and
provide sufficient support to domestic demand, while keeping the increases in the domestic
borrowing requirement and the debt-to-GDP ratio within reasonable margins. Overall, the
revised program will target a central government deficit of C680 billion or 4.1 percent of GDP
in 2009. The revised deficit of the combined public sector will increase by slightly less than the
deficit of the central government, and remain well under 5 percent of GDP. To finance the
additional deficit, we will increase our domestic borrowing and, if necessary, resort to the central
government’s accumulated cash reserves (1.2 percent of GDP as of late August 2009). For 2010,

37
we will target a central government deficit of 4.1 percent of GDP (C140 billion higher than in the
original program), and a combined public sector deficit of 4.7 percent of GDP. To avoid
crowding out private sector credit, we will seek to finance a substantial share of next year’s fiscal
deficit with resources from abroad, including by drawing on the $500 million contingent credit
line from the World Bank that is currently awaiting approval in the Legislative Assembly.
5.
Monetary and external sector policies. The stronger external position and the sharp
deceleration of inflation have created some room for monetary easing. Correspondingly, the
BCCR reduced in mid-July the policy interest rate from 10 percent to 9 percent and the overnight
deposit rate from 7.75 percent to 7.25 percent. In the period ahead, we will continue to monitor
closely domestic liquidity conditions and the attractiveness of the colon to gauge the
appropriateness of our interest rate level. We remain committed to adjusting interest rates as
necessary to achieve the end-2010 inflation target and maintain orderly conditions in the foreign
exchange market. To further bolster our international reserves position, we intend to save the
additional SDR allocation of the IMF (about US$205 million).
6.
Financial sector policies. Despite the resilience that the banking system has displayed so
far, we will remain vigilant and continue the intensive monitoring of the banking sector. We
remain committed to working closely with our Legislative Assembly to obtain approval of the
draft laws to establish consolidated supervision of financial conglomerates and recapitalize the
BCCR. We will also continue to address remaining gaps in the financial sector safety net,
including through the submission to the Legislative Assembly of draft laws to establish a bank
resolution framework in line with international best practice and create a deposit insurance
scheme (both now benchmarks for end-December 2009).
7.
Safeguards assessment. A safeguards assessment of the BCCR was completed in
July 2009. The assessment found that the bank has a sound operating control environment, in
particular covering the management of official reserves and internal audit functions, and made a
number of recommendations to further strengthen the BCCR’s safeguards framework. Key
recommendations include the appointment of an external auditor to conduct annual audits of the
BCCR financial statements from 2008 onwards, the implementation of International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) by 2011, and the establishment of Audit Committee functions. We
are committed to implementing the assessment’s recommendations; in particular, the BCCR has
already initiated the process to select an external auditor and will include in the services to be
contracted an analysis of the existing gaps between the BCCR’s accounting practices and IFRS,
in order to establish an action plan for the implementation of IFRS.
8.
Program monitoring. The program will continue to be monitored on a quarterly basis, by
quantitative performance criteria, indicative targets, and structural benchmarks. The phasing of
access under the arrangement and the structural benchmarks of the program remain unchanged
(Tables 1 and 2). The quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets for endSeptember 2009 and end-December 2009 are set out in Table 3 (quantitative performance criteria
for March 2010 will be defined at the time of the second program review).

Attachment III. Technical Memorandum of Understanding

This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) sets out the understandings between
the government of Costa Rica and IMF staff regarding the definitions of quantitative and
structural performance criteria and reporting requirements under the Precautionary Stand-By
Arrangement (SBA).

Definitions
Program Exchange Rates
For the purposes of the program (and not as a target rate), the average exchange rate is set at
576.3 Costa Rican colones per U.S. dollar. The exchange rates against the SDR and Euro are
provided in Table 1. The program rate for the inflation indexed unit (UDES) is set at
683.4 colones.

Central Government
Numbers referring to the central government include the central government budget and extra
budgetary funds. If the government establishes new extra budgetary funds, they will be
consolidated within the central government system.
Combined Public Sector
For program purposes, the combined public sector includes the central government, the
central bank, public enterprises (excluding the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE))
and a number of decentralized institutions (Table 2).

Quantitative Performance Criteria, Indicative Targets, and Continuous
Performance Criteria: Definitions and Reporting Standards
A. Floor on the Cash Balance of the Central Government
The cash balance is defined as the difference between total revenues and expenditures. The
floor on the cash balance of the central government will be monitored from above the line on
a cash basis. The interest component of expenditures excludes the capitalized inflation
component of inflation-indexed zero coupon bonds (TUDES).
B. Floor on the Cash Balance of the Combined Public Sector
The cash balance is defined as the difference between total revenues and expenditures. The
floor on the cash balance of the combined public sector will be monitored from above the line
on a cash basis. The balance of the central bank will be measured on an accrual basis. The
interest component of expenditures excludes the capitalized inflation component of inflationindexed zero coupon bonds (TUDES) held outside of the combined public sector.

42
C. Floor on Net International Reserves of the Central Bank of Costa Rica
Net international reserves (NIR) of the central bank of Costa Rica (BCCR) are defined
as the U.S. dollar value of gross foreign assets minus gross foreign liabilities of the BCCR.


Gross foreign assets are defined in conformity with the Special Data Dissemination
Standard as readily available claims on nonresidents denominated in foreign
convertible currencies. They include the BCCR’s holdings of monetary gold, SDRs,
foreign currency cash, foreign currency securities, deposits abroad, and the country’s
reserve position at the Fund. Excluded from reserve assets are any assets that are
pledged, collateralized, or otherwise encumbered, claims on residents, claims in
foreign exchange arising from derivatives in foreign currencies vis-à-vis domestic
currency (such as futures, forwards, swaps, and options), precious metals other than
gold, assets in nonconvertible currencies, and illiquid assets.



Gross foreign liabilities are defined as all short-term foreign exchange liabilities to
nonresidents, including commitments to sell foreign exchange arising from derivatives
(such as futures, forwards, swaps, and options) and all credit outstanding from the
Fund.
D. Ceiling on Net Domestic Assets of the Central Bank of Costa Rica

Net domestic assets of the BCCR are defined as the difference between base money and the
NIR of the BCCR converted at program exchange rates, where base money is defined as the
sum of currency issued and domestic currency reserve deposits of deposit-taking financial
intermediaries at the central bank.

43
E. Ceiling on the Debt Stock of the Central Government
The ceiling on the stock of central government debt shall apply to all debt defined as set forth
in point no. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt
(Decision No. 12274-00/85) 1 Excluded from this performance criterion are normal short-term
import credits. All foreign currency denominated debt will be converted into colones using
the program exchange rates set out in Table 1. All domestic debt denominated in inflation
indexed units (TUDES) will be converted into colones using the program rate set out in
Table 1.
F. Continuous Performance Criteria on Nonaccumulation of External Arrears
The central government will accumulate no external debt arrears during the program period.
For the purposes of this performance criterion, an external debt payment arrear will be defined
as a payment by the central government system which has not been made within seven days
after falling due under the contractual agreement, unless specified otherwise. The
performance criterion will apply on a continuous basis.
G. Adjustors
The floor on the NIR will be adjusted upward and the ceiling on NDA downward by the
amount of external financing contracted by the central bank, excluding funding used to
provide liquidity support to the financial sector and IMF disbursements.

1

The definition of debt set forth in point No. 9 of the IMF's guidelines reads as follows: “(a) For the purpose of
this guideline, the term “debt” will be understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a
contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and
which requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services,
at some future point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred
under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows: (i) loans, i.e., advances
of money to obligor by the lender made on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the
future (including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans and buyers' credits) and temporary exchanges of
assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and
usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements
and official swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers' credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to
defer payments until some time after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and
(iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the right to use for one or
more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while
the leaser retains the title to the property. For the purpose of the Guideline, the debt is the present value (at the
inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the agreement excluding
those payments that cover the operation, repair, or maintenance of the property. (b) Under the definition of debt
set out in point 9(a) above, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make
payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation
that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.”

44

Clarification of Structural Conditions
Benchmark for end-June 2009 on the establishment of a monthly monitoring report for the
banking system: Preparation of a monthly report to monitor the liquidity position of the
banking system on a bank-by-bank basis.
Benchmark for end-June 2009 on establishing a system of daily forecasting of systemic
liquidity in the money market: Establish a daily liquidity forecasting exercise, containing a
comprehensive assessment of liquidity supply and demand based on the compilation and
consolidation of information on liquidity needs, a forecasting methodology, close
communication with market participants and relevant parties, real-time monitoring of money
market transactions, and an assessment of the size and scope of BCCR's market intervention
and its effectiveness.
Benchmark for end-June 2009 on unification of the money market under a single platform:
Establishment of an integrated liquidity market (MIL) that will include the following: (i) the
introduction of a short-term lending facility that sets an interest rate ceiling to guide the
market rate; (ii) the BCCR's withdrawal from the interbank money market (MIB); and
(iii) disallowing access for financial entities to the central bank’s deposit facility (Central
Director) for maturities of 30 days or less, except for deposits with maturities that mirror the
maturities offered by the MIL lending facility.
Benchmark for end-December 2009 on submission to parliament of a draft law to strengthen
the bank resolution framework: The draft law should provide for a more robust bank
resolution framework. This framework should allow for the orderly transfer of assets and
liabilities of an insolvent bank to another institution, while imposing first losses on
shareholders and subordinated creditors before any of the general creditors, the deposit
insurance scheme, or the government incur costs.
Benchmark for end-December 2009 on submission to parliament of a draft law to create a
limited deposit insurance scheme: The draft law should establish a deposit insurance scheme,
which includes the following elements: contain a clear ex ante funding mechanism, provide
for rules to allow for the swift compensation of depositors in the event of a bank failure, and
describe the linkages to the bank resolution framework.

45

ceiling of the band was raised to 9 percent per year. Costa Rica has accepted the obligations
of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement and maintains an exchange
system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions. Buying and selling exchange rates were 587 colones per
U.S. dollar and 588 colones per U.S. dollar, respectively, as of August 26, 2009.

II. Relations with the World Bank Group
15.
The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) covers the remaining term of the
current administration and an additional seven months following the presidential
transition in May 2010. It includes a selective, demand-driven program of lending based on
the government’s policy priorities. The CPS supports the Government’s objective of
developing a comprehensive risk management framework in the context of an increasingly
unfavorable external environment. The program consists of four lending operations, totaling
US$258 million, targeted to specific areas: a Disaster Risk Management Development Policy
Loan with a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (CAT DDO) of $65m; a Secondary
Education Quality and Competitiveness Project ($80m); a Telecommunications TA ($13 m);
and an Integrated Infrastructure Development of the City-Port of Puntarenas ($100 m). The
program also includes a reimbursable TA operation for the social security agency (CCSS) in
the management of pension assets and supporting continued strengthening of the health
system; and, a nonreimbursable TA operation related to competitiveness, poverty targeting,
and social assistance.
16.
Although not specifically included in the 2008–2010 CPS, in April 30, 2009 the
World Bank’s Board approved a US$500 million contingent line of credit to boost the
country’s competitiveness, strengthen its public finances and respond to the global
financial crisis. The Development Policy Loan with a Deferred Drawdown Option (DPLDDO) supports the Government’s efforts aimed at: (i) strengthening public finances and their
transparency by enhancing the efficiency of revenue generation and results-based
management of expenditures; (ii) improving competitiveness by enhancing secondary
education, and expanding the beneficiaries of the conditional cash transfer program; and
(iii) establishing operational regulatory authorities for the telecommunications and insurance
sectors, and reinforcing the legal framework pertaining to intellectual property rights.
17.
The loan will be disbursed in a single tranche of US$500 million, payable in
30 years, including five years of grace period, following the National Assembly’s
approval. Although it is a single tranche operation, the actions being supported by the DPLDDO have formed part of a longer-standing policy dialogue that has been carried out through
various ongoing operations and, particularly, in the context of the Bank’s Analytical and
Advisory Activities (AAA) support, such as the Costa Rica Public Expenditure Review
(March 2008) and the Competitiveness Diagnostic and Recommendations (July 2009).
Consultation with the IMF was particularly close in the context of carrying out the Debt
Sustainability Analysis and in the assessment of macroeconomic and financial risks. The
prior actions in this DPL-DDO complement the actions in the IMF program. The DPL-DDO
harmonizes and complements Bank operations in agriculture, disaster risk management,
health and nutrition, education, and infrastructure. Details on the outstanding portfolio are in
the table below.

18.
Recent activities. Congressional ratification and declaration of eligibility of IDB
approved projects resumed in 2008 after a period of four years. The IDB still has four
operations awaiting legislative ratification, including a program for supporting
competitiveness, two infrastructure loans and the tourism program for protected areas. The
Liquidity Program for Growth Sustainability, a US$500 million dollar loan for the financial
sector approved by the IDB in December 2008, was cancelled by the Costa Rican authorities
on June 12, 2009 because of the improvement in the conditions on international markets.
Disbursements for the Electric Power Sector Development Program are expected to begin in
the last quarter of 2009. A Water and Sanitation Investment Program is currently under
preparation and expected to be approved by the end of 2009.
19.
Future plans. The IDB is currently preparing for the policy dialogue with the next
government, to take place in 2010 after the elections. The IDB intends to be involved in
operations in the infrastructure (electric, roads, and transport) and social sectors.

IV. Statistical Issues
20.
Economic and financial statistics are adequate for surveillance and program
monitoring purposes. The quality of macroeconomic data has continued to improve in
recent years. This was confirmed by a reassessment of the Data Module Report on the
Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) that took place in April 2009. Further
statistical improvements are being pursued, including in the real, monetary, fiscal, and
balance of payments sectors. Costa Rica is in observance with the Special Data
Dissemination Standards (SDDS). The Central Bank, the Ministry of Finance, and the
National Institute of Statistics and Censuses make data available to the public through
regular official publications on their websites (http://www.bccr.fi.cr and
www.hacienda.go.cr) .
Real sector
21.
A new consumer price index was introduced in August 2006 by the National
Institute of Statistics and Censuses. It is based on an updated and expanded consumption
basket, derived from a household survey conducted in 2004–05. The new and old CPIs
were spliced, using July 2006 as the base period.
22.
A new national account series was disseminated by the Central Bank in 2004.
The 1993 SNA was adopted as its conceptual framework and a wider database was
generated, that allowed the expansion in the scope of the accounts. Consistent GDP
estimates by production and expenditure approaches at current and constant prices, as
well as by income approach at current prices, are generated in the framework of supply
and use tables. However, the reference year 1991 for the series at constant prices is
outdated, data available for the quarterly GDP estimates are limited in scope, and an
excessive use is made of fixed coefficients that are more than five years old.
23.
Updates to the Producer Price Index (PPI) are not done on a regular basis
although it is expected that the index will be updated in 2010. The last update of the
index was in 2000. There are few regular comprehensive industrial surveys that can be
used to update the weights, the product sample, and the establishment sample for the PPI.
Plans are underway to resolve this problem. As a first step, a draft of a new business
register is now available.
24.
An area for improvement pertains to the wage and employment data, which
are currently available on an annual basis only. The authorities are looking at ways to
enhance the periodicity, timeliness, and overall quality of the data collected from this
sector.

Government finance statistics
25.
The Fund has launched a regional Government Finance Statistics (GFS)
Harmonization Project that will last 18–24 months. A STA mission visited Costa Rica
in late-March for the opening-workshop of the project, with the aim of establishing the
modalities of collaboration, the expected outcomes in terms of moving toward
harmonized standards and the medium-term process, and the actual data dissemination to
the public in the short term, including the appropriate metadata.
26.
Independently, Costa Rica has made progress compiling public finance data
according to the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM 2001). A plan
to migrate to GFSM 2001 was designed in 2004, and the authorities have developed an
integrated financial system for the budget and public debt as the starting point. They are
working to better integrate systems for accounting, budgeting, and debt management.
Further work is underway to address remaining weaknesses, including on the consistency
and availability of consolidated public sector data. These include discrepancies between
above-the-line fiscal figures and the financing side, and the need to standardize fiscal
information on an accrual basis. In addition, nonfinancial public sector data are published
only on an annual basis. A higher frequency would be critical to improve transparency
and monitoring of the overall public sector.
Monetary statistics
27.
Monetary and financial statistics are broadly in line with the IMF’s Monetary
and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). After successive TA missions to assist in the
implementation of the MFSM (2001, 2003, 2007, and 2008), several important
improvements have been made to the classification, coverage, and timeliness of the
money and banking statistics. In 2008, the country started reporting data to STA using the
standardized report forms (SRFs) for the central bank and other depository corporations
(ODCs). Coverage of the ODC sector is still not complete, because data exclude money
market funds and off-shore banks, which accept deposits from residents. The chart of
accounts used by ODCs does not permit a proper sectorization of claims on and liabilities
to domestic sectors, although additional data are provided by the ODCs to the BCCR.
Costa Rica is participating in the regional project for harmonization of monetary and
financial statistics in Central America, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, for which
the SRFs constitute the source data. There is in place a unified reporting system for
monetary data, which automatically generates the analytical tables used by WHD from
the data submitted to STA.
Balance of payments statistics
28.
Substantial progress has been made in the estimation of quarterly balance of
payments and international investment position (IIP) statistics. Costa Rica has
published quarterly balance of payment data (BOP) since 1999 and IIP data since 1996.
In 2005, Costa Rica initiated the compilation and dissemination of quarterly IIP data. In
September 2003, Costa Rica initiated the dissemination of quarterly external debt
position data with one quarter lag on the central bank’s website with a hyperlink to the
Fund’s website. As a SDDS subscriber, Costa Rica reports external debt data to the

9
Quarterly External Debt Statistics (QEDS) website, and disseminates, on a monthly basis,
the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity.
29.
The April 2009 Data Module ROSC mission found that Costa Rica has room
for improving the coverage of private sector transactions in external sector
statistics. Weaknesses in coverage are observed in areas such as services, compensation
of employees, and financial transactions of the private sector. Transfer prices in some
cases are not converted to market prices. On public external debt, the accrued interest
principle is not followed, but due date is recorded. Costa Rica will be able to receive
additional technical assistance on BOP and IIP statistics within the context of CAPTAC’s
Harmonization Project of External Sector Statistics in Central America, the Dominican
Republic, and Panama, in which all these issues will be addressed.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Approves First Review Under Costa Rica’s Stand-By
Arrangement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund today completed the first review of
Costa Rica’s economic performance under the 15-month, SDR 492.3 million (about US$780
million) Stand-By Arrangement approved in April 13, 2009 (see Press Release No. 09/124).
Completion of the review makes an additional SDR 41.025 million (about US$65 million)
available for disbursement, bringing the total resources available to Costa Rica under the
arrangement to SDR369.2 million (about US$585 million). The Costa Rican authorities
intend to continue treating the arrangement as precautionary.
Following the Executive Board discussion on Costa Rica, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, made the following statement:
“The Costa Rican economy has withstood the impact of the global economic and financial
crisis relatively well. The authorities’ strategy to reduce the impact from external shocks
through fiscal stimulus and the mobilization of contingent external financing, including the
precautionary Stand-By Arrangement with the Fund, has helped sustain investor confidence
and financial stability. Output, especially in sectors dependent on external conditions, has
declined, but preliminary evidence suggests that the economy is bottoming out.
“The 15-month Stand-By Arrangement is expected to remain precautionary and will continue
to support confidence through the availability of a substantial liquidity buffer. The program
has been revised to partly accommodate lower-than-expected fiscal revenues through higher
deficits in 2009–10. This will help protect social spending and support domestic demand,
while keeping the domestic borrowing requirement and the debt-to-GDP ratio within
reasonable margins.

2
“Inflation has reached historical lows, providing the central bank with an opportunity to
achieve durable price stability. Monetary policy will maintain its cautious, gradual easing
bias conditional on a decline in inflation and exchange rate expectations.
“The banking sector remains sound. While the cyclical downturn of activity has led to a
moderate increase in nonperforming loans and a decline in bank profitability, liquidity and
solvency indicators remain generally adequate and banks have reduced their net foreign
exposure by repaying external credit lines. The authorities will continue to monitor financial
sector risks closely, and press ahead with their well-focused agenda to strengthen bank
supervision, regulation, and the financial sector safety net.
“Overall, the near-term prospects for Costa Rica’s economy have improved and external
vulnerabilities have declined. The incipient global recovery should boost confidence, help lift
export-related activities, and restore investor risk appetite. Some downside risks remain,
especially if the global recovery falters or the fiscal borrowing requirement rises more than
expected. Continued strong implementation of the policies under the IMF-supported program
will help insulate Costa Rica’s economic recovery from these downside risks.” Mr. Portugal
said.

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Costa Rica
On September 23, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the 2009 Article IV consultation with Costa Rica. 1
Background
The global crisis has hit Costa Rica hard. After experiencing an economic boom with output
growth averaging 6.6 percent during 2003–2007, the Costa Rican economy decelerated sharply
in 2008 as output growth turned negative in the fourth quarter of 2008 (-1.7 percent compared
to the same quarter of the previous year) and continued to decline in the first quarter of 2009 (4.8 percent). A major correction in inventories and a decline in sectors most dependent on
external conditions were key factors behind the slowdown. Nonetheless, the decline in output
appears to be approaching an end. The index of economic activity rose 1.2 percent on a
quarter-on-quarter basis in the second quarter of 2009, as output in key sectors stabilized. At
the same time, inflation remained on a firm downward path, falling from 13.9 percent in
December 2008 to 5.7 percent in August 2009, its lowest level in over 30 years.
Despite the worsening of economic activity, the banking sector has remained sound. Although
the nonperforming loan ratio of banks has risen moderately and profitability declined in the first
half of 2009, liquidity and solvency indicators remained adequate. With the slowdown in activity,
demand for credit declined, contributing to a leveling of bank lending to the private sector.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
Nonetheless, bank deposits continued to grow, especially dollar-denominated deposits, allowing
banks to repay foreign credit lines and reduce their net external position. In light of the strength
of the balance of payments position, the authorities have treated the first purchase (about
$500 million) under the SBA as precautionary. 2
Fiscal policy has provided significant support to domestic demand. The fiscal deficit of the
central government increased to 1.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the first half
of 2009 as noninterest expenditures rose 14 percent in real terms, despite a significant revenue
shortfall. The central government’s gross financing requirements, including large amortization
payments were met through domestic bond issuances. Fiscal policy is expected to remain
expansionary in the second half of 2009. As a result, the central government deficit for the year
as a whole is expected to reach 4.1 percent of GDP, compared to a deficit of 0.3 percent of
GDP in 2008.
Monetary conditions have tightened somewhat in 2009. Despite the rapid decline in inflation,
nominal rates of colon-denominated deposits and government bonds remained largely
unchanged, contributing to an increase in real interest rates. In July 2009, the central bank
lowered its key policy interest rate by 100 basis points to 9 percent in July 2009. The exchange
rate has remained close to the ceiling (most depreciated end) of the currency band so far
in 2009, though occasionally traded up to 2 percent below the ceiling. Central bank (BCCR)
interventions were generally moderate.
Near term prospects have improved. Although real GDP is estimated to decline by 1.5 percent
in 2009, it is projected to increase by 2.3 percent in 2010 as activity recovers. Inflation would
continue to drop to reach 5 percent by end-2009, pulled down by economic slack, prudent
monetary policy, and the lagged effect of the commodity price adjustment. After a sharp
contraction in 2009 to 3.6 percent of GDP, the current account deficit is expected to widen
in 2010 to 4.8 percent of GDP, as imports bounce back with the economic recovery.
Nonetheless, some downside risks to this outlook remain. Concerns about the sustainability of
the incipient global recovery could weigh in on domestic demand and a concomitant loss in
domestic confidence could weaken the balance of payments.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that the Costa Rican economy has withstood the impact of the global
crisis relatively well. Directors commended the authorities for their strong policy performance
focused on preserving stability, protecting the external position, and supporting the nascent
recovery. They welcomed the prospects for positive output growth in 2010 and a gradual return
to potential growth over the medium term.
While noting that the immediate risks to Costa Rica’s economic outlook have moderated with
the stabilization of the global financial environment, Directors encouraged the authorities to

3
remain vigilant as confidence could weaken if the incipient recovery falters or the fiscal deficit
widens more than expected. They emphasized that timely implementation of structural reforms
in the areas of fiscal revenues and the financial sector will be key to maintain the positive
growth momentum.
Directors noted that fiscal policy should continue to strike a balance between supporting
domestic demand and keeping domestic government borrowing and the public debt in check.
Once the recovery takes hold, the fiscal deficit should be brought down to reduce the debt
burden and rebuild fiscal space. Achieving this goal, while maintaining higher levels of public
investment and social spending, will require a substantial increase in revenues, including by
broadening the tax base and strengthening tax administration.
Directors welcomed the recent decline in inflation, which would strengthen monetary policy
credibility and facilitate the transition to inflation targeting. Directors encouraged the authorities
to move forward with the recapitalization of the central bank, and recommended further steps to
improve communications and the coherence of the monetary policy framework, including by
clarifying the central bank’s role in the debt and foreign exchange markets.
Directors observed that Costa Rica’s balance of payments has adjusted rapidly to the
deterioration in the external environment. They noted staff’s findings that the current level of the
real effective exchange rate remains broadly in line with fundamentals. Most Directors found
merit in a gradual build up of international reserves over the medium term to further improve
resilience to external shocks.
Directors agreed that the banking sector remains sound. While the cyclical downturn of activity
has led to a moderate increase in nonperforming loans and a decline in bank profitability,
liquidity and solvency indicators remain adequate and banks have reduced their net foreign
exposure by repaying external credit lines. Directors welcomed the planned implementation of
risk-based supervision and called for strengthened market discipline by modifying legal
provisions that limit the dissemination of prudential indicators for individual banks. They
encouraged the authorities to continue to monitor financial sector risks closely, and to press
ahead with their well-focused reform agenda to strengthen bank supervision, regulation, and the
financial sector safety net.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Costa Rica will be held in accordance
with the Executive Board decision on the consultation cycle for members with Fund
arrangements.

Statement by Ramon Guzmán, Executive Director for Costa Rica
and Johnny Gramajo-Marroquin, Senior Advisor
September 23, 2009
We would like to thank Staff for a comprehensive and well-written set of papers. Our Costa
Rican authorities broadly agree with the Staff’s assessment. Performance under the Program
was very strong; all quantitative performance criteria for end-June were meet, most with
significant margins. Costa Rica has also complied with all three end-June structural
benchmarks. The authorities intend to continue treating the arrangement as precautionary.
After five years of robust growth, averaging 6.6 percent per year, the Costa Rican economy
has experienced a considerable slowdown since last quarter of 2008 as the United States, its
main trade partner, and the rest of the world entered the current recession. In that context, the
global crisis has hit Costa Rica hard, but the economy continues to withstand the negative
shock reasonably well. Active policies have helped preserve stability and mitigate the
negative impact on domestic demand. During the first quarter of 2009 real GDP contracted
4.8 percent (y/y) being substantially weaker than envisaged, however, short-term economic
activity indicators have shown some evidence that the real GDP decline is reaching an end.
At the same time, inflation has declined faster than expected, to a 30-year low of 5.7 percent
in August. Authorities agree with Staff that advancing in the transition to an inflationtargeting regime—supported by increased exchange rate flexibility—could be useful to
achieve price stability, helping anchor inflation expectations around the Central Bank’s
inflation target.
On the fiscal side, government revenues for 2009 are expected to fall short of the original
projection by around 1.7 percent of GDP. This shortfall is the result mainly of a larger than
anticipated decline in import-related taxes. About one half of the lower revenue will be
accommodated through a higher deficit to protect the planned increase in government noninterest spending. Overall, the revised program now envisages a central government deficit of
4.1 percent of GDP and a deficit of the combined public sector of 4.8 percent of GDP. The
increase in the deficit over previously programmed shall be financed by domestic borrowing
and, if necessary, by the use of central government deposits. In the case of 2010, the program
anticipates a deficit for the central government of 4.1 percent of GDP and a combined public
sector deficit of 4.7% of GDP.
It is important to underline that although mentioned deficits are higher than the original, they
continue to imply a small adjustment in structural terms. In this regard, my authorities also
want to highlight to the Board that planned spending was central to their objective of
fostering investment in human and physical capital. They feel that risks of deficit expansion

2
to stability are manageable, and want to stress their commitment to begin the fiscal
consolidation process as soon as the economic recovery takes hold.
The external current account deficit has narrowed substantially, and the overall balance of
payments was in surplus during the first half of 2009. For end-2009, the current account
deficit is expected to decline to 3.6 percent of GDP (5.3 percent of GDP at program
approval) and thereafter to increase to 4.8 percent of GDP in 2010. The balance of payments
is projected to remain in overall balance in 2009. In addition, our Costa Rican authorities
share the Staff’s assessment that the level of real effective exchange rate is broadly in line
with fundamentals.
The banking system has remained sound, despite some hike in nonperforming loans and a
decline in bank profitability. Although concerns about risks to bank liquidity have eased, the
Superintendency of Banks will continue to closely monitor developments in the banking
sector, particularly credit risks. The authorities are working on draft laws to strengthen the
bank resolution framework and create a limited deposit guarantee scheme, which are
scheduled to be submitted to the Legislative Assembly by end-December 2009.
The medium-term outlook for Costa Rica’s economy remains generally favorable. However,
authorities are aware that the following actions are desirable: i) after a large fiscal expansion,
it will be necessary to reduce the fiscal deficit to keep the debt burden in comfortable levels;
ii) advancing in implementation of inflation targeting regime and providing greater exchange
rate flexibility can help to achieve price stability; and iii) to continue enhancing the
supervision and prudential framework, and safety net for banks.
Authorities believe that the ongoing policies are adequate to meet the objectives of their
program. However, if needed, the government stands ready to take additional measures.
