IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Morocco
On January 23, 2017, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV Consultation with Morocco.1
Morocco’s macroeconomic conditions have improved since 2012, but growth has remained
sluggish. In 2016, growth slowed due to a sharp contraction in agricultural output and subdued
non-agricultural activity. The unemployment rate decreased to 9.6 percent in Q3 2016 while
youth unemployment remains high at 21.8 percent. Headline inflation (year-on-year) reached
1.6 percent, reflecting higher food and energy prices.
External imbalances have fallen substantially since 2012, even though the current account
deficit increased to 2.9 percent of GDP in 2016, against 2.2 percent in 2015. Strong
manufacturing and agriculture exports, and a rebound in tourism and remittances, have more
than offset the impact of increased equipment and food imports and low phosphate prices. As a
result, and with continued robust foreign direct investment (FDI), international reserves
strengthened to about seven months of imports.
Fiscal consolidation has continued with a deficit down from 4.4 percent in 2015 to about
4 percent of GDP against the objective of 3.5 percent of GDP for 2016. This reflects resilient tax

revenues and well contained current expenditures, which offset the grant shortfall of about
0.3 percent of GDP and allowed for an increase in investment spending.
Banks are well capitalized and have stable funding, but nonperforming loans are rising and
credit concentration risks, while declining, are still elevated. The expansion of Moroccan banks
into Sub-Saharan Africa opens new channels of risk transmission, but cooperation with host
country supervisors is intensifying and supervisory requirements for cross-border activities are
being upgraded.
Morocco’s medium-term prospects are favorable, with growth expected to rebound to
4.4 percent in 2017 and reach 4.5 percent by 2021. However, risks remain substantial, and relate
mainly to growth in advanced and emerging countries, geopolitical tensions in the region, world
energy prices, and global financial market volatility. Stronger medium-term growth will hinge
on continued implementation of comprehensive reforms with regard to labor participation and
labor market efficiency, access to finance, quality education, public spending efficiency, and
further improvements to the business environment. Continued poverty reduction, and lower
regional and gender disparities, will also be crucial to achieve higher, sustainable and more
inclusive growth.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their sound macroeconomic policies and
reforms, which have helped reduce domestic and external vulnerabilities, enhance the fiscal and
financial policy frameworks, and increase economic diversification. Directors noted that, while
the medium-term outlook is favorable, risks remain elevated. Against this backdrop, they
welcomed the authorities’ continued strong commitment to sound policies, and encouraged them
to sustain their reform efforts to further reduce vulnerabilities and promote stronger job creation
and more inclusive growth.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing up can
be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/m/qualifiers.htm.

Directors commended the continued progress made in fiscal consolidation, particularly the
recent containment of current spending, the energy subsidy reform, and the reform of the public
pension system. Going forward, they encouraged the authorities to gradually reduce the level of
public debt over the medium term while preserving pro-growth and social spending. Directors
agreed that efforts should focus on accelerating tax reforms to broaden the tax base and on
careful and well-planned implementation of the fiscal decentralization to mitigate any related
fiscal risks. Directors also encouraged the authorities to reform the civil service to help contain
the public wage bill.
Directors endorsed the currently accommodative monetary policy stance in the context of
moderate inflation and the nascent credit growth recovery. They supported the authorities’
intention to move gradually to a more flexible exchange rate regime and a new monetary policy
framework, which will help preserve competitiveness and better insulate the economy against
shocks. In this regard, Directors concurred that the conditions for a successful transition in 2017
are in place. Directors also encouraged the authorities to submit to parliament the draft central
bank law, which will strengthen Bank Al-Maghrib’s (BAM) independence and expand its roles
in the promotion of financial stability and inclusion.
Directors welcomed that the banking sector remains sound and well capitalized, and stressed
that rising non-performing loans, credit concentration risks, and the expansion into Sub-Saharan
Africa require continued monitoring. They also welcomed BAM’s continued efforts to
strengthen the financial regulatory and supervisory framework in line with 2015 Financial
Sector Assessment Program recommendations, including ongoing advances on cross-border
bank oversight, more risk-based and forward looking supervision, a stronger macroprudential
policy framework, and efforts to strengthen supervisory resources in view of expanding
responsibilities.
Directors emphasized the importance of sustained implementation of structural reforms to
promote higher and more inclusive growth. They recommended continued efforts to improve the
business climate, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, including by enhancing
their access to financing. Directors also called for improved labor market regulations as well as
increased efficiency of public spending on education and vocational training that better

4

addresses skill mismatches, which will be critical to bolster growth, reduce unemployment—
especially among the youth—, lower gender gaps, and strengthen competitiveness. Directors
welcomed ongoing efforts to reinforce the governance and oversight of public enterprises, and
looked forward to further progress in implementing the national strategy to fight corruption.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
December 28, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context. Macroeconomic conditions have improved since 2012 despite sluggish
growth. In 2016, growth slowed due to a sharp contraction in agricultural output and
subdued non-agricultural activity; the fiscal deficit is estimated to have declined to
3.5 percent of GDP; the current account deficit widened slightly to 2.9 percent of GDP;
and international reserves strengthened to about seven months of imports. Reforms are
advancing, including of the public pension system and the transition to a new exchange
rate and monetary regime. Banks are adequately capitalized, but non-performing loans
(NPLs) are increasing and credit concentration risks need to be reduced.
Outlook and risks. Growth is expected to rebound to 4.4 percent in 2017 and reach
4.5 percent over the medium term. Headline inflation is projected to be 1.2 percent in
2017 and stabilize at about 2 percent thereafter, while the external position would
continue to improve. Medium-term prospects are favorable, but risks remain
substantial, and relate mainly to growth in advanced and emerging countries,
geopolitical tensions in the region, world energy prices, and global financial market
volatility.
Policy discussions. Prudent macroeconomic policies and continued reforms, as well as
declining international oil prices, have helped to reduce domestic and external
vulnerabilities in recent years. However, the reform momentum needs to be maintained
in order to reach higher, sustainable, and inclusive growth so as to reduce youth
unemployment. The 2016 Article IV discussions focused on: (i) strengthening domestic
stability, including fiscal and macro-financial sustainability; (ii) safeguarding external
resilience with the transition to a new exchange rate and monetary regime; and
(iii) raising growth potential and job creation while promoting inclusion.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
1.
Decisive policies and reforms have helped improve macroeconomic conditions in
recent years, but important challenges remain in raising growth and employment. The
authorities have successfully reduced domestic and external vulnerabilities, enhanced the fiscal and
financial policy frameworks, and supported economic diversification (see Annex I). As a result, fiscal
and current account deficits have declined, and the medium-term outlook is favorable. Yet, external
risks remain elevated, and continued efforts are needed to further reduce vulnerabilities and
promote stronger and more inclusive growth. The IMF supports the authorities’ program through
the successor two-year precautionary and liquidity line (PLL) arrangement approved in July 2016.
This arrangement provides insurance against external risks and supports efforts to strengthen fiscal
sustainability, transition toward greater exchange rate flexibility, and promote higher growth so as
to reduce unemployment.

A. Recent Developments
2.
Following the parliamentary elections held on October 7, 2016, policy continuity is
expected. The incumbent Justice and Development Party (PJD) won the highest number of seats.
Therefore, the current Head of Government will lead the future government. Discussions on a new
coalition government are still underway, but it is likely to involve the same political parties as in the
current government, and staff believes that current policy and reform commitments will be
maintained.

The fiscal deficit is expected to be further reduced in 2016, to 3.5 percent of GDP, and
public debt is sustainable. After culminating at 7.3 percent of GDP in 2012, the deficit was reduced
to 4.5 percent in 2015 through strong policies, including energy subsidy reforms, resilient public
revenues, and well contained public expenditures. In 2016, tax revenues performed better than
projected, but grant revenues (mostly from Gulf countries) were lower than anticipated (39 percent
of expected amount at end-October). Public spending on wages, interest payments and subsidies

were below expectations, while capital expenditures continued to increase (76 percent of budget at
end-October). Public debt is sustainable and expected to peak at 64.3 percent of GDP in 2016.
5.
Monetary policy remains accommodative. After declining to 0.3 percent in January 2016
(y-o-y), headline inflation reached 1.6 percent in October due to increasing food and energy prices,
while core inflation increased to 1.1 percent. Average inflation is projected to remain at around
1.6 percent in 2016. Bank-Al-Maghrib (BAM) lowered its policy rate to 2.25 percent in March 2016,
the first reduction since end-2014.

Credit growth has recently started to recover as economic activity is picking up.
Following a credit boom in the mid-2000s, the
Real Estate Index, 2003Q4-2016Q3
(2006Q1 = 100)
credit to GDP ratio grew below trend, particularly
120

after 2012 (Box 1). Credit growth picked up only

recently, reaching 4 percent in September (y-o-y).
These trends have reflected a combination of

corporate deleveraging and increasing household

indebtedness in recent years, the latter becoming

(based on ratios to GDP and household income).

of the year, investment lending has been a key
driver of credit growth more recently. Mortgage lending remains moderate (about 5 percent y-o-y)
and there is no indication of a housing price bubble.

7.
Banks are well capitalized, but rising non-performing loans, credit concentration risks,
and expansion into Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are sources of concern (see flow chart). Banks’
regulatory capital ratio stood at 13.7 percent in 2015. Profitability declined during 2010–15 but
recovered in 2016. While provisioning levels are high, NPLs have been rising since 2012, reaching
8 percent in September 2016 (against 7.4 percent in 2015), driven by weak economic activity and
strains in parts of the corporate sector, including in construction. The banking system also remains
vulnerable to credit concentration risks: despite strict regulatory limits and declining aggregate
exposure (302 percent of T1 capital against 341 in 2014), stress test results suggest that the failure
of the top three largest corporate exposures (mostly SOEs) may lead to the under-capitalization of
several banks. Finally, the expansion of Moroccan banks into SSA provides diversification and profit
opportunities, but also opens new channels of risk transmission, as such riskier cross-border
exposures now account for about 20 percent of their assets, and some banks are systemically
important in certain host countries.
8.
The current account deficit has widened in 2016, but reserves continue to strengthen.
The current account deficit is expected to reach 2.9 percent of GDP in 2016 against 2.2 percent in
2015. This reflects increased machinery and food imports, and weaker export growth, as the impact

of low phosphate prices offset stronger automobile, agriculture and textile exports. Tourism and
remittances revenues have rebounded in 2016, offsetting lower-than-expected official grants from
GCC countries, while FDI inflows remain sizeable. Reserves strengthened further and should reach
100 percent of the Assessing Reserve Adequacy (ARA) metric by the end of 2016 (or 131 percent the
adjusted ARA metric). The net international investment position (NIIP) is expected to decline slightly
to -62½ percent of GDP, while external debt, amounting to 32.4 percent of GDP, should remain
moderate and sustainable. The real effective exchange rate has appreciated marginally since
mid-2015, increasing 3.7 percent (y-o-y) at end-November 2016 due to the strengthening of the US
dollar. The IMF’s External Balance Assessment (EBA) indicates that the external position is broadly
aligned with macroeconomic fundamentals and policies (Annex II).2
Morocco. Key Macro-Financial Linkages

The IMF’s EBA methodology includes three approaches to evaluating the external position relative to fundamentals
and desirable policies: (i) the current account approach suggests a current account gap of -0.9 percent of GDP
relative to the norm, equivalent to an REER overvaluation of 3.1 percent (compared to 7 percent in Spring 2016);
(ii) the external sustainability approach suggests an REER undervaluation of 9.7 percent; however this estimate tends
to be very sensitive to the underlying benchmark on net foreign assets; (iii) the REER approach suggests an
undervaluation of 6.4 percent, but data limitations affect the robustness of this estimate. Given measurement issues
in the latter two approaches, staff’s preferred approach is the current account approach, which suggests that on
balance, the dirham is broadly aligned with fundamentals.

B. Outlook and Risks
9.
Growth is expected to increase gradually and the external position to remain strong in
the medium term:


In 2017, growth should rebound to 4.4 percent due mainly to the base effect on agricultural
activity. In the medium term, it is expected to reach 4.5 percent, with potential output increasing
by an estimated one percentage point relative to 2016, driven by higher capital accumulation
and a pickup in productivity (Annex III). This latter trend assumes that the current government’s
reform commitments are implemented, including improvements to the business environment,
agricultural modernization and industrial diversification, and further integration into global value
chains. Inflation is expected to remain low at 1.2 percent in 2017 and to increase to about
2 percent over the medium term. Consistent with the envisaged investment and GDP growth
path, credit growth should pick-up over the medium-term to an average of 5 percent.



In 2017, the current account deficit is expected to decline to 2.3 percent of GDP. In the medium
term, it is projected to remain in the range of 1.5–2 percent of GDP. Export growth would be
driven by emerging sectors and stronger external demand, and a gradual recovery of phosphate
prices. Imports would grow steadily, with low (but rising) oil prices. Tourism receipts would
accelerate while remittances would remain robust. Sustained FDI inflows, in line with the
dynamism of new industrial sectors, would also contribute to bring reserves over 115 percent of
the ARA metric (151 percent of the adjusted metric) by 2021.

10.
Risks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside (see Table 1). Despite increased
economic diversification, growth will remain susceptible to agricultural output volatility. Weaker
growth in the euro area, or in other emerging and frontier economies, could affect external demand.
Adverse geopolitical developments in the Middle East and Europe, and their impact on tourism, also
remain significant risks. Finally, more volatile financial conditions, together with protracted
uncertainty about global trade policies, could affect investor confidence and banks’ correspondent
relationships, with potential impact on financial intermediation, notably for trade credit and
remittances. In terms of outward spillovers, the subsidiaries of Moroccan banks in SSA are
systemically important in some host countries. On the domestic front, the new coalition government
may make changes to some policies.
11.
The authorities broadly agreed with the outlook and characterization of risks in the
RAM and the external sector assessment (Annex II), but viewed the impact of some of these
risks as less severe, including risks of rising nationalism in large economies, fragmentation and
security dislocation, and slower than expected pace of reforms. They also noted that there is upside
growth potential as economic activity in Europe strengthens and current structural reforms bear fruit
and help increasing diversification and moving up the value chain. They agreed that a higher growth
path would require significant gains in productivity.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
12.
Building on recent fiscal and external improvements, the reform momentum needs to
be maintained to secure longer-term stability and raise growth and employment (Appendix I).
This will require:


Strengthening domestic stability;



Safeguarding external resilience; and,



Raising potential growth and job creation while promoting inclusion.

A. Strengthening Domestic Stability
13.
The authorities continue to implement gradual fiscal consolidation despite recent
shortfalls in grant revenues. The fiscal deficit objective of 3.5 percent of GDP for 2016 is estimated
to have been met, including due to spending cuts (such as in wages and subsidies) to offset the
grants shortfall observed again in 2016 (about 0.4 percent of GDP). In 2017, the deficit is expected to
decline further to 3 percent of GDP, in line with projections at the time of PLL request. This would
reflect: (i) reduced spending (in percent of GDP), primarily through contained spending on public
wages and goods and services; and (ii) stable tax revenues, due mostly to weaker growth in 2016
and increased VAT refunds.3 Staff supported these objectives, which will allow to reduce public debt
while preserving growth-friendly expenditures, and encouraged the authorities to identify shortterm measures for 2017 to compensate for any grants shortfall.
14.
While sustainable, public debt should be placed firmly on a downward path. The debt
sustainability analysis (DSA) shows that public debt, which rose from 47 percent in 2009 to
64.3 percent in 2016, remains sustainable and resilient to various shocks (Annex IV), and below the
debt burden benchmark of 70 percent of GDP for emerging markets. Still, there are significant fiscal
risks, including potential delays in reforms to raise potential growth in the years ahead. Staff and the
authorities agreed to maintain the objective of reducing public debt to 60 percent of GDP by 2020,
in order to increase fiscal space gradually, without affecting growth.
15.
Reducing public debt will require fiscal reforms to bring the fiscal deficit to about
2.4 percent of GDP by 2020. Following important reforms to rein in public spending in recent
years, including through energy subsidy reforms (and associated stronger social safety nets), the
new organic budget law, and public pension reform, fiscal consolidation efforts going forward
should focus on a few key reform areas:


Taxation. The authorities are implementing tax reforms in line with recommendations from the
2013 national tax conference (Box 2). Staff welcomed recent efforts, such as regarding the

3

Projections of taxes on income, profits, and capital gains are based on last year’s revenues. The authorities project
an increased VAT refund from 5.2 billion dirhams in 2016 to 7 billion dirhams in 2017.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MOROCCO

taxation of self-employed and liberal professions. Staff recommended that tax reforms, which
could yield about 1.5–2 percent of additional public revenues over the medium term, be
accelerated. A key priority is to broaden the tax base, including through fight against fiscal fraud,
and reduced VAT and other tax exemptions (especially for large agricultural firms). In general,
better communication on tax reforms, providing context for specific changes to the taxation
regime, would also help make such reforms better accepted and more impactful. The authorities
agreed that there is room to broaden the tax base and are committed to this reform.


Fiscal decentralization. The authorities are shifting increasing amounts of public resources to
the regional level as part of their regionalization initiative. They are aware that there are
important fiscal risks associated with fiscal decentralization, and that proper administrative
capacity and checks and balances have to be in place to ensure sound public financial
management at all levels. Indeed, they have taken action to strengthen local operational
structures for regional development planning and project management, and to reinforce
budgetary and financial procedures and controls for regions (Box 3). Staff supported these
efforts, and welcomed the authorities’ interest in receiving Fund TA support on local taxation,
capacity development, and fiscal management.



Civil service. The authorities intend to keep the public payroll below 10.5 percent of GDP over
the medium term so as not to compromise priority spending. Several reforms have been
pursued to achieve this objective, such as the recent introduction of contractual employment
and increased personnel mobility across ministries. Staff welcomed these efforts and stressed
the need for a comprehensive reform of the civil service in order to generate savings on public
wage spending while increasing the efficiency of public services. Staff highlighted some options
for this reform, including changes to civil service statutes aiming for more merit-based career
progression, as well as changes to public wage structures. The authorities agreed that a
comprehensive reform is needed.



Public enterprises. The authorities have taken steps to address potential state owned enterprise
(SOE)-related fiscal risks for which specific provisions are missing from the Organic Budget Law.
A draft law to reinforce the governance and oversight of public enterprises has been submitted
to the cabinet for approval. The authorities also work on a consolidated SOEs balance sheet.
Staff welcomed these plans while stressing the need to advance them expeditiously.

16.
The accommodative monetary policy stance remains adequate. The policy rate cut in
March 2016 was instrumental in supporting the nascent credit recovery, suggesting that monetary
transmission is effective. Staff noted that in the baseline scenario, the current monetary policy stance
would remain appropriate as long as inflation expectations remain well anchored. This is the case in
particular for 2017, when inflation is expected to remain moderate reflecting a weather-related
decline in food prices while economic activity is above potential. Since SME credit could be
hampered by demand or supply constraints, staff supported continued initiatives by the authorities
to provide SME credit guarantees and to address potential obstacles to SME credit access. The
authorities noted that BAM’s main objective is inflation, and that credit growth has started to pick
up while liquidity conditions are adequate.

17.
The financial system is resilient but key risk exposures require continued vigilance and
reforms:


NPLs. The authorities intend to move forward in the first half of 2017 with several reforms
consistent with FSAP recommendations, including: aligning loan classification and provisioning
rules with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and formalizing and harmonizing
the criteria for inclusion in supervisory “watch lists” (and implementing related tighter
provisioning requirements). In addition, the future legal framework for collateral execution
should help increase recovery rates.



Concentrated credit exposures. The authorities agree that large credit exposures continue to
pose a risk and are taking action to reduce them. They issued a new directive in June 2016
requiring corporate groups to prepare consolidated financial statements including all existing
debt, and specifying future borrowing plans. In addition, they are considering a further
tightening of risk weights for large connected exposures.

18.
More broadly, continued improvements to the financial sector policy framework are
underway. Changes in the financial system, including its increasing complexity, the cross border
expansion of Morocco’s banks, and the forthcoming exchange rate flexibility, require increased
supervisory resources and a continuous shift to more risk-based and forward-looking supervision:


Supervisory capacity and resources. Efforts to increase supervisory resources and capacity are
progressing, in line with FSAP recommendations. In addition to new recruitment, organizational
changes were made in 2016, including the creation of specialized units dedicated to the
oversight of systemic banks, cross-country exposures, and bank recovery plans. In preparation
for the exchange rate transition, the authorities requested Fund TA support in assessing banks’
readiness to manage currency risks.



Macro prudential policy. This policy framework has been enhanced with the creation of a
dedicated department at BAM, inter-agency discussions of financial stability issues at the level of
the Systemic Risk Surveillance and Coordination Committee (CCSRS), and the introduction of the
legal power to impose countercyclical capital buffers. Going forward, priorities include filling key
data gaps for macro-prudential surveillance, such as sectoral data on loan-to-value ratios and
debt-service-to-income ratios, and designing capital surcharges for systemic banks.



Crisis management and bank resolution. The authorities will start upgrading the legal
framework for bank resolution, while ensuring its compatibility with broader Moroccan law. This
effort will introduce key changes consistent with recent FSAP and Fund TA recommendations
(including the “least-cost” principle, changes to the deposit guarantee scheme, and bail-in
powers), but it is likely to take several months. As a result, BAM’s designation as the resolution
authority will not be introduced in the central bank law to be approved in the next parliament
session in 2017—but the new emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) framework will.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MOROCCO



Cooperation with host country supervisors. Such cooperation, aiming to supervise the cross
border activities and exposures of Moroccan banks, has intensified. Formal arrangements have
been established with bilateral and regional supervisory bodies (such as at the BCEAO and
CEMAC) and supervisory colleges for all main banks are in place. The authorities also upgraded
supervisory requirements for cross border activities, including in terms of country and sovereign
risk management.

19.
AML/CFT framework. The authorities are preparing for the evaluation of AML/CFT-related
risks by the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF) in 2017. They are
currently reviewing the potential need to adjust current legal frameworks in various parts of the
financial system, in line with the latest changes introduced by the FATF. In particular, the authorities
should continue to strengthen risk-based AML/CFT supervision, improve the availability of beneficial
ownership information and enhance monitoring tools to mitigate cross-border AML/CFT risks,
especially in the context of the banking sector’s expansion to the SSA region.

B. Safeguarding External Resilience
20.
The authorities have entered the final preparatory phase for the introduction of
greater exchange rate flexibility in 2017. Greater exchange rate flexibility will increase the shock
absorption capacity of the economy, particularly given current constraints on fiscal space. It will also
help preserve competitiveness and better incentivize the reallocation of productive resources
between the tradable and non-tradable sectors within the economy (Box 4).
21.
The authorities and staff agreed that the current conditions in Morocco offer a unique
window of opportunity for such a transition. While not without risks in a global context of volatile
financial conditions, key pre-conditions are in place to ensure that Morocco can move from a
position of strength, including: strong macroeconomic buffers and comfortable reserves; recently
enhanced fiscal, monetary and financial policy frameworks; alignment of the exchange rate with
fundamentals, which reduces the risk of large exchange rate adjustments; limited currency risk
exposures in the economy, including low level of foreign currency-denominated public debt;
relatively low estimated pass-through of exchange rate movements to consumer prices; and a preexisting exchange rate market that already helps operators to manage the dirham’s volatility vis-avis individual currencies.
22.
In preparation for the transition, the authorities have benefited from extensive Fund
technical assistance, and they are now ready operationally. Technical assistance has helped the
authorities prepare for the implementation of key technical and operational aspects of the
transition, including: macro-economic modelling; forecasting and policy analysis; communication
strategy; legal, institutional and regulatory structures; and foreign exchange market development.
23.
Staff supports the authorities’ gradual approach, consisting in introducing an adjustable
horizontal band, which will progressively dis-anchor the dirham from the current currency basket,
foster the deepening of the foreign exchange market, and allow for monetary policy decisions to be
increasingly based on inflation forecasts. Staff highlighted the importance of timely communication

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

MOROCCO

to manage economic agents’ expectations regarding the sequence and modalities of the transition.
The authorities noted that their roadmap incorporates these aspects, including through regular
meetings and outreach to banks, corporations and the general public.
24.
Staff agreed with the authorities that the adoption of fully-fledged inflation targeting
should be envisaged in the later stage of the exchange rate transition. In the meantime,
maintaining the current monetary policy regime will help avoid any major conflict between the
adoption of a formal inflation target and the existence of a still narrow exchange rate band. There
was also agreement that restrictions on capital outflows by residents should not be eliminated in the
short run, in order to minimize risks during at least the initial phases of the transition.

C. Raising Potential Growth and Job Creation while Promoting Inclusion
25.
Addressing key constraints to growth can significantly raise Morocco’s growth
potential (see Annex III). Staff’s analysis shows that the main obstacles to higher growth in Morocco
are the quality of education, skills mismatches, governance and the business environment, and the
functioning of the labor market. Their impact has been reflected in Morocco’s declining productivity
and lower human capital levels, employment and labor force growth, compared to emerging market
peers. Staff’s baseline scenario assumes that the ongoing reforms to improve the business
environment and access to finance would increase potential output by about 1 percentage point in
the medium term. However, it is estimated that more ambitious structural reforms to address all of
the above constraints could increase potential growth by about 2 percentage points.
26.
The business environment has improved but further progress is needed. Efforts have
been made recently to simplify administrative procedures (such as for customs transactions,
property rights, and enterprise creation), and to reduce payment delays from the public to the
private sector. Morocco’s 2017 Doing Business ranking improved to 68 (against 75 in 2016).
However, key reforms are still needed. Staff highlighted the importance of making the Competition
Council operational by appointing all its members and of fighting corruption through a determined
implementation of the recently-adopted national strategy. The authorities reiterated their
commitment to business climate improvements and pointed to plans to further simplify
administrative procedures, including by developing an e-regulation platform.
27.
High youth unemployment, inadequate education outcomes and gender gaps are
barriers to higher and more inclusive growth. Unemployment is high, especially among the youth
(Box 5). Female labor force participation is very low, at 24.8 percent, and has declined in the past
decade. These outcomes partly reflect poor education and skills mismatches, highlighting the
importance of speeding up education and labor market reforms. In this context, staff reiterated the
need to increase the efficiency of public spending on education and to enhance teachers’ training,
recruitment, and evaluation, and also noted the need to foster public–private partnerships for
curriculum design and apprenticeships, which could help align worker skills with private sector
needs. The authorities shared staff’s assessment and highlighted their recent efforts to facilitate the
deployment of teachers, as well as the recently-adopted strategy on vocational training, which is

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MOROCCO

focused on private sector needs.4 The authorities and staff also agreed on the need to improve labor
market regulations to facilitate job creation. In this regard, staff encouraged the authorities to
consider relaxing restrictions on fixed-term contracts and layoffs in order to better integrate young
workers in the labor market. Finally, staff stressed the need to strengthen policies to reduce gender
gaps in education and labor force participation, including by investing in women’s education, child
care facilities, safe transportation and removing gender discriminatory tax practices.5
28.
SME access to finance is improving but challenges remain. The latest World Bank
Enterprise Survey shows that firms with a line of credit have increased to 52 percent in 2013. Large
enterprises have better access (72 percent) than SMEs (50 percent), but both ratios in Morocco are
higher than the world and Middle East averages. Nonetheless, collateral requirements continue to
be a constraint particularly for small enterprises. In addition to public mechanisms to support SME
credit, staff welcomed the launch of a second credit bureau expected in January 2017. The
authorities indicated that the draft law on collateral is ready for discussion and would play a key role
in facilitating collateral enforcement through extra-judiciary procedures and thus further improving
credit access for SMEs. Staff also encouraged the authorities to continue with efforts to bring
Morocco’s insolvency regime in line with international best practices.

STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
Morocco’s sound macroeconomic policies and ongoing reforms have helped reduce
vulnerabilities and increase the economy’s resilience. External and fiscal imbalances have
decreased significantly in recent years, and international reserves are now comfortable. Key reforms
have been implemented in the areas of public subsidies, fiscal management, financial oversight, and
economic diversification. Most recently, the preparations for the transition to a new exchange rate
and monetary regime have been finalized. Yet, growth remains sluggish and subject to agricultural
volatility, but it is expected to rebound in 2017 and to strengthen gradually in the medium term.
30.
In an environment still subject to elevated downside risks, and given domestic
challenges, sustained reform implementation will be crucial. The economy remains vulnerable to
global conditions, notably the risk of weaker growth in the euro area and emerging economies,
adverse geopolitical developments in the Middle East and protectionist trade policies in large
economies. In several areas, accelerating the pace of reforms will also be key to increase Morocco’s
growth potential, achieving higher and more inclusive growth, and reducing persistent high
unemployment levels, especially among the youth, while improving women’s participation in the
labor force. Priority reform areas include further improvements to the business climate (particularly
for SMEs), education, and labor market functioning.
31.
The current macroeconomic policy mix consisting of fiscal consolidation and
accommodative monetary policy continues to be appropriate. The fiscal deficit is expected to

decrease in 2016, buttressed by short-term measures to offset lower-than-expected grants. It will
further consolidate in 2017 with stable tax revenues and contained current spending. Since inflation
expectations remain well-anchored, the current monetary policy stance would remain adequate and
support a gradual pick-up in credit growth.
32.
Over the medium term, further fiscal consolidation will be required to put public debt
firmly on a downward path. Even if sustainable, public debt is relatively high, and reducing it to
60 percent of GDP by 2020 will be key to create fiscal space for social and growth-enhancing
expenditures. Building on progress in reining in public spending in recent years, including energy
subsidy reforms, efforts should focus on accelerating tax reforms by broadening the tax base and
promoting greater tax efficiency, equity, and simplicity; gradually implementing fiscal
decentralization in order to introduce all needed safeguards; enhancing the governance and
financial oversight of public enterprises; and pursuing civil service reforms aiming to generate
savings on the public wage bill while increasing the efficiency of public spending.
33.
The conditions for a successful transition to greater exchange rate flexibility in 2017
are in place. Such flexibility will increase the shock absorption capacity of the economy, particularly
given current constraints on fiscal space, and help preserve competitiveness. Staff is of the view that
Morocco’s current position of strength offers a unique window of opportunity for such a transition.
Staff supports the authorities’ preference for a gradual approach to dis-anchor the dirham from the
current currency basket and to allow for monetary policy decisions to be increasingly based on
inflation forecasts.
34.
Ongoing advances in financial oversight will further enhance the financial system’s
resilience including in the context of the cross border expansion of Moroccan banks and the
forthcoming introduction of greater exchange rate flexibility. Increased supervisory resources, the
shift toward more proactive, risk-based and forward looking supervision, and the authorities’
continued efforts to tighten provisioning requirements and to strengthen the macro-prudential
policy framework, in line with 2015 FSAP recommendations, are welcome.
35.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

reallocate credit away from most affected sectors.
Both credit demand and supply diminished rapidly after the 2008 financial crisis. The results of the
estimations of a generalized method of moments with separate sets of exogenous variables indicate that
both have been significant drivers of credit (with expected signs). The supply curve is estimated from the
loan-deposit spread and NPLs, and the demand curve from GDP and real estate prices. In particular, the
estimations show that banks supply more loans when systemic liquidity increases and demand increases
with lower interest rates and higher real estate prices. Empirical evidence suggests that credit demand has
been affected by slow growth in real estate prices in the post-financial crisis period, while supply has been
affected by lower profitability for banks via interest rates and also a moderate rise in NPLs. More recently,
since 2013, the supply curve has remained low and predicted demand has been somewhat higher, but
supply cannot be identified as a major constraint for credit growth.
Going forward, credit is expected to grow
around 5 percent annually over the medium
term. Based on projected inflation and GDP
growth, credit growth should be between
2.5 and 7 percent. A cross-country comparison of
credit growth for emerging market countries
with similar macro-indicators shows this
projection is around the median expectation of
4.5 percent. Appropriate policies to boost credit
activity, such as continuing with an
accommodative monetary policy, government
guarantee programs for boosting credit supply
to SMEs, unlocking payment delays to revert
liquidity constraints, and restructuring corporate
debt that are negatively affecting bank balance
sheets could play an important role to support
this development.

Box 2. Morocco: Advancing Tax Reforms
Morocco has undertaken a number of reforms to implement the consensus from the National
Conference on Taxation in 2013. Key measures implemented since then include: the introduction of
corporate tax brackets in the 2016 budget (departing from a unique 30 percent corporate income tax rate),
the introduction of VAT deductions in some agro-industrial inputs, and improvements to the VAT refund
system. The core VAT regime remains unchanged with a regular rate of 20 percent, and several reduced
rates. Revisions were also introduced on excise

Cross country experience suggests that successful tax reforms generally require a comprehensive
approach. While average VAT statutory tax rates are very close among developing and advanced economies
(14.7 percent versus 16.2 percent), income tax rates can vary significantly, but they have declined in the past
ten years, and some convergence of corporate tax rates has been observed. There is a large variation in the
contribution of different taxes to government revenues, and cross country experience also shows that
multiple VAT rates could introduce economic distortions, complicate administration, and cause revenue
loss.1 In the absence of comprehensive strategy, the risk is that isolated reforms of specific taxes may either
introduce inconsistencies or distortions, or be perceived as unfair, and in the end counter-productive from
the perspective of improving the quality, efficiency and acceptance of the tax system.
While achievements have been made, there is a need for greater clarity and communication on the
overall reform strategy. There is agreement that the priority is to broaden the tax base and make the
system more efficient and equitable (including in light of widespread exemptions and tax evasion). However,
faster implementation of the agreed consensus reached in 2013 requires a more strategic and pedagogic
approach, including the coordination, sequence, and timeframe of reforms, which could yield about
1.5–2 percent of additional public revenues over the medium term. These could include:
Short term measures to boost VAT revenues based on recommendations from previous TA, specifically
the application of 7 percent rate to some exempted products, including inputs to agriculture, and a
gradual convergence to a dual VAT rate system;
 Consolidation of the corporate tax reform, including to prevent tax avoidance from recently introduced
corporate tax brackets, which are expected to yield an additional 0.7 percent of GDP of corporate tax
revenues in 2017. At some point, a full assessment of the benefits and risks from implementing this
tiered system, which is atypical from a cross country perspective, would help guide about future
corporate tax reforms;
 Accelerated reduction of exemptions for large agricultural firms, and better enforcement of tax
payments by the self-employed and liberal professions.

Box 3. Morocco: Fiscal Decentralization
The process of regionalization in Morocco has been revitalized with the adoption of the 2011
constitution. It intends to promote sustainable development, modernize state’s structures, and strengthen
the participation of citizens to economic development. Significant economic, social, cultural, and
environmental competencies are gradually transferred to regions and local communities.
Decentralization is now also leading to an increased sharing of public resources between the central
government and local entities. The organic budget law for the regions, adopted in June 2015, defines the
contours of this process and transposes the principles of the OBL at the local level, including by
modernizing the institutional framework and reinforcing governance at the local level. On the revenue side,
an increased share of revenues from personal income tax, corporate tax, housing tax, VAT, and various
licenses and fees are assigned to regions. For instance, the 2016 budget increased the share of income tax
revenues allocated to regions from 1 to 2 percent, and the authorities plan to increase this share gradually in
the years ahead up to 5 percent by 2020. To ensure that all regions meet their assigned expenditure
responsibilities, additional transfers from the central government are also possible.
International experience shows that fiscal decentralization entails significant risks that Morocco will
need to manage. Successful fiscal decentralizations requires clear revenue and spending responsibilities,
sound public financial management, adequate revenue sharing arrangements, mechanisms to limit
borrowing (including based on market discipline), and administrative controls.1 Morocco’s regional system is
still characterized by significant fragmentation and administrative structures and the devolution of certain
responsibilities to the local level may be too partial and, combined with limited implementation capacity,
may lead to inconsistent development strategies (e.g., with regions deciding to open schools but without
control on infrastructures or teacher hiring). Furthermore, own resources of regions (less than 10 percent of
central government resources) may be insufficient and render the system increasingly dependent on
complex tax revenue sharing mechanisms, equalization of grants, central government subsidies, and
potentially excessive borrowing, with little incentive to mobilize revenues locally.2
The authorities are putting in place key elements of a strategy for fiscal decentralization, including
safeguards at the central and local levels. Building on the framework provided by the organic budget law
for the regions, these elements provide greater clarity on the sequence of reforms and public resources
transfers, and on mechanisms to ensure sound public financial management at local and regional levels.
They include:


Strengthened operational structure for regions, including for project management, and under high-level
administrative oversight;



Reinforced regional legal, budgetary, and financial frameworks, including controls and checks and
balances that replicate those in place for central government (e.g., as regards public procurement,
performance requirements, and strict limits on indebtedness);



Pre-approved regional development plans, established through broad consultation, and aiming to align
the amounts of dedicated public resources with the quality of expected public services;



An ongoing reflection on how to streamline and harmonize tax regimes at the local levels (regions,
municipalities).

Box 4. Unit Labor Costs and External Competitiveness
Low relative unit labor costs (ULCs) are an important source of competitive advantage for Morocco.
Sectors with high relative ULCs, notably the textile and leather sector, have lost global market share,
compared to emerging sectors, such as mechanical and metallurgic manufacturing, chemicals, and
electronics, which have much lower relative ULCs. The gap between ULCs in some emerging sectors relative
to competitors has somewhat narrowed more recently, despite gains in labor productivity (electronics,
chemicals). Low relative ULCs should translate to a depreciation in the ULC-based real effective exchange
rate (REER), a measure of external competitiveness; however, the extent of this depreciation has been limited
by nominal exchange rate movements vis-à-vis competitors.

Sources: Ministère de l’Industrie, du Commerce, de l’Investissement et de l’Economie Numérique; UNIDO; and IMF staff calculations.
Note: Competitors include China, India, Poland, Spain, Thailand, and Turkey.

Morocco’s exports remain sensitive to the real effective exchange rate (REER). Regression analysis
suggests that a 1pp depreciation in the real exchange rate leads to a 0.2-0.4 pp increase in merchandise
exports (see Selected Issues Paper). This elasticity has weakened slightly since the global financial crisis.
Looking ahead, as exports move up global value chains, this elasticity is likely to weaken to some extent;1
Morocco’s exports are currently only moderately integrated in global value chains.
Continued productivity growth and greater exchange rate flexibility will be key in maintaining
external competitiveness. Whereas high relative nominal wages in competitor countries may give Morocco
a competitive advantage at the current juncture, in the long run, productivity growth matching or exceeding
nominal wage growth will be central to maintaining low ULCs. At the same time, greater exchange rate
flexibility would allow REERs to adjust in response to nominal shocks, playing an important role in preserving
competitiveness.

Box 5. Employment Trends in Morocco

Job creation has been weak in the past five years. Morocco
has only created 55,000 jobs per year over the last five years,
which is below the number of market entrants. Job creation is
happening only in the construction and service sectors. Indeed, it
has been negative in agriculture and in low value-added
industries such as textiles, which employ a large share of the
manufacturing workforce (higher value-added sectors only
represent a small share of manufacturing employment). Finally,
while unpaid work has declined to 22.5 percent in 2014 (against
33.9 percent in 2000), jobs are still precarious as only
20.5 percent of workers receive medical coverage and only
12 percent of employed youth had a formal job contract in 2015.

Angel-Urdinola et al., May 2015, “Social Protection and Labor Brief.”
Angel-Urdinola et al., Aug. 2016, “Are Minimum Wages and Payroll Taxes a Constraint to the Creation of Formal Jobs in
Morocco?” shows that Morocco could reduce unemployment rates for youth and women by 5–20 percent and informal workers
by 20–75 percent, through the implementation of a 10–25 percent decrease in minimum wages and 5–15 percent decrease in
payroll taxes.

Table 1. Morocco: Risk Assessment Matrix1
Source of Risk
Structurally weak growth in key
advanced and emerging
economies.
Significant slowdown in other
large EMs/frontier economies.

Rise in populism and
nationalism in large
economies—especially those
with near-term elections—could
slow down or even reverse
policy coordination and
collaboration; international
trade liberalization; financial,
and labor flows; and lead to
unsustainable policies, weighing
on global growth and
exacerbating financial market
volatility.
Heightened risk of
fragmentation/security
dislocation in parts of the
Middle East, Africa, and Europe.
Tighter, more volatile global
financial conditions, including a
sharp rise in risk premia with a
flight to safety.

Reduced financial services by
global/regional banks ("derisking”)

Persistently lower energy prices,
triggered by supply factors
reversing more gradually than
expected.
Slower than expected pace of
reforms.

Expected Impact

Policy Response

High. Weak external demand for Morocco’s
exports, particularly from the euro area, could
weaken growth and the external position.
Low. Whereas direct links to large EMs are limited,
low growth in EMs could spill back to Morocco’s
advanced economy trading partners. Low growth in
frontier markets where Moroccan banks are present
could pose a risk, for instance through elevated
NPLs.
High. An increase in protectionism could impact
FDI in emerging sectors, impacting exports;
reduced activity could lower growth.

Diversify export composition
and markets, implement
structural reforms to boost
competitiveness. Greater
exchange rate flexibility can
help absorb external shocks.

High. Negative sentiment could reduce Morocco’s
tourism receipts, and impair investor confidence,
reducing FDI inflows. Disruptions in oil supply could
increase oil prices, raising oil import costs.
Low. External debt is only about 30 percent of GDP,
with long maturities, and foreign portfolio
investments are moderate. The effect of surges in
the US dollar on the dirham could be countered
with the expected decline in the Euro. Foreign
exchange exposures in the corporate and banking
sectors are limited.
Low. A decline in correspondent banking services
could curtail cross-border payments, trade finance,
FDI, and remittances, especially vis-à-vis domestic
banks. However, most cross-border transactions are
denominated in euro, while de-risking is mainly in
US$.
High. A reduced oil import bill would improve
Morocco’s external position; lower domestic fuel
prices would boost consumption.
Medium. Increase in fiscal vulnerabilities, low
potential growth, and potential drop in domestic
and foreign investor confidence.

Increase policy
responsiveness by further
reducing vulnerabilities and
building fiscal and external
buffers. Greater exchange
rate flexibility can help
absorb external shocks.
Continue to strengthen bank
supervision and resolution
frameworks; build external
and fiscal buffers to increase
policy space.
Preserve gains from lower
oil prices; reduce long term
reliance on energy imports.
Build consensus on reforms
needed to reduce
vulnerabilities and foster
higher and more inclusive
growth (such as improved
governance).

1 The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff).
The relative likelihood is staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium”
a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall
level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly. “Short term” and “medium
term” are meant to indicate that the risk could materialize within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

Annex I. Morocco: Implementation of Past Fund Advice
Policy implementation has been broadly in line with past Fund advice, but there is a need
to speed up the implementation of key structural reforms.
1.
Fiscal policy. The authorities continued fiscal consolidation, met the 2015 fiscal deficit target
(4.5 percent of GDP), and remain committed to reducing public debt to 60 percent of GDP by 2020.
Most of the new organic budget law provisions entered into force in January 2016, and the
authorities plan to gradually implement the remaining provisions (including triennial budget and
programming, making ceiling on wage appropriations binding, limiting the carryover of investment
appropriations) by 2020. The parliament approved in July 2016 the parametric reform of the main
public pension plan, which has started to be implemented. The authorities plan to gradually reduce
certain remaining food subsidies (for wheat and sugar). Tax reforms continued with the removal of
some exemptions and the introduction of corporate tax brackets, and the authorities prefer to
assess the impact of these latest changes before revisiting them.
2.
Monetary policy. Inflation remains low and inflation expectations are well-anchored. BAM
reduced its main policy interest rate to 2.25 percent in March 2016. The authorities have decided to
introduce greater exchange rate flexibility and inflation targeting starting in 2017.
3.
Financial policies. Solid progress has been made in upgrading the financial policy
framework, including implementing Basel III and FSAP recommendations. Most regulations to
implement the new banking law have been introduced, with the exception of the crisis management
and bank resolution frameworks. The authorities plan to submit the new central bank law for
parliament approval in 2017.
Structural reforms. Morocco has made continued progress in the Doing Business ranking
and in improving access to finance, but much remains to be done on the structural front, including
to improve the business environment, competition and governance. Reforms are also needed to
strengthen further the functioning of the job market and the quality of education outcomes and
vocational training.

Annex II. External Sector Assessment
Morocco’s external position is assessed as broadly consistent with fundamentals and
desired policies. It has strengthened markedly since 2012, as narrowing current account
deficits (due mainly to positive terms of trade movements) together with continued fiscal
reform implementation reduced imbalances and strengthened reserves. Looking ahead,
continued policy action to resolve remaining fiscal imbalances, increased exchange rate
flexibility, and structural reform to improve the business climate and boost
competitiveness would further bolster buffers and support the economy’s resilience.
Current account and exchange rate
1.
The trade deficit has improved
markedly due to favorable oil prices and
growth in emerging export sectors. Morocco’s
current account has been characterized by large
trade deficits, a tourism-driven surplus in services,
and strong remittances. The trade deficit in turn is
highly sensitive to external demand, particularly
from the Eurozone (2/3 of export market), and the
price of oil, of which Morocco is one of the largest
net importers. Since 2012, the sharp decline in oil
prices has helped shrink the share of oil imports
from 28 percent in 2012 to 18 percent in 2015. At
the same time, the composition of exports has
shifted toward higher value-added sectors, with
automobile exports overtaking the traditional
export engines, phosphate and textiles, in 2015.
Tourism receipts, at about 6½ percent–7 percent
of GDP, have remained robust despite low euro
area growth, as markets have become more
diversified. In the medium term, further growth in
emerging export sectors, a diversification of
markets, and structural reform implementation
should support a slight narrowing of the trade
deficit and improvement in the current account.

2.
The REER has been on an appreciating trend since mid-2012. The Moroccan dirham,
which is pegged to the euro (60 percent of the basket) and US dollar (40 percent), depreciated since
mid-2009, by nearly 5½ percent by late 2012. More recently, however, the REER has appreciated,
driven primarily by inflation differentials with euro area trading partners. As of November 2016, the
pace of appreciation had picked up at 3.7 percent y-o-y due to the strengthening of the US dollar
and higher domestic food prices due to the year’s drought.

3.
Morocco’s external position is broadly consistent with that implied by fundamentals
and desired policies. Based on the IMF’s External Balance Assessment (EBA) Methodology, the
current account (CA) method suggests a current account gap of -0.9 percent of GDP, down from
1.7 percent in April 2016, which corresponds to an over-valuation of the REER of 3.1 percent. This
gap consists of a policy gap of 0.9 percent of GDP, comprising mainly a fiscal policy gap of

Reserves

Morocco’s reserves are assessed as adequate based on a range of metrics. Reserve
coverage has improved significantly as current account deficits have narrowed, currently amounting
to a comfortable seven months of imports. Looking ahead, reserve coverage should improve to

Composition of Net International Investment Position
(percent of GDP)

6.
Declining current account deficits
have lifted Morocco’s net international
investment position (NIIP). The NIIP position
weakened from -51 percent of GDP in 2011 to
about -64 percent of GDP in 2013 (due mainly
to increased portfolio and other investments);
since then, the NIIP has strengthened to
62½ percent of GDP on the back of the
strengthening reserves position (which has
offset the continued increase in FDI). Looking
ahead, Morocco’s NIIP position should
strengthen over the medium term to about 55 percent of GDP, as trade deficits narrow
notwithstanding FDI growth.

7.
On balance, the dirham is broadly
aligned with fundamentals. The EBA’s external
sustainability approach suggests that the current
account is stronger than the level required to
stabilize the IIP, suggesting an REER
undervaluation of 9.7 (from 11.7 percent in
April 2016). A current account deficit of

baseline, would stabilize the IIP at its 2015 level
of -61.3 percent of GDP (Scenario 1 below). To maintain the IIP at its ten-year average of about 55 percent of GDP (Scenario 2), a CA deficit of 3.8 percent is required; to reach this level in ten years,
the CA deficit would need to strengthen to 3.4 percent of GDP (Scenario 3). Each of these scenarios
implies varying degrees of real undervaluation. However, these estimates remain sensitive to the
choice of base year and IIP targets.

External competitiveness
8.
Morocco’s external competitiveness has improved since 2000 despite a recent
appreciation of the nominal ER. The unit labor cost (ULC)-based REER has been on a depreciating
trend since 2000 due to relatively low unit labor costs, suggesting gains in Morocco’s external
competitiveness, but recent movements in nominal exchange rates relative to competitors have led
the ULC-based REER to appreciate (Selected Issues Paper). Although its unit labor costs are lower
than its main trading partners in the Eurozone and most competitors, structural measures to
increase labor productivity and improve labor market efficiency would help preserve external
competitiveness outside of movements in the nominal exchange rate. Currently, Morocco ranks
70 out of 138 countries in the 2016-2017 World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index,
with low scores in higher education and training, innovation, and labor market efficiency. On the
2017 World Bank Ease of Doing Business Indicators, Morocco now ranks 68th (up from 75th in the
2016 rankings).

Annex III. Raising Morocco’s Growth Potential
Morocco’s growth performance has weakened since 2011. In addition to the adverse
external environment, this reflects declining productivity, human capital and employment
levels compared to emerging market peers. Our analyses show that growth prospects
could improve significantly if key constraints were addressed, especially as regards:
governance and the business environment, human capital, the labor market and in
particular female labor force participation.

2.
Productivity is low relative to other emerging
market peers and will be key to improve potential
growth for Morocco. TFP estimates show that Morocco
has improved, but remains below many of its peers
(Figure 2). A closer look at episodes of growth take-off
in emerging markets shows that those episodes are
generally associated with a strong pick-up in
productivity growth (Dabla-Norris et al., 2013).
3.
The contribution of employment to growth
has declined since 2008, despite an increase in the
working-age share of the population (Figure 3).
Morocco currently lags behind benchmark countries on
labor force and employment growth (Figure 4). This
deterioration reflects lower employment rates than in
the past and further declines in the labor force
participation rate.
Human capital gaps are large relative to
emerging market peers. While average years of
schooling have been rising, Morocco displays a sizeable

Morocco’s growth performance has been
uneven over the last decades (Figure 1).
In the 2000s, the economy grew rapidly at an average
of 5.1 percent, and output was less volatile, thanks to
strong domestic demand, favorable external
conditions and the implementation of adequate
macroeconomic and structural reforms. Since 2011,
Morocco’s economy has slowed (partly reflecting less
favorable external conditions) reverting back to a
lower average growth rate of 3.9 percent. PPPadjusted GDP per capita growth has been lower
relative to the average emerging market countries.

5.
Continued economic diversification also offers opportunities for increased
productivity and faster economic growth. In 2008, the government launched a diversification
strategy, “Plan Emergence,” to widen the production and export bases. Consequently, the economy
benefited from significant structural changes in recent years, as newly developed industries
(automobile, aeronautics, and electronics) have represented an increasing share of exports. The
economy’s resilience to shocks has also improved, with the impact of climatic shocks to the
aggregate output relatively dampened, as is presently the case. Yet, economic diversification in
Morocco is lower than the MENA oil importers average, and Morocco’s economy is less complex
than many emerging market economies. Going forward, policies and strategies to stimulate new
tradable sectors will involve fostering horizontal and vertical diversification, and further integrating
into global value chains.
6.
Our baseline scenario assumes that potential growth would increase by about
1 percentage point in 2021 compared to 2016. It assumes that the authorities’ ongoing structural
reform agenda to improve the business environment and access to finance, and sectoral plans to
diversify and increase the resilience of the economy, will lead to a pick-up in productivity and higher
capital accumulation. This should increase potential output by 1 percentage point over the mediumterm.
7.
Structural reforms could boost potential growth by more than 2 percentage points.
Mitra and others (2016) found that the following key reforms would have the largest impact on

growth in Morocco and would lead to an overall
2.5 percentage gains in potential growth (Figure 5):
(i) a more competitive business environment,
including by streamlining business regulations, tax
codes, and bureaucratic red tape, promoting
competition and discouraging corruption;
(ii) improving workers’ skills; (iii) raising financial
market development; and (iv) greater labor market
flexibility—including improved hiring and firing
practices—and increased female labor force
participation.

the structural reforms mentioned above would allow a much rapid convergence with high-income
countries.1

The convergence half-life is the log of 2 divided by the difference in average per capita income growth between
Morocco and OECD counties over the 2016-21 period. Under the IMF baseline growth scenario, Morocco’s
convergence half-life is around 50 years. Under a scenario with 1 percent higher growth than in the baseline,
Morocco’s half-life to OECD per capita income is reduced to around 33 years.

Annex IV. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
Morocco’s public debt remains sustainable. While the gross debt-to-GDP ratio declined
between 2000 and 2010, external shocks and domestic factors have caused the ratio to
rise again since then. Nevertheless, at about 64.1 percent of GDP at the end of 2015,
public debt remains sustainable, and the DSA shows it to be resilient to various shocks.
Vulnerabilities linked to the level and profile of the debt appear to be moderate for the
most part. Gross financing needs (mainly linked to the rollover of existing debt) have
exceeded the benchmark of 15 percent of GDP in 2014, but are now declining, further
mitigating rollover risks.
1.
This DSA updates the analysis conducted at the request for an arrangement under the
Precautionary and Liquidity Line. The overall analysis is largely unchanged, and public debt
remains sustainable. A slight downward revision to the real output growth projections for 2016–21
has not affected the debt to GDP ratio significantly given that the authorities maintain their deficit
target for 2016-17 unchanged (3.5 percent and 3 percent of GDP respectively), plan to finance a
portion of those deficits through deposits and privatization proceeds (for 2016), and intend to put
the debt to GDP ratio on a downward path over the medium term.
2.
After declining in the previous decade, Morocco’s public debt to GDP ratio started
rising in 2010 following a deterioration in its macroeconomic performance. Rising international
commodity prices contributed to a significant increase in the fiscal deficit, mainly through higher
food and fuel subsidies, and public debt rose from 48 percent of GDP in 2009 to about 64.1 percent
in 2015. About half of this increase occurred in 2012, when the economy was most affected by the
crisis in Europe (Morocco’s main trade partner) and higher oil prices, and the authorities
encountered difficulties in containing the fiscal deficit. The increase in public debt to GDP over the
past three years has been mostly driven by the levels of the primary deficit and higher-thanexpected real interest rate/growth differential. However, the authorities’ ongoing fiscal consolidation
efforts are expected to help bring the debt ratio down to 60 percent of GDP by 2020.
3.
Public debt is generally resilient to shocks, but there are residual risks linked to
financing needs and, to a lesser extent, to shocks to growth and the primary balance (heat
map). Baseline projections are realistic when compared to a group of market access countries.
Morocco’s projected fiscal consolidation efforts, aimed at lowering the overall deficit to about
2.4 percent of GDP in the medium term, do not appear exceptional relative to the distribution of
other country cases. The debt level remains well below the debt burden benchmark of 70 percent of
GDP for emerging markets when various shocks are assumed, except in cases of shocks to real GDP
growth or to the primary balance where it slightly approaches the benchmark. Vulnerabilities linked
to the profile of debt are mostly moderate and short-term debt still represents a very small part of
the total debt (about 5 percent). Relevant indicators exceed the lower early-warning benchmarks but
not the upper risk assessment benchmarks (chart). Gross financing needs, which exceeded the
benchmark of 15 percent in 2014, declined under that benchmark in 2015, and are expected to
continue declining over the medium term due to a lengthening of average maturities through

44

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MOROCCO

improved debt management. Although gross financing needs could increase under the shock
scenario, the nature of the investment base (mostly local investors, many of whom are long-term
investors) mitigates the associated risks. Nonetheless, these risks highlight the importance of
continuing on the path of fiscal consolidation to reduce debt-financed deficits, and of carefully
managing the maturity profile of public debt.
External Debt Sustainability
4.
Risks to external debt sustainability are contained. Morocco’s external debt to GDP is
expected to decline slightly to 32.4 percent of GDP in 2016, and decline to 27.2 percent of GDP in
the medium term due mainly to steady GDP growth, as well as strong FDI inflows reducing the need
for external borrowing. The structure of external debt entails limited vulnerabilities: 75 percent is
owed to official bilateral and multilateral creditors with long maturities, and about 75 percent carries
fixed-rate terms. The external debt position remains resilient to a range of shocks (Figure 6); in the
event of a large depreciation, external debt is projected to increase from 27 to 40 percent of GDP by
2021.

1/ Public sector is defined as central government.
2/ Based on available data. Moody's credit rating is unsolicited.
3/ Bond Spread over U.S. Bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 4 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
8/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Exchange Rate Arrangement and Exchange System
Morocco maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers on current international transactions. However, Morocco maintains certain restrictions
relating to Iraq and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), pursuant to
UN Security Council Resolutions. These are subject to notification to the Fund in accordance with
Decision 144 (52/51). The exchange rate is freely determined in the interbank foreign exchange
market, which was created in 1996. Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM) intervenes in the market to maintain the
exchange rate within its target range, defined around a fixed central rate. Morocco has a
conventional peg arrangement. The current exchange rate of the Moroccan dirham is pegged to a
basket of currencies comprising the euro and the U.S. dollar, with respective weights of 60 percent
and 40 percent. BAM fixes daily rates for the rated currencies on the basis of variations on the value
of the basket. Rates for most currencies quoted in Morocco are established on the basis of the daily
dirham-euro rate and the cross rates for those currencies in relation to the euro in the international
exchange markets. As of December 15, 2016, the SDR/dirham exchange rate was SDR 1=MAD 13.6.
Article IV Consultation
Morocco is on the standard 12-month cycle. The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the
Executive Board on January 27, 2016. The discussions for the 2016 consultation were held in Rabat
and Casablanca during November 16–December 1, 2016.

FSAP update
The latest update of the Financial Sector Assessment was performed in April 2015. The findings were
discussed with the authorities during the October/November 2015 Article IV mission and discussed
by the Board on December 14, 2015.
Safeguard assessment
An update of the 2013 safeguards assessment of the BAM, completed in January 2015, found that
the safeguards framework at the BAM remains relatively strong. The Board continues to be engaged
and governance arrangements are supported by strong internal audit and risk management
functions. A new law on BAM statutes that would lead to sustained good governance practices and
autonomy is expected to be approved in 2017. Regarding staff’s recommendation to implement
IFRS, the BAM carried out a feasibility study with the assistance of an audit firm and decided to
maintain the current accounting standards. Instead financial statement disclosures were improved to
enhance transparency.

Morocco—Table of Common Indicators Required for Surveillance
(As of December 15, 2016

Statement by Mohammed Daïri, Alternate Executive Director for Morocco
January 23, 2017
My Moroccan authorities wish to express their gratitude to staff for fruitful discussions
during these consultations and a balanced report as well as for the interesting Selected
Issues paper. They broadly share staff analysis and conclusions.
Morocco continues to adjust to the generally weak and uncertain external environment by
further strengthening its macroeconomic fundamentals and resilience and rebuilding
buffers, while continuing to lay the foundations for stronger and more inclusive growth.
In 2016, growth is estimated to have slowed to 1½–2 percent, from 4½ percent in 2015,
mainly due to a poor cereal crop after the all-time record achieved the previous year,
leading to a decline of agriculture output by about 10 percent, while non-agriculture
growth remained positive at
3–3½ percent. Inflation remained well under control, at about 1½ percent.
Unemployment declined slightly but remained high, in particular for the young and
women. Early signs of a recovery in late 2016 bode well for non-agricultural GDP
growth in 2017, which is expected, along with a projected recovery in agriculture, based
on improved weather conditions from last year, to lead to total GDP growth of 4½–
5 percent this year.
The impact of the decline in cereals production in 2016 on overall GDP growth was
much more muted than in the past, when such large though rare declines brought overall
GDP growth well into negative territory. This reduction in GDP growth volatility attests
to the success of agriculture diversification and productivity-enhancing reforms. It also
reflects the dynamism of new, high value-added and export-oriented sectors in response
to well-structured industrial policies and improved business climate.
The current account deficit edged up slightly to about 3 percent of GDP. Exports of
automobiles, electronics, and aeronautics continued to be strong. However, lower prices
affected exports of phosphates and derivatives. Moreover, imports of machinery, food
and other consumer goods increased markedly, more than offsetting lower fuel import
prices. As a result of continuing strong FDI inflows and higher other private capital
inflows, the external reserve position strengthened further to reach close to 7 months of
imports, or about 130 percent of the Fund adjusted-ARA metric (100 percent of the
standard metric).
Implementation of the medium-term fiscal consolidation plan has helped significantly
reduce the deficit and stabilize public debt. The fiscal deficit target of 3½ percent of GDP
in 2016, down from 7.3 percent in 2012, is within reach, with lower grants expected to be
offset mainly through stronger tax revenue and savings on current spending, including

2

wages. In the context of a larger than projected slowdown in growth and in the run up to
last October elections, this is no small achievement that attests to the authorities’ strong
commitment to sound fiscal policy.
In view of the relatively moderate growth along with low and stable inflation and
comfortable reserves, the current policy mix of further fiscal consolidation along with
monetary policy accommodation is appropriate. The draft 2017 Budget presented to
parliament in early October aims at further reducing the deficit to 3 percent of GDP as
planned, including through continued implementation of the recommendations of the
2013 national tax conference and tight control of current spending. Discussion of this
draft budget has not started since negotiations for a new government have not yet been
completed. It is very unlikely that the final Budget would deviate from the current
consolidation path, in view of the authorities’ well-established track record of fiscal
prudence, and since preserving fiscal balances has been enshrined in the new constitution
as a joint responsibility of the government and parliament.
Public debt is sustainable and resilient to shocks, with favorable maturity, interest rate
and currency structure. It has stabilized as a ratio to GDP at 64 percent since 2015 and
should start declining this year to achieve the authorities’ objective of 60 percent by
2020. Active debt management operations within strengthened debt management strategy
have contributed to improving the structure of the debt and reducing costs and risks.
Significant progress has been made in implementation of the ambitious structural fiscal
reform agenda aimed at further strengthening institutions and the policy framework.
Implementation of the 2015 Organic Budget Law (OBL) is proceeding according to
schedule. The new OBL and the landmark reform subsidy, along with the entry into
effect of the bold parametric pension reform, which has reduced the actuarial deficit of
the public pension fund by close to 60 percent, have significantly reduced budget
vulnerabilities and risks. While agreement on the pension reform took longer than
expected, its enactment and start of implementation immediately before the general
elections attest to the government strong commitment to the reform. Implementation of
the tax reform is advancing, with the objective of simplifying the system and enhancing
its equity, while making it more business-friendly. Progress is being made on fiscal
decentralization under the ambitious Advanced Regionalization program, with gradual
roll-over of financial and human resources to allow territorial entities to support growth
at the local level and enhance efficiency within sound budget management practices.
With inflation well under control, continued moderate credit growth, along with
comfortable reserves and prudent fiscal policy, monetary policy will continue to aim at
supporting the recovery by promoting adequate financing of the economy, including
SMEs, while maintaining its core focus on keeping inflation low. BAM reduced the
policy rate by 25 bp in March 2016, the third such reduction since September 2014. The

3

current accommodative monetary policy has led to a significant decline in lending rates
by a total of 99 bp over the last 2 years, reflecting effective monetary transmission, which
has helped reinvigorate credit.
The financial system is well-capitalized, with adequate liquidity and profitability. While
NPLs have increased somewhat, they are confined mainly in a few sectors, including
those affected by the global economic slowdown, and are well provisioned. The
authorities continue to closely monitor credit concentration risks, which have declined
recently and where limits set by the regulator are tighter that the standard practice and
effectively enforced. They have strengthened supervisory resources, including for
oversight of Moroccan banks’ subsidiaries in Africa, and have maintained close
cooperation with host countries to identify and mitigate potential risks. They continue to
strengthen financial sector regulation and their pro-active and risk-based supervision,
including in implementing FSAP recommendations.
Preparation for gradually moving to a flexible exchange rate regime has been virtually
completed, with extensive technical support from MCM and RES departments, for which
the authorities are grateful. A roadmap of the reform has been prepared and discussed
with staff. The authorities have requested Fund TA to help assess preparedness of the
banking sector to manage currency risks and to adapt public debt management to the new
exchange rate regime. They are finalizing their communication strategy, and are
confident that they will be in a position to announce the policy change and start
implementation in the second half of this year. Later in the transition, when the
fluctuation band will be large enough, BAM will abandon the nominal exchange rate as
an anchor and shift to an inflation targeting regime.
To improve the business climate, raise productivity and growth potential, and accelerate
job creation, the authorities continue to strengthen the financial sector, including by
further deepening markets, easing access to credit, and enhancing financial inclusion.
They are also strengthening support to SMEs to enhance their contribution to growth and
reduce informality. Important efforts are also being made in streamlining regulations and
upgrading infrastructure, with positive effects on productivity and access to services. As a
result of these reforms, Morocco gained 7 notches in the Doing Business ranking to 68
between 2016 and 2017, with significant advances in registering property, getting credit,
protecting minority investors, and trading across borders. Implementation of the recentlyadopted National Strategy for Employment and the Strategic Vision for Education will
help boost productivity and alleviate constraints to employment, including by improving
education and vocational training and enhancing effectiveness of labor market policies.
The large renewable energy program, in particular in solar energy, is advancing as
planned, and should help meet the authorities’ ambitious climate mitigation undertakings
while reducing Morocco’s dependency on fuel imports.

4

The authorities are confident that their current policy and reforms will be continued and
consolidated going forward. The reappointment of the current Head of Government to
form a new coalition government provides further assurance in this regard in view of his
strong commitment to sound policy implementation. The authorities look forward to
continued close cooperation with the Fund.
