Previous Article IV consultation: The 2007 Article IV consultation was concluded
by the Executive Board on July 30. Directors agreed that the main challenge for
Maldives will be to ensure that broadly favorable growth prospects are supported by
a prudent fiscal policy and a viable macroeconomic framework. Many Directors
disagreed with the staff assessment that the Maldives’ exchange rate was
fundamentally misaligned, although they concurred with the view that fiscal
slippages in 2007 and beyond could eventually undermine competitiveness and the
dollar peg.

•

Exchange rate system: Maldives’ exchange rate regime comprises a conventional
fixed peg against the U.S. dollar. Maldives continues to avail itself of the transitional
arrangements under Article XIV of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, but no longer
maintains Article XIV restrictions. Maldives is yet to accept the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, but maintains no restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Maldives continues to grow robustly, underpinned by a tourism sector that has
rebounded strongly from the Asian tsunami. Rapid bed-night growth, together with
construction activity, has kept growth high in the face of a fall in the fish catch. Inflation has
picked up markedly due to soaring food and oil prices. The exchange rate peg to the dollar is
appropriate and will continue to serve the country well provided it is supported by prudent
fiscal policies.
The main challenge for the Maldives is to ensure that favorable growth prospects are
not undermined by fiscal excesses and consequent macroeconomic instability. In recent
years, government expenditure, especially domestically financed current expenditure, has
increased to remarkably high levels. Although some increase in expenditure was fully
justified in response to the tsunami, most of the additional spending is unrelated to relief or
reconstruction measures. The authorities’ laudable commitment to zero domestic financing is
therefore premised on a series of ad hoc nontax revenue measures, which carry high
implementation risks and would be difficult to sustain over the medium term.
Key issues discussed during the consultation were:
•

The 2008 budget. A substantial planned increase in domestically financed
expenditures was initially to be offset by a large receipt from a transshipment port.
However, that receipt has been delayed until 2009, and the authorities intend to fill
the shortfall by leasing an additional 30 island resorts. Staff urged the government to
identify contingent expenditure cuts in case these ad hoc revenue measures fail to
materialize fully. The alternative—monetizing the deficit—would stoke already high
imported inflation and increase external vulnerabilities.

•

Fiscal reforms. Going forward, a medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF) should be
developed to prioritize spending within a realistic resource envelope. Current
expenditures will need to be substantially scaled back in order to accommodate
necessary infrastructure investments. Revenue reforms are also needed, including the
introduction of corporate taxation, a broad-based sales tax, and replacing the current
“per head” tourism tax with an ad valorem tax.

•

Competitiveness and external vulnerabilities. Notwithstanding the recent increase
in inflation, the economy remains competitive, largely due to the depreciation of the
dollar against the euro together with the predominance of European tourists to the
country. There has been an increase in external debt ratios due to the financing of new
resorts, and with planned further expansion, these ratios are expected to climb sharply
before peaking in 2010. Most of the rise in debt levels is attributable to private sector
borrowing, channeled through the commercial banks. The elevated level of private
sector debt should be closely monitored, while bank supervision should remain
vigilant.

4
I. POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC BACKGROUND
1.
President Gayoom’s sixth term in office ends on November 11, 2008, with multiparty elections expected in October. After considerable delays, a special Majlis (parliament)
passed a new constitution. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for February 2009. Soon
after the Article IV mission, the Finance Minister resigned, and is expected to become a
presidential candidate. He has been replaced by the Governor of the central bank.
2.
The Maldives has achieved solid growth over the past decade, but continues to
face serious challenges due to its dependence on tourism and fishing, its vulnerability to
environmental shocks, and its dispersed population.
•

Per capita income has doubled, and real
per capita GDP has risen substantially.
This has been accompanied by a marked
improvement in social indicators. An
exchange rate regime comprising a peg
to the dollar has anchored
macroeconomic stability.

The Maldives consists of some 1,200 low-lying coral islands, 200 of which are inhabited, spread over an area
of the Indian ocean of 900,000 square kilometers. The average height is 1.5 meters above sea level. Its
population is about 300,000.

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Real GDP growth was a robust 7.6 percent in 2007, down from the 18 percent
growth rate of 2006 associated with a rebound from the tsunami. The tourism and
construction sectors continued to lead growth, offsetting an unusually low fish catch.
•

Tourist arrivals increased by 12 percent in 2007, contributing to an increase in
tourist revenues of about 14 percent. Currently there are 91 island resorts in
operation, a number that the authorities

The fish catch fell by about 38 percent compared to the previous year. Fisheries
employ about 11 percent of the workforce and account for the bulk of nontourism
exports. The causes for the fall in the catch are poorly understood, but could include
changing ocean currents and warmer surface temperatures. Net of the fishing sector,
GDP grew by 9.6 percent, well above the pre-tsunami average.

4.
Inflation increased markedly to
14.7 percent (year-on-year) in April,
driven by rising food prices. After several
years of relatively subdued inflation, the
increase in global food prices and the fall in
the domestic fish catch contributed to a
sharp rise in prices. Fish prices alone surged
by 47.5 percent. The rise in international oil
prices also played a significant role in this
cost-push inflation, although oil comprises
a smaller share of the CPI basket than food.

5.
The fiscal balance for 2007 was better than staff projections, but in line with the
budget. The government cut planned expenditures in line with a shortfall in revenues, thus
eliminating the need for domestic financing of the budget, in contrast with a staff baseline
projection of domestic financing of

financed or “regular” budget plus the
foreign financed budget, which channels mostly concessional foreign financing into tsunamirelated and infrastructure projects), the actual level was about 8 percent of GDP, much lower
than the planned deficit of about 28 percent of GDP, due in addition to a shortfall in foreign
financing and a corresponding reduction in capital expenditures tied to that financing.
6.
However, government expenditure rose to an extremely high 65.8 percent of
GDP. About three-quarters of this comprised current expenditure, notably payments to the
civil service of about 16.5 percent of GDP and social welfare contributions of about
18 percent. Government expenditure in the Maldives was comparable with that of broadly
similar island economies before the tsunami in 2004, but has since reached new highs.
Moreover, the rise has not been primarily driven by tsunami-related spending (about
95 percent of the increase in domestically financed expenditure since 2004 is unrelated to the
tsunami).

The current account deficit widened to over 40 percent of GDP in 2007 from
33 percent the previous year, driven by a surge in construction-related imports and
rising commodity prices. With tourism booming, exports grew by a robust 10 percent in
2007, despite declining fish exports. However, imports rose by 18 percent, primarily owing
to demand for construction materials for resorts and infrastructure projects, but also due to
high oil and food prices. These developments caused the current account deficit to widen
from 33 percent of GDP in 2006 to over 40 percent in 2007. The deficit was financed mainly
through a large increase in private capital inflows, including foreign borrowing by
commercial banks. In addition, there was an increase in official financing from bilateral and
multilateral sources. External debt increased sharply, from 49.1 percent of GDP in 2006 to
69.6 percent of GDP in 2007. Most of this increment was attributable to private sector
activity, with government external debt registering a relatively small increase from 32.4
percent of GDP in 2006 to about 39 percent in 2007.

Corresponding to the above, the banking sector—comprising one local and five
international banks—has presided over a recent boom in private sector credit, with a
40 percent increase in 2007. The robust trend dates from 2004, when the government
commenced an ambitious program for leasing new islands. Much of the expansion has been

8
financed by foreign-owned banks borrowing from their head office and on-lending locally,
with risks contained through the country risk exposure limits of the banks, and through
collateralizing the property in the case of loans for resort development. On-site bank
examinations are being conducted with MCM technical assistance (TA). NPLs as a share of
total loans decreased to 1.7 percent in March 2008 from 6.6 percent in December 2005,
mainly due to the recovery of the tourism sector and improved banking supervision.
III. KEY POLICY DISCUSSIONS
With the real economy booming and an election year in progress, staff’s main macro
message was the importance of maintaining fiscal responsibility. Discussions focused on the
following areas:
•

The 2008 budget.
The medium-term fiscal outlook including revenue and expenditure reforms.
Competitiveness and External Vulnerabilities.

macroeconomic consequences if its ambitious revenue plans—including some ad hoc
measures—do not materialize fully.

loans—by over 38 percent compared
to the 2007 outturn. About two-thirds of the increase is on current expenditure,
including an over 55 percent increase in the civil service wage bill (provided as of
January 2008) and quadrupled subsidies, mostly on account of administered

9
electricity prices,2 which more than offset the first phase down of tsunami-related
social welfare expenditures.
•

Staff emphasized the need to resist mid-year pressures to increase expenditure
beyond the budgeted amount. The wage increase in January was implemented in an
ad hoc manner, with an uneven distribution among different segments of the civil
service, resulting in additional wage demands from some dissatisfied employees. The
authorities should contain the wage bill and manage expectations in order to avoid an
inflationary wage spiral. Staff also urged an immediate revision of electricity tariffs,
in light of the fact that rising oil prices are progressively increasing the subsidy
needed to maintain administered electricity prices at their current level.

•

Although the budget is balanced in terms of domestic financing, the mission again
stressed the risk of a significant revenue shortfall risk. The budget initially included a
34 percent increase in domestic

30 additional islands. Staff noted
that the substitute measures still contain significant implementation risks.

•

The mission underlined the need for identifying contingency expenditure cuts in the
event of a revenue shortfall. Responding to revenue shortfalls through domestic
financing of the deficit would risk exacerbating already high inflation, further
expanding the current account deficit, and increasing external vulnerabilities.

10.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to achieving domestic budgetary
balance for 2008. They noted that they were well aware of the dangers that monetizing the
deficit would cause in the current environment, and were resolved to avoid such an outcome.
2

In the Maldives, fuel price increases have been largely passed through. In particular, changes in the price of
diesel—which accounts for the bulk of fuel consumption—are in line with international prices. Electricity,
however, is produced by a state-owned electricity company, with administered prices unchanged since 2002.
The majority of government subsidies go to this company, whose losses have increased in proportion with the
cost of diesel. The budget also includes subsidies to maintain administered staple food prices (rice, flour, and
sugar) and subsidies to fisheries for higher fuel costs.

10
At the same time, they pointed to spending pressures arising from the presidential election
expected to take place in November, as well as from high international oil and food prices.
On the other hand, there is usually some underspending of budgeted amounts—especially on
capital projects—due to capacity constraints. While the authorities’ primary focus remains on
ensuring that the budgeted revenues materialize, they agreed to identify contingency
expenditure cuts. In addition, they agreed that the current electricity tariff is not sustainable
and requires early adjustment, but could not say when such a step might take place.
B. Medium-Term Fiscal Framework
11.
Staff argued that expenditure reforms are critical for achieving medium-term
fiscal stability and creating room for needed capital expenditures.

drop by nearly 9 percentage
points of GDP by 2013. This is because the contribution of lease payments falls over
time, 3 windfall payments from the transshipment project—if they materialize—fall
only in 2009 and 2010, and import duty collection weakens in line with declining
import needs for resort and infrastructure construction materials. Leasing out
additional islands at a pace far exceeding the ambitious but sustainable pace
envisaged in Maldives’ tourism development master plan is likely to face heightened
implementation risks by overburdening infrastructure and the financial sector.

•

Consequently, staff recommended that domestic expenditure be curtailed
substantially over the medium term. This is especially relevant because the large
projected increase in private investment in new resorts could face capacity constraints

3

Lease payments for a new island typically have the following schedule. A successful bidder makes an up-front
payment of 15 percent of the cumulative lease amount for the first 10 years (equivalent to 18 months of rent).
After an 18 month-grace period, annual lease payments as per the predetermined schedule start, providing
medium-term revenues to the government.

and be crowded out if government expenditure is not successfully contained. Staff’s
framework incorporates about a 13 percent of GDP adjustment in current
expenditures by 2013, excluding an 8 percent of GDP decline related to the
completion of tsunami reconstruction. This could be achieved by (i) civil service
reforms, including a nominal wage freeze and moderate downsizing based on natural
attrition; (ii) the rationalization of social expenditures through progress on population
consolidation in the islands; and (iii) cutting back on subsidies by adjusting domestic
administered prices including electricity tariff. These measures will help create space
for infrastructure investment to support the expanding tourism sector and enable
small domestic surpluses that underpin declining public debt ratios.
12.
The authorities emphasized the need to respond to rising demand for basic social
services, but also pointed to recent governance reforms that should help in rationalizing
expenditures. While providing social services is very costly given the Maldives’ unique
geography, rising income levels have raised peoples’ expectations of government services.
Moreover, the planned expansion of the tourism sector will require corresponding
improvement of infrastructure, particularly transport links. The authorities noted that
progress in population consolidation—by reducing the need to service thinly populated
remote islands—would improve efficiency in the civil service. Thus, the nearing completion
of a major consolidation project would yield considerable benefits and serve as a model for
future progress. The government also pointed out that newly established independent
agencies would enhance rules-based governance over the medium term, and would thus help
contain expenditures. In this context, staff welcomed the recent formation of the civil service
commission and its initial efforts at reform, including the downsizing of the civil service by
1,800 staff (about 5½ percent of total civil servants) by implementing mandatory retirement.
13.
Staff also observed that revenue reforms should be expedited. Previous Article IV
consultations have pointed out that the Maldives’ tax structure is outdated, making it
inflexible at adjusting to exogenous shocks. There is no personal or corporate income tax
(except for a profit tax on the banking sector), sales tax, or VAT, and the main sources of
revenues are import duties, resort and land lease payments, dividend transfers from stateowned enterprises (SOEs), and a tourist tax. The limited tax base is one reason the
government has been recently resorting to lease income to finance rapidly expanding
expenditures. The mission reiterated the benefits of the following key reforms, in line with
FAD TA recommendations.
•

4

Business profit tax (BPT). The mission urged the authorities to introduce the BPT as
soon as possible.4 Over the medium term, to broaden the tax base and increase the
revenue potential and fairness of direct taxation, a separate personal income tax

After a number of years of preparatory work in consultation with FAD experts, a business profit tax was
supposed to be introduced in 2008, bringing in revenues of about 2–3 percent of GDP.

12
should be introduced and the BPT should evolved into a more general corporate
income tax.
•

Ad valorem tourism tax. The specific tourism tax, which is levied on a uniform basis
on every tourist, is inefficient and the existing fixed rate of $8 per bed per night is too
low, especially for high-end tourists. The mission recommends that the tax should be
increased, in particular by replacing the specific tax with an ad valorem tax.

•

VAT. The mission encouraged the authorities to announce a clear timetable for their
plan to substitute a VAT for a large portion of import duties. Introduction of the VAT
could quickly follow the successful implementation of the BPT.

14.
The authorities reaffirmed their intention to broaden the tax base, but noted
that a careful and equitable approach was needed. They were optimistic about the
prospect of adopting the BPT in 2009, after parliamentarian elections. However, they had
some reservations about increasing the tax burden on the tourism sector by adopting an ad
valorem tourism tax. Rather, they considered that a broad-based consumption tax, such as a
goods and services tax (GST), would be more equitable across sectors. At present, however,
there is no timetable for the introduction of a GST.
15.
Staff projects that the public debt ratio will decline substantially over the
medium term, in line with the authorities’ commitment to maintaining zero domestic
financing. Balanced domestic budgets (or small domestic surpluses), declining official
disbursements for tsunami-related projects, and increasing repayment of foreign public
debt—as per the existing amortization schedule—underscore a sharp turnaround of the
primary balance into positive territory over the medium term. As a result, both domestic and
foreign public debt ratios decline appreciably, falling well below the pre-tsunami level by the
end of the projection period. The key to reducing public debt is achieving the government's
ambitious domestic budget balance target. If the primary balance remains at its 10-year
average level,5 the debt ratio would continue to rise (Appendix I). However, the 10-year
average includes a particularly expansionary phase following the tsunami. Based on the pretsunami average, the debt ratio remains constant.
16.
More generally, the authorities agreed with staff on the need for realistic
budgets grounded in a Medium-Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF) so that they can serve
as a useful policy tool. In recent years it has become customary for the announced budget to
incorporate unrealistic projections of domestic revenue, and correspondingly unsustainable
expenditure plans. While the authorities have performed well in 2006 and 2007 in keeping

13
expenditures in line with available financing, it would be better to frame a realistic budget to
begin with, thereby underpinning the credibility of the macro framework.
C. Competitiveness and External Vulnerabilities
17.
The authorities agreed with staff that high inflation in 2008 was a concern
because of its potential impact on competitiveness. The forecast year-on-year inflation rate
of 15 percent is driven mainly by food and oil price increases, and is likely to increase costs
in the tourist industry correspondingly.
18.
Nonetheless, the Maldives appears to have enough of a cushion to maintain
competitiveness, provided that fiscal discipline is maintained. Most of Maldives’ exports
are to euro-denominated areas—with 80
150

percent of tourist arrivals coming from the
130
EU—while the bulk of imports are dollardenominated. Thus, the depreciation of
110
the dollar against the euro in recent years
has helped the country’s competitive
90
position. Since the beginning of 2000, the

REER has depreciated by 27 percent,

end-2006. The REER has declined more
than that of comparator tourism-based
small economies. Hence the country is in a good position to weather some appreciation of the
real exchange rate, provided that imported inflation is not exacerbated by fiscal slippages
requiring domestic financing. Based on these considerations—although data limitations
preclude the application of comprehensive CGER methodologies—staff view the exchange
rate as broadly in equilibrium.6
19.
The authorities agreed that competitiveness was currently adequate. Small island
economies of the type that directly compete with the Maldives for tourism revenues are
equally likely to be hit hard by imported inflation, so that in relative terms, Maldives’
competitiveness may not erode as much as implied by the calculated REER. In addition, most
tourism to the Maldives is at the high end of the market, which may be relatively price
inelastic. The Maldives also performs well on survey-based measures of competitiveness.
The country was ranked first in the World Bank’s “Doing Business in South Asia” (2007)
and in the top third of countries globally.

6

Rough calculations using the External Sustainability approach indicate that, once temporary factors
influencing the current account have been accounted for, the REER is within 5 percentage points of its NFAstabilizing value, and hence the misalignment should be regarded as about zero.

14
20.
External debt is projected to rise sharply in the next few years before starting to
decline. The current account should move toward balance in the medium term, with the
present extraordinary rate of growth of imports slowing considerably due to (i) the
stabilization of commodity prices in 2009; (ii) a cessation of tsunami-related reconstruction
from 2010; and (iii) a gradual winding down of resort construction activity from 2011
onwards. Staff projects that the external debt-to-GDP ratio will climb to almost 95 percent in
2010, before declining gradually to about 83 percent by 2013. This debt accumulation does
not reflect more government borrowing; public external debt is set to fall considerably in the
medium term as tsunami-related disbursements wind down and amortization on concessional
loans comes due. Rather, the debt accumulation would be caused by private inflows into
resorts and infrastructure projects, which is assumed to be concentrated in the 2008–10
period. As shown in the debt sustainability analysis (Appendix I), the projected debt path is
sensitive to current account and/or exchange rate shocks.
21.
The mission urged the authorities to closely monitor the elevated level of
external debt. To some extent, risks are mitigated through the country risk exposure limits
of the banks, and through collateralizing the resort properties. Nonetheless, bank inflows
could be sensitive to global economic and financial conditions, and hence bank supervision
should continue to be vigilant, and the monitoring of private sector debt should be improved.
Moreover, in staff’s projections, the rise in private external debt is balanced to some extent
by a fall in the external public sector debt-to-GDP ratio. These declines are, however,
contingent on sustainable fiscal policies that result in small domestic surpluses over the
medium term, underpinning the importance of fiscal reforms.
22.
Staff reaffirmed the view that the dollar peg is an appropriate exchange rate
regime. The current arrangement has served Maldives well by reducing transaction costs and
foreign exchange risks and providing an effective nominal anchor. The regime is also
consistent with the limited institutional capacity to manage a foreign exchange market. The
authorities concurred with staff that that it will remain important to support the peg with
prudent fiscal polices, especially in view of the vulnerabilities present in the 2008 budget.
D. Other Issues
23.
Staff welcomed the appointment of a new central bank governor, following the
passage of amendments to the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) Act enshrining the
separation of the positions of finance minister and governor. In another important move,
an inter-agency agreement between the Ministry of Finance and the MMA empowered the
MMA to set interest rates, and put a ceiling on the amount that the government can borrow
through its Ways and Means Account. These developments, together with the introduction of
treasury bill sales in 2006, should help move the MMA away from its traditional role of
passively financing any outstanding fiscal deficit. The authorities noted, and staff concurred,
that going forward it will be important to entrench the MMA’s independence, through

15
upholding the principle of not financing budget deficits, and through moving ahead with the
second phase of amendments to the MMA Act.
24.
Staff also welcomed the implementation of some key legal reforms. Following the
passage of the Civil Service Bill and the Audit Act, an independent Civil Service
Commission and Auditor General have been appointed and begun work. The Civil Service
Commission should play a vital role in rationalizing the structure of the civil service, and
eliminating the current ad hoc nature of compensation increases, while the Auditor General
will perform an important monitoring role. The authorities noted that other crucial legislative
reforms––including the Banking Act and AML/CFT legislation––are being expedited, and
are scheduled for passage by the current parliament. Moreover, the Maldives has recently
indicated its strong commitment to implement the global AML/CFT standard established by
the Financial Action Task Force by joining the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering
25.
Staff urged the authorities to consider accepting the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4. The Maldives does not maintain any restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions. The authorities responded that
MMA staff has prepared a note on the issue, which will be presented to its board
expeditiously.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
The economy continues to rebound from the impact of the Asian tsunami,
registering strong growth led by tourism. Bed-night growth continues to be robust, with a
corresponding boom in construction. Post-tsunami reconstruction activities continue along
with numerous infrastructure and developmental projects. On the other hand, there have been
recent sharp declines in the fish catch, which acted as a drag on growth in 2007.
27.
Inflation has risen steeply to 14.7 percent (year-on-year) in April. The main driver
of this acceleration is food prices, which increased by 26 percent over the year to April, with
oil prices also playing a significant role. In the face of these exogenous shocks, it is
imperative to maintain a prudent macro-economic stance, so as to limit the second-round
effects on core inflation.
28.
The fiscal stance continues to pose risks to macroeconomic stability. The fiscal
outturn for 2007 was better than expected, with expenditures being kept in line with a
revenue shortfall, thereby avoiding the need for domestic financing. However, expenditure as
a share of GDP reached unsustainably high levels. The 2008 budget continues to show
excessive expenditures. Of particular concern is the rapid increase in recurrent, domestically
financed expenditures, with most of the spending unrelated to the tsunami. Furthermore, it is
likely that some ad hoc nontax revenue measures may not materialize, which would endanger
the government’s commitment to avoid domestic financing. Thus it is important to identify
contingent expenditure cuts and make adjustments to the electricity tariff.

16
29.
Over the medium term, both revenue and expenditure measures will be needed
to maintain fiscal stability, reduce public debt, and create space for necessary
infrastructure spending. On the revenue side, the business profit tax should be expedited,
while an ad valorem tourism tax and a broad-based consumption tax (GST) would further
help in broadening the tax base and limiting reliance on import duties and resort leases. On
the expenditure side, current expenditure should be reduced through a combination of
measures including civil service reform, a nominal wage freeze, progress on population
consolidation, and cutting back on subsidies. Achieving the government's zero domestic
balance target is crucial to reducing debt over the medium term. More generally, greater
realism is needed in budgetary formulation, with budgets grounded firmly in the context of a
MTFF.
30.
External vulnerabilities have increased, although international reserves have so
far been supported by grants and loans from both bilateral and multilateral sources,
and by increased borrowing by commercial banks. Exports in 2007 grew rapidly,
supported by robust growth in tourism revenues, but imports grew at an even more rapid pace
due to construction activities and rising food and oil prices, leading to a widening of the
current account deficit. External debt, particularly private debt, has risen in line with
booming private sector activity, particularly construction. The external debt-to-GDP ratio is
projected to reach almost 95 percent in 2010 before falling with the completion of several
resorts and infrastructure projects. Much of this debt has been and will continue to be
channeled through the commercial banks. Thus bank supervision must remain vigilant, while
the monitoring of private debt should be improved.
31.
The dollar peg remains an appropriate exchange rate regime, and the Maldives
has retained its international competitiveness. The peg continues to serve the Maldives
well by reducing transactions costs and foreign exchange risks and providing an effective
nominal anchor. Since the bulk of tourists to the Maldives are from Europe, the depreciation
of the dollar against the euro in recent years has provided the economy with a cushion against
an erosion in competitiveness due to the rise in inflation.
32.
It is recommended that the next consultation with Maldives take place within the
standard 12-month cycle.

APPENDIX I. MALDIVES: PUBLIC AND EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Debt sustainability analysis (DSA) indicates a considerable rise in the external debt-toGDP ratio over the next few years—driven primarily by private sector activity—while
public sector debt ratios are forecast to decline from next year onwards. The baseline
scenario is premised on GDP growth of about 6 percent per annum over the medium term,
consistent with a cautiously optimistic forecast for expansion in the tourism and fisheries
sectors.7 The fiscal assumptions incorporate a substantial scaling down of current expenditure
over the medium term, in conjunction with revenue reforms described in the main text of the
staff report.
A. Public Debt Sustainability
The Maldives’ public sector debt has increased rapidly owing to fiscal expansion
following the tsunami. The primary deficit has jumped from an average of 2¼ percent of
GDP during 2000–04 period to an average of 6⅔ percent of GDP during the 2005–07 period.
Both domestic and foreign resources have been mobilized to finance the deficit, pushing up
the overall debt ratio by over 13 percentage points of GDP between 2004 and 2007.
In the baseline DSA, the public debt ratio declines steadily over the medium term,
reflecting the fiscal prudence embedded in the staff projection. The projection builds on
zero or small positive domestic balances, by restraining expenditures within a realistic
resource envelope (which builds in various revenue reforms). The zero or negative usage of
domestic financing and the start of the net repayment of the government external debt as per
the amortization schedule implies a sharp turnaround of the primary balance into positive
territory starting in 2010. As a result, both domestic and foreign public debt ratios decline
appreciably, achieving a level well below the pre-tsunami average over the medium term.
The major risks to the baseline are on the fiscal stance, indicating the significance of
fiscal prudence for achieving macroeconomic stability. The historical scenario would
imply an increasing trajectory for public debt, rather than the forecast decline. The major
driver of this result is the historically high primary deficits, with a 10-year average of
3.4 percent of GDP. If the primary balance remains fixed at the elevated level of 7.4 percent
of GDP (as budgeted in 2008), the debt ratio would continue to expand to and reach
75 percent of GDP by 2013. Sensitivity tests also show that the public debt path is
susceptible to shocks to real GDP growth, with a one-fourth standard deviation shock to
growth leading to a public debt ratio of 55 percent in 2013 (instead of the baseline forecast of
7

The forecast assumes that roughly half of the resorts planned by the authorities will be constructed by 2013,
which still comprises an ambitious schedule. In line with government plans, construction activity is expected to
be particularly concentrated in the period 2008–10, after which it diminishes as some resorts are completed
along with the transshipment port and various infrastructure projects.

26
30). However, the impact of a GDP shock may be overstated by the standardized sensitivity
test, because in the Maldives’ case the tsunami and the sharp recovery thereof accentuate the
volatility of GDP growth. Excluding the year of the tsunami and the following year, the
growth rate shock scenario generates a falling path for public debt, which reaches about
40 percent of GDP by 2013.
B. External Debt Sustainability
The external debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to climb sharply until 2010, before attaining
a downward trajectory later in the projection period. Over the next three years, several
new resorts will begin construction, while work continues on island resorts leased previously.
The financing for these resorts is mainly expected to be channeled through commercial banks
borrowing from their head offices and on-lending domestically, as in the past. In addition,
work will commence on a transshipment port, while various other infrastructure projects
continue. The external debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to climb to about 95 percent in 2010,
after which it will diminish as several projects are completed. Notably, this path is driven by
private sector activity and borrowing. Government external debt, in contrast is forecast to
decline from next year onwards—falling gradually from 39 percent of GDP in 2008 to about
23 percent by 2013—as amortization on existing loans comes due and loans for tsunami
reconstruction activities winds down. Debt service follows a similar profile, rising as a
percentage of domestic exports from 12 percent in 2008 to 14½ percent in 2010, before
declining to about 13 percent by 2013.
The stress tests illustrate that the debt path is particularly vulnerable to shocks to the
current account and the exchange rate. A real depreciation of 30 percent would cause the
ratio to rise sharply to over 120 percent in the year that the depreciation occurred, before
falling to about 90 percent in 2013. A large current account shock is potentially more
worrying because the trajectory of the external debt ratio does not decline appreciably over
the projection period, rising steadily to about 144 percent by 2013. While both scenarios are
unlikely, neither can be ruled out entirely. A current account shock could occur due to
Maldives’ large exposure to tourism patterns and world commodity prices. A real
depreciation could occur if fiscal slippages and attendant deficit monetization led to high
inflation or if a surge in import demand—generated by excessive public expenditure—put the
peg under pressure.

1/ Defined as general government gross debt.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g. A large negative contribution from real interest rate reflect a large pickup in (imported) inflation, while
domestic and foreign loan interest rates are expected to remain stable reflecting the peg to the U.S. dollar and the consessional nature of foreign loans.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium- and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Exchange Arrangements

From March 1, 1982 to June 30, 1985, the Maldivian rufiyaa was pegged to the
U.S. dollar. Beginning in July 1985, the exchange rate of the rufiyaa was linked to a
trade-weighted basket of currencies, but the exchange rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar
remained relatively stable until February 1987. On March 1, 1987, the rufiyaa was
devalued by 29 percent vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. From 1987 to 1994, the exchange rate of
the rufiyaa was adjusted periodically. Since October 1994, the exchange rate of the
rufiyaa remained unchanged at Rf 11.77 per U.S. dollar until July 25, 2001, when the
rufiyaa was devalued to Rf 12.80 per U.S. dollar.

3
Maldives continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements under the provisions of
Article XIV, but no longer maintains restrictions under Article XIV. Under these
circumstances, any exchange rate restriction that arises is subject to approval under
Article VIII.

Technical Assistance

FAD: In April 1994, Mr. Potter and Ms. Bédague visited Male to advise on budget
management. This was followed by periodic assistance from Mr. Webber (consultant)
over the period November 1994 to December 1995. In July 1994, Mr. Faria and
Mr. Kambil (consultants) assisted in formulating a strategy for revenue reform. This was
followed by a visit by Mr. Kambil in August/September 1995 to draft tax legislation. In
October 1996, a tax administration mission developed a strategy to establish an Inland
Revenue Department and a follow-up mission by a consultant took place in June 1997. In
May 2007, a mission conducted a diagnostic review of tax and tariff policy and
administration.
LEG: In October 2003, Mr. Head provided assistance on the revision of the Maldives
Monetary Authority Act (MMA Act). A series of missions (March and September 2005,
and April 2006) were provided to revamp the banking law.
MCM: In March 1993, a consultant provided assistance on the introduction of treasury
bills. In November 1994, a mission headed by Mr. Taniguchi provided assistance on
monetary management, foreign exchange operations, and bank supervision. In
February/June 1995, a consultant provided assistance for the development of a treasury
bill and MMA certificate market. In February/March 1996, a mission headed by
Mr. Swinburne provided advice on the reform of monetary operations and exchange
system. This was followed by a visit of a foreign exchange advisor in May 1997. In early
2001, two consultants provided assistance on foreign exchange and monetary
management, of two missions each. In July 2001, a consultant provided assistance on
monetary management following the lifting of credit ceilings and further impending
changes in the monetary framework. In October 2002, a multi-purpose mission took
stock of developments and provided recommendations in the areas of banking, foreign
exchange operations, and foreign exchange reserves management. In October 2003, in
cooperation with the legal consultant, Mr. Dornseif (Deutsche Bundesbank) provided
assistance on the drafting of the amended MMA Act. Two missions visited in 2006 on
monetary operations, financial market development, and banking issues.

4

STA: In June 1993 and February 1994, assistance was provided on monetary and balance
of payments statistics, respectively. In May 1995, a STA consultant provided assistance
on the compilation of a new consumer price index, which was followed by further
assistance in August 1996. In November 2005, TA was given on monetary and banking
issues. In June 2006, STA provided advice government finance statistics. In January
2007, STA provided advice on balance of payments statistics.

The World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy
The Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) FY08–12 aligns a joint IDA/IFC assistance
program behind the Government of Maldives’ (GoM) development strategy. The overarching

1

Prepared by World Bank staff.

6
objective is to contribute to policy and institutional reforms to help maintain the country’s
successful development trajectory of the last two decades.
The country context has changed considerably since the last CAS was discussed by the
Board in 2000. While the economy has continued to grow, the Maldives experienced a very
real economic and social rupture in the wake of the Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004,
which caused damage worth 60 percent of GDP. The GoM has also initiated a wide-ranging
reform program to modernize its governance in line with its middle-income status.2
Furthermore, demands upon the government for better services are rising rapidly with
income levels.
Much has changed in the seven years of the last CAS period, and the World Bank Group has
had to be flexible. The country faces three serious challenges: (i) the sustainability of its
fiscal policies, (ii) the completion of ambitious governance reforms, and (iii) adaptation to
global climate change. Sustaining the Maldives’ remarkable development progress hinges on
the government’s ability to address these key challenges in the short term, and to prioritize
policies and programs that maintain the country’s successful development trajectory over the
medium to long term.
The CAS FY08–12 has built in flexibility. The CAS period straddles the end of the Seventh
National Development Plan (7NDP) and the first half of the next five-year government
strategy, the midterm review of the CAS scheduled for FY10 will coincide with the start of
the government’s next strategy. This will be an opportunity to review CAS progress against
the indicators of the CAS Results Matrix as well as fine tune the program in line with
government’s priorities in the next plan. Pending fiscal adjustment, the strategy proposes a
programmatic, policy-based investment model for the second half of the CAS period. The
eligibility for the Maldives for IBRD funds will also be reviewed at that time.
This CAS has been prepared jointly by the World Bank and IFC and as such presents a
common view of development objectives in the Maldives, together with a commitment to a
shared strategy. During the last CAS period, the IFC committed a total of US$47.8 million
(US$ 46.5 million in debt and the remainder in equity), consisting of four projects in the
financial, tourism, logistics and telecommunications sectors. In addition, the IFC has
expanded its South Asia Enterprise Development Facility (IFC-SEDF) with a dedicated
advisory services program to cover Sri Lanka and the Maldives, and has established a
framework to provide support to small- and medium-sized enterprise (SMEs) within an
2

On December 20, 2004 days before the tsunami struck, the UN General Assembly endorsed a recommendation
that the Maldives graduate from Lead Developed Country (LDC) status at the end of 2007. Given the impact of
the disaster, the transition process was subsequently deferred and the Maldives will now formally graduate on
January 1, 2011. The main implication for the Maldives is the loss of duty exemptions on tuna exports to
Europe. Graduation from IDA and IBRD eligibility is not linked to this process.

7
enhanced investment climate. The IFC is considering further investments in the Maldives in
the areas of infrastructure, access to finance and tourism.
The IMF has been actively engaged in the Maldives, fielding technical assistance (TA)
missions and staff visits in addition to the regular cycle of Article IV consultations. The
teams of IMF and other IFIs have been working closely with the World Bank’s macro and
fiscal team. This collaboration will continue to be of critical importance in the short run
considering the risks posed by the expansionary fiscal policy and also recognizing the limited
leverage that the Bank Group may bring to bear on its own on this matter.
The CAS is designed to mitigate the risks that could reduce the effectiveness of the World
Bank Group’s operations and to further develop the ability to monitor the impact of
interventions. These include the immediate fiscal risks as well as the political risks due to the
country’s upcoming first multi-party elections. To mitigate these risks, the Bank Group will
maintain close dialogue with the authorities and with other donor partners in Male’. In
addition, the Bank Group is in close dialogue with the authorities and staff of the IMF with
regard to the country’s fiscal situation, which has worsened significantly in recent years.
Flexibility has been built into the proposed program to adjust the mix and level of Bank
instruments in response to emerging fiscal and political risks. Finally, given shallow capacity
in many of the implementing agencies, there are some implementation risks. Hence
operations will be designed simply and in close coordination with the government. Where
possible, government M&E systems will be upgraded as part of the Bank Group’s
interventions so as to avoid the expense of developing project-specific monitoring systems.
Lending program
Applying the principle of selectivity and taking into account the changing country context
and challenges facing the Maldives, the proposed World Bank Group assistance program
seeks to further three strategic development outcomes: (i) a well-managed economy
attracting increased investment; (ii) increased quality of education in support of a better
skilled workforce; and (iii) improved capacity to manage the country’s pristine, but fragile,
natural environment. These strategic outcomes will be supported through IDA credits
(mobile phone banking, education, and environmental management), strategic IFC
investments and TA and a flexible program of AAA. In addition, two cross-cutting
development themes have emerged as essential ingredients to the country’s overall
development program. These are: building stronger institutions and capacity to levels
commensurate with the socio-economic development of the Maldives; and encouraging
population and development consolidation (PDC) on larger islands.
The proposed CAS program is laid out in table below. The program for FY10, FY11 and
FY12 will be further elaborated during the CAS period and reviewed as part of the CAS
Progress Report. The content and product mix will depend on progress on the reform agenda.
Given the relatively small IDA allocation, making an effective contribution will mean that

8
the Bank Group’s work must be selective, catalytic and well-coordinated with other donors.
The CAS spans the last year of IDA14, three years of IDA15, and the first year of IDA16.
The overall size of the IDA envelope during the five-year CAS period is assumed to be about
SDR 30 million (about US$45 million), including about SDR 13.2 million (US$20 million)
in FY08 of resources remaining from IDA14, and annual resources of about SDR 4 million
during each of the subsequent years (US$6 million per year).3 4
Interventions are proposed that build on progress and relationships established by previous
operations. They also aim to establish a three pillar platform: (i) economic and fiscal
governance, (ii human development and social protection, and (iii) environmental
management; for a more long-term or programmatic approach to Bank Group assistance, as
proposed by the previous CAS, toward ensuring relevance over the next five years. Despite
the short-term risks posed by an expansionary fiscal policy, World Bank Group management
is committed to stay engaged with the authorities through a program that supports the longterm growth path.
While the IDA allocation is fixed, the mix of products is not. The World Bank Group will
ensure that the instruments used are consistent with the country’s development context. In
particular, a responsive program of analytical work has proved constructive in the Maldives
in the past and is consistent with the World Bank Group’s strategy for middle income
countries. In addition, the proposed sector lending program assumes that authorities manage
the current risks and avert a crisis. However, it is also possible that expenditures may
continue to rise, further endangering economic conditions. If this occurs the World Bank
Group would have to adjust its program accordingly in partnership with other donors and the
IMF to support resolution of the structural issues where possible.
Development policy lending is preferable, but will be contingent on demonstrated reforms. If
the authorities are able to re-establish fiscal balance within a sustainable macro-economic
framework that is satisfactory to the World Bank, then a development policy lending
operation (DPL) would be considered. To this end, a DPL operation is under consideration
for FY10, and is reflected in the program table above. The sector focus under the DPL would
be consistent with the overall assistance framework set out in this document. If a DPL is not
feasible, IDA resources will be channeled toward additional financing for sector operations.
In the future, the Maldives should aim for IBRD creditworthiness. Maldives’ eligibility for
IBRD lending could also be considered as part of the CAS Progress Report at mid-term. The
3

Under the small island exception, in recognition of exceptional vulnerability of small island states, the
Maldives has access to IDA despite having per capita income in excess of the IDA cut-off.
4
Estimates for IDA15 are based on performance in FY08 and assumptions about the size of the IDA15
replenishments. Actual allocations during the CAS period will be determined on an annual basis and will
depend on: (i) total IDA resources available in IDA15 and IDA16, (ii) the country’s performance rating; (iii) the
performance and assistance terms of other IDA borrowers; (iv) the terms of IDA's assistance to the Maldives
(credits or grants), and (v) the number of IDA-eligible countries.

9
uncertainties posed by recent expansionary policies and the political transition make it
inopportune to consider an IBRD envelope at present. However, with fiscal correction, the
conditions might be right to assess the creditworthiness of the country.

ANNEX V. MALDIVES: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
Macroeconomic statistics have improved in recent years, with technical assistance from STA
and the Asian Development Bank (AsDB). Remaining shortcomings affect the balance of
payments, government finance, and national accounts statistics. The authorities have
requested assistance from the Fund in the areas of balance of payments and government
finance, in addition to the ongoing assistance on monetary statistics. Also, the authorities are
receiving assistance from other agencies to improve the national accounts. The main official
statistical publication is the Statistical Yearbook of Maldives, which contains data series up
to 2004. APD also receives, albeit with a lag, the Quarterly Economic Bulletin and the
Annual Report of the Maldives Monetary Authority.
Real sector
National accounts statistics are available only on an annual basis and with a considerable lag,
and there are inconsistencies between GDP data from the production and expenditure sides.
The AsDB is assisting the authorities in setting up a framework for compiling more
comprehensive national accounts. The CPI has been compiled since June 1995 based on the
1993 income and expenditure survey. In 1996, a STA consumer price statistics mission
recommended that the authorities develop additional price indices for a more comprehensive
analysis of inflation. As 1995 is still used as the base year, the CPI may not reflect current
consumer spending patterns.
Fiscal sector
General government data are reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook and the latest
published data are for 2007. Data on the operations of state enterprises are limited.
Monetary sector
Comprehensive data are published in the Quarterly Economic Bulletin and the Annual
Report, with a significant lag. Data for the accounts of the Maldives Monetary Authority
(MMA), commercial banks, and interest rates are reported to the Fund for publication in IFS
on a regular and timely basis. There are inconsistencies between monetary and fiscal data
regarding the financing of the fiscal deficit due to issues of timing and coverage. The
April 2007 STA monetary and financial statistics mission completed the standardized
reporting forms (SRFs) for the central bank and other depository corporations, and developed
the integrated monetary database that will meet the data needs of the MMA, STA, and APD.
The regular reporting of the SRFs will begin in the coming months, when the MMA
approves these data for dissemination. It is expected that similar reporting forms will be
completed for other financial corporations in a follow-up mission.

14
External sector
Balance of payments data are compiled on an annual basis. There are problems of coverage
and measurement in a range of areas. Travel receipts are still estimated on the basis of a
small and outdated survey of resorts/hotels to determine daily average expenditure by
tourists. Estimates of distributed and reinvested earnings in the tourism sector are still
unsatisfactory and information on private financial flows is incomplete. A technical
assistance mission in January 2007 proposed steps to include data on direct investment,
travel receipts, and a range of other specific items.
Official reserves are reported monthly with a (variable) two-week lag. Predetermined
outflows on foreign currency assets (mainly debt service payments) are known and reported
at the time of the annual consultation missions, while other movements of foreign currency
assets have not been identified. Quarterly data on external debt and debt service are available
for the government and the monetary authority, and to some extent for the banking sector and
state enterprises at the time of the annual consultation missions, but no data are reported for
the nonfinancial private sector.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Maldives
September 3, 2008

1.
There have been some political changes to the composition of the government
following the Article IV consultation mission. The Finance Minister, Mr. Qasim Ibrahim, has
resigned and will be a presidential candidate in the forthcoming elections. He has been
replaced by the former Governor of the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA), Mr. Abdulla
Jihad. No replacement has yet been named for the Governor.
2.
To date budget execution is lagging a little, especially on capital expenditures.
Monthly data to end-June indicate that the government has spent 41½ percent of budgeted
current expenditures and 14 percent of budgeted capital expenditures.
3.
The Ministry of Finance has revised down the budget and remains committed to the
goal of zero domestic financing. The government is planning to cut expenditures by
19 percentage points of GDP for the year, the level that could be achieved if it maintains the
same spending patterns in 2H as in 1H. In particular, it aims to cut 20 percent of expenditures
from August onward. Measures include (i) limiting overtime work; (ii) reducing recurrent
expenditures such as official travel and celebrations; (iii) suspending or deferring capital
expenditures; and (iv) forfeiting a part of the salaries for cabinet ministers and other senior
officials. The ministry expects at least Rf 596 million (3.6 percent of GDP, 5.3 percent of
budgeted annual domestic expenditure) cuts from above measures. On the revenue side, the
revised budget apparently includes no revenues from the leasing of additional island resorts.
Accordingly, the revised budget, as is, leaves a domestic financing gap of 1.9 percent of
GDP.
4.
While the planned expenditure reductions are commendable, the authorities should
aim for deeper and less ad hoc reductions in expenditure, along the lines of the staff report
recommendations. Immediate measures should include: (i) an increase in electricity tariffs
(which would reduce government subsidies to the state-owned electricity company), and
(ii) a nominal wage bill freeze for the civil service. The authorities would also need to raise
revenues through additional island leases, while keeping well below the authorities’ previous
ambitious target of 30 islands discussed during the mission.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with the
Maldives
On September 3, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Maldives.1
Background
The Maldives continues to grow robustly, underpinned by a tourism sector that has rebounded
strongly from the Asian tsunami. In 2007, rapid tourism growth, together with construction
activities, has kept the headline growth rate in line with the pre-tsunami average despite an
unusually low fish catch. Inflation has recently picked up sharply to nearly 15 percent year on year
due to soaring food and oil prices.
The main challenge for the Maldives is to contain fiscal expenditures that have increased sharply
following the tsunami. Expenditure has reached extraordinarily high levels by international and
historical standards, with the majority of the increase in domestically financed expenditure
unrelated to the tsunami. On the revenue side, there has been little progress with tax reforms. The
government has been relying on extraordinary revenue measures, such as leasing out islands, to
contain the fiscal deficit, and indeed has achieved its target of zero domestic financing in 2007.
The 2008 budget continues to entail a large increase in current expenditures in an election year
financed by extraordinary revenue measures with significant implementation risks. An over
50 percent increase in the wage bill and quadrupled subsidies, mainly because of administered
electricity prices, pushed up overall expenditure to nearly 70 percent of GDP. The government
planned to achieve zero domestic financing with a large receipt (about 15 percent of GDP) from a
transshipment port project, but when the project was delayed by a year, the authorities planned to
fill the shortfall by leasing an additional 30 islands. The government now realizes that this is too

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and
discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters,
the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the
conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
ambitious and accordingly, has revised down the budget by cutting back on expenditure by
20 percent from August onward.
Dynamic private sector activities shaped the external sector. The current account deficit widened to
45 percent of GDP in 2007, driven by a surge in construction-related imports and rising commodity
prices, notwithstanding the contribution from strong tourism earnings. The deficit was financed
mainly through a large increase in private capital inflows, including foreign borrowing by
commercial banks, which was then on-lend to resort developers. As a result, external debt
increased sharply to near 70 percent of GDP in 2007.
The U.S. dollar peg has served the Maldives well and continues to be an appropriate exchange
rate regime for the country. The Maldives appears to have adequate room to maintain
competitiveness under the peg despite the recent rise in inflation, provided imported inflation is not
exacerbated by fiscal slippages. Most of Maldives’ exports are to euro-denominated areas, while
the bulk of imports are dollar denominated. The real effective exchange rate has declined more
than that of comparator tourism-based small economies.
There has been some notable progress with key legal reforms. A new central bank governor was
appointed following the amendment to the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) act enshrining the
separation of the positions of finance minister and governor. MMA was also empowered to set
interest rates and put a ceiling on the amount the government can borrow through its Ways and
Means Account. The Civil Service Bill and the Audit Act were passed and an independent civil
service commissioner and an auditor general have been appointed.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors were encouraged that Maldives’ economy has rebounded strongly from the
December 2004 tsunami, underpinned by a booming tourism sector and reconstruction activities.
However, inflation has picked up markedly mainly due to high food and oil prices, and the economy
remains vulnerable to external shocks.
Directors agreed that the main challenge for Maldives is to ensure that the broadly favorable
growth prospects are not undermined by excessive fiscal spending and attendant macroeconomic
instability. Government expenditures—in particular current expenditures unrelated to tsunami
relief—have risen to extremely high levels. While welcoming the authorities’ efforts to maintain their
commitment to zero domestic financing of the budget, Directors cautioned that any revenue
shortfall would put at risk these efforts, exacerbating already high inflation and increasing external
vulnerabilities.
While the 2008 budget calls for zero domestic financing, Directors expressed concern that it
accommodates a substantial rise in domestically financed expenditures with ad hoc revenues from
the lease of additional island resorts, which might prove uncertain. They welcomed the authorities’
intention to reduce the remaining 2008 budget allocation of line ministries by 20 percent, and
encouraged the authorities to identify further contingent expenditure cuts if needed. Directors
looked forward to early progress on steps to reduce subsidies to the state-owned electricity

3
company by increasing electricity tariffs and to contain the civil service wage bill through civil
service reform.
Directors stressed that ensuring fiscal sustainability over the medium term will require revenueenhancing reforms, including the introduction of corporate taxation, a broad-based sales tax, and
an ad valorem tourism tax. They called on the authorities to press ahead with their plans to
develop a realistic medium-term expenditure framework to prioritize spending within the available
resource envelope.
Directors agreed that external vulnerabilities will need to be monitored carefully, given the recent
rise in external debt and debt service. While the rise in debt is attributable mainly to private sector
activity, risks to the banking sector should be carefully monitored.
Directors generally acknowledged that Maldives’ U.S. dollar peg exchange rate regime and the
level of the exchange rate appear appropriate. The dollar’s decline against the euro has enhanced
the country’s competitiveness in recent years, providing a cushion against any erosion in
competitiveness arising from high imported inflation. At the same time, Directors emphasized that it
will remain crucially important that the peg be supported by prudent fiscal policies.
Directors commended the authorities for implementing the Maldives Monetary Authority Act by
appointing an independent Governor. They also welcomed the appointment of an independent Civil
Service Commission and Auditor General. Directors encouraged early passage of the pending
Banking Act and Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)
legislation.

Statement by Shakour Shaalan, Executive Director for Maldives
September 3, 2008
1.
The Maldives economy has resumed its impressive growth trend as sound policies
and generous international support have aided its recovery from the effects of the December
2004 Tsunami. Like other small island economies, the Maldives will likely remain highly
dependent on tourism and tuna exports for some time. However, the ongoing concerted
reconstruction drive and ambitious tourism development plan have boosted activity in the
construction and services sectors in recent years, prompting deterioration of the fiscal
balance. While steady growth in per capita GDP has helped propel the country to middleincome levels, the authorities recognize the need to reduce external vulnerabilities and ensure
long-term fiscal sustainability in the period ahead.
2.
Growth and outlook. GDP growth resumed its normal pace of around 7½ percent in
2007, in spite of an unexpected drop in fish catch, the main commodity export. This growth
rate followed on the post-tsunami sharp contraction in 2005 and the exceptional rate of
18 percent growth in 2006 as the economy rebounded. Tourism levels have now returned to
pre-tsunami levels and the fish catch has recovered in early 2008. With these trends, and
assuming there is a lasting correction in commodity prices, the near-term outlook for GDP
growth and the balance of payments are favorable as the ongoing expansion in rapidly
building up hotel capacity. Over the medium-term, further expanding tourism and enhancing
human and institutional capacity, as well as stronger financial institutions will help foster
economic diversification.
3.
Inflation. The Maldives has not been immune to the global trend of rising commodity
prices stoking inflationary pressures since mid-2007. Headline inflation rose from 4 percent
to nearly 15 percent in April stemming from rising food and fuel prices. Most food is
imported and accounts for 30 percent of the CPI basket, and non-food inflation stands at
6 percent in April 2008, compared to 2 percent a year earlier. Although fuel has a small
direct share in the CPI basket, its impact permeates domestic prices through transport,
construction, tourism-related activities, and the delivery of health, education, and other
services to a population that is widely dispersed among remote islands. A severe housing
shortage has raised housing costs, partly resulting from the large increase in foreign labor, as
elaborated below. The weakening dollar, to which the rufiyaa is pegged, has also contributed
to rising import costs and inflation. A correction in commodity prices would allow inflation
to revert back to previous levels of around 4 percent.
4.
External developments. Because of the predominance of European tourists,
competitiveness has not been hurt by the weakening of the dollar to which the rufiyaa is
pegged. Indeed, the Maldives is in a good competitive position relative to its main
comparators and can withstand some further real appreciation without adverse impact on
tourism. Notably, and in contrast to staff’s rash proposal last year, staff unambiguously
confirms the absence of any exchange rate misalignment this time around, and reaffirms that
the dollar peg provides an effective nominal anchor and remains the most appropriate regime.
Intensive reconstruction of resorts and infrastructure has supported a rebound in tourism,
with tourist receipts rising steadily in the last three years to surpass their pre-tsunami levels.

2
The current account deficit continued to widen in spite of the strong growth of tourism due to
higher imports, with about one-half of the increase in the value of imports coming from
capital goods and one quarter from higher payments for petroleum products. Imports were
financed primarily by a steady flow of private capital and commercial bank borrowing,
allowing for a modest addition to reserves to maintain adequate import coverage.
5.
Budgetary operations. The 2007 fiscal outcome is considerably better than projected
during the last Article IV consultation, and better than targeted under the 2007 budget. In the
face of persistent spending pressures to finance the reconstruction effort, the Maldivian
authorities have relied, to the extent possible, on grant financing, concessional borrowing,
and private sector leasing in order to contain domestic financing. In 2007, domestic revenue
increased by 5 percent of GDP primarily from resort lease payments and grant receipts
exceeded the budgeted amount by 1½ percent of GDP. However, overall revenue fell short of
the budget by about 2½ percent of GDP, as the anticipated increase in import duties did not
materialize. Accordingly, current spending was contained to within ½ percent of GDP of the
budgeted amount and capital spending was kept well below the budget target. As a result, the
overall fiscal deficit including grants came in at 7.8 percent of GDP, well below the staff’s
projection of 24 percent of GDP, and the projected domestic financing (of 9 percent of GDP)
did not materialize. This outcome is a clear demonstration of the authorities’ resolve to
address potential fiscal risks by reining in spending pressures and avoiding domestic
financing.
6.
With respect to the 2008 budget, the authorities are confident that they can continue
to maintain a balanced budget in terms of domestic financing and plan to adjust their
spending in line with domestic revenue and foreign financing. As the expected revenue from
the transshipment port project has been delayed, a cabinet decision was taken in August 2008
to reduce the remaining budget allocation of each line ministry/office by 20 percent,
consistent with staffs’ recommendation that they identify contingency measures other than
lease of resorts. They are also currently in discussions with both the World Bank and Asian
Development Bank, on possible budget support for this fiscal year, and have approached
some bilateral donors for possible grant support. Spending pressures are unavoidable this
year given the scheduled Presidential elections before the 10th of October 2008 and
Parliamentary elections in March 2009. Moreover, the expanding tourism sector requires
corresponding improvements in infrastructure and transport links. The demand for public
services has also increased, not only from the citizen’s rising expectations, but also from a
large inflow of foreign labor. The number of expatriates nearly doubled since 2004,
increasing the island’s population by about 10 percent, and increasing the administrative
burden on the public sector. Higher subsidy payments were necessary to ensure affordable
food staples, assist fisheries in meeting rising fuel prices, and to mitigate the impact of higher
fuel costs on electricity prices. However, there has been a full pass-through of the price
increases of petroleum products and the authorities plan to adjust electricity prices in the near
future so as to gradually remove electricity subsidies. Higher commodity prices, together
with a weakening rufiyaa, also necessitated a correction to public sector wages in January
2008 to reduce the resulting erosion of real incomes, with larger increases given to those in
the lower end of the pay scale. As in previous years, there will likely be some underspending
in some budget categories.

3
7.
Debt and fiscal sustainability. To ensure fiscal sustainability over the
medium-term, the authorities remain committed to their policy of zero domestic financing
underpinned by key expenditure and revenue reforms. The public debt ratio edged up with
the reconstruction activity but is expected to rapidly recede over the medium-term. In
anticipation of the decline in official disbursements and in the contribution of lease
payments, the authorities plan to introduce a business profit tax in 2009. With respect to the
latter, the Ministry of Legal Reform estimates that the bill will be submitted to Parliament
before December 2008. They are also considering broadening the tax base through a
consumption tax, but this will require further study to ensure an equitable and orderly
approach. A number of infrastructure and public sector governance reforms are expected to
assist in rationailizing public spending on social services in the wake of rising expectations
from public services. Some savings are expected from the planned consolidation of the
population to reduce high-cost services in remote areas. The newly formed civil service
commission should facilitate downsizing of the civil service over the medium-term and avoid
future ad-hoc compensation increases. Rising incomes should allow for greater provision of
private health and education services that would reduce reliance on public services. The
authorities fully recognize the importance of a medium-term fiscal framework to contain
expenditure levels at a sustainable level and on par with realistic revenue estimates. To this
end, the Ministry of Finance and Treasury is working to ensure that such a framework will be
in place starting from 2009.
8.
Financial Sector. Private sector credit continues to expand at a robust pace, in step
with the ambitious tourism development plan that began in 2004. Most lending comes
through the parent banks of international commercial banks and it has contributed to raising
the external debt ratio. As the staff note, the external vulnerabilities are mitigated by the
exposure limits of the parent banks and the fact that the loans are well collateralized. With
strengthened off-site and on-site supervision, the share of nonperforming loans has seen a
steady decline since 2005, and impaired loans currently account for less than 2 percent of
total loans.
9.
Recent reforms have strengthened the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) and its
capacity to manage liquidity. A recent amendment of the MMA Act has provided for
separating the leadership of the central bank and ministry of finance, previously held jointly,
and reorganized the governing body of the central bank. In addition, an inter-agency
agreement provides the MMA jurisdiction on setting of interest rates and places a ceiling on
government borrowings through the Ways and Means Account. The authorities have initiated
another amendment to further clarify that the central bank need not be a captive purchase of
government bills. These reforms will strengthen the MMA’s instruments and capacity to
control domestic liquidity.
10.
Finally, the Maldivian authorities would like to thank staff for their sound advice and
thank the Fund and its membership for their continued support.
