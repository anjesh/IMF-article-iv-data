Discussions on the 2005 Article IV consultation and third review under the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) were held in Lusaka, during October 12-26, 2005.
The staff met with the Minister of Finance and National Planning, Mr. Magande; the
Deputy Governors of the Bank of Zambia (BoZ), Mr. Mfula and Mr. Kalyalya; other senior
officials; representatives of the private sector, trade unions, NGOs, and the donor
community.

•

The staff comprised Mr. Caramazza (head), Mr. Dunn, Mr. Akatu (all AFR), Mr. Arnason
(PDR), Mr. Baldini (FAD), and Mr. Kakoza (Resident Representative). The mission worked
closely with World Bank Staff.

•

The Board concluded the last Article IV consultation with Zambia on April 7, 2004. On that
occasion, the focus of the Fund’s advice was on the fragile economic situation and the
structural reforms needed to achieve strong growth and poverty reduction. The authorities’
policies since then have been broadly in line with Fund advice. Expenditure restraint,
including on the wage bill, has helped to put the fiscal operations of the government on a
sustainable course and contributed to the attainment of the HIPC completion point. Progress
has also been made on the structural reforms agenda, including public expenditure
management, public debt management, the resolution of insolvent nonbank financial
institutions, and the privatization of the Zambia National Commercial Bank.

•

Zambia’s three-year PRGF arrangement was approved by the Executive Board on June 16,
2004 in the amount of SDR 220.10 million (45 percent of quota) of which SDR 176.08
million has been drawn. The second review of the program was completed on April 8, 2005
and, at that time Zambia reached the completion point under the enhanced Heavily Indebted
Poor Countries Initiative.

•

Zambia maintains a managed floating regime, with no pre-announced path for the exchange
rate. Zambia has accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 of the
Articles of Agreement. Zambia maintains an exchange restriction arising from the external
payments arrears accumulated prior to October 1985, which is subject to Fund approval.

•

Presidential and parliamentary elections are due in 2006. A Constitutional Review
Committee (CRC) appointed by the Government with broad terms of reference has
presented a draft constitution and an interim report to the Government, after consultation
with all stakeholders. A final report is expected by year end.

-4EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Economic Background
•

After more than two decades of economic stagnation, the Zambian economy has,
since 2000, achieved sustained robust growth. Inflation, however, has remained high
and poverty, though declining, is still widespread.

•

Zambia’s external position has strengthened in recent years, as the terms of trade
recorded a marked improvement and nontraditional exports grew strongly. The exchange
rate has appreciated strongly in real terms during the past year, but foreign exchange
reserves are low. Extensive debt relief has greatly reduced Zambia’s external debt
burden. Implementation of the MDRI would cancel the bulk of the remaining external
debt.

Policy Issues
•

The main challenge facing Zambia is to seize the opportunity provided by debt relief
and the prospect of rising external assistance to build upon the recent improvement in
economic performance. The authorities’ strategy seeks to promote macroeconomic
stability, private sector growth, improved public sector management and development of
the financial sector.

•

A reduction in government domestic borrowing will continue to anchor the
stabilization effort. To avoid a renewed buildup of unsustainable external debt, the
authorities are committed to a prudent borrowing policy and to strengthening their debt
management capacity.

•

Monetary policy aims to reduce inflation to single digits by 2007.

•

The high external value of the currency may pose a challenge for nontraditional
exports, which will have to rely on improvements in productivity to enhance
international competitiveness.

Program for 2006
•

Performance under the PRGF program has been broadly satisfactory. The
authorities have requested two modifications to the program: one, an upward adjustment
of the end-2005 ceiling on net domestic financing for the sole purpose of clearing the
bulk of domestic arrears to road contractors; and two, a rescheduling of the initiation of
the IFMIS pilot.

•

The program for 2006 aims to promote macroeconomic stability and achieve robust
economic growth. Real GDP is projected to grow by 6 percent, while end-year inflation
is brought down to 10 percent. The overall fiscal deficit is projected to remain roughly
unchanged, but domestic financing would be reduced modestly, notwithstanding
spending for elections, while spending on poverty-reducing programs is increased. The
structural program builds on the 2005 program in seeking to strengthen public
expenditure and debt management, financial sector development, and governance and
transparency.

-5I. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS: A MARKED TURNAROUND IN ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
Real GDP growth averaged 4½ percent a year during 2000–2005, a marked turnaround after
more than two decades of economic stagnation and falling per capita income. Inflation,
however, remains high, international reserves are low, and poverty is still widespread. A
significant fiscal adjustment begun in 2004, has reduced the government’s domestic financing
need, eased pressures to monetize debt, and curbed crowding out of bank credit to the private
sector. In 2005, Zambia received extensive debt relief, which has greatly reduced its external
debt burden. While this removes a major vulnerability, the Zambian economy is still susceptible
to climatic and terms of trade shocks.
A. Robust Growth But Inflation Still High
1.
After two decades of poor performance, the Zambian economy has, since 2000,
achieved sustained robust growth (Tables 1 and 2 and Figure 1). The construction sector has
performed particularly well, driven mainly by strong demand for housing, while the mining
sector has undergone a substantial recovery in the wake of privatization and rising world prices
for copper. Agricultural sector growth has been restrained, however, by adverse climatic
conditions, which depressed production of food crops in some years. Economic activity in 2005
has been weaker than expected, owing to a drought-related shortfall in maize production and
temporary setbacks in the mining sector associated with labor disputes and mining accidents.
Moreover, in the second half of the year, fuel shortages caused by shutdowns of the country’s
oil refinery further curtailed mining production and disrupted economic activity more broadly.
Real GDP in 2005 is projected to grow 4.3 percent in 2005, compared with 5 percent anticipated
in the PRGF-supported program.

Despite the broad-based economic recovery and the growth of employment in the
mining sector, total formal sector employment has continued to decline. Contributing to this
have been declining employment in state-owned enterprises, the short- to medium-term effect of
restructuring of privatized firms and the

Poverty has been reduced, but is still widespread, reflecting, in part, the low growth
rates in agriculture and the limited employment in, and multiplier effects of, mining. In
2004, 67 percent of the population fell below the poverty line—a modest improvement from the
73 percent in 1998. While Zambia’s prospects for reaching the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) have improved in recent years, it still faces a number of challenges—in particular,
sustained, higher pro-poor growth and greater financial and human resources for the social
sectors will be required to accelerate progress toward achieving the MDGs (Appendix V).

B. Fiscal Consolidation and Strengthened Public Expenditure Management Systems
5.
Zambia has begun to address the weaknesses in fiscal policy that had hindered
efforts to achieve greater macroeconomic stability, and in 2004-05 recorded a substantial
improvement (Tables 3 and 4 and

In 2005, overall fiscal performance was satisfactory through the third quarter, with
both revenue and expenditure broadly in line with program objectives. In October, in the
context of a fuel crisis brought about by the breakdown of the oil refinery, the government
reduced import and excise duties on petroleum products for the remainder of the year so as to
stem a sharp escalation in retail prices of fuel and encourage oil marketing companies to directly
import-finished petroleum products. This is estimated to lower tax revenue by about 0.1 percent
of GDP. Nevertheless, for the year as a whole, revenues are expected to be in line with the
program target. Domestic financing of the budget is expected to be 1.9-2.2 percent of GDP,
depending on the extent of clearance of arrears to road contractors (see below).
7.
Progress has also been made in strengthening public expenditure management
(PEM) systems, but weaknesses continue to hamper the effective delivery of public
services. In 2003, Zambia ranked among the weakest performers among HIPC countries in
regard to PEM—it met only 3 of 16 criteria for sound PEM.4 Procedures for budget planning,
execution, and monitoring allowed for little oversight, resulting in inefficiencies, the
accumulation of domestic arrears, and limited accountability. By end-2004, an additional three
criteria were satisfied, including the preparation of Zambia’s first medium-term expenditure
framework (MTEF). With support from donors, the government officially embarked on the
comprehensive Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability (PEMFA) reform
program in June 2005, aimed at (i) strengthening existing PEM systems, while implementing a
modern integrated financial management and information system (IFMIS); (ii) improving debt
management capabilities; and (iii) increasing transparency and accountability.

On average, sub-Saharan HIPC countries met six benchmarks in 2003/04. See Update on the
Assessments and Implementation of Action Plans to Strengthen Capacity of HIPCs to Track
Poverty-Reducing Public Spending (April 12, 2005).

-9C. Monetary Expansion Being Brought Under Control
8.
After several years of excessive monetary expansion, driven by persistently large
fiscal deficits, the Bank of Zambia (BoZ) adopted a firmer monetary policy in 2005
(Tables 5 and 6). Fiscal adjustment and efforts by the BoZ to mop up excessive liquidity in the
banking system contributed to a decline in the 12-month rate of growth of reserve money from
over 60 percent in 2000 to 23 percent at end-December 2004. Over the same period, the growth
of broad money fell by half, to 31 percent (Figure 3). Continued fiscal discipline contributed to
a substantial further decline in reserve money and broad money growth, to a twelve-month rate
of 12 percent and 16 percent, respectively, in September 2005. The cutback in government
borrowing helped to lower market interest rates and crowd in private sector credit, which has
expanded at a rapid pace, albeit from a low base. However, lending rates have remained high,
largely reflecting the slow progress in lowering inflation. The expansion of credit to the private
sector in 2005 has been supported also by a shift in bank’s portfolios out of foreign assets to
take advantage of more favorable yields on domestic securities. To foster the development of a
long-term bond market, in August 2005, the government introduced three- and five-year bonds.

9.
The recent improvement in the fiscal position has allowed the BoZ to exercise more
effective control of overall liquidity. Nonetheless, liquidity management has at times
continued to be problematic, owing to inadequate coordination between the monetary and
fiscal authorities and shifting objectives over the direction of interest rates, exchange rates, and
reserve accumulation. This has tended to obscure policy signals.5
10.
The banking sector remains generally sound. Risk-weighted capital-asset ratios are on
average more than double the statutory requirement of 10 percent (Table 7), and the ratio of
nonperforming loans (NPLs) to total loans declined sharply following the restructuring of
Zambia National Commercial Bank (ZNCB) in 2001. Furthermore, loan loss provisions are
generally adequate. Earnings have been generally strong and bank liquidity has continued to be
high by regional and international standards. In recent months, however, NPLs have risen,

reduced their net foreign asset position as they rebalanced their portfolios in favor of domestic
assets. The desired portfolio adjustment has been mainly achieved and only a further small
decline in commercial banks’ NFA is projected in 2006. Banks’ net open position in foreign
exchange relative to capital has declined further during 2005, pointing to a reduced
vulnerability.7

External Position
11.
Zambia maintains a flexible
exchange rate regime.8 During 200004, the kwacha was fairly stable in real
effective terms, but it has since
appreciated strongly (19 percent from
December 2004 to September 2005).9
The appreciation has been associated
with a marked strengthening of market
sentiment stemming from record high
world prices for copper, a perceived
continued commitment to prudent fiscal
and monetary policies, and a marked
improvement in Zambia’s debt
sustainability outlook with the

The ratio of NPLs to total loans rose to 10.8 percent in July 2005, from 7.6 percent in
December 2004, before declining to 8.6 percent in August 2005. The ratio of the provision for
loan losses to NPLs rose to 60.6 percent in August 2005 from 53.9 percent in July.
7

The ratio of official reserves to foreign currency deposits also rose, from 51 percent in
December 2004 to 72 percent in July 2005.
8

The regime is classified as managed floating. The exchange rate is market determined, with
BoZ intervention in the interbank foreign exchange market, aimed at smoothing short-run
fluctuations and meeting the program’s gross international reserves target.
9

The kwacha continued to appreciate in October and November. Against the U.S. dollar, the
kwacha was, at end-November, 27 percent stronger than at the beginning of the year.

- 11 attainment of the completion point under the HIPC Initiative and the prospect of further
substantial debt relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) (Box 1). Speculative
inflows, aimed at taking advantage of relatively high yields on government securities, have also
been reported.
12.
Zambia’s gross international reserves have increased gradually in recent years, but
import coverage remains low. The import coverage of reserves is projected to rise to
1.4 months at end-2005, from 1.2 months at end-2004, reflecting BoZ purchases on the foreign
exchange market at various times during the year. In the past, Zambia’s policy on accumulating
reserves was largely driven by the need to meet external debt-service payments. Having
received extensive debt relief in 2005 the immediate pressure of facing a shortfall has eased.
End-2005 reserves are estimated to be about three times higher than debt-service payments due
in 2006, before taking into account the impact of the MDRI.10 Moreover, the end-2005 reserve
level is also about three times higher than programmed external budget support in 2006, thus
providing a buffer for a shortfall in disbursement.

projected to widen slightly to about
12 percent of GDP. External grant financing, primarily in the form of project support, has
remained fairly stable in nominal terms but has declined relative to GDP. In contrast, external
budget support has exhibited considerable volatility but is estimated to roughly double in 2005,
to about 2 percent of GDP, partly as a result of greater donor coordination under the Wider
Harmonization in Practice program (Tables 8 and 9 and Figure 4).

Programmed end-2005 reserves are equal to 11 percent of the estimated end-2005 nominal
public and publicly guaranteed debt of about US$3.5 billion. With implementation of the
MDRI—through a stock of debt reduction of AfDF, IDA, and the Fund—for which Zambia is
likely to qualify, reserves projected at end-2006 would cover about 97 percent of total nominal
external debt of about US$500 million.

Box 1. A Long-Term Perspective on the Real Effective Exchange Rate
Long-term movements in the kwacha’s real effective exchange rate reflect the vagaries of the
Zambian economy and especially the swings in world prices of copper. During the first decade of
independence, in 1964, Zambia enjoyed robust export earnings from copper. When copper prices
collapsed in the mid-1970s, Zambia resorted to large scale foreign borrowing to finance its import
needs and avoid an adjustment to the real exchange rate. However, when access to foreign loans was
cut off in the early 1980s, a sharp depreciation of the real exchange rate was inevitable.
Zambia undertook extensive liberalization of the foreign exchange market during 1992-95. The
introduction of bureaux de change, lifting of controls on current transactions, permission to citizens
and non-citizens to hold foreign currency accounts enabled market forces to play a larger role in the
determination of the exchange rate, although the Bank of Zambia was able to exert influence over it
through the Bank’s regular auctions. An interbank market in foreign exchange was established in
2003. Currently, the Bank of Zambia intervenes in the sometimes thin foreign exchange market to
smooth excessive volatility and to meet its reserve targets.

Over the last year, the real effective exchange rate of the kwacha has appreciated sharply. The
appreciation has been particularly steep in recent months. It stems from an improvement in the terms
of trade and renewed confidence in the economy, resulting from the marked improvement in fiscal
performance and the international commitment of extensive debt relief. Interest in government
securities, both domestically and abroad, has also been strong owing to their high nominal yields.
This has been reflected in the drawdown of the net foreign asset position of commercial banks.
From a long-term perspective, the appreciation of the kwacha during the past year may be seen as an
adjustment to the upward shift in the equilibrium real value of the exchange rate, as a result of the
greatly improved prospects of the copper sector and cancellation of the bulk of Zambia’s external
debt. But while this suggests that the kwacha may not be overvalued currently, the higher external
value of the currency may pose a challenge for nontraditional exports, which will have to rely on
improvements in productivity to enhance their international competitiveness.

- 13 -

14.
Zambia’s debt sustainability outlook has improved markedly with the attainment
of the completion point under the HIPC Initiative and the favorable trend in exports in
recent years. Taking into account HIPC Initiative and additional bilateral debt relief (Box 2),
Zambia’s stock of external debt relative to current year exports of goods and services is
projected to be 66 percent at end-2005 based on calculations using the LIC DSA framework
(Appendix VI).11 Moreover, Zambia’s external debt and debt-service indicators remain quite
low over the long term. Stress tests suggest a sharp curtailment of export earnings—for
example, associated with a precipitous drop in world copper prices—could cause the NPV of
debt-to-exports ratio to temporarily rise again above its LIC DSA threshold of 150 percent. This
scenario underscores Zambia’s continued vulnerability to external shocks. Implementation of
the MDRI would further improve Zambia’s debt sustainability outlook as it would cancel the
bulk of remaining external debt. It is the joint view of Fund and Bank staff that Zambia is at low
risk of debt distress.

Box 2. Paris Club Agreement
Representatives of Paris Club creditors met on May 11, 2005 and agreed to recommend to
their governments a reduction of Zambia's external debt. In order to contribute to the
restoration of Zambia's debt sustainability, they recommended that debts of US$1,403
million in nominal terms be cancelled; this represents the Paris Club's share of the debt relief
effort under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. All creditors but one (Russia) also committed on a
bilateral basis to cancelling their remaining claims on Zambia of US$393 million. As a result
of this agreement, Zambia's debt to Paris Club creditors would be reduced from
US$1,920 million to US$125 million. Moreover, Russia agreed to defer one half of debt
service due during 2005-07 to 2009-11. The Zambian government is actively pursuing
bilateral agreements with Paris Club creditors, including Russia, based on the agreed minutes
of the May 2005 Paris Club meeting.

15.
Despite the recent improvements in economic performance, many challenges lie
ahead for Zambia. For poverty levels to be substantially reduced and to attain the other MDGs,
substantially higher rates of pro-poor economic growth will have to be attained; service quality
and delivery will have to be markedly improved to address the HIV/AIDS pandemic and
provide better quality and access to education and health care; and financial and human
resources will need to be significantly scaled up. The government is preparing a New
11

At the completion point, the end-2005 NPV of debt-to-exports ratio was projected to be
118 percent. The largest contributor to this difference is a higher denominator, both because of
an upward revision in estimates of exports in 2004 and 2005 and the switch from a three-year
average of exports to current-year exports. Another important contributing factor, is the use of
the standard 5 percent discount rate, rather the average six-month CIRR rate in the completion
point calculations of 4.2 percent.

- 14 Development Plan (NDP) aimed at addressing these challenges, which is expected to be
launched in early 2006 (Box 3).
Box 3. The Fifth National Development Plan, 2006–10
The fifth National Development Plan (NDP), covering 2006–10, is expected to be
issued in early 2006 and will serve as Zambia’s revised Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP). The NDP has been prepared through a highly participatory process,
including consultations on local needs in each of Zambia’s 72 districts. Sector
Advisory Groups (SAGs), chaired by government officials and comprised of a variety
of stakeholders, including representatives from civil society and the donor community,
have drafted chapters for the NDP, which are now being finalized.
The NDP reviews Zambia’s improved economic performance in recent years under the
current PRSP. Building on lessons from this period, the NDP emphasizes
macroeconomic stability as necessary for achieving sustainable high rates of growth
under the baseline scenario. The NDP further proposes alternative scenarios that aim
for greater pro-poor growth, mainly through higher growth in labor intensive sectors—
notably, agriculture, agro-processing and other manufacturing, and tourism. Under the
“core” alternative scenario, additional donor assistance would be used to finance
infrastructure investments to support these sectors, as well as to step up provision of
social services for the poor (mainly health, education, and water and sanitation).
II. MEDIUM-TERM PROSPECTS AND POLICIES: CONSOLIDATING MACROECONOMIC
STABILITY AND ADVANCING STRUCTURAL REFORMS
Against this background, the main economic task facing Zambia is to seize the opportunity
provided by debt relief and the prospect of rising external assistance to build upon the recent
improvement in economic performance. Policy discussions focused on achieving greater
macroeconomic stability, anchored in a further reduction in government’s domestic borrowing,
and implementation of structural reforms to support private sector-led growth, improve public
sector management, and increase competitiveness, as emphasized in the forthcoming NDP.
16.
Zambia’s growth prospects over the medium term are favorable (Table 10). Real
GDP growth is projected to pick up to about 6 percent a year, partly as a result of the coming on
stream of a number of recent and ongoing large-scale private investments in the mining
electricity, and manufacturing sectors.12 More generally, with the authorities’ commitment to
achieve greater macroeconomic stability and implement an agenda of structural reforms to
support development in the financial and private sectors, it is expected that over the medium
term, gross national savings and gross domestic investment would remain near the stepped-up
levels achieved in recent years (18 percent and 23 percent respectively, during 2006-10). To
12

Given that much of this investment has already taken place, the likelihood of a significant
pick up in production is high.

- 15 enhance the poverty-reducing qualities of economic growth, however, it is important to also
develop more labor intensive sectors. As discussed in the NDP, the authorities have outlined an
alternative pro-poor growth scenario that, with a scaling up of donor assistance, includes greater
infrastructure investment to support agriculture and manufacturing (mainly processing of
agricultural and mining products) and extend growth opportunities to small and medium-sized
enterprises (Box 4). The authorities agreed that sustained macroeconomic stability is essential
for creating an environment conducive to savings and investment. Moreover, as recognized in
the NDP, it is vital to pursue the reform agenda under the Private Sector Development Initiative
(PSDI) and the Financial Sector Development Plan (FSDP) aimed at removing impediments to
doing business and expanding access to credit.
17.
Low inflation, anchored on a prudent fiscal policy, is critical for attaining higher
rates of economic growth. The authorities remain committed to lowering inflation to single
digits by 2007, supported by a reduction in government’s domestic borrowing (see
memorandum of economic and financial policies (MEFP)). With growth in broad money
consistent with inflation of 5 percent a year, the attenuation in government borrowing would
allow for a robust expansion of bank credit to the private sector, while simultaneously achieving
a gradual buildup in international reserves (to about 3 months of imports by 2010). The
authorities emphasized that extraordinary expenditures related to the constitutional review and
referendum in 2007-08 constrain the scope for a greater reduction in government net domestic
financing and a greater accumulation of international reserves.
A. Fiscal Policy
18.
In the years ahead, fiscal policy will be guided by the need to achieve and
maintain macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability. The LIC DSA shows that under
projected fiscal deficits, the debt burden indicators, which are already well below the relevant
thresholds in 2005, would decline further. While this suggests that Zambia has considerable
room to run larger fiscal deficits over the medium term (by over 3 percentage points of GDP), if
it aimed to simply stabilize debt relative to GDP, the authorities and staff agreed that the scope
for using that room is very limited. Higher fiscal deficits financed by domestic borrowing would
sustain inflation pressures and crowd out credit to the private sector. Moreover, under standard
alternative scenarios and stress tests, the projected debt dynamics are less favorable than in the
baseline scenario, which builds on the successful fiscal adjustment that Zambia has undertaken
in recent years and incorporates the authorities’ objective of limiting domestic financing to
½ percent of GDP a year over the long term. In particular, in a scenario in which key variables,
including real GDP growth and the primary balance, are set at their historical averages, and the
resulting financing requirement is met by additional domestic borrowing, the debt burden
indicators deteriorate significantly—for instance, the cost of servicing public debt doubles over
the next ten years to 25 percent of revenue.

- 16 -

Box 4. Macroeconomic Effects of Scaling Up of Donor Assistance
A significant scaling up of donor assistance would be required to finance the “core” alternative policy scenario
being developed for the NDP, which envisages a strong expansion of government programs in rural infrastructure,
health services, and education. In this scenario, annual donor inflows would increase by US$70 million (about
1 percent of GDP) a year during 2006–10,1 before leveling off at US$350 million a year above baseline projections.
The increased assistance is expected to be in the form of grants. Additional resources would also be available from
the MDRI, which would peak at just over US$150 million in 2010.
Staff estimates that the projected rise in donor assistance and government spending over the next 5 years would
provide a substantial stimulus to the Zambian economy (Table). Real GDP growth would rise to an average
6½ percent a year, as shortages of skilled labor, particularly health workers, would dampen the effect of the
stimulus. The additional supply of foreign exchange, much of which would be sold by the BoZ to mop up injections
of liquidity from higher government spending, would create modest appreciation pressures on the Zambian kwacha
and contribute to a widening of the trade deficit in goods and services. Higher reserve accumulation would be
desirable, given the greater dependence on donor support. To achieve this goal the authorities would need to issue
additional government securities (less than ½ percent of GDP a year) to help mop up liquidity.
The positive impact on growth would extend over the longer term, as productivity increases from greater
infrastructure investment and, with a longer lag, the higher spending on education and health. Real GDP growth is
projected to remain at about 6½ –7 percent beyond 2010, while export growth would pickup substantially.

To avoid a renewed build up of unsustainable external debt, the government is
committed to a prudent borrowing policy and to strengthening its debt management
capacity. While the LIC DSA framework suggests that Zambia could have considerable scope
for new external borrowing, Zambia’s debt sustainability could be vulnerable in certain
circumstances, in particular, in case of a strong negative shock to exports. The staff agreed with
the authorities that this vulnerability and Zambia’s past record on external debt management
suggest caution regarding new external borrowing, whether on concessional terms or not. These
considerations also underscore the need for Zambia to strengthen its external debt management
capacity. The authorities noted that the government would continue to seek loans on
concessional terms, and adhere to the general principle underlying its external borrowing
strategy: that new loans be on terms aligned with the country’s repayment capacity.
Furthermore, consideration would have to be given to absorptive capacity and the need to
further strengthen PEM systems to ensure effective use of public resources. Indeed, donors have
made any scaling up of budget support contingent on good execution of PEMFA reforms. With
regard to debt management capacity, since 2004, the government has been implementing a debt
reform and capacity building program with support from the World Bank under the PEMFA
project. In the initial phase, the focus has been on strengthening the back office function at the
Ministry of Finance and National Planning. However, the objective is to have in place a
comprehensive debt management strategy by 2006.
20.
A reduction in government domestic borrowing will continue to anchor the
macroeconomic stabilization effort, and is needed to give the macroeconomic framework
credibility in light of entrenched expectations of high inflation. The medium-term fiscal
framework envisages a reduction in government domestic borrowing to 1.6 percent of GDP in
2006, 1.0 percent in 2007, and 0.5 percent in 2008. This consolidation will be achieved while
reorienting expenditures towards pro-poor growth programs, especially in the areas of
infrastructure, development of agriculture, education, and health. Particular attention will also
be paid to the payment of domestic arrears.
21.
The overall objective of the government’s tax policy is to have a broad-based tax
system that raises revenue in an equitable and efficient way. In this respect, certain features
of the current system will undergo a comprehensive review in 2006: the progressivity of the tax
system; the relatively low yield from VAT; the narrow personal income tax base; and the extent
and scope of tax incentives, especially in the mining sector.13 Red tape in tax administration will
also be a focus of attention. Efforts will also be directed to improving tax administration
through the establishment of performance targets for the Zambia Revenue Authority. The staff
further proposed a review of the structure and performance of nontax revenue, as the levels of
fees and charges have been eroded by inflation and enforcement has been poor. Government
revenue is projected to rise gradually to around 18½ percent of GDP.

13

In November 2005, an FAD technical assistance mission visited Lusaka to advise on taxation
and royalty rates in the mining sector.

- 18 22.
Stronger economic growth, increased external assistance, and reduced servicing
costs for both domestic and external debt should provide fiscal space for increased
spending on infrastructure, health, education, and other PRPs. Based on current
commitments, donor support is projected to increase by about US$30 million a year over the
medium term, while annual debt relief under the HIPC Initiative will average about
US$130 million a year. Falling domestic interest payments (relative to GDP) would be a source
of budget savings. The strengthening of budget planning and execution, however, is essential
for achieving public sector efficiencies and sustainable savings. Moreover, donor assistance,
primarily in the form of grants, could increase substantially in the event of strong progress with
the PEMFA reforms and the implementation of a well-designed NDP, further increasing the
scope for spending on the PRPs.
23.
The public pension system is insolvent and poses a serious risk to the public
finances. The two public sector schemes—the Public Service Pension Fund (PSPF) and the
Local Authorities Superannuation Fund (LASF)—are both insolvent, with actuarial deficits
equivalent to about 9 percent of GDP. However, both are owed considerable amounts in
contribution arrears. The other pension fund, the National Pension Scheme Authority (NAPSA),
which is the largest of the funds, is solvent but faces challenges with respect to capacity
building in asset management. A financial reform program for PSPF and LASF has been
prepared. Reform is likely to be contentious, however, since the benefit levels in these schemes
are high relative to contributions and protected in the constitution.14 To ensure that over the
medium term (while the reform of the public pension system is being implemented) adequate
resources will be available to meet the government’s obligations on the cash-flow deficit of the
PSPF, the PRGF program includes additional budget allocations (0.3 percent of GDP in 2006)
for paying down the outstanding arrears on the government’s contributions to the PSPF.
24.
In a significant step forward in the area of budget planning, the MTEF for 2006–08
explicitly allocates substantial resources to clear outstanding domestic arrears and meet
forthcoming contingent liabilities, most notably statutory obligations associated with the
projected cash flow deficit in the public sector pension fund (PSPF). The PSPF is projected
to incur cash-flow deficits on the order of ½ percent of GDP a year over the foreseeable future.
Paying down outstanding arrears on government contributions to the PSPF (estimated at about
1¼ percent of GDP in 2005) would mostly cover the deficit over the MTEF’s horizon, but a

14

The World Bank has the lead role in the reform of the pension system. The Economic
Management and Growth Credit has two credit release milestones for the second tranche
(December 2005). These are: One, Cabinet approval of (i) a proposal to the Constitutional
Review Commission to change the relevant articles in the constitution to enable PSPF reforms
to be applicable to existing participants in PSPF, and (ii) a reform program that ensures the
financial sustainability of PSPF. Two, requesting that NAPSA has (i) adopted a revised
investment policy, appointed a global custodian, and selected a pension fund manager;
(ii) drafted an operations manual on corporate governance; and (iii) developed a program for
training trustees. The World Bank staff has concluded that satisfactory progress has been made
in both of these milestones. The World Bank is also providing technical assistance to Zambia on
pension reform.

- 19 comprehensive reform of the PSPF is needed to achieve longer-term solvency. Moreover, the
government is taking steps to identify and quantify all such pension obligations.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
25.
Going forward, staff and the authorities agreed that the inflation outlook is more
benign but saw the need for monetary policy to remain appropriately tight. In particular,
the supply-side pressures on prices experienced in 2005 were likely to dissipate. However, there
was also agreement that expectations of high inflation are entrenched and that policy needs to
remain sufficiently firm until inflation assumed a clearly downward trend. The authorities
restated their commitment to reduce inflation to single digit over the medium term while
recognizing the need to improve the implementation of policy. In this regard, to improve
liquidity management, coordination between the MoFNP and the BoZ is being strengthened,
including by improving the coverage and timeliness of data on government fiscal operations and
improving the liquidity forecasting framework. Furthermore, the Bank of Zambia has submitted
to the Constitutional Review Commission proposed changes to the Constitution to enhance the
operational independence of the central bank.
26.
Staff and the authorities concurred that while the banking sector remained
generally sound, lending portfolios would continue to be closely monitored. Staff cautioned
that the strong growth of private sector credit, especially since 2004, called for greater scrutiny
of lending standards and close monitoring of the quality of assets in light of the rise in NPLs. In
response, the authorities indicated that appropriate remedial actions had been mandated where
warranted and that progress had been made in all cases. They observed that the surge in
household credit carried relatively moderate risk as it was generally in the nature of assetbacked lending. In addition, the BoZ has increased the number of on-site inspections and is
moving toward adopting risk-focused supervision, to enhance the effectiveness of available
resources.
27.
The authorities remain committed to a flexible exchange rate regime. The foreign
exchange market in Zambia was substantially liberalized in 1992-95, and since 2003, the
exchange rate of the kwacha is determined in the interbank market. The Bank of Zambia only
intervenes in the interbank market to smooth temporary fluctuations in the exchange rate and to
meet international reserve objectives. Staff concurred that this regime is appropriate for Zambia.
28.
The authorities were cognizant of the potential impact of a large, sustained
appreciation in the real effective exchange rate on the international competitiveness of
nontraditional exports and domestic manufacturers. They felt, however, that it would
neither be feasible nor appropriate for the Bank of Zambia to attempt to resist an appreciation of
the currency brought about by a fundamental improvement in the country’s external prospects
and the resulting changes in market sentiment. The staff concurred, but noted that the monetary
program provided some scope for leaning against the wind in the foreign exchange market to
dampen the strong appreciation of the kwacha and buildup reserves. The authorities remarked
that the Bank of Zambia’s ability to engage in sterilized intervention is limited and can be
costly, while nonsterilized foreign exchange purchases would conflict with the overriding

- 20 objective of bringing inflation under control through tight monetary policy. 15 Staff suggested
that the authorities consider coordinating domestic financing operations and Bank of Zambia
foreign exchange purchases to achieve the effect of sterilization. An important question was the
degree to which the recent appreciation would be sustained. The authorities and staff agreed that
exchange rate developments should be closely watched.
C. External Sector Policies
29.
The government’s external sector objectives are to sustain a viable current account
balance, improve the international competitiveness of the economy, and maintain a
sustainable external debt position. In the authorities’ view, export growth is key to a viable
current account balance and productivity growth is key to improved international
competitiveness. Although the mining sector will continue to make a large contribution to
exports over the medium and long run, especially with the reinvestments in the Copperbelt
mines and the opening of new mines in the Northwestern province, Zambia’s export
development strategy will remain focused on diversification away from copper. The
government, therefore, remains committed to an open trade regime that is supportive of export
development and diversification of the economy. Zambia is a member of regional trading
arrangements—COMESA and SADC—and the WTO. To derive meaningful benefits from these
arrangements, Zambia will continue to push for improved market access while simultaneously
addressing supply side constraints and improving the competitiveness of domestic economic
activities. Regarding potential moves toward a COMESA customs union, the authorities are
following discussions on the harmonization of the COMESA and SADC common external
tariffs. Staff expressed support for the broad orientation of the authorities’ external policies.
30.
Drawing on a recent Diagnostic Trade Integration Study, the authorities have
incorporated a number of export promoting trade policy measures into the MTEF and
NDP. Key priorities in trade policy that would help remove impediments to export growth
include: (i) making export incentives work for exporters, including through the streamlining of
procedures for the duty drawback scheme and improved management of bonded warehouses
and RIB (removal in bond), and the establishment of an accessible and affordable export
financing facility; (ii) improving trade facilitation, including through greater efficiency in
customs administration and strengthened standards and certification services; (iii) strengthening
export-oriented investment promotion and export promotion functions; and (iv) strengthening
capacity to formulate and implement trade policy and negotiate trade agreements.
D. Structural Reforms
31.
The authorities and staff agreed that macroeconomic stability is necessary but not
sufficient to achieve sustained high growth and must be complemented by a broad set of
structural reforms to: (i) improve the business and investment climate; (ii) enhance the
delivery of public services and the provision of infrastructure; (iii) strengthen expenditure and
financial accountability; (iv) develop the financial sector and improve access to credit; and
15

In July, relatively large foreign exchange purchases proved difficult to sterilize and caused
reserve money to spike well above the program path.

- 21 (v) reduce government’s direct involvement in commercial activities and promote competition
and improve the efficiency of state-owned enterprises. Reforms in many of these areas are
already ongoing in the context of the Public Sector Reform Program (PSRP, which includes the
PEMFA reforms), the Financial Sector Development Plan (FSDP), and the Private Sector
Development Initiative (PSDI), but require speedier implementation.
32.
The authorities are convinced that progress on the implementation of the PEMFA
reform is critical for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public service and that
sufficient confidence in the budget planning, execution, and monitoring systems is a
prerequisite for any substantial increase in donor assistance. The authorities explained that
they have followed a two-pronged approach, namely, strengthening current systems
(computerizing the existing financial management system, strictly enforcing the commitment
control system, rigorously implementing the cash-flow framework), while developing new
systems (initiation of an integrated financial management and information system (IFMIS)). In
addition, under the PEMFA reform, public finance management, payroll management, debt
management, and transparency are targeted for major improvements. While acknowledging that
significant progress has been made in the past year in strengthening PEM systems, staff noted
that progress in some areas had been slow. The authorities remarked that capacity constraints,
including analytical capacities, particularly in line ministries, remain a major challenge but are
being addressed with the support of development partners.
33.
Financial sector policies are focused on expanding financial intermediation and
access to financial services both in urban and rural areas. This involves developing a wellfunctioning micro and rural financial system, developing broad and deep primary and secondary
bond markets, and strengthening banking and nonbanking financial institutions. While progress
has been made in these areas in the past year, the staff stressed the importance of accelerating
progress toward the resolution of state-owned financial institutions. The authorities noted that
after having suffered a number of setbacks in recent years, the privatization of ZNCB was
moving forward. In October 2005, the Zambia Privatization Authority (ZPA) chose a wholly
owned subsidiary of Rabobank of the Netherlands as the preferred bidder for a 49 percent stake
in ZNCB. However, this decision was subsequently challenged in court by a rival bidder and
discussions between ZPA and Rabobank have been ordered suspended. Staff also stressed the
importance of quickening the implementation of measures to broaden access to credit, in
particular, the establishment of a credit reference bureau.
34.
The PSDI aims to remove impediments to business activity and investment, such as
excessive licensing requirements and regulations, poor delivery of utility services, and
restrictive laws on labor and land ownership. Objectives include the creation of a “One-StopShop” for business investment and the liberalization of the telecommunication gateway. The
PSDI got off to a slow start; however, with the recent formation of a PSD steering committee
and secretariat the pace of the reform program should quicken.
35.
The focus of the parastatal reform program over the next two to three years will be
on improving the operations of the utilities in the energy and telecommunication sectors,
namely ZESCO and ZAMTEL. The strategy being followed is that of commercialization. The
process of commercialization of ZESCO began in 2004 and is expected to be completed in
2006. As part of the process, ZESCO began operating under a new business plan on April 1,
2005. ZESCO’s management has proposed a large investment agenda that would increase

- 22 generation capacity three-fold over the next 10 years at a projected cost of about US$11½ billion.16 In addition to meeting a rapidly growing domestic demand, ZESCO would be
prepared to become a major exporter to the region. An evaluation of ZESCO’s
commercialization will take place following the completion of the first fiscal year under the
plan. With regard to ZAMTEL, reform should aim to open up the gateway, facilitate entry of
new providers, and ensure the effective management and regulation of the sector.
III. THE PRGF-SUPPORTED PROGRAM
Performance under the PRGF program has been broadly satisfactory. Quantitative program
targets and structural performance criteria and benchmarks have generally been met. Progress
toward the piloting of IFMIS continues to encounter delays, however. In the interim, the current
financial management system is being strengthened. The program for 2006 incorporates a
roughly unchanged overall fiscal deficit—but with a modest reduction in domestic financing—
while increasing spending on poverty reducing programs and addressing pension arrears. The
program targets an end-year inflation rate of 10 percent and a slight build up in international
reserves. The structural program builds on the 2005 program in seeking to strengthen public
expenditure and debt management, financial sector development, and governance and
transparency.
A. Performance Under the Program
36.
Performance under the PRGF-supported program has been broadly satisfactory.
Continuous performance criteria have been observed. All quantitative performance criteria and
indicative targets, for June 2005, the test date for the third review, were met and all but one
were met for September 2005 (MEFP, Table 1). The September ceiling on government net
domestic financing was narrowly exceeded (by K 17 billion or 0.05 percent of GDP), owing to
outlays for emergency food relief and higher-than-anticipated expenditures on preparations for
elections and the constitutional review exercise. The authorities have requested a waiver for the
nonobservance of this performance criterion, based on the minor nature of the breach and efforts
to contain government net domestic financing to within program limits for the year as a whole.
37.
On the structural side, both performance criteria were observed and, despite some
delays, all but one of the benchmarks were implemented (MEFP, Table 2). With respect to
the missed benchmark—the issuance of new regulations and revised accounting manuals for the
new Finance Act—revised manuals are being prepared based on draft regulations proposed by
an IMF-sponsored expert and should be available for review in December.
38.
The authorities continue to make progress in resolving the two claims by
commercial creditors that are in arrears. Agreement has been reached with one of the
creditors on a reduced repayment schedule, while the second claim is in litigation in commercial
court in London. The authorities are actively seeking to ascertain the validity of this claim,
which originated in a debt to the Romanian government, to facilitate its settlement. Neither of

16

To ensure ZESCO’s independent commercial operations, the Government will not on-lend or
guarantee external credits to ZESCO.

- 23 these claims poses a risk to Zambia’s adjustment effort. The staff is of the view that the
authorities are making a good faith effort to settle its external commercial arrears.
B. Proposed Modifications to the Program
39.
The authorities have requested two modifications to the PRGF-supported program.
First, the authorities request that the end-December 2005 ceiling on net domestic financing be
adjusted upward by up to K120 billion (0.3 percent of GDP) for the sole purpose of clearing a
greater amount of domestic arrears to road contractors than initially budgeted (MEFP, para. 8).
Combined with available budgetary resources, the additional borrowing (through the issuance of
government securities) would clear the bulk of the arrears, depending on the discounts obtained
from the contractors. The authorities established transparent procedures for seeking discounts
from, and making payments to, the contractors. Staff supports this request. Clearance of the
arrears would facilitate the issuance of new contracts for critical infrastructure projects and
improve fiscal transparency. The operation is not expected to significantly crowd out bank
credit to the private sector.
40.
The authorities also seek to reschedule the initiation of the IFMIS pilot to
September 2006. Ensuring compliance with the PEMFA/World Bank procurement guidelines
in tendering the contract for the installation of IFMIS has, however, resulted in additional
delays.17 The contract has been retendered and selection of preferred bidders is expected to be
completed in December 2005. It will thus not be feasible to meet the end-January 2006
performance criterion on the piloting of IFMIS. Rather, it is expected that a contractor can be
selected and negotiations concluded by the second quarter of 2006. In the meantime, the
authorities continue to install the infrastructure required by IFMIS and to strengthen the existing
financial management system (FMS), including its computerization in all line ministries, the
provinces, and government agencies and the production of monthly reports on budget execution,
using activities-based budgeting (ABB) classification applied to the FMS.
C. Program for 2006
41.
In keeping with the authorities’ medium-term objectives, as set out in the MTEF
and draft NDP, the program for 2006 aims to promote macroeconomic stability and
achieve robust economic growth.18 Real GDP is expected to grow by 6 percent, with the
agricultural sector rebounding and mining output expanding markedly as the recent investments
in the sector come on stream. The overall fiscal deficit is projected to remain roughly unchanged
(2.6 percent of GDP), but domestic financing would be reduced modestly (1.6 percent of GDP)

17

In June 2005, the Executive Board agreed to move the test date on the piloting of IFMIS from
end-June 2005 to end-January 2006 and indicated that the performance criterion on the report of
a preliminary review of IFMIS would be set in the context of the third program review.

18

The MTEF, which was approved by cabinet in November, serves as background to the 2006
budget proposal that is scheduled to be submitted to parliament in late January 2006. Parliament
is expected to approve the budget by end-March 2006.

- 24 compared with the projected outcome for 2005.19 The budget allocation for the 2006 elections
has been cut by about two thirds with respect to the original estimate. To make room for this
spending, administrative costs will be trimmed and spending on nonpriority programs curtailed
or postponed. Transfers will increase by 0.9 percent of GDP, owing to an increase in statutory
pension payments, an increase in poverty-related transfer programs, and a reclassification of
some spending items. Sufficient resources will be allocated to achieve an increase of at least
½ percent of GDP in spending on poverty-reducing programs (PRPs). The budget provides
additional scope for hiring new teachers and retaining core health workers, while maintaining
the total government wage bill below 8 percent of GDP, and for the first time addresses the
problem of paying outstanding arrears to the Public Sector Pension Fund. Donor support of
1 percent of GDP will be channeled through sector wide approach (SWAP) grants to the health
and education sectors. In the area of infrastructure, capital expenditure on road development
will be increased by 0.3 percent of GDP. In the wake of HIPC debt relief, the authorities are
under pressure to cut taxes but they are committed to maintaining the ratio of tax revenue to
GDP at least at current levels. In the first half of 2006 an overall review of tax policy will be
undertaken, with the aim of broadening the tax base and rationalizing the tax system—the
structure of rates, deductions, incentives and targeted reliefs.
42.
Monetary policy will aim at reducing end-year inflation to 10 percent. The import
coverage of foreign reserves is expected to rise slightly, while the current account deficit
(excluding grants) is projected to narrow to 11 percent of GDP. The authorities remain
committed to a flexible exchange rate regime, and to implementing measures that will reduce
the cost of doing business in Zambia and expand and diversify the export base. External budget
support is conservatively estimated to decline somewhat in 2006 relative to 2005. Based on
commitments from donors under the Wider Harmonization in Practice (WHIP), external budget
support is estimated to be about 1.6 percent of GDP, with more than four fifths coming in the
form of grants. On the other hand, debt service charged to the budget is projected to decline to
about 1 percent of GDP, from 1.9 percent in 2005, not taking into account potential relief under
the MDRI. On this basis, the 2006 program is fully financed.
43.
The structural measures for 2006 build on the 2005 program and reflect the
priorities in the draft NDP. They seek to enhance public expenditure and debt management,
transparency, and budget execution through both strengthening existing systems (for example,
issuing regulations and new manuals for the new Finance Act and rules and procedures for
enforcement of the cash-flow framework, reporting on budget execution, and improving
government’s monitoring of its onlending activities and contingent external liabilities), as well
as implementing new systems (that is, IFMIS). The program includes follow-up measures for
resolving government-owned nonbank financial institutions, the establishment of a credit

19

The 2006 budget does not assume any debt-service relief under the MDRI. Potential savings
on debt service to the AfDF and IDA in 2006 that accrue directly to the budget are estimated to
be K 79 billion (0.2 percent of GDP), while savings on debt service to the Fund are estimated to
be K 97 billion (0.25 percent of GDP). The authorities will consult with the Fund on the
appropriate allocation of the savings on debt service at the time of the next review under the
PRGF arrangement.

- 25 reference bureau, and, in the area of private sector development, provide for an assessment of
ZESCO’s performance under commercialization.
D. Program Monitoring
44.
Implementation of the PRGF arrangement will continue to be monitored quarterly,
but the disbursement schedule will be converted to semi-annual disbursements that
correspond with program reviews. The fourth review of the program, which is expected to be
completed by May 2006, will be based on the performance criteria and benchmarks for endDecember 2005. The program for 2006 outlined in the MEFP sets quantitative benchmarks for
end-March and performance criteria and benchmarks for end-June, which will be the basis for
the fifth review expected to be completed by December 2006, and indicative targets for endSeptember and end-December 2006. At the time of the fourth review, the indicative targets will
be re-evaluated and set as benchmarks for end-September 2006 and performance criteria and
benchmarks for end-December 2006, which will be the basis for the sixth review expected to be
completed by May 2007. In line with the schedule set out in Table 4 of the MEFP, performance
criteria under the structural program will be part of the basis for completing program reviews.
Financing assurance reviews would be completed prior to each disbursement so long as external
arrears to private creditors remain outstanding.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
45.
Staff commends the authorities for maintaining a policy framework that has
enabled the economy to sustain robust growth in 2005, despite a number of adverse supply
shocks. Consolidation of the fiscal adjustment that began in 2004 and the tightening of
monetary policy have positioned Zambia to achieve greater macroeconomic stability and extend
its marked economic turnaround over the foreseeable future. The authorities’ main challenge
now is to seize the opportunity provided by debt relief and the prospect of rising external
assistance to build upon the recent improvement in economic performance and to substantially
reduce poverty. Sustained implementation of sound macroeconomic and structural policies will
be crucial to avoid a repeat of the “stop-go” pattern that emerged from Zambia’s faltering
structural reform efforts and uneven macroeconomic management in the 1980s and 1990s.
46.
Prospects are favorable for significantly lowering inflation in 2006 and achieving
single-digit inflation by 2007. Attainment of this goal would mark a historic breakthrough in
economic management in Zambia and would encourage financial intermediation, harmonious
labor relations, and investment. To break entrenched expectations of inflation, the monetary
authorities must maintain clear objectives for monetary policy. Close coordination of monetary
and fiscal policy is necessary to ensure that the monetary program is consistently implemented.
The staff welcomes the proposal to strengthen the operational independence of the BoZ.
47.
Increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector is critical for
reorienting spending toward priority poverty reducing programs and obtaining greater
donor support. Staff welcomes the efforts made to contain expenditures for the elections and
the constitutional review process in 2006 and 2007, thus permitting a further decline in
government borrowing while providing scope for increased spending on poverty reduction
programs.

- 26 48.
Progress has been made in advancing the reform agenda aimed at ameliorating
public expenditure management systems. This agenda has initially focused on developing and
implementing a monitoring and evaluation framework, strengthening budget execution, and
improving debt management. Introduction of IFMIS continues to encounter delays, however.
While these have been largely beyond the authorities control, the staff urges the authorities to
redouble efforts to prevent any further slippages. More generally, staff encourages the
authorities to press ahead with the comprehensive PEMFA reform, with a view to strengthening
existing financial management systems while introducing IFMIS in the coming years.
49.
The insolvent public pension system poses a serious risk to the public finances. Staff
urges the authorities to proceed expeditiously with reform of the pension system, and welcomes
the allocation of budgetary resources to paying outstanding arrears on government contributions
to the PSPF.
50.
A sound financial system is crucial to the authorities’ private sector-led growth
strategy. The authorities should follow through on the plans to resolve the financially troubled
nonbank financial institutions and ZNCB, improve financial sector supervision and regulation,
and also give priority to strategies aimed at increasing the flow of credit to small- and mediumscale enterprises.
51.
The flexible exchange rate policy has served Zambia well. The rapid growth of
nontraditional exports in recent years suggests that Zambia has maintained its international
competitiveness. In view of the recent real appreciation of the kwacha, brought on, at least in
part, by a fundamental improvement in Zambia’s longer term prospects, staff urges the
authorities to step up implementation of the structural reform agenda, which aims at increasing
both private and public sector productivity, removing impediments to business, and expanding
access to credit. Improving infrastructure is also critical for maintaining competitiveness.
Appreciation pressures also represent an opportunity for the BoZ to accumulate international
reserves more rapidly than planned.
52.
Debt relief has greatly improved Zambia’s external debt situation. Moreover, the
government is making good progress on improving its debt management capabilities. While
Zambia’s debt sustainability outlook is quite favorable, staff advises the authorities to exercise
caution when taking on new debt. In this regard, ZESCO investment plan, which could lead to
the accumulation of US$1-1½ billion of new debt, should be thoroughly scrutinized to assure
that Zambia reaps the maximum benefits of its hydroelectricity resources.
53.
While the economic outlook is broadly favorable, it is not without risks. Election
year pressures could threaten sound fiscal and monetary policies. In addition, Zambia remains
vulnerable to climatic and terms of trade shocks. Debt relief has eased the risk of insufficient
reserve coverage for meeting external debt service obligations. In this light, staff considers a
gradual course for building up international reserves to be appropriate.
54.
Staff recommends that the third review under the PRGF arrangement be
completed. Staff further recommends that Zambia be granted a waiver for the nonobservance of
one performance criterion for the sixth disbursement (based on performance under the
quantitative program through September 2005), in view of the minor nature of the breach and
the authorities’ commitment to meet the end-year target. The staff also recommends that the

- 27 performance criterion for end-December 2005 net domestic financing and the end-January 2006
criterion with respect to IFMIS be modified as requested and that the financing assurances
review be completed.
55.
Regarding the exchange restriction evidenced by the existence of external arrears, the
staff encourages the authorities to continue with their efforts to resolve the remaining arrears. It
is proposed that the next Article IV consultation will be held on the 24-month consultation
cycle, subject to the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles approved on July 15,
2002.

Sources: Zambian authorities; and Fund staff estimates and projections.
1/ Includes medical levy collection by the Zambia revenue Authority. In 2004, nontax revenues include K 62 billion of additional proceeds due to the reconciliation of government accounts.
2/ In 2005, project grants and loans are also funding current expenditures. In 2006-2008, project grants include specific grants in Health and Education sectors (SWAPs).
3/ Include purchases of goods and services, some allowances, and training expenses.
4/ In 2004, authorized expenditure of about 0.3 percent of GDP which could not be spent in 2004 due to late funding will be executed in 2005. For this reason,
projected domestic financing for 2005 is higher than programmed.
5/ Until 2003 at face value. From 2004 at cost value. Inconsistency in the past valuation of government securities has resulted in discrepancies with data from the banking system.
6/ From 2005, fiscal accounts identify poverty-reducing spending according to a wider definition consistent with the PRSP (MEFP, para. 14).
7/ Audited at end-June 2005 for K 593.5 billion by the Zambian authorities. It excludes the stock of statutory pension arrears, which was K 414 billion at end-September 2005.
8/ From 2004, at cost value. Includes bonds issued in 2001 in favor of BoZ (K 1,646 billion) and in 2002 in favor of the Zambia National Commercial Bank (K 248 billion).

APPENDIX I

December 9, 2005
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D. C.
Dear Mr. de Rato:
Since June 2004, the Government of Zambia has been implementing a financial and economic
program with support from the Fund under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF). The second review of the program was completed on April 8, 2005. The attached
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) and Technical Memorandum of
Understanding (TMU) reviews progress in implementing the program during 2005 and outlines
the policies that the Government of Zambia will pursue in 2006. In the context of the new
National Development Plan, scheduled to be launched in early 2006, the government’s
development strategy and policies will continue to focus on achieving high rates of pro-poor
economic growth through the maintenance of sustainable macroeconomic policies and
acceleration of the pace of structural reforms to support private sector growth, improve public
expenditure management and accountability and the delivery of public services, and enhance
competitiveness.
The Government requests the completion of the third review and the fifth and sixth
disbursements under the PRGF arrangement in the amounts of SDR 5.502 million each. With
regard to the sixth disbursement, the Government requests the IMF Executive Board to grant a
waiver for the nonobservance of the end-September 2005 performance criterion on net
domestic financing (NDF). The ceiling on NDF was breached by a small amount owing to
emergency outlays for food relief in drought-affected areas, and higher-than-programmed
expenditures on preparations for elections and the constitutional review process. The
Government is making every effort to contain its net domestic financing requirements within
program limits, in part, by soliciting additional external support for food relief.
The Government also requests two modifications to the program under the PRGF arrangement.
First, the Government requests an upward adjustment to the end-December 2005 ceiling on
NDF of up to K120 billion for the sole purpose of clearing domestic arrears to road contractors
and consultants. These additional resources, combined with available resources from the 2005
budget allocation for arrears and a supplementary allocation financed from identified
budgetary savings, would allow the Government to clear the bulk of the outstanding arrears to
road contractors. This would facilitate the completion of ongoing contracts and the
implementation of new contracts for essential infrastructure projects.
Second, the piloting of the Integrated Financial Management and Information System (IFMIS)
has encountered further delays owing to difficulties in the procurement process. The contract

- 44 -

APPENDIX I

for the installation of IFMIS had to be retendered after serious flaws with the preferred bidder
emerged. The time table for selecting the winning bidder, signing the contract, and piloting the
project is now expected to extend beyond that envisaged in the program. The Government thus
requests that the IMF Executive Board modify the end-January 2006 performance criterion on
the piloting of the IFMIS. The Government plans to undertake the piloting of the IFMIS by
end-September 2006. Notwithstanding this delay, the Government has continued to strengthen
current public expenditure management systems, including the computerized Commitment
Control System and the Financial Management System (FMS). Site preparations are also being
done at various ministries to facilitate the fast introduction of the IFMIS when it is ready for
implementation.
The Government believes that the policies set forth in the attached MEFP are adequate to
achieve the objectives of the program, but will take any further measures that may become
appropriate for this purpose. Zambia will consult with the IMF on the adoption of these
measures, and in advance of revisions to policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance with
Fund policies on such consultation.
The Government of Zambia authorizes the IMF to make this letter and attached memoranda
available to the public, including through the placement of these documents on the IMF
website, subject to the removal of market sensitive information, following the IMF Executive
Board conclusion of the review.
Sincerely yours,

Ng’andu P. Magande, MP
Minister of Finance and National Planning

APPENDIX I

ZAMBIA
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
of the Government of Zambia for 2006
I. Performance Under the Program Supported by the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) in 2005
1.
The Zambian economy has continued to perform well overall in 2005, although supplyside shocks have resulted in lower real GDP growth and higher inflation than was projected
under the program. Real GDP growth is projected to be 4.3 percent, compared with 5.0 percent
under the program (and 5.4 percent in 2004). A strong expansion in construction—driven by a
robust demand for housing and large-scale investment in the copper sector—and solid growth
in the tourism and cash crop sectors has been only partly offset by a drought-related shortfall in
maize production and a relatively weak performance in mining. Zambia’s copper production
capacity increased significantly with the start-up of the Kansanshi mine in 2005, however its
initial production was lower-than–expected. In addition, output growth in the sector was
weakened by a variety of temporary setbacks, including a serious mine accident, labor
disputes, and a fuel shortage caused by an extended shutdown of the country’s oil refinery
(Indeni). More broadly, Indeni’s production problems and the ensuing severe fuel shortages
disrupted activity throughout the economy during the second half of the year. Inflation has
increased somewhat during 2005, owing in part to strong pressure on food and fuel prices.
End-year inflation is expected to be 19.0 percent, compared with 17.5 percent in 2004 and the
program objective of 15 percent.
2.
Fiscal performance has been broadly satisfactory through September 2005.
Government revenue collection was above the program target, with buoyant tax revenue
collection largely offsetting a shortfall in nontax revenue. In October, to alleviate the impact of
the fuel shortages, the Government reduced import and excise duties on petroleum products for
the remainder of the year, which is expected to lower tax revenue by K 35 billion (about
0.1 percent of GDP). Nevertheless, for the year as a whole, revenues are expected to be in line
with the program target. Through September, total recurrent expenditure was lower than
programmed because of savings realized in domestic and external interest payments. However,
government has had to resort to a bridge loan from the BoZ to cover a recurring mismatch in
liquidity. Repayment of this loan and supplementary budget expenditures suggest a
significantly tighter fiscal position in the fourth quarter of the year.
3.
The growth of broad money has decelerated steadily, in line with the objectives
of containing inflation pressures. On a year-on-year basis, the increase in broad money
declined from 30.2 percent in December 2004 to 9.1 percent in August 2005. Owing largely to
the difficulty in coordinating the management of liquidity, progress in slowing down the
growth of reserve money was uneven. The control of liquidity was complicated by the sharp
reduction by commercial banks of their holding of foreign assets to avoid balance sheet losses
associated with the appreciation of the kwacha.

- 46 -

APPENDIX I

4.
On the external side, record high world copper prices and expanding non-traditional
exports of goods and services, including tourism, have contributed to strong growth in export
receipts. Imports have grown even more strongly, in part because of high world petroleum
prices and strong investment activity in the mining sector. On balance, however, the current
account deficit (including grants) is expected to widen from 5.4 percent of GDP in 2004 to
6 percent in 2005. External budget support is expected to double between 2004 and 2005, to
US$134 million, or 1.9 percent of GDP.
5.
All quantitative PRGF program targets were met for June and all but one for
September (Table 1). Of note, the floor on gross international reserves and the ceiling on net
domestic assets of the Bank of Zambia (BoZ) were met by wide margins. The ceiling on
government domestic financing was met by a comfortable margin in June, owing to a delay in
the conclusion of wage negotiations with public sector labor unions, but it was narrowly
missed in September. Similarly, the Government’s wage bill was well below the benchmark
ceiling for June, while the September benchmark was met by a narrower margin.1
6.
Under the structural program, both performance criteria were observed and,
despite some delays, most benchmarks were implemented (Table 2). In August, the
Investment and Debt Management Department (IDM) of the Ministry of Finance and National
Planning (MoFNP) produced the first quarterly update of debt-service projections based on the
validated end-second quarter debt stock. Also, the Government continued to refrain from
extrabudgetary expenditures that were not legally binding. In August, a list of supplementary
expenditures (of about 0.5 percent of GDP) was approved by Cabinet. These expenditures,
which included supplementary spending on emergency food relief, were limited to resources
available from the contingency account and identified budgetary savings—mainly lower-thanbudgeted interest payments on domestic and external debt. While there have been delays, all
but one of the measures related to Public Expenditure Management and Financial
Accountability (PEMFA) were implemented. With regard to the outstanding measure, new
financial regulations and revised accounting manuals for the new Finance Act are being
prepared and are expected to be issued by end-March 2006. The quarterly report on budget
execution was published in a timely manner, but it was incomplete because some ministries
had not yet provided the necessary information. All ministries have since reported.
7.
In the financial sector, the government adopted the Bank of Zambia’s (BoZ)
proposed action plan for the Zambia National Building Society (ZNBS) in August, and the
National Savings and Credit Bank (NSCB) and Development Bank of Zambia (DBZ)
submitted initial drafts of their plans for incorporation under the Companies Act to the BoZ in
April and May, respectively. The BoZ is working with the NSCB, DBZ, and Government (the
principal shareholder), to finalize the action plans, including necessary resource allocations in
the 2006 budget. The amendments to the acts governing the building societies, NSCB, and
1

Agreements were reached in June 2005, which provided for a 25 percent wage increase
retroactive to April 1, 2005, and 13 percent effective April 1, 2006. The wage bill in 2005 is
expected to slightly exceed budget projections.

- 47 -

APPENDIX I

DBZ, which align these acts with the Banking and Financial Services Act and gives the BoZ
clear supervisory responsibility for these institutions, were enacted in October. Furthermore,
the Zambia Privatization Agency (ZPA), has selected Rabobank as the favored bidder for a
controlling 49 percent stake in the Zambia National Commercial Bank (ZNCB) and
negotiations are expected to begin before the end of the year. The Government will make
another 25.8 percent of the shares in ZNCB available for purchase by the general public
through the Stock Exchange.
II. Proposed Modification to the Program for 2005
8.
While fiscal and monetary developments have largely been in line with program
objectives through the first three quarters of the year, the Government may exceed the
end-year program ceiling on domestic financing in order to pay down a larger amount of
arrears to domestic road contractors and consultants (RCCs) than envisaged in the
budget. Re-establishing a good payments record with the RCCs is essential to assure the
smooth implementation of road development, which is a key element of the draft National
Development Plan (NDP) and for reducing poverty. The Government intends to borrow up to
K 120 billion (0.3 percent of GDP) through the issuance of government securities during the
fourth quarter that will be combined with other available budgetary resources for immediate
payment of the bulk of these outstanding arrears.2 Government will seek significant discounts
in the claims to be paid off and the selection of RCCs to be paid will be done in a transparent
manner. Given the availability of credit in the banking system and the demand for government
securities from the non-bank public, the issuance of additional government securities is not
expected to greatly impinge upon credit to the private sector. Government therefore will seek
an adjustor to the December 2005 program ceiling on its domestic financing of up to
K 120 billion for the sole purpose of clearing arrears beyond the amount possible with
currently available resources.3
III. Medium-Term Objectives
9.
In line with the forthcoming National Development Plan (NDP), expected to be
finalized in early 2006, and the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF),
Government aims to implement a macroeconomic policy framework and an agenda of
structural reforms that will support strong economic growth and a substantial reduction
in poverty. While the NDP considers policy alternatives to accelerate growth and poverty
reduction, which would require additional resources, the MTEF is based on current projections

2
3

Arrears to road contractors and consultants stood at K 298 billion as of end-March 2005.

The adjustor is defined in paragraph 7 of the technical memorandum of understanding.
Available resources amount to K 108 billion from a budget allocation of K 35 billion and
identified savings of K 73 billion.

- 48 -

APPENDIX I

and resource commitments. Under this current scenario for the MTEF period, 2006–2008,
Government aims to:
•

Achieve real GDP growth of 6 percent a year;

•

Bring down end-year inflation to 10 percent in 2006 and 5 percent in 2007 and 2008;

•

Reduce domestic borrowing to 1.6 percent of GDP in 2006, 0.7 percent of GDP in
2007, and 0.5 percent of GDP in 2008 to strengthen the domestic debt position and
limit the crowding out of credit to the private sector;

•

Increase the coverage of official gross international reserves to at least 1.5 months of
imports in 2006, 1.8 months in 2007, and 2.2 months in 2008; and

•

Remain current with foreign debt service.

10.
Raising economic growth is a key government objective and a precondition for
poverty reduction. In addition to sound macroeconomic and financial policies, raising
economic growth to 6 percent a year would be supported by strong private sector investment,
an expansion of energy supplies, and pro-poor growth policies to encourage labor-intensive
sectors including small-scale mining, agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism. Recent and
ongoing large-scale investment in the copper sector is expected to greatly boost mining sector
output over the medium term, while strong growth in both residential and infrastructure
construction is expected to continue. Monetary policy—supported by prudent fiscal policy—
will focus on achieving price stability. External policies will be centered on maintaining a
liberal trade regime, while ensuring a competitive, expanded and diversified export base.
11.
The reduction in Government’s domestic borrowing over the medium term is the
anchor to Zambia’s macroeconomic stabilization effort. That reduction will be achieved by
gradually raising government revenues—by improving tax administration and widening the tax
base by further bringing in the informal sector into the tax base—while exercising strict
control on government expenditures. In addition, Government will explore the scope for
revising the taxation of mining, without violating existing agreements. Expected increases in
donor assistance, including in the form of budget support, would provide room for a greater
expansion of government spending. A strengthening of budget execution will not only be
critical to enable donors to increase budget support, but also to improve public sector service
delivery and investment. The government has a large outstanding stock of arrears to the Public
Service Pension Fund (PSPF). Over 2006-2008, about 1.5 percent of GDP will be allocated to
reducing the stock of pension arrears.
12.
The structural reform agenda is mainly aimed at increasing productivity.
Implementation of the Financial Sector Development Plan (FSDP) and the Private Sector
Development (PSD) action plan will be instrumental in addressing the main credit and
administrative constraints on the private sector in Zambia. The structural reform agenda will
also include measures to improve the quality, efficiency, cost effectiveness, and delivery of
public services. Increasing productivity in the public sector will rely on continued progress
with ongoing reforms to strengthen public expenditure management and financial

- 49 -

APPENDIX I

accountability (PEMFA), public service management, including rightsizing of the civil service,
and decentralization.
IV. The Program for 2006
A. Fiscal Policy
13.
A reduction in the Government’s net domestic financing to 1.6 percent of GDP
in 2006, while allocating sufficient resources to achieve an increase of at least ½ percent
of GDP in spending on PRPs, will be the anchor of the Government’s macroeconomic
stabilization effort.4 Government will conduct an overall review of tax policy during the first
half of 2006, with the aim of rationalizing the tax system and expanding the tax base. In this
context, Government is committed to maintaining revenues at a minimum of 17.5 percent of
GDP in 2006, which is the projected collection under current policies (that is, excluding the
temporary reduction in duties and excises on petroleum products). In addition, the Government
will explore options to increase revenues from the mining sector, without violating any
existing agreements.5 Any tax measures and business incentives that may be introduced during
the forthcoming budget deliberations will be accompanied by offsetting revenue measures. On
the spending side, Government will seek to contain expenditures associated with an election
year, including limiting spending on the general election itself in line with recent experience in
neighboring sub-Saharan African countries. In addition to the PRPs, other spending priorities
include (i) staying current with pension contributions and paying down outstanding arrears to
the Public Sector Pension Fund (PSPF); (ii) net recruitment of [2000] teachers and retention
of core health workers; (iii) financial restructuring of parastatals, including the NSCB and
DBZ; (iv) timely payment of current terminal benefits. Moreover, it will be important to ensure
that spending outcomes reflect budget intentions. In this regard, supplementary spending will
continue to be limited to the contingency account and identified additional budgetary
resources. The total wage bill in 2006 will respect the indicative ceiling of 8 percent of GDP.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
14.
The BoZ will maintain an appropriately tight monetary policy in 2006. Reserve
money growth will be held to 9.8 percent during the year, while broad money, defined to
include foreign currency deposits, is expected to expand by 14.3 percent.6 The monetary
authorities recognize that consistent implementation of the reserve money program is
necessary in order to curb entrenched expectations of high inflation. In this regard, a return to
4

Government net domestic financing in 2005 could reach 2.2 percent of GDP, if the adjuster
for clearance of arrears to road contractors and consultants is fully utilized.
5

The expiration at the end of March 2005 of the tax concessions given to Konkola Copper
Mines and new mining operations from Kansanshi Mines will increase the revenues from the
mining sector.
6

As measured using the program exchange rate.

- 50 -

APPENDIX I

normal conditions in the agriculture and fuel sectors would ease inflation pressures. The
monetary program is projected to accommodate an expansion of credit to the private sector of
about 20 percent in 2006. In addition, the BoZ expects to continue its buildup of gross
international reserves (to at least 1.5 months of imports).
15.
The Bank of Zambia has been successful in maintaining the growth of broad
money at below the target under the 2005 program. However, this has not been without
difficulty. In the face of, at times, significant upward pressure on the kwacha, the conduct of
policy required a balancing act that was not always successful in achieving of the monetary
policy objective. In particular, short-term interest rates came down noticeably in the first half
of the year and were increasingly negative in real terms. In the second half of the year, the
Bank of Zambia has been pursuing a more clearly tighter monetary stance consistent with the
objective of lowering inflation. The recent introduction of long term bonds, in part to help
define the yield curve, and efforts to foster the development of the interbank money market, as
spelled out in the draft NDP, will form the basis for strengthening the conduct of policy. Close
coordination between the BoZ and the MoFNP is important for improving liquidity
management and will be intensified. The Government also recognizes the need for operational
independence for the BoZ, if the BoZ is to successfully pursue the objective of price stability.
16.
The government remains committed to a flexible exchange rate regime. The
government is cognizant of the potential impact of exchange rate appreciation—caused by a
combination of rising export receipts, growing aid inflows, and actual and prospective debt
service relief—on the international competitiveness of nontraditional exports and domestic
manufacturers. However, competitiveness needs to be secured through the establishment and
maintenance of a business environment that is conducive to productivity growth. The
government is, therefore, committed to implementing measures—including under the FSDP
and the PSD action plan—that will reduce the cost of doing business in Zambia and contribute
to the expansion and diversification of the export base, as well as allow domestic
manufacturers to flourish.
C. External Prospects and Policies
17.
The external outlook for 2006 is favorable. Notwithstanding an anticipated easing of
copper prices from their record levels of 2005, metals exports are expected to rise by
11 percent, owing to stepped up production from Chambishi and Kansanshi mines.
Nontraditional exports, including tourism, are also expected to continue to record healthy
growth, resulting in total growth of goods and services exports of 10 percent in U.S. dollar
terms. The oil import bill is also likely to rise further as a result of continued high oil prices
and the need to restore inventories drawn down in 2005, including the possible initiation of a
strategic petroleum reserve to guard against temporary supply shocks. Total goods and services
imports are therefore projected to rise by 10 percent in U.S. dollar terms. On this basis, the
current account deficit (including grants) is projected to remain steady at about6 percent of
GDP in 2006.
18.
Somewhat lower external budget support is programmed for 2006 than was
received in 2005, while external debt service is projected to decline sharply. Based on

- 51 -

APPENDIX I

commitments from donors under the Harmonization in Practice (HIP) program, external
budget support is conservatively estimated to be US$121 million (1.5 percent of GDP), with
more than four-fifths in the form of grants. On the other hand, external debt service charged to
the budget is projected to decline to US$81 million (1 percent of GDP), from US$129 million
(1.9 percent of GDP) in 2005 with the full implementation of the debt-service relief under the
HIPC Initiative. On this basis, the program for 2006 is fully financed.
19.
The government is committed to an open trade regime that is supportive of export
development and diversification of the economy.
D. Structural Measures
20.
Structural reforms in 2006 will continue to focus on public expenditure
management and financial accountability (PEMFA), debt management, financial sector
development, and governance and transparency. These reforms are critical to support
macroeconomic stability and growth. Table 4 presents the specific measures proposed for
inclusion in the PRGF-supported program for 2006 as structural performance criteria and
benchmarks
Public Expenditure Management
21.
Important advances in the PEMFA reform program will be implemented in
2006. In addition to hiring a contractor for installation of and training for an integrated
financial management and information system (IFMIS), Government will take steps to
strengthen existing expenditure management systems. The Accountant General will issue rules
and procedures for implementing and enforcing the new cash management system and will
prepare reports for Cabinet on compliance with the commitment control system by ministry,
province, and spending agency. To enhance transparency with regard to proposed budgetary
allocations, starting with the 2006 budget, the MoFNP will issue summary tables using the
activities based budgeting classification and identifying poverty-reducing programs. To
strengthen planning and budget preparations the MoFNP will submit the initial draft of the
2007–2009 MTEF (“Green Paper”) to Cabinet by end-August 2006. Also, Government will
issue new regulations and revised accounting manuals for the new Finance Act by end-March
2006, which would improve procedures for treasury management at the MoFNP.
22.
Progress is being made toward implementation of IFMIS, albeit with some
delays. In line with the World Bank’s procurement guidelines, the Government has re-tendered
the contract for installation and training of IFMIS, including the piloting of the system in at
least three line ministries by end-September 2006. It is expected that a list of pre-qualified
bidders will be submitted to the World Bank in December 2005, and that negotiations with a
preferred contractor could be concluded by end-April 2006. However, this is a complex
process, involving a series of reviews by Government, bilateral donors, and the World Bank,
and is subject to delays. The Government anticipates that a report on the findings of a
preliminary review of the piloting exercise will be available by end-March 2007.

- 52 -

APPENDIX I

Debt Management
23.
The government will continue to strengthen its debt management capacity. With
the support of the World Bank, the government is implementing a multi-year debt management
reform and capacity building program. The initial focus of the program is on strengthening
back office functions in the IDM Department of the MoFNP. Major progress has been
achieved in the validation of the external debt database and the initiation of the preparation of
quarterly projections of debt service for the coming three years. The Government will validate
the stock of onlending agreements by end-June 2006, with a view to ensuring that these
agreements are effectively enforced, and will validate the stock of contingent external
liabilities by end-December 2006. The Government will also prepare by end-June 2006 an
annual report on external debt management operations during 2005. In addition, the IDM
Department will strengthen the data base on Government’s outstanding domestic obligations,
beginning with the quarterly reporting of outstanding obligations to the Public Service Pension
Fund (PSPF).
Financial Sector Development
24.
The government has continued to make progress in implementing the action
plans for the problem nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs). With the necessary legal
framework in place, the way is now clear to pursue the resolution options for which
preliminary work has been done. As regards the DBZ, the Government will, in accordance
with understandings reached with the World Bank, explore options for expanding the lending
resources of the DBZ in the light of the coming in of a new investor and the offer of a
substantial line of credit. The Government expects that progress in this regard will pave the
way for the registration of the DBZ under the Companies act and subsequent licensing under
the Banking and Financial Services Act. The Government remains firm in its commitment to
reduce its shareholding in the DBZ to 25 percent. As for the NSCB, the immediate tasks are to
conclude the ongoing account reconciliation exercise, and implement the bank’s Institutional
Development Plan (IDP) involving the installation of a new computer system, with the IFAD’s
assistance. It is expected that with the completion of the review of the IDP, IFAD will
formalize its participation in the bank and release funds to the NSCB. To this end Government
in September, paid in its counterpart funds to the NSCB. This will open the way for
registration and subsequent licensing of NSCB. Regarding the ZNBS, the Government has
made a decision on the resolution of the institution and the BoZ is working on the modalities
for its implementation. The resolution of the ZNBS will be effected by end-June 2006.
25.
A key element of the Government’s Financial Sector Development Plan is the
establishment of credit reference bureaux (CRB), to foster the availability of credit to
support growth. In this regard, the government will submit to cabinet a proposal for the legal
framework establishing a credit reference bureau. The BoZ has completed preliminary studies
and expects to issue interim guidelines for CRBs by the end of the year. These guidelines will
serve as the basis for regulating CRBs until a legal framework is established.
26.
Outstanding pension liabilities pose a significant risk to fiscal balances over the
medium term. With support and technical assistance from the World Bank, the Government
has initiated a pension reform aimed at providing sustainable benefits for retirees. In this

- 53 -

APPENDIX I

regard, Cabinet has approved a proposal to amend the constitution with the aim of ensuring the
financial sustainability of the pension system. At the same time, Government will ensure that
the investment and asset management capabilities are strengthened at the National Pension
Scheme Authority NAPSA. To address the anticipated cash flow deficit in the Public Service
Pension Fund, Government will paydown its outstanding balance on past contributions during
2006–2008.
Private sector development
27.
The Government has taken steps to accelerate the implementation of the Private
Sector Development Programme (PSDP). Most recently, following the fourth meeting of the
Zambian Investors Business Advisory Council (ZIBAC) in September 2005, the Ministry of
Labour and Social Security is preparing a reform proposal for Statutory Instruments Nos. 1
and 2 of 2002 on separation packages, aimed at reducing the burden of Zambia’s costly
terminal benefits. Also, the Ministry of Commerce, Trade, and Industry is preparing a cabinet
memorandum on the liberalization of the telecommunications international gateway. A
decision on the gateway is planned for early-December 2005. With the establishment of the
PSD Steering Committee, assisted by a dedicated programme coordinating unit, it is expected
that further progress will be achieved throughout the six areas of the PSDP: (i) reform of labor
regulations and laws; (ii) business facilitation and economic diversification; (iii) infrastructure;
(iv) local empowerment; (v) trade expansion; and (vi) policy environment and institutions.
28.
The electricity sector will play an integral role in supporting the country’s
economic growth in the years ahead, both through expanded production and
contribution to increasing productivity and competitiveness. At present, Zambia’s
electricity company (ZESCO), which is in the midst of implementing the first year of its
business plan as a commercialized government-owned company, is planning a number of
large-scale investments primarily to expand its generation and transmission capacity. Under
the plan, ZESCO would incur external debt obligations of about US$1.5 billion. For Zambia to
benefit from this expansion, without exposing the Government to potentially large liabilities,
ZESCO’s management must demonstrate the highest level of expertise in all aspects of the
electricity sector. Upon completion of its fiscal year ending March 31, 2006, ZESCO’s
management will provide all the necessary financial, technical, and managerial information to
the World Bank and the IMF for an assessment of ZESCO’s performance under the
commercialization process. The information will be provided by end-April 2006. Moreover, to
ensure ZESCO’s independent operations, the Government will not on-lend or guarantee any
external credits to ZESCO.
Strengthening data
29.
The Government will take steps to expand Zambia’s capacity to collect and report
quality economic data. At present, there are serious shortcomings in the data for the national
accounts, consumer price index, and the balance of payments. To strengthen the role of the
Central Statistics Office (CSO) in collecting and compiling data, the Minister of Finance and
National Planning will submit to Cabinet a proposal for the revision of the 1964 Census and
Statistics Act, with a view to reorganizing the CSO so as to make it more efficient and

- 54 -

APPENDIX I

effective. The CSO will also prepare a comprehensive strategy for improving its data
collecting and reporting services.
V. Technical Assistance Needs
30.
Over the past year, Zambia has received technical assistance from the IMF in the areas
of banking sector statistics, liquidity management, government finance statistics, legislation
governing nonbank financial institutions, public sector financial regulations, and tax policy for
the mining sector. It is expected that further technical assistance will be requested for followup on liquidity management and the payments system, public sector financial regulations, and
for training in reporting government finance statistics. In addition, the CSO will likely request
assistance on rebasing the consumer price index and the national accounts. When making these
requests, the Zambian authority will identify a senior officer who will oversee the technical
assistance and a counterpart team that will work directly with IMF staff and the technical
experts. The identified senior officer will also participate in the formulation of technical
recommendations and be responsible for their implementation.
VI. Program Monitoring
31.
Progress in implementing the PRGF-supported program will continue to be monitored
quarterly, with semi-annual reviews, based on the quantitative and structural performance
measures indicated in Tables 3 and 4. Performance criteria are now proposed through the end
of June 2006, as well as indicative targets through the end of December 2006. The fourth
review of the program, which is expected to be completed by May 31, 2006, will be based on
the performance criteria and benchmarks for end-December 2005. The fifth review of the
program, which is expected to be completed by December 15, 2006, will be based on the
performance criteria and benchmarks for end-June 2006. In addition, the government requests
modification of the performance criterion for end-December 2005 on the ceiling on net
government domestic financing, through the introduction of an adjustor related to clearance of
arrears to road contractors and consultants. The government further requests that the
performance criterion envisaging initiation of the piloting of IFMIS in at least three line
ministries by end-January 2006 be modified to envisage initiation by end-September 2006. The
quantitative and structural performance criteria and benchmarks are defined in the attached
technical memorandum of understanding.

Zambia: Technical Memorandum of Understanding for
The Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) Arrangement
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This memorandum sets out the understandings between the Zambian authorities and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding the definitions of the quantitative and structural
performance criteria and benchmarks for the program for 2006 supported by the PRGF
arrangement, as well as the related reporting requirements. The definitions are valid at the start
of the program, but may need to be revisited to ensure that the memorandum continues to reflect
the best understanding of the Zambian authorities and IMF staff to monitor the program. The
memorandum also introduces an adjustor on the end-2005 ceiling on net domestic financing
related to the clearance of arrears to road contractors and consultants (paragraph 7).
II. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AND BENCHMARKS:
DEFINITIONS AND DATA SOURCES
A. Net Domestic Assets (NDA) of the BoZ
2.
Net domestic assets (NDA) of the BoZ are defined as the monthly average (based on
daily data) of reserve money less net foreign assets calculated at Kwacha 4,550.0 per U.S. dollar
(program exchange rate).1 Reserve money consists of currency issued, required reserves on
Kwacha deposits, required reserves on foreign currency deposits (at the program exchange rate),
positive current account balances of banks with the BoZ, and deposits in the BoZ of non-central
government institutions. Net foreign assets of the BoZ are defined as gross international
reserves (defined below) plus any other foreign assets, including the US$25 million blocked
reserves at the former Meridien Bank (MBZ), minus foreign liabilities (defined below). The
Kwacha values are derived from the U.S. dollar values using the program exchange rate.
3.
Foreign reserve liabilities are defined as short term (one year or less in original maturity)
foreign currency-denominated liabilities of the BoZ to nonresidents and outstanding use of IMF
credit.
4.
The ceilings on NDA will be adjusted upward by the amount of the shortfall of balance
of payments support net of debt service as indicated in Table 3 (item 10) of the Memorandum of
Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), up to a maximum of US$20 million for the period
end-December 2005 to end-December 2006. External disbursements that occur anytime during

1

Unless otherwise defined, program exchange rates for 2006 between the U.S. dollar and other (nonKwacha) currencies will be equal to the end-September 2005 rates. The U.S. dollar/SDR rate for
program purposes is 1.4360. Any other assets (e.g. gold) would be revalued at their end-September 2005
market prices.

- 61 the month of the test date will be treated as if they were disbursed on the first day of the month.2
In the event of excess balance of payments support net of debt service, the ceiling on NDA will
be adjusted downward by 100 percent of the additional excess support. However, if part of the
excess support is used to reduce the stock of Treasury bills or bonds held by commercial banks
and the non-bank sector, then the programmed NDA will be adjusted upward by that amount. In
the event of implementation of the MDRI, the ceiling on NDA will be adjusted downwards by
100 percent of the amount of debt to the IMF that is cancelled. The Kwacha value of the
cumulative shortfall/excess will be calculated at the program exchange rate.
5.
The ceiling on NDA will be adjusted downward/upward to reflect decreases/increases in
the legal reserve requirements on deposits in commercial banks. The adjustor will be calculated
as the percent change in the reserve requirement multiplied by the actual amount of reserves
(Kwacha and foreign-currency denominated) at the end of the previous calendar month.
B. Net Domestic Financing (NDF)
6.
Net domestic financing is defined as the Central Government’s net borrowing from the
banking and non-banking sectors (See table 1).3 All government-issued securities will be
recorded at cost (face value less discount). NDF will be defined as:
(a)
the net position of the Government with commercial banks, including:
(i) Treasury bills; (ii) government bonds; (iii) loans and advances; less (iv) support to MBZ; and
(v) central government deposits (defined to include account balances under the authority of
controlling officers); plus
(b)
BoZ holdings of: (i) Treasury bills; (ii) government bonds; (iii) the Kwacha
bridge loan (overdraft facility); less (iv) the government’s position at the BoZ; and (v) the donor
suspense account; plus (vi) the long-term non-transferable security issued against the
government’s total indebtedness to BoZ as at end-2002.
(c)

Nonbank holdings will include: Treasury bills; and government bonds.

7.
The end-December 2005 ceiling on NDF will be adjusted upward by up to K 120 billion
solely for the purpose of clearance of government arrears to road contractors and consultants,
audited at end-March 2005 at K 298 billion, in excess of the K 108 billion provided for this
purpose in the 2005 budget allocation and a supplementary allocation financed from identified
budgetary savings.
8.
The NDF ceiling will be adjusted upward by the amount of the shortfall in balance of
payments support net of debt service as indicated in Table 3 (item 10) of the MEFP, up to a
2

This implies that, for purposes of monitoring the NDA, the targeted NDA will be increased by the
amount of the disbursement divided by the number of business days in the month and multiplied by the
number of business days from the beginning of the month to the day prior to the disbursement.

3

The Central Government includes all the administrations identified by the budget heads listed in the
2006 Yellow Book.

- 62 maximum of US$20 million for the period end-December 2005 to end-December 2006. In the
event of excess balance of payments support net of debt service, the ceiling on NDF will be
adjusted downward by 100 percent of the additional excess support. The ceiling on NDF will be
adjusted downward by 100 percent of the amount of debt-service payments foregone to IDA and
AfDF under the MDRI. The Kwacha value of the cumulative shortfall/excess will be converted
at the program exchange rate.
9.
The data source for the above will be the “Net Domestic Financing” Table produced by
the BoZ Economics Department, submitted on a weekly basis, and reconciled with the monthly
monetary survey.
C. Gross International Reserves of the BOZ
10.
Unless otherwise noted here, gross international reserves of the BoZ will be defined as
reserve assets of the BoZ (See Table 2). Reserve assets are defined in the IMF BOP manual (5th
edition) and elaborated in the reserve template of the IMF’s special data dissemination standards
(SDDS). They exclude, for example, foreign assets not readily available to or controlled by the
monetary authorities, and foreign currency claims on Zambian residents.
11.
Gross international reserves consist of (i) monetary gold; (ii) foreign currency in cash;
(iii) unencumbered foreign-currency deposits at non-resident banks; (iv) foreign securities and
deposits; (v) SDR holdings and Zambia’s reserve position with the IMF; and (vi) balances in the
BIS account related to debt service to Paris Club creditors. Gross reserves exclude nonconvertible currencies, pledged, swapped, or any encumbered reserve assets including but not
limited to reserve assets used as collateral or guarantees for third-party external liabilities,
commercial bank reserve requirements in foreign currency, and the US$25 million deposit in
MBZ (in liquidation).
12.
The floor on gross international reserves will be adjusted: (i) downward by the amount
in U.S. dollars of the shortfall in balance of payments support net of debt service as indicated in
Table 3 (item 10) of the MEFP, up to a maximum of US$20 million for the period endDecember 2005 to end-December 2006; (ii) upward by 100 percent of the cumulative excess
balance of payments support net of debt service. However, if part of the excess support is used
to reduce the stock of Treasury bills or bonds held by commercial banks or the non-bank sector,
then the programmed reserves buildup will be adjusted downward by that amount;
(iii) downward/upward for any shortfall/excess in the U.S. dollar value of disbursements from
the IMF under the PRGF arrangement; (iv) downward for any increase in BoZ short-term
foreign currency denominated debt (to residents and nonresidents), using the definition of shortterm debt below; and (v) upward by 100 percent of the amount of debt-service payments to the
IMF foregone under the MDRI.
13.
For the purpose of this target, as well as those for external debt and arrears, valuation
will be in U.S. dollars using the program exchange rate.
14.
Data on gross international reserves, including its components, will be reported by the
BoZ on a weekly and end-month basis.

- 63 D. External Payment Arrears
15.
The performance criterion on the non-accumulation of new external arrears is
continuous. Official external payment arrears are defined as unpaid debt service by the Central
Government and BoZ, beyond the due date and/or the grace period, if any. This definition
excludes arrears subject to rescheduling.
16.
Data on arrears are compiled jointly by the Ministry of Finance and National Planning
(MoFNP) and BoZ and will be reported by the MoFNP on a quarterly basis.
E. Official Medium- and Long-Term Concessional External Debt
17.
Official medium- and long-term concessional external debt is defined as all forms of
official debt with original maturity of more than one year contracted or guaranteed by the
Central Government and BoZ having a grant element of no less than 40 percent, but excludes
debts subject to rescheduling. The grant element is to be calculated by using currency-specific
commercial interest reference rates (CIRRs) reported by the OECD; for maturities of less than
15 years, the grant element will be calculated based on six-month averages of CIRRs, and for
maturities longer than 15 years, the grant element will be calculated based on 10-year averages.
Adjustment lending from the IMF will be excluded.
18.
This target applies not only to debt as defined in Point 9 of the Guidelines on
Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (Decision No. 12274-(00/85) of August 24,
2000; see Annex), but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not
been received. This excludes non-concessional loans stemming from the rescheduling of
external arrears.
19.
Detailed data on all new concessional and non-concessional debt contracted or
guaranteed will be provided by the MoFNP on a monthly basis.

F. Official External Short-Term Non-concessional External Debt
20.
Official external short-term non-concessional external debt is defined as the outstanding
stock of external debt with original maturity of less than one year owed or guaranteed by the
central Government or the BoZ. For this purpose short-term debt will include forward
commodity sales but will exclude normal trade credit for imports. There will be no new official
external short-term debt during the program period. The term “debt” has the meaning set forth
in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt
(Decision No. 12274-(00/85) of August 24, 2000; see Annex).
21.

The data will be reported by the MoFNP and BoZ on a monthly basis.
G. Domestic Arrears of Government

22.
Domestic arrears are defined as: (i) any bill that has been received by a spending
ministry from a supplier for goods and services delivered (and verified) and for which payment
has not been made within 30 days after the due date of payments; (ii) wage, salary and any

- 64 payment to government employees, including all forms of housing allowances, that were due to
be paid in a given month but remained unpaid on the 15th of the following month; and
(iii) interest or principal obligations which remain unpaid 30 days after the due date of payment.
Included in the quarterly program floors for payment of domestic arrears in 2006 is payment of
K 25 billion each quarter toward Government’s arrears on contributions to the Public Sector
Pension Fund.
23.
Information regarding domestic arrears is to be compiled through audits of the accounts
of spending Ministries and agencies, conducted by the Internal Audit division of the MoFNP.
The audits will be completed and data submitted to IMF staff by the Secretary of the Treasury
within six weeks of the end of each quarter.
H. The Central Government’s Wage Bill
24.
For the purposes of the wage bill, the definition of Central Government includes all
heads covered in the 2006 Yellow Book. The Central Government’s total wage bill will include
payments on wages, salaries, allowances, and all other items specified as personal emoluments
in the Yellow Book, and any direct or indirect payments of housing allowances to employees.
The Government will provide, on a monthly basis and by budget head, the following data:
(i) the number of all employees in the Central Government for each budget head; (ii) the basic
salary, the allowances and any other personal emoluments released during the month; (iii) the
arrears incurred during the month on the basic salary, on the allowances, and on any other
personal emoluments; (iv) the number of employees retrenched and the corresponding
retrenchment costs.
25.
All the data will be submitted to the IMF staff by the MoFNP within three weeks of the
end of each month.

- 67 ANNEX
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt
Excerpt from Executive Board Decision No. 6230-(79/140), as revised on August 24, 2000
9.
(a)
For the purpose of this guideline, the term “debt” will be understood to
mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through
the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires
the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services,
at some future point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest
liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being
as follows:
(i)
loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made
on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the
future (including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans and
buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to
fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the
funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the
buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and official swap
arrangements);
(ii)
suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the
obligor to defer payments until some time after the date on which the
goods are delivered or services are provided; and
(iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which
the lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time
that are usually shorter than the total expected service life of the property,
while the retains the title to the property. For the purpose of the guideline,
the debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease
payments expected to be made during the period of the agreement
excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair or maintenance
of the property.
(b)
Under the definition of debt set out in point 9 (a) above, arrears,
penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a
contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation
that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to
debt.

Safeguards Assessment:

Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Zambia (BOZ) is subject to an
assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement, which was approved on June 16, 2004 and is
scheduled to expire on June 15, 2007. A safeguards assessment of the BOZ was completed on
October 20, 2004.
The assessment identified certain weaknesses. The authorities have taken the following steps in
the light of the recommendations made:

(i) in December 2004, the BoZ’s board adopted the International Financial Reporting Standards
as the basis for financial reporting;
(ii) in December 2004, the BoZ’s board also adopted a policy for the appointment of external
auditors (three year-term appointment, renewable only once);
(iii) pending the approval of an amendment to the Bank of Zambia Act the BoZ and the MoFNP
have adopted a Memorandum of Understanding for the exclusion of unrealized gains from
profits available for distribution to government; and
(iv) the Finance Department of the BoZ and the Economics Department of the BoZ have

to the Fund. Reconciliation reports for the first two quarters of 2005 have been submitted to the
Fund.
(v) proposed amendments to the BoZ Act to strengthen the operational independence of the BoZ
have been submitted for consideration as part of the ongoing review of the country’s
constitution.
IX.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

The currency of Zambia is the kwacha. The exchange rate for the kwacha is determined in the
inter-bank foreign exchange market, in a managed float with no pre-announced path. On
August 31, 2005, the Bank of Zambia mid-rate was K 4,364 per U.S. dollar. On April 19, 2002,
Zambia accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Section 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of
Agreement. However, the Fund urged the authorities to eliminate the exchange restriction
evidenced by the accumulation of external payments arrears, which is subject to approval by the
Fund under Article VIII, as soon as possible.
X.

Article IV Consultations:

Zambia is on the 24-month Article IV consultation cycle, subject to the provisions of the
decision on consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002. The last Article IV consultation was
concluded by the Executive Board on April 7, 2004.
XI.

FSAP Participation and ROSC:

Zambia has participated in the financial sector assessment program (FSAP), and an FSAP
mission from the Fund and the World Bank conducted a comprehensive external assessment of
the financial system. The two FSAP missions visited Zambia during April 30-May 15 and July

APPENDIX III

Zambia: Relations with the World Bank Group
A. Partnership for Development
1.
The IDA and IMF Boards endorsed the Government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy,
covering the period 2002-20041, embodied in its first full PRSP, in May of 2002. An Interim
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) had been presented to the Board in July 2000. The
PRSP was substantially complete when the new Government took office in January 2002. The
new Government endorsed the PRSP and went further to expand the PRSP in the Transitional
National Development Plan (TNDP) that was published in October 2002 and covers the period
2002-2005. The first and the second Annual Progress Report on the implementation of the
PRSP were presented to the IDA and IMF Boards in May 2004 and April 2005, respectively.
2.
Strategic focus of the PRSP. The PRSP /TNDPhighlights the following barriers to
poverty reduction: lack of economic growth, high inequality, excessive dependence on foreign
aid, poor prioritization of public resources, inadequate safety nets, and HIV/AIDS. Therefore,
the PRSP seeks to achieve poverty reduction through promoting (i) economic growth and
diversification of production and exports; (ii) improved access and quality in the provision of
social services; and (iii) the mainstreaming of crosscutting issues of governance, HIV/AIDS,
gender, and the environment. Targets and indicators are provided for each sector and sub-sector.
For example, by 2004 the poverty headcount is to be reduced to 65 percent, the same as in 1996.
Even though the MDGs are not explicitly mentioned in the PRSP, given that the MDGs were
not widely discussed when Zambia prepared its PRSP, some of the targets for improvements in
the social indicators are similar to the MDGs.
3.
Joint staff assessment of the PRSP and the Progress Reports. Bank and IMF staffs are
in agreement with the major objectives set out in the PRSP and confirmed in the Annual
Progress Reports. The strengths of the PRSP are: a participatory process that involved civil
society, the private sector, and the donors; a poverty analysis that draws from available
quantitative and qualitative data, looks at multiple dimensions of poverty, and provides data
broken down by socio-economic group, gender, and region; an appropriate macroeconomic
framework and financing plan; identification of priority sectors likely to contribute most to propoor growth; and the emphasis placed on the need to improve governance and reduce
corruption.
4.
Since 1995, the Fund has supported by ESAF and PRGF arrangements Zambia’s
economic reform program. During December 2003-May 2004, the authorities have implemented
an extended Staff Monitoring Program (SMP), which has formed the basis of a new Fundsupported program under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility which was endorsed by
the IMF Board on June 14, 2004. The PRGF focuses on (i) fiscal consolidation; (ii) inflation
reduction, and (iii) maintaining an adequate level of foreign reserves. Successful performance
1

Subsequently the PRSP was extended to cover also 2005 as to fully overlap with the
Transitional National Development Plan. A new PRSP/National Development plan is currently
being formulated and will cover the 2006-10 period.

- 76 -

APPENDIX III

under the PRGF is a key condition for reaching the completion point under the Enhanced HIPC
Initiative.
B. World Bank Group Strategy
5.
In March 2004, the Bank’s executive Board discussed the Bank’s current Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS), which outlines the roadmap for the Bank’s country support for the
period 2004-2007. The CAS is explicitly rooted in a result-based framework, which links
overall goals of the PRSP/TNDP to specific strategic objectives. Paying attention to cause-andresult linkages, the main focus of the planned Bank’s activities is to remove obstacles to longerterm strategic development outcomes. Where appropriate, quantitative targets to be reached
during the CAS period have been specified. For the CAS period, the Bank will track progress on
specific outcomes and intermediate indicators directly affected by Bank interventions.
6.

World Bank activities focus on three strategic priorities:
1.
2.
3.

Strategic Priority 1: Sustained Economic Growth Anchored in a Diversified
and Export-Oriented Economy;
Strategic Priority 2: Improved Lives and Protection of the Vulnerable;
Strategic Priority 3: Efficiently and Effectively Managed Public Sector.

In addition to ongoing Bank’s lending operations in the areas of public sector reform,
privatization, HIV/AIDS, education, social service delivery, infrastructure, support for
diversification, and the environment, the base case of the new CAS includes adjustment lending,
i.e., the Economic Management and Growth Credit, approved in December 2004. The CAS also
continues project support (in particular, for public sector reforms, infrastructure, and sanitation),
pursues a reengagement in the agricultural sector and to assist in the governments fight against
malaria.
7.
The Bank continues to undertake substantive country diagnostics providing a solid base
for policy dialogue, design, and implementation of its lending operations in Zambia. A
combined Public Expenditure Review (PER), Country Procurement Assessment Review
(CPAR), and Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), was completed in 2003
and forms the basis for the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability TA work jointly
undertaken with cooperating partners. The main economic sector works recently completed are
a Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), an Investment Climate Assessment (ICA), an
Administrative Barriers study (AB), and a Strategic Country Gender Assessment (SCGA). In
addition, a collaborative Poverty and Vulnerability Assessment (PVA), an integrated framework
study for trade (DTIS), and Public Expenditure Review for the education sector are currently
being finalized and a Public Expenditure Review for the Health sector and an assessment of
competition and regulation in Zambia’s infrastructure sectors initiated. In addition, a review of
labor market regulations, a rural development strategy, and a post privatization copper strategy,
have been planned for the upcoming two FYs.
8.
To support the implementation of the PRSP, IDA prepared a results-based CAS for the
period FY04-Fy07, which was discussed by IDA’s Executive Board in March 2004. IDA’s
active portfolio as of November 2005 contains 14 credits and grants for a total initial
commitment of US$462 million. During FY05 2 projects were approved i.e. SEED
(US$32.2 mil.) to support economic diversification in July 2004 and the Economic Management

- 77 -

APPENDIX III

and Growth Credit (US$40 mil.) in Dec 2004. In FY06 one project, the Malaria Booster Project
(US$20 mil.) was approved by IDA’s Board. It is expected that two additional projects will be
submitted for Board approval before the end of June 2006 i.e. the Public Sector Management
Project (US$30 mil.) and Agricultural Development Support Program (US$40 mil.). Note that 4
projects are expected to close by the end of 2005 (see table 1).
9.
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) is very much aligned with the Bank’s
policy agenda in Zambia. The IFC currently has a small portfolio of 12 projects totaling
US$15 million outstanding. These are a mix of financial sector, agribusiness,
telecommunications (mobile telephone), and tourism projects. The IFC’s most prominent
project was for US$30 million in the equity of Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) with AngloAmerican in 2000. The IFC exited in 2002 along with Anglo, in accordance with the terms of
the investment agreement.
10.
Zambia is currently a group 3 country for the IFC (as defined in the recently board
approved IFC strategic initiative for Africa) and thus assessed as a relatively poor investment
climate, with limited prospects for stimulating new private investment and limited progress on
reforms to improve the investment climate. In this environment, the IFC seeks to be responsive
to individual projects where IFC can play a role, and in which there is strong development
impact, but does not invest significant resources in upstream project development. The IFC is
exploring, jointly with the Bank, how to support the Bank Group’s activities on improving the
investment climate in Zambia.
11.
MIGA’s outstanding portfolio in Zambia consists of four contracts of guarantee in the
agribusiness and manufacturing services sector with a US$36.1 million gross exposure and a
US$35.7 million net exposure as of December 2003. The projects are for the privatization,
modernization, and expansion of a foundry, and for cobalt and copper facilities. They benefit
the Zambian economy by saving production costs and by providing training to personnel
working on projects. The estimated total amount of foreign direct investment facilitated to date
is US$155.5 million

C. IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
12.
A summary of IMF-World Bank collaboration in Zambia is provided in Table 2. There
are a number of areas where the Fund leads and its analysis serve as inputs into the World Bank
policy formulation and advice, including policies to maintain macroeconomic stability, fiscal,
monetary, and exchange rate policies. There are other areas in which the Fund and the Bank
share responsibility and are coordinating closely their policy advice to the Zambian authorities,
such as trade, financial sector, public expenditure management, including debt management,
and economic governance. The Bank has taken the lead in the social sectors, including health,
education, social protection, water and sanitation, agriculture and rural development, private
sector development including regulatory issues and the environment.
13.
The Fund and the Bank shared joint responsibility in supporting the Government in the
preparation of the PRSP and its annual progress reports on the implementation of the PRSP. The
Fund and the Bank have also jointly provided assistance to Zambia for evaluating progress to
reach the Completion Point under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative. In addition, the Bank and the
Fund are jointly assisting GRZ to improve its debt and cash management practices.

- 79 -

APPENDIX III

C.1. Areas in which the World Bank leads and there is no direct IMF involvement
14.
Areas in which the Bank leads and there is no direct involvement of the IMF are support
for social sectors, agriculture and rural development, economic diversification, infrastructure,
and the environment. In light of the complex and crosscutting nature of risk and vulnerability in
Zambia, the Bank is assisting Government in developing a cross-sectoral Social Protection
Strategy. The strategy will extend beyond traditional ex post risk-coping measures (e.g. safety
nets) to include a better understanding of the role of ex ante risk-prevention and risk-mitigation
measures. The strategy is being prepared in a highly participatory fashion, with the aim of
integrating it within Zambia’s next poverty-reduction strategy. For the same purpose, the Bank
has undertaken a Poverty and Vulnerability Assessment, which is to be discussed with GRZ in
Winter 2005.
15.
HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and health. At this time, IDA is assisting the Ministry of Health
with a US$12 million project under a multi-sectoral AIDS program (ZANARA) and
US$20 million under its Malaria Booster project. In addition, IDA has carried out an ESW on
human resources in the health sector (FY04) and plans a health sector PER in FY06. Building
on this, IDA will provide support, but not necessarily financially for the Health Sector Support
Program (SWAP) beginning in FY07. The improvement of water supplies under the Mine
Township Services Project will also contribute to health outcomes in the areas served.
16.
In education, the Bank is currently supporting the Ministry of Education’s efforts
through Adaptable Program Lending (APL). The APL1 Credit enables IDA funds to be devoted
to a wide range of purposes in basic education and, following an amendment, to construct two
high schools in the Eastern Province. The Bank is supporting expenditure effectiveness and
efficiency in the sector through a public expenditure review (currently underway).
17.
In the area of technical education, vocational, and entrepreneurship training (TEVET),
the Government is carrying out reforms aimed at improving the quality of training, making it
more responsive to labor market demand and financially sustainable. Reforms also aim at
increasing the participation of female trainees and trainees from socio-economically
disadvantaged groups. The Government’s efforts in this area are being supported by an IDA
Credit committed in FY01 and by several other partners.
18.
In agriculture and rural development, the Bank’s focus is two fold: improvement of
productivity of the sector and increase of overall food security. The Bank is reengaging in the
agricultural sector given the priority Zambia attaches to this sector, as set out in the
PRSP/TNDP. Indeed, in a stable macroeconomic environment, if supporting infrastructure and
adequate agricultural policy are in place, a major effort could be launched to unleash growth
and poverty reduction potential of the sector, in particular through well-targeted interventions
for both smallholders and commercial agriculture.
19.
Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) are planned to support the formulation of an
agricultural policy consistent with the planned and ongoing projects in related sectors, such as
roads and electricity, to remove bottlenecks that prohibit and or make difficult for farmers to
produce for the market. Hence, the policy dialogue with the Government on reforms and
priorities of public spending for agriculture and rural development will address both short run
policy issues, as well as a long run strategy to tap the large agricultural export potential of the

- 80 -

APPENDIX III

country, focusing on investment in land development, irrigation, and infrastructure. A balanced
treatment of smallholders and commercial agriculture is important for growth and poverty
reduction. As a follow-up to the AAA work, an Agricultural Support Project is planned to assist
the Government with these challenges in FY06.
20.
In addition, the Bank has assisted Zambia in developing an Integrated Framework for
Disaster Relief and Mitigation–intended as multi-sectoral response to anticipate and address the
impacts of climate shocks–under the recently closed Emergency Drought Recovery Project
(EDRP). The aim was to increase food security and protect living conditions for the poorest and
most vulnerable in targeted districts. Pilot programs are being designed to manage and protect
against climate shocks, including dams and local irrigation, labor intensive public works, and
agriculture input distribution programs. Feeding programs will be implemented in primary
schools in a subset of districts; young children in Zambia are particularly at risk to high and
rising levels of malnutrition.
21.
The Bank supports economic diversification directly through its SEED project, which
will assist implementation of a diversification strategy in the tourism, agribusiness, and
gemstone sectors. In the initial phase, the SEED project will focus on supporting the design and
establishment of appropriate policy and legal frameworks to encourage private investments in
these three sectors, as well as investments, primarily in tourism-related infrastructure. The
tourism component will work toward making Livingstone the flagship tourism destination in
Zambia and strengthening management of national parks, which underpin Zambia’s mediumterm tourism development strategy. The interventions in the gemstones and agribusiness
subsectors are focused to strengthen the supply chain that links rural/small-scale producers to
local and export markets.
22.
Private sector development. To improve Zambia’s investment climate, the Bank and
the IFC have assisted the Government with analytical work, notably an Investment Climate
Assessment and a FIAS-led Administrative Barriers to Investment study. These studies are
geared to facilitate the adoption of a new and more business friendly Investment Act and result
in regular consultations between business and Government to discuss how to strengthen
Zambia’s business climate. As a result of this dialogue, the Government, with support from the
Bank and the IFC, prepared a private sector development strategy. The strategy was developed
through an interactive process, which included intensive consultations with the private sector
and other donors and coordination within the Government itself. Implementation of some of the
reform actions identified in the strategy has already started through analytical support by the
Bank and through programs funded by other donors.
23.
In the infrastructural sectors, the Bank is assisting the authorities in the
commercialization of ZESCO. Analytical work aims at identifying the main bottlenecks with
regard to competition and effective service delivery. The policy recommendations and
institutional changes would be supported through adjustment operations. In particular, the
ongoing and proposed investment projects (Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project and
the Water Sector Reform Project) would provide the financial resources needed for investments.
Zambia will also benefit from the Southern African Power Pool Project.
24.
Environmental concerns are addressed as part of each individual project as laid down
in the Bank’s safeguard policies. They are also addressed through the Bank’s environmental

- 81 -

APPENDIX III

project in the Copperbelt, which will assist Government with the cleanup of several hazardous
sites in the Copperbelt and Kabwe area. The SEED project will assist the Government in
making environmentally sustainable tourism in protected areas.
C.2. Areas in which the World Bank leads and its analysis serves as input into the IMF
program
25.
The Bank leads the dialogue on institutional dimensions of public expenditure
management and financial accountability as well as public sector reform and restructuring and
privatization. The Bank program will support these areas through a combination of lending and
analytical work. In the area of institutional dimensions of public expenditure management
and financial accountability, the Bank’s long-term objective is to encourage a more
transparent and accountable public sector by improving budget management, procurement
systems, and the accountability for public funds. The public sector reform and restructuring
agenda centers on instilling a more productive and efficient public service. To achieve this
goal, reform efforts aim at promoting a more qualified and motivated civil service, developing a
strategic management orientation in line ministries, improving policy coordination and
implementation, and lastly, strengthening local government’s capacity to participate in the
development process.
26.
While the Bank has taken the lead in privatization, the IMF has also a strong interest in
these areas since many of the reforms are critical to achieving macroeconomic stabilization and
enhancing Zambia’s growth prospects. Accordingly, there is a high degree of consultation and
coordination between the two institutions on these matters.
C.3. Areas of shared responsibility
27.
The Fund and the Bank are working jointly in the following five areas (i) trade policy;
(ii) financial sector reform; (iii) debt management and domestic debt market development;
(iv) PRSP monitoring and evaluation; and preparation of a LIC debt sustainability analysis.
28.
In the area of trade policy, the Bank, with collaboration from other partners, will
undertake an integrated framework exercise. The Fund and the Bank jointly reviewed the
Financial Sector Development Plan (FSDP). Follow ups on the FSAP and the FSDP will guide
the Bank’s policy dialogue and interventions in the financial sector in close collaboration with
the IMF. The PRGF and the Economic Management and Growth Credit assist the Government
on the resolution of three state-owned Non-Bank Financial Institutions and the strengthening of
the operational independence of the Bank of Zambia.
29.
Assistance in the areas of central government debt management and domestic debt
market development will focus on reducing vulnerability and the cost of and the need for
domestic financing. This work will draw from the Guidelines for Public Debt Management
(published in March 2001) and the Handbook on Developing Government Bond Markets
(published in July 2001). It will also benefit from an accompanying document to the Guidelines
(prepared by the World Bank and the IMF), containing case studies from a range of countries at
different stages of economic and financial development. The Bank, through its Treasury
department, has under taken a debt management assessment and currently assists the
Government in putting the recommended institutional changes in place.

- 82 -

APPENDIX III

30.
The Fund and the Bank are working closely to review progress with Zambia’s PRSP.
The Bank and the Fund jointly prepared the Joint Staff Assessment (JSA) of the full PRSP
(published in May 2002), the JSA of the first annual progress report (May 2004), and the Joint
Staff Advisory Note on the second annual progress report (March 2005). Zambia reached its
decision point in December 2000. Finally, the Fund and the Bank jointly prepared the HIPCAAP document, monitored progress towards the completion point under the Enhanced HIPC
Initiative, and prepared a debt sustainability analysis.
C.4. Areas in which the Fund leads and its analysis serves as input into the World Bank
program
31.
The Fund leads the dialogue on macroeconomic framework, in particular with regard
to fiscal policy, advising the Government on the overall envelope for public expenditures, tax
policy, as well as monetary and exchange rate policy. In these areas the Bank takes into account
the policy recommendations of the Fund and ensures that its own policy advice, embedded in its
adjustment operation (the Economic Management and Growth Credit), is consistent.

APPENDIX IV

Zambia: Statistical Issues
Zambia is one of fifteen countries participating in the Fund’s General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) Project for Anglophone African Countries. Zambia’s GDDS
metadata were posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board on
November 1, 2002 and were partially updated in July 2004.
Zambia’s data provision is generally adequate, but there are shortcomings in the data
for the national accounts, consumer prices, and balance of payments remain. The present
arrangements for the compilation of macroeconomic statistics involve duplication of effort
and insufficient coordination among the Bank of Zambia (BoZ), the Ministry of Finance,
and the Central Statistical Office (CSO). The situation largely reflects resource constraints
and organizational weakness within the CSO that have affected its ability to produce
economic statistics on a timely basis.
A data module ROSC for Zambia, using the July 2003 DQAF methodology, was published
on January 18, 2005 and is available on the IMF website.
Real sector
An IMF/DFID GDDS mission visited Lusaka from June 24 to July 5, 2002 to
provide technical assistance to the CSO on national accounts, focusing on improving the
source data (surveys); introducing a phased implementation of the 1993 System of National
Accounts (1993 SNA); and developing quarterly GDP estimates. The mission’s main
findings are summarized below.
The national accounts estimates are compiled according to the conceptual guidelines
of the 1968 SNA, but a phased approach to the introduction of the 1993 SNA is planned. The
estimates are released in accordance with a well-established schedule and cover, on the
production side, 11 industry groups and 23 subgroups, and, on the expenditure side, the
6 main components, at both constant and current prices. For the production approach, 1994
is the latest benchmark year for value-added ratios. For many important industry areas, such
as wholesale and retail trade, construction, business services and many other service
industries consisting mainly of small-scale private service providers, there are no
appropriate indicators. In addition, the data currently available are mostly quarterly volume
or quantity indicators of production. Data that would permit the compilation of the more
comprehensive real sector indicators, such as data on total production and intermediate
consumption of establishments, are not available. On the expenditure side, there are no
current indicators of household consumption, and private final consumption expenditure is
derived residually. Source data to estimate gross fixed capital formation and changes in
stocks are incomplete.
Current price estimates for both the production and the expenditure sides have been
derived from the constant price indicators by using wholesale price indices (WPIs) and
consumer price indices (CPIs) as deflators. However, for the most recent period, the WPI
was no longer available and the CPI components were used throughout the system.

- 86 -

APPENDIX IV

A rapid erosion of the range of basic source data for national accounts estimates in
recent years and at a time when the economy was subject to major structural changes has
increasingly detracted from the quality of the GDP estimates. Moreover, even some major
methodological improvements within national accounts, such as the adoption of the
commodity flow approach to estimate some of the aggregates, have not been adopted.
Further, the CSO has not used the results of the input-output table constructed for the period
1994-1999, to improve the estimation process. The authorities’ plan to implement the
economic census project for 2002 constitutes a major breakthrough in the development of
source data for the national accounts.
A follow-up mission during March 3-19, 2003 noted that the short-term
recommendations made during the first mission had not been implemented due to lack of
staff resources. The 2004 Data ROSC mission also confirmed the lack of progress in the
compilation process.
Government finance
Zambia’s GFS data have not been updated since 2000. Last information available
and published in the GFS Yearbook 2004 is preliminary for 1998 and forecast for 1999. The
coverage of the data is limited to budgetary central government. No monthly or quarterly
fiscal data are reported for publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS).
The authorities report monthly budget data for the Fund’s operational use in a timely
manner. However, data are often subject to substantial revisions later in the year. Local
government fiscal data are not available.
An IMF/DFID GDDS mission visited Lusaka from March 13 to 26, 2003 to provide
technical assistance to the Ministry of Finance and National Planning on fiscal issues. The
expert provided advice on the initial steps toward migration to the methodology of the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM2001). An IMF GDDS mission visited
Lusaka again on April 18-29, 2005 to assess the overall quality, coverage, and timeliness of
fiscal data. The main conclusions and recommendations of the mission were:
•

With regard to the accounting data, the mission reviewed and made proposals to improve
the chart of accounts that would be introduced in the 2006 budget cycle, but indicated
that the implementation of Integrated Financial Management and Information System
(IMFIS) is a long-term project (full implementation is only expected towards 2009).
Capacity constrains with regards to companies that are capable to implement the system
as well as human resources were noted.

•

Decentralization of government activities in earlier years has led to the creation of
numerous extra-budgetary institutions. While the majority of these entities follow
international accounting practices, they are not obliged to report to the Ministry of
Finance. Currently an estimated 35 percent of government activities are not captured in
the data.

- 87 -

APPENDIX IV

Monetary accounts
There has been progress made in the compilation of monetary statistics, and the
monetary survey is published on a monthly basis. The BoZ has also eliminated discrepancies
between its own records of IMF accounts and data from the Finance Department of the IMF.
In April 2003, the BoZ switched fully to a new computing system for generating its
monthly trial balance, which enables the production of monetary accounts on a timely basis.
A July 2003 STA monetary and financial statistics mission recommended the recording of
deposits on a gross, rather than on a net basis; the reporting of central government securities
at cost, rather than at face value; and the reclassification of some accounts.
Data reported by commercial banks are adequate, but the other depository
corporations’ survey should be expanded to cover four nonbank deposit-taking institutions.
Furthermore, the BoZ should include in the survey the accounts of all the banks currently in
the process of liquidation, classifying their deposits as restricted deposits and excluding
them from broad money. A STA mission in May 2005 noted that the authorities had
implemented most of the recommendations of the July 2003 mission. However, the BoZ was
still recording deposits on a net rather than gross basis. There were also problems with the
sectorization of public sector deposits reported by commercial banks.
Balance of payments
In May 2000, a STA mission found compilation of data on imports, exports, and foreign
direct investment to be inadequate and made a number of recommendations to improve the
coverage of the data. Since then, the authorities have prepared a work plan to implement the
recommendations of the mission, and some improvements have been made in the coverage
of the customs data and the methodology for compiling some balance of payments
components. However, the quality of balance of payments data continues to be problematic,
as data sources are poor and unreliable, and the methodology inadequate.
Data sources on private sector foreign assets and liabilities are insufficient to compile an
international investment position statement.

Progress Towards Achieving the Millennium Development Goals
Two reports have been prepared in recent years—the first in 2003 and the second in 2005—which assess Zambia’s
progress towards achieving the MDGs.1 These reports were prepared in collaboration with Government, Civil Society
Organizations, academia, political representatives and the U.N. Country Team. Both reports highlight the efforts being
made in achieving the MDGs and the challenges ahead. In the 2003 report, only one MDG target out of ten—viz, gender
equality—was judged likely to be achieved. Six other targets were considered potentially achievable, while three targets
were judged as unlikely to be achieved by 2015. In 2005, five targets were judged likely to be achieved (those relating to
eradicating extreme hunger and poverty, universal primary education (UPE), gender equality, and halting the spread of
HIV/AIDS), three potentially achievable (reducing child mortality, halving the incidence of malaria, and halving the
proportion of people without access to drinking water), and only two unlikely to be achieved by 2015 (improving
material health and ensuring environmental sustainability). Reasons for the more positive assessment in 2005 included
attainment of the HIPC completion point and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative. It is expected that the additional
resources provided by debt relief would go into poverty reduction programs and the social sectors.

The more favorable recent assessment is supported by improvements in some indicators measuring
progress in achieving of the MDGs. For instance, according to the preliminary results of the 2004 Living
Conditions Monitoring Survey, the incidence of extreme poverty has dropped to 53 percent from
58 percent in 1998. There has also been progress with respect to achieving UPE and general equality.

APPENDIX V

The reports also indicated an improvement in the national environment for reaching the MDGs. The 2005
report concluded that national support for achieving the MDGs was generally good. This was an
improvement on 2003, when national support was perceived to be weak for five out of ten targets. For its
part, for instance, government has been released the resources committed in the national budget to poverty
reduction and social sector programs.
Notwithstanding the progress made, Zambia faces a number of challenges in her efforts to achieve the
MDGs. To reduce poverty and hunger, Zambia needs to achieve higher pro-poor economic growth and
increase employment opportunities. In addition, more resources, both financial and human resources, are
required in the social sectors to achieve the targets in the education and health sectors.

APPENDIX VI

Zambia: Debt Sustainability Assessment
Introduction
1.
This appendix reports the results of a debt sustainability assessment for Zambia
conducted jointly by Fund and World Bank staff using the LIC DSA framework. The
baseline scenario extends the medium-term macroeconomic framework of the PRGF-supported
program to 2025. In addition to standard alternative scenarios and stress tests two scenarios
were considered: one that involves additional borrowing from power sector investment over
2008-11 and another that incorporates potential debt relief under the MDRI. In addition to
external debt, the assessment also takes into account the implications of the outlook for
domestic debt for fiscal sustainability.
2.
Zambia’s external debt sustainability outlook has greatly improved with the
attainment of the HIPC Initiative completion point in April 2005. With the full delivery of
HIPC Initiative assistance, as well as additional bilateral debt relief, Zambia’s external debt is
estimated at $3.8 billion in nominal terms at end-2004, corresponding to $1.5 billion in NPV
terms, or 75 percent of exports. The bulk of this debt—almost 90 percent—is owed to
multilateral institutions, in particular the Fund, IDA and the African Development Bank.
Domestic debt, at 22 percent of GDP in NPV terms at end-2004, represents an additional
element of risk to debt sustainability in Zambia, but this risk is mitigated by the government’s
commitment to limiting domestic financing to 0.5 percent of GDP per year over the long term.
Fund and World Bank staff are of the view that Zambia is at low risk of debt distress going
forward.
Baseline Scenario
3.
Policy-based indicative thresholds for debt burden indicators are a key feature of
the LIC DSA framework. The thresholds are based on the empirical finding that low-income
countries with stronger policies and institutions tend to have higher debt carrying capacity.
Zambia is classified as a medium performer in regard to policies and institutions, for which the
relevant thresholds for debt burden indicators are 40 percent for the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio,
150 percent for the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio, and 20 percent for the debt service-to-exports
ratio.
4.
Zambia’s external debt burden indicators are well below the policy-based
thresholds of the LIC DSA framework in the baseline scenario and gradually improve
over time. The baseline scenario is based on an extension of the macroeconomic framework of
the PRGF-supported program (Box A1). It assumes a continuation of Zambia’s relatively
strong recent performance, but incorporates a projected deterioration in the terms of trade as
copper prices ease from their recent historic highs and a tapering off of output growth in the
mining sector. In this scenario, the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline gradually
from 23 percent at end-2005 to 16 percent by 2010 and 10 percent by 2025 (Table A1 and
Figure A1). The NPV of debt-to-exports ratio is also projected to decline, although somewhat
more slowly, from 66 percent at end-2004 to 59 percent by 2010 and 45 percent by 2025,
reflecting the slower growth of exports than of GDP. The debt service-to-exports ratio is

- 93 -

APPENDIX VI

projected to fluctuate between 3-5 percent until 2010 and thereafter decline to 1 percent. In the
baseline, the debt burden indicators remain significantly below their CPIA-linked thresholds
for a medium performer on the quality of policies and institutions such as Zambia—40 percent
for the NPV of debt-to GDP ratio, 150 percent for the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio, and 20
percent for the debt service-to-exports ratio—throughout the projection period.

Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions for Baseline Scenario, 2005-06
The baseline scenario is an extension of the macroeconomic framework that underlies the
PRGF-supported program. It assumes that the government will continue to pursue sound
macroeconomic and structural policies and that economic performance will be favorable.

Real GDP grows by 6 percent per year on average.
Inflation declines to 5 percent by 2007 and remains stable thereafter.
The real effective exchange rate appreciates gradually—by about 2 percent per year.
Exports growth is projected to be strong over the medium term, but to then moderate
for a few years as metals output growth slows. Thereafter, export growth averages
about 8 percent a year in dollar terms, supported by a rising share of nontraditional
exports.
Import growth is assumed to be strongly linked to GDP growth over the long run.
Following the sharp recent improvement, the terms of trade are assumed to
deteriorate gradually over the medium-term and then stabilize.
The current account deficit (excluding grants) declines to 10 percent of GDP by
2010 and to about 8 percent by 2025.
Government revenues remain stable over the medium term at about 18.5 percent of
GDP, and thereafter rise gradually to 20 percent of GDP. External grants, both
project and program, are stable at around 6 percent of GDP. Expenditures rise to
25 percent of GDP and remain stable thereafter. Domestic financing falls to
½ percent of GDP by 2008 and remains at that level.
Foreign direct investment declines somewhat from its recent level of around
5 percent of GDP, associated with strong investment in the mining sector, to about
2 percent over the long run.
External borrowing rises in nominal terms but declines gradually, relative to GDP,
from its current level of about 2 percent to about 1 percent over the long run. All
external borrowing is assumed to be concessional.

Standard Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
5.
Zambia’s favorable external debt sustainability outlook is fairly robust to a
deterioration in economic performance and exogenous shocks. In a scenario that sets key
variables equal to their averages over 1994-2004, and therefore takes into account the
relatively poor performance of the Zambian economy during the earlier part of that period, the
NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio declines throughout the projection period, albeit at a slower pace
than in the baseline (Table A2). The NPV of debt-to-exports ratio, however, rises initially to 74

- 94 -

APPENDIX VI

percent by 2010 and the declines gradually to 65 percent by 2025. The debt service-to-exports
ratio is marginally higher than in the baseline.
6.
All but one of the standardized stress tests exhibit relatively benign debt
dynamics: all debt burden indicators remain well below relevant thresholds throughout. The
exception is a shock to exports in 2006-07—modeled as export value growth at its historical
average less one standard deviation, to allow for the possibility that copper prices fall sharply
from their current elevated levels. In this scenario, the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio rises
sharply in 2007, to above 150 percent where it stays through 2010. However, by 2015 the NPV
of debt-to-exports ratio is projected to fall to 137 percent and to 94 percent by 2025. The NPV
of debt-to-GDP and the debt service-to exports ratio also rise temporarily to peaks of
28 percent and 10 percent, respectively, well below the relevant thresholds.
Power Sector Investment Scenario
7.
Substantial investment in power generation financed by external borrowing on
commercial terms has only a limited impact on Zambia’s debt burden indicators. As
discussed in the staff report, ZESCO aims to expand its power generating capacity
significantly over the medium term, with investment needs possibly financed on commercial
terms. An alternative scenario that assumes external borrowing on nonconcessional terms—8
percent interest rate, 5 year grace, 17 year maturity—of 1 billion over 2008-2011 was
prepared. The impact of this borrowing on debt and debt service ratios relative to the baseline
is similar in magnitude to that of the historical scenario. Debt burden indicators never come
close to their respective threshold.
MDRI Scenario
8.
Implementation of the MDRI would further improve Zambia’s debt sustainability
outlook. The MDRI would cancel Zambia’s obligations to the Fund, IDA, and the AfDF as of
end-2004. This would lower Zambia’s projected end-2006 nominal external debt from
$3.6 billion to $0.5 billion. The reduction in the NPV of external debt-to-GDP ratio would be
equally marked with the end-2006 value declining from 20 percent to 4 percent, while the NPV
of external debt to export ratio would fall from 63 percent to 14 percent. These ratios would
rise gradually over the long run as new borrowing comes to dominate the debt dynamics. The
debt ratios remain low throughout relative to the relevant debt burden thresholds. The debt
service-to-export ratio declines quickly to 2 percent and thereafter settles around 1 percent.
Fiscal Sustainability
9.
Domestic debt accounts for a substantial share of overall public debt in Zambia.
Domestic debt is projected to be about 19 percent of GDP at end-2005, a sizable portion of
which is in short-term treasury bills (Table A3 and Figure A2). Under the baseline scenario,
which builds on the successful fiscal adjustment that the government has undertaken in recent
years and incorporates its objective of limiting domestic financing to ½ percent of GDP per
year over the long run, domestic debt is projected to decline to 12 percent of GDP by 2010 and
6 percent by 2025. The domestic debt-to-revenue ratio is projected to decline from 80 percent
in 2005 to 50 percent by 2010 and 24 percent in 2025. Thus, in the baseline, the share of
domestic debt in total public debt is projected to decline over time.

APPENDIX VI

10.
Domestic debt is an additional element of risk to fiscal sustainability in Zambia.
Under standard alternative scenarios and stress tests, the projected debt dynamics are less
favorable, sometimes significantly so (Table A4). The least favorable case is represented by a
scenario in which key variables, including real GDP growth and the primary balance, are set at
their historical averages, and the resulting financing requirement is met by additional domestic
borrowing. In this scenario, the ratio of domestic debt to GDP is stable at 16-17 percent of
GDP until 2010 before rising to 23 percent of GDP by 2015 and 26 percent by 2025. Relative
to government revenue, the NPV of domestic debt is projected to ease from 70 percent in 2005
to 65 percent in 2010 before rising to 85 percent in 2015 and 123 percent in 2025. Moreover,
the cost of servicing overall public debt in this scenario rises from a low of 13 percent of
revenue in 2006-07 to 18 percent by 2010, 25 percent by 2015 and 39 percent by 2025.
Conclusion
11.
On the basis of the debt sustainability analysis that has been conducted, Fund and
World Bank staff are of the view that Zambia is at a low risk of debt distress. Application of
the LIC DSA framework to Zambia indicates that Zambia’s external debt sustainability
outlook is favorable under most scenarios, although it is vulnerable to a sharp setback to export
earnings. Domestic debt and unfunded government liabilities represent some risks, although
these stem to some extent more from the short maturity of the external debt than its volume.
Implementation of the MDRI would further greatly strengthen Zambia’s debt sustainability
outlook and reduce Zambia’s vulnerability to shocks.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 1, 2006

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with
Zambia
On January 11, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Zambia.1
Background
The Zambian economy has achieved sustained robust growth in recent years, a marked
turnaround after more than two decades of economic stagnation and falling per capita income.
During 2000–05, real GDP growth averaged 4½ percent a year, as the mining sector
recovered substantially in response to privatization and rising copper prices, while the
construction sector performed particularly well, driven by strong demand for housing. Inflation
has been reduced in recent years, but remains high. In addition, Zambia’s external position
has strengthened, owing to both a rebound in copper export receipts and relatively strong
growth of nontraditional exports; nevertheless, international reserves remain low.
Notwithstanding the improvements in economic performance, poverty is still widespread and
the economy continues to be vulnerable to climatic and terms of trade shocks.
In 2005, real GDP growth is estimated to have moderated to 4.3 percent from 5.4 percent in
the previous year, owing to a drought-related shortfall in maize production and temporary
disruptions to mining activity associated with labor disputes and mining accidents. Fuel
shortages in the second half of the year, arising from unanticipated shutdowns of the country’s
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2oil refinery, also contributed to the economy’s slowdown. Inflation remained in the high teens
during most of 2005, partly reflecting drought-induced increases in food prices and rising world
oil prices, before dropping to 15.9 percent at end-year, as the tightening of monetary policy
and a sharp appreciation of the Zambian kwacha restrained inflation pressures.
A substantial fiscal adjustment in 2004 has helped put the public finances on a sustainable
course. Spending restraint allowed the overall deficit (including grants) to be reduced to
1.7 percent of GDP from 6.6 percent in the previous year, while still allowing for increased
spending on poverty-reducing programs (PRPs), including the hiring of a significant number of
new teachers and health workers. As a result, government domestic borrowing was greatly
reduced (to less than 1 percent of GDP), thus easing the crowding out of private sector credit,
which expanded rapidly while interest rates declined. In 2005, the overall fiscal deficit is
expected to be broadly in line with the target for the year of 2.5 percent of GDP,
notwithstanding a temporary reduction in import and excise duties on petroleum products
during the final quarter, to encourage greater imports in order to alleviate fuel shortages.
The attainment of debt relief under the HIPC Initiative coupled with the favorable trend in
exports has improved markedly Zambia’s debt sustainability. Including additional bilateral debt
relief agreed by Paris Club creditors in May 2005, the ratio of Zambia’s external public sector
debt to exports is estimated to have fallen to 66 percent at end-2005. Implementation of the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, approved by the Fund’s Board in December, would result in
the cancellation of the bulk of the remaining external debt.
The government’s lower domestic financing need has facilitated a firmer monetary policy
stance by the Bank of Zambia, after years of excessive monetary expansion. Together with a
more consistent implementation of liquidity management in recent months, growth of both
reserve and broad money has been reduced and is expected to have remained well within
target through the end of the year.
After having remained fairly stable in real effective terms during 2000–04, the Zambian kwacha
appreciated strongly in 2005. Against the U.S. dollar, the kwacha appreciated by 26 percent
during the year, driven by a marked strengthening of market sentiment stemming from record
high world prices for copper, a perceived commitment to prudent fiscal and monetary policies,
and the substantial improvement in Zambia’s debt sustainability outlook.
In addition to the rebound in copper export earnings, a steady expansion of nontraditional
exports have contributed to the strengthening of Zambia’s external sector. Despite strong
growth in imports, arising partly from high levels of investment in the mining sector and, more
recently, high world oil prices, the current account deficit (excluding grants) narrowed sharply,
from about 20 percent to about 12 percent of GDP during 2000–05. Still, international reserves
have remained low, building up to only about 1½ months of imports by end-2005.
While there have been a number of delays, there has also been important progress in
implementing the structural reform agenda, aimed at increasing the efficiency and
effectiveness of the public sector, improving debt management, deepening the financial sector,
and enabling private sector development. There has been an overall improvement in public
expenditure management systems, including the introduction of a medium-term expenditure

-3framework in the budget making process, even though the long planned for piloting of an
integrated financial management and information system (IFMIS) has yet to be realized. Again,
with some delays, progress has been made implementing the authorities’ Financial Sector
Development Plan—notably, toward the resolution of troubled state-owned nonbank financial
institutions and the privatization of the Zambia National Commercial Bank. Progress to date
under the Private Sector Development Initiative has been more limited.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the authorities for maintaining a macroeconomic policy framework that
has enabled the economy to sustain robust growth in 2005, despite a number of adverse
supply shocks. They welcomed the sustained efforts to strengthen the public finances, which
have contributed to improved macroeconomic stability and strong growth. Directors noted the
favorable performance of nontraditional exports, and the recent strong recovery of the mining
sector following privatization of mining companies. Directors were concerned, however, that
poverty, though declining, is still widespread in Zambia. They were encouraged by the
authorities’ commitment to increase further spending on poverty-reducing programs (PRPs)
and implement a structural reform agenda aimed at increasing productivity and raising
incomes.
Directors agreed that prospects are favorable for achieving higher economic growth and lower
inflation in the years ahead. They noted that attaining single-digit inflation by 2007 would be a
historic accomplishment that would further investment, financial intermediation, and good labor
relations. Noting the potential pressures on policies during an election year, Directors urged
the authorities to maintain disciplined economic and financial policies to safeguard the gains
achieved. Directors further observed that the authorities must maintain clear objectives for
monetary policy and closely coordinate fiscal and monetary policies to help break expectations
of high inflation.
Directors agreed that strengthening public expenditure management and financial
accountability (PEMFA) is critical for increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the public
sector. They welcomed the progress achieved thus far under the comprehensive PEMFA
reform program, and noted that it has encouraged some donors to increase their direct support
for the budget. Directors, however, expressed concern over delays to the contracting for the
installation of an integrated financial management and information system (IFMIS) and urged
the authorities to ensure that existing public expenditure management systems are
appropriately strengthened.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to resolve domestic arrears and fund contingent
liabilities. They agreed that clearing arrears to contractors should be a high priority. Directors
urged the authorities to proceed expeditiously with a reform of the pension system.
They welcomed the initial steps taken by the authorities to provide budgetary resources over
the medium term to meet projected obligations to the public sector pension fund, but
emphasized that a fundamental reform is necessary to avert a major risk to the public
finances.

-4Directors observed that expansion and deepening of financial intermediation is critical for
private sector-led growth. In this regard, they welcomed the expansion in bank credit to the
private sector facilitated by reduced government borrowing. Directors cautioned, however, that
this credit expansion is not without risks and urged enhanced financial sector supervision and
regulation as an essential step to maintain confidence in the system. Directors advised the
authorities to follow through with planned measures to resolve financially troubled nonbank
financial institutions and finalize privatization of the Zambia National Commercial Bank.
Directors agreed that a flexible exchange rate policy has served Zambia well. They remarked
that the rapid growth of nontraditional exports in recent years suggests that Zambia has
maintained its international competitiveness. However, the recent appreciation of the kwacha,
supported by the improvement in Zambia’s longer-term prospects, points to the importance of
increasing productivity in order to maintain competitiveness. Directors noted that appreciation
pressures may provide an opportunity to accumulate international reserves more rapidly than
planned, and recommended that a close watch be kept on the impact of foreign exchange
market developments on the economy.
Directors urged the authorities to step up implementation of the structural reform agenda to
remove impediments to business activity, expand access to credit, and improve infrastructure.
They highlighted the importance of donor coordination, welcomed the Fund's good work in
coordinating and consulting productively, and encouraged the Fund and the Bank to continue
to strengthen their efforts in this regard.
Directors remarked that debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative and the Multilateral
Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) have greatly improved Zambia’s external debt sustainability
position. They welcomed the authorities’ commitment to avoid a renewed build up of external
debt by adopting a prudent borrowing policy and further strengthening their debt management
capacity. In this regard, investment plans by state-owned enterprises, such as the electricity
and telephone companies, should be thoroughly scrutinized to ensure that Zambia reaps the
maximum benefits.
Directors noted that debt relief and the prospect of increased donor support provided a
significant opportunity for directing greater resources to increasing economic growth and
reducing poverty. In particular, Directors looked forward to the timely revision of the Zambian
National Development Plan to map out a comprehensive agenda to achieve strong progress
toward meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries)
concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member
countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex
post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after
Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in
a particular case. The staff report for the Article IV consultation with Zambia may be made available at a
later stage if the authorities consent.

IMF Executive Board Completes Third Review Under Zambia's PRGF Arrangement and Approves
US$15.9 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the third review of
Zambia's economic performance under a three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
arrangement, which was approved on June 16, 2004 (see Press Release No. 04/117) in the amount of SDR
220.1 million (about US$318.8 million).
The completion of the review enables the release of a further SDR 11.0 million (about US$15.9 million),
which will bring the total amount drawn under the arrangement to about SDR 187.1 million (about
US$271.0 million). Zambia is on a quarterly disbursement schedule under the PRGF arrangement and
received two disbursements of SDR 5.5 million each for broadly satisfactory performance through June
2005 and September 2005, respectively.

The Board also approved a waiver for the nonobservance of the end-September 2005 quantitative
performance criterion on the net domestic financing of the central government.
Following the Executive Board discussion, Mr. Takatoshi Kato, Deputy Managing Director and Acting
Chair, said:
“The Zambian authorities are to be commended for the successful implementation of sound economic
policies and the broad achievement of their program objectives in 2005. In particular, sustained efforts to
strengthen the public finances, have contributed to improved macroeconomic stability and robust growth.
Zambia’s external position has strengthened in recent years and debt relief has greatly reduced Zambia’s
external debt burden. However, inflation, though declining, remains high, and there is a critical need to
seize the opportunity provided by debt relief to sustain improved economic performance and accelerate
the reduction of Zambia’s widespread poverty.
“The strong pace of investment suggests that prospects for robust economic growth in the years ahead are
favorable. The authorities’ policy framework aims to extend the recent gains in macroeconomic stability,
including the reduction of inflation to single-digit levels by 2007. If sustained, these policies would
provide a solid foundation for continued strong economic growth and poverty reduction. Thus, it is

-2critical that the authorities resist election year pressures that could undermine fiscal and monetary
policies.
“Continued progress under the comprehensive Public Expenditure Management and Financial
Accountability (PEMFA) reform would lead to substantial improvements in the effectiveness of public
resources. In addition, longer-term budget planning and the allocation of resources to eliminate domestic
payments arrears and provide for forthcoming contingent liabilities, including the projected cash flow
deficit in the public sector pension fund (PSPF), are welcome. Proceeding expeditiously with pension
system reforms will be critical to reducing risks to the public finances.
“The recent appreciation of the kwacha, spurred by the improvement in Zambia’s longer-term prospects,
points to the importance of closely monitoring exchange rate developments and increasing productivity in
order to maintain competitiveness. Therefore, the implementation of structural reforms to remove
impediments to business activity, expand access to credit, and improve infrastructure should be stepped
up. In order to maintain confidence in the financial sector, it is essential for the authorities to follow
through on plans to resolve financially troubled nonbank financial institutions, privatize the Zambia
National Commercial Bank and, more generally, strengthen financial sector supervision and regulation,”
Mr. Kato said.
The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. It is intended that PRGFsupported programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory
process involving civil society and development partners and articulated in a Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP). This is intended to ensure that PRGF-supported programs are consistent with a
comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural, and social policies to foster growth and reduce
poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate of 0.5 percent and are repayable over 10 years with a 5
½-year grace period on principal payments.

Statement by Peter Ngumbullu, Executive Director for Zambia
and Joseph Masawe, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
January 11, 2006

The Zambian authorities wish to express their appreciation to staff for their well balanced report on the
developments in the Zambian economy. The staff report on Article IV consultation and the third review
of the PRGF provides helpful policy advice, which will guide authorities going forward. The authorities
want to thank the Executive Board for its continued support and reiterate their commitment to prudent
macroeconomic polices. They welcome the Fund’s interaction with representatives of the private sector,
trade unions, NGOs and the donor community, as they constitute important stakeholders on the national
development agenda.
As correctly reflected in the staff report, Zambia has made significant gains in macroeconomic
stabilization. GDP growth has been strong despite lower than projected growth in 2005, caused by supply
side shocks. Fiscal performance continues to stay within programmed levels and efforts to contain
inflation are being strengthened. Zambia’s exports are also growing and reforms in the financial sector are
being deepened. The authorities recognize that despite these positive developments, downside risks
remain and hence, the need for continued deepening of the reform agenda.
Recent Macroeconomic Developments
After more than two decades of economic stagnation, the Zambian economy experienced a marked
rebound, with GDP growth averaging 4.5 percent over the past five years. The robust growth has been
driven by a strong expansion in construction, following increased demand for housing and rapid growth in
investment, especially in the copper mining sector. During 2005, GDP growth is expected to be around
4.3 percent compared with the projected growth of 5.0 percent, following the impact of drought-related
decline in maize production during 2004/05 and oil shortage caused by intermittent closures of the
country’s INDENI Oil Refinery, which negatively affected fuel supply and caused high pump prices of
petroleum products. However, despite these adverse supply side shocks, implementation of appropriate
tight monetary policy by the BOZ, coupled with government’s tight fiscal policy, led to a reduction in the
annual overall inflation to 15.9 percent in December 2005, compared to 17.4 percent in 2004 and the
program target of 15 percent for 2005. This is a marked improvement compared to the high rates
experienced in the past.
Fiscal performance continued to be strong, with revenue collection surpassing the September 2005 target.
It is expected that end-of-year revenue target will still be achieved, despite a projected shortfall in nontax
revenue arising from reduced import and excise duties on petroleum products undertaken in October 2005
to dampen the impact of fuel shortages. Given the revenue shortfall, the government maintained tight
expenditure regime over the year and ensured that all bridge finance obtained from the central bank is
paid before end of the year.
Monetary policy remained tight, in line with the objective of containing inflationary pressures. Broad
money supply growth declined from 30.2 percent in December 2004, to only 9.1 percent in September

-22005. Exports grew strongly following high world market copper prices and a rapidly growing nontraditional export sector. However, strong growth in imports arising mainly from high world petroleum
prices and a rise in capital imports following increased investment in the mining sector, is expected to
lead to widening of the current account from 5.4 percent of GDP in 2004 to around 6.0 percent of GDP in
2005.
In the financial sector, good progress was also recorded. The National Savings and Credit Bank (NSCB)
and the Development Bank of Zambia (DBZ) submitted their plans for incorporation under the
Companies Act to the Bank of Zambia (BOZ) in April and May 2005, respectively. The government also
adopted the BOZ’s proposed action plan for the Zambia National Building Society (ZNBS) in August.
The amendment to the Acts of the NSCB and DBZ undertaken in October 2005, has aligned these Acts
with the Banking and Financial Services Act, while giving the BOZ clear supervisory mandate for these
institutions. Meanwhile the privatization of the Zambia National Commercial Bank (ZNCB) is proceeding
well and the process is on course. The Zambia privatization Agency (ZPA) selected Rabobank as the
preferred investors for 49 percent shares in the bank.
Performance under the Program
All quantitative program targets for June 2005 were met, while only one target for September 2005 was
not met. Notably, the floor on gross reserves and the ceiling on net domestic assets (NDA) of the BOZ
were met with wide margins. However, despite meeting the net domestic financing of the government
(NDF) ceiling with a comfortable margin in June 2005, the target for September 2005 was missed
narrowly, owing to emergency outlays for food relief in drought affected areas and higher than
programmed expenditures on preparations for elections and constitutional review process. The authorities
are currently making every effort to ensure that domestic financing requirements remain within
programmed levels. The two performance criteria under the structural program were both met. The
government continued to refrain from extra budgetary expenditures, except for parliamentary approved
supplementary expenditures which were necessary for emergency food relief imports. The new financial
regulations and revised accounting manuals for the new Finance Act are being finalized and are expected
to be issued before end-March 2006.
Macroeconomic Policies for 2006 and Medium-Term Outlook
The Zambian authorities remain committed to policies aimed at achieving a high level of growth,
necessary for poverty reduction. Although recent supply side shocks to the economy, may lead to lower
than projected GDP growth and higher level of inflation, the setbacks will be temporary. The authorities
recognize the daunting challenges that they face in meeting the MDGs, but remain confident that with the
strong continued support by the development partners, they stand a chance of meeting most of them by
2015. The government’s development strategy for the medium and long-term remains focused towards
transforming agriculture and substantially reducing poverty. These priorities are addressed in the National
Development Plan (NDP) and the medium term expenditure framework. The key objective of sustained
growth will be supported by sound macroeconomic policies including policies to create an environment
for strong private sector investment and expansion in energy and pro-poor growth, mainly focusing on
increased investment in small scale mining, agriculture and manufacturing. In addition, the country’s
export development strategy will remain focused on diversification away from metal exports, in particular
copper exports.

-3Fiscal Policy
The government remains committed to prudent fiscal policies. Macroeconomic stabilization policies will
be anchored on reduction in net domestic financing, while allocating more resources to poverty reduction
programs. The government intends to conduct an overall review of its tax policy, with the objective of
rationalizing the tax system and expanding the revenue base. In this context, it will ensure that a
minimum revenue target of 17.5 percent of GDP is attained and expenditure will be contained within the
approved limits. Expenditures related to elections scheduled for 2006 will be monitored closely with the
objective of keeping such expenditures within budgeted levels.
Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
The authorities recognize that consistent with program implementation targets the reserve money will be
key to curbing inflationary pressures. The authorities will therefore ensure that during the year, broad
money growth is kept at around 14 percent. The monetary program will focus on increased flow of credit
to the productive sector, while gross international reserves are expected to reach at least 1.5 months of
import cover. The government will continue to strengthen the bond market, whose recent introduction has
helped to shape the yield curve and strengthen implementation of monetary policy. The government is
committed to maintaining the independence of the Bank of Zambia, which is a key aspect in pursuing its
primary objective of maintaining price stability.
The flexible exchange rate regime has so far served Zambia well. The objective of the government is to
ensure that this regime is maintained and further strengthened. The authorities are aware of the impact of
a large and sustained exchange rate appreciation on the competitiveness of Zambian exports, but
recognize that it may not be prudent for the Bank of Zambia to intervene in such appreciation
immediately. Nevertheless, the authorities will continue to watch exchange rate developments closely and
take appropriate measures when necessary. Other measures to improve the country’s international
competitiveness will also be implemented. The government intends to introduce measures to reduce the
cost of doing business in Zambia, and increase competitiveness of its exports. Similarly, measure to
diversify the export base will continue to be implemented and enhanced.
Structural Measures
The government will continue to pursue it structural reform agenda, with measures during 2006 focusing
on public expenditure management and financial accountability (PEMFA), debt management, financial
sector development and governance and transparency. As part of the PEMFA, the government intends to
put in place an Integrated Financial Management and Information System (IFMIS). New rules to
strengthen existing expenditure management system will be instituted, including rules to strengthen
commitment control. Similarly, the government will strengthen fiscal transparency and new manuals for
the new Finance Act will be issued. The government will also continue to strengthen its debt management
capacity.
The authorities are thankful to the multilateral financial institutions and the international community for
granting Zambia debt relief under the HIPC initiative and further under the recent multilateral debt relief
initiative (MDRI). Debt relief granted to Zambia has greatly improved the country’s external debt
situation and overall debt sustainability. The government will ensure that the resources released from
these initiatives are used to benefit the Zambian population through increased social spending and the

-4development of rural infrastructure, both being key aspects towards achieving the MDGs and eradicating
poverty .
In the financial sector, policies will be directed towards expanding financial intermediation in both urban
as well as rural areas. Measures will be taken to deepen availability of microfinance services, particularly
in rural areas and strengthen the overall banking system. The government is aware that despite the overall
strength of the domestic banking sector, vulnerabilities still exist and hence, there is need to continue
taking measure to improve the banking system. The government will continue to expand the lending
resources of the DBZ as per understanding reached with the World Bank and ensure that the bank gets
registered under the Companies Act and its subsequent licensing under the banking and Financial
Services Act, but measures will be taken to ensure that the bank maintains prudent lending policies.
Measures are also being taken to finalize reconciliation of the NSCB accounts and implement the bank’s
institutional development plan. The government intends to establish a credit reference bureau (CRB) to
foster availability of credit to support growth, while at the same time ensuring that outstanding pension
liabilities are addressed, including initiating, with the assistance of the World Bank, a reform of the
pension funds.
The government recognizes the key role of the electricity sector to the economy. As the Zambia
Electricity Company (ZESCO) accomplishes its first year as a commercialized government-owned
company, plans to expand electricity generation and transmission will be implemented. Under the plan,
government will strengthen ZESCO management and enhance profitability of the company. In this
context, the government will also ensure that Zambia’s capacity to collect, analyze and report various
statistics of socio-economic importance is enhanced. The government will strengthen the Central
Statistics Office (CSO) to ensure that the ability of this agency in compiling and reporting various
statistics is improved.
Concluding Remarks
The authorities have consistently, over the past five years, implemented broad based structural reforms
and moved towards market-based policies. These measures have started bearing results, as evidenced in
the sustained high level of growth, which is critical for poverty reduction. However, despite this
impressive performance, the authorities recognize that there remain many challenges, which must be
addressed in order to meet the MDGs and eradicate poverty. The Zambian authorities remain strongly
committed to policies aimed at deepening the reforms agenda as vast majority of Zambians are poor, most
of whom live in rural areas. Improving their future welfare hinges upon transforming the rural sector,
including improving rural infrastructure. It is for this reason that the new NDP aims at increased emphasis
on rural infrastructure and attaining sustainable growth level, which are necessary for the reduction of
income poverty and hence, improvement in social well-being of the majority of the Zambians.
As the country consolidates the economic gains achieved, the authorities are strongly committed to
implementation of prudent macroeconomic policies and further structural reforms. They are looking
forward for continued support from the Fund, other multilateral institutions and other cooperating
partners in their pursuit of the reform agenda, particularly in the areas of debt management, capacity
building, strengthening of the intermediation role of the financial sector, enhancement of the role of the
private sector in economic development to enable meeting of the MDGs and the various challenges facing
the country in the medium and longer term.

-5The authorities request for completion of the third review and the fifth and sixth disbursements under the
PRGF arrangement. With regard to the sixth disbursement, the government requests for waiver on nonobservance of the end September 2005 performance criterion on net domestic financing of the
government (NDF), which was missed by a small margin owing to emergency outlays for food relief. The
government also requests for modification of the performance criterion for end-December 2005 on net
domestic financing to facilitate clearing of domestic arrears, as well as the end-January 2006 criterion
with respect to the piloting of the IFMIS.
