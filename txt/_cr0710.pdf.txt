with Prime Minister the Hon. Patrick Manning, Ministers Enill and Sahadeo in the Ministry of
Finance; Central Bank Governor Williams; other senior government officials; representatives of the
private sector and labor unions; and the leader of the opposition. Mr. Samuel (OED) participated in
several meetings and C. Atkinson (WHD) joined the team for the final discussions.
2005 Article IV Consultation. Directors noted that favorable economic conditions provided a unique
opportunity to secure sustainable high living standards for Trinidad and Tobago. Directors noted that
maximizing the gains from the energy windfall required a prudent mix of macroeconomic and
structural policies. They encouraged the authorities to take advantage of the favorable conditions to
press ahead with structural reforms to support private sector led growth.
The authorities’ policies. Earlier Article IV consultations have emphasized fiscal and financial
sector issues reforms, which the authorities are partly addressing, in particular, the revised Heritage
and Stabilization Fund draft bill includes a number of staff recommendations. As regards broader
macroeconomic developments, the fiscal accounts and the government balance sheet have improved
due to higher oil prices and the authorities’ efforts to save revenues in excess of budgeted amounts.
However, expenditure has recently risen, and is budgeted to expand further and drive up the
nonenergy deficit beyond the medium term sustainable level recommended in the last Article IV.
Foreign exchange sales have been stepped up to absorb excess liquidity in line with staff
recommendations. However, monetary policy has not contained aggregate demand pressures and
inflation has continued to rise. The exchange rate de facto peg has been maintained contrary the
recommendation to introduce greater flexibility. The government has been active in promoting
economic diversification to reduce reliance on energy production. In regards to the financial sector,
progress has been made at the technical level to implement the recommendations in the 2005 FSAP
but key legislation needs approval.
Trinidad and Tobago has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. It
maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions.
Trinidad and Tobago statistical database is adequate for surveillance. Trinidad and Tobago
began participation in the General Data Dissemination Standards system in September 2004. Recent
STA technical assistance has focused on the compilation of national account statistics.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
Trinidad and Tobago has one of the highest per capita incomes in Latin America and
the Caribbean. Its wealth stems from vast oil and gas reserves. Trinidad and Tobago is also
a regional financial center and a significant source of capital flows in the Caribbean.
The political balance is delicate with political divisions, largely along ethnic lines,
complicating policy making. The next general elections could be called any time between
now and January 2008. The political climate is charged in anticipation.
Economic developments continue to be underpinned by a favorable international
environment. In 2005, real GDP grew about 8 percent and is set to accelerate to 12½ percent
this year. The current account surplus is running at around 25 percent of GDP, the budget has
posted sizable surpluses, and net public debt fallen sharply. However, the underlying fiscal
situation has deteriorated and the nonenergy fiscal deficit has risen. Aggregate demand
pressures have mounted and capacity constraints have become evident in some sectors. The
labor market has tightened, real estate prices are rapidly rising, and inflation is accelerating.
Policy Discussions
The discussions centered on the need to develop macroeconomic and structural policies
that use the energy windfall to promote sustainable long-term growth with low
inflation. This involves a number of challenges, including: (i) managing aggregate demand
to avoid overheating the economy in the short term; (ii) striking an appropriate balance in the
use of energy resources over time; and (iii) accelerating structural reforms that will help to
foster economic diversification.
The short- and medium-term outlook for growth remains favorable due to the high
energy prices. However, tighter macroeconomic policies are needed to curb inflation and
bring public spending back to levels consistent with medium-term fiscal sustainability. In
addition, fiscal reforms are needed to promote the best use of energy resources. Key areas
that deserve attention are: the efficiency and equity of the tax system; the quality of public
spending; and transparency and accountability.
Rising energy revenues pose challenges to monetary policy. Regaining control over
liquidity is a priority and monetary management needs to be strengthened to improve the
central bank’s ability to provide a credible nominal anchor for monetary policy. Greater
exchange rate flexibility may be needed given the persistent positive terms of trade shock and
absence of fiscal restraint. Looking ahead, the mission recommended allowing for a gradual
nominal appreciation over time to facilitate the adjustment of the real exchange rate.
Progress has been made at the technical level to implement the recommendations in the
2005 FSAP but key legislation needs approval.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Trinidad and Tobago has one of the highest per capita incomes in Latin America
and the Caribbean (Figure 1). Its wealth stems from vast oil and gas reserves which at
current extraction rates would be exhausted in 20 years. There is nevertheless scope to
strengthen social and development indicators. Life expectancy and literacy are among the
highest in the Caribbean. However, in terms of broader social indicators, Trinidad and
Tobago’s Human Development Index ranking stands at 57 (out of 177 countries)—only
slightly above the regional average.

The political balance is delicate with divisions, largely along ethnic lines,
complicating policy making. The next general election could be called any time between
now and January 2008. The political climate is charged in anticipation.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Economic activity has been very strong, with growing signs that the economy is
operating near full capacity (Figure 2). In 2005, real GDP grew about 8 percent—above
the annual average growth of 6½ percent since 1994. Surging energy prices, the exploitation
of new gas fields, and an expansion of industrial capacity underpinned growth of 8¼ percent
in the energy sector. The nonenergy sector also grew rapidly, by 7¾ percent, supported by
public infrastructure spending and rapid credit growth that fueled private spending. Tobago
has benefited from growth in international tourism and increased public spending (Box 1).
Aggregate demand pressures have mounted and
capacity constraints are evident in some sectors,
Net Foreign Assets and Oil export price
notably construction. The unemployment rate has
60
6
dropped to 6¾ percent—an all time low.
4.
The external accounts are strengthening
and net foreign assets accumulating but
portfolio outflows have accelerated (Figure 3).
In 2005, the current account posted a surplus of
about 25 percent of GDP reflecting a sharp

improvement in the trade balance led by rising energy exports. Portfolio outflows, prompted
by the excess liquidity, surpassed FDI inflows. Gross international reserves reached
US$4.8 billion (10 months of imports).
5.
The government’s balance sheet has improved with rising energy receipts, but
the underlying fiscal position has deteriorated due to the rapid increase in public
spending (Figure 4). In FY 2004/05, strong growth in energy revenues boosted the central
government’s budget surplus to 5.6 percent of GDP, its debt-to-GDP ratio fell to 20 percent,
and deposits in the Interim Revenue Stabilization Fund (IRSF) reached 5.6 percent of GDP.
At the same time the non-energy deficit widened to 10½ percent of GDP due to growing
transfers and subsidies (on utilities and fuels) and higher public investment. In the first nine
months of FY 2005/06, buoyant revenues and a slower-than-planned execution of
expenditure contributed to a stronger-than-anticipated central government fiscal position and
a stable nonenergy deficit. However, based on the mid-year budget provisions, the nonenergy
deficit is projected to expand very sharply in the final months of the fiscal year, and reach
over 15 percent of GDP for the year as a whole. Nonenergy revenues are projected to slow
down reflecting the full year impact of the income tax cuts, and the government plans to
accelerate spending execution, in particular public investment. Moreover, the public
enterprises deficit has increased rapidly, worsening the overall NFPS balance this year.
6.
Demand pressures have contributed to rising inflation, notwithstanding policies
to hold fuel and utility prices constant (Figure 2). In July, inflation reached 8.6 percent
compared to 7.2 percent and 5.6 percent at end-2005 and end-2004, respectively. Core
inflation is also accelerating, reaching 4 percent compared to 2.7 percent in December. At the
same time, fuel prices have been held constant since October 2003 and electricity tariffs
frozen. The real effective exchange rate appreciated by 2.6 percent in 2005.
7.
Despite an overall build-up in central bank reserves, the foreign exchange
market experienced recurrent shortages in 2005. The balance of payments surplus led to a
large build up in central bank reserves. At the same time, the monetization of foreign
currency energy receipts to finance the nonenergy fiscal deficit created significant excess
domestic liquidity, which pushed up the demand for foreign exchange (Figure 4). The central
bank did not sell enough foreign exchange to satisfy this demand at the de facto pegged
exchange rate. As a result, 2005 saw a substantial increase in unsatisfied customer demands
(“queues”) and banks’ short trading positions. Nevertheless, a well-defined parallel foreign
exchange market was not observed. In light of these developments in the exchange system,
staff continues to assess the consistency of Trinidad and Tobago’s exchange system with
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 & 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement.
8.
The central bank has gradually adopted measures to address the foreign
exchange market imbalances (Figure 5). The policy rate, at which the central bank lends to
banks, was hiked by a cumulative 275 bp since February 2005 to 7.75 percent and the rate on
treasury-bills has been allowed to rise since February of this year. A scheduled reduction in
reserve requirements was put on hold, and commercial banks were required to make special
deposits at the central bank totaling TT$1.5 billion (1¼ percent of GDP). At the same time,

7
in recent months, the central bank has increased the supply of foreign exchange to the market
to alleviate remaining shortages.
9.
A stock of excess liquidity nevertheless
remains and the monetization of the nonenergy
deficit remains a source of pressure. Ample
liquidity has muted the effects of policy rate
increases by the Central Bank on market rates and
commercial bank lending and deposit rates, and
credit to the private sector has grown rapidly
(29 percent). At the same time rising inflation has
led to negative real interest rates and encouraged
capital flight.

Local financial markets have gone through an orderly correction since mid-2005
following a stricter enforcement of limits on institutional investors’ equity investments.
The local stock market index has fallen by over 20 percent from its peak in May 2005.
Mirroring developments in the stock market, mutual funds’ growth rate slowed to 16 percent,
compared to an average growth rate of 44 percent in the previous five years. In 2005, the
primary bond market continued to be very active with 37 placements with a face value
equivalent to 8 percent of GDP, about one-third in foreign currency. However, the secondary
market remains inactive.
11.
The authorities’ structural agenda emphasizes growth and diversification, and
improved macroeconomic management.
•

Diversification of the non-oil and oil sector. In addition to promoting new growth
industries in the nonenergy sector, the authorities have introduced a significant
downstream component requirement (40 percent) to all new energy projects. The
objective is to develop downstream petrochemical plants that use semi-processed
inputs that could be imported once energy reserves are exhausted.

•

Human capital accumulation. The authorities have begun implementing a multipronged human capital development strategy, which includes new training programs
and free tertiary education. Enrollment has increased threefold following the
introduction of universally free tertiary education. Education policies are also paying
increased attention to early childhood development.

•

Financial sector. The authorities have embarked on an ambitious effort to modernize
the legal, regulatory and supervisory frameworks governing the financial sector, with
a view to reducing vulnerabilities and promoting Port-of-Spain as a financial center.
In 2005, a FSAP found that although the banking system was well capitalized and
profitable, it remained vulnerable to sharp falls in energy prices. The absence of a
legislative and regulatory framework for nonbanks was noted as an area of concern
given that the contractual savings sector has replaced banking as the financial

8
market’s single largest segment. Another potential source of vulnerability was the
financial system’s exposure to countries in the region where fiscal sustainability is a
concern.
•

Fiscal sector. The main reform in this area is the plan to replace the IRSF with the
Heritage and Stabilization Fund (HSF). Draft legislation has been approved by
cabinet and is expected to be submitted soon to parliament (Box 2). Other reforms in
the fiscal area include the creation of special purpose vehicles (SPVs), which are
public enterprises intended to overcome institutional constraints that have hampered
the implementation of the public investment program.
III. OUTLOOK FOR 2006–07 AND THE MEDIUM TERM

12.
Trinidad and Tobago’s short-term outlook remains favorable but tighter
macroeconomic policies are needed to control inflation. The energy sector is set to
achieve an expansion in excess of 20 percent in 2006, reflecting the full-year impact of large
investments on productive capacity. The nonenergy sector is projected to grow by about
7 percent, supported by tax cuts and government spending but limited by emerging capacity
constraints. Overall growth is expected to accelerate to 12½ percent in 2006 before
decelerating to around 7 percent in 2007. The current account surplus is projected to continue
in excess of 20 percent of GDP in 2006 reflecting a sustained increase in exports that more
than offsets import growth. On current policies, the central government budget surplus will
shrink to about 3¾ percent of GDP in FY 2005/06 and FY 2006/07. However, the underlying
fiscal situation is likely to deteriorate and the nonenergy deficit increase to over 16 percent of
GDP. Inflation is projected to accelerate further, continuing to exceed that of trading
partners.
13.
Staff’s medium-term projections, based on strong energy revenues and current
macroeconomic policies, envisage robust economic growth, albeit at declining rates. The
energy sector will continue to post strong rates of growth as new projects coming on stream
more than offset the projected decline in energy prices (WEO projections). The nonenergy
fiscal deficit is projected to remain at about 15 percent of GDP over the medium term and
then assumed to move sharply into balance in 2020 consistent with the authorities’ objective
to balance the nonenergy deficit in the medium term. Public spending is projected to remain
at about 50 percent of nonenergy GDP, crowding out private investment and undermining the
dynamism of the nonenergy sector. On these assumptions the current account surplus will
decline rapidly to near balance by 2010, portfolio outflows will remain significant and
international reserves will eventually decline. Monetary policy will continue to face difficult
challenges and inflation will further accelerate.
14.
Tightening fiscal policy in line with fiscal sustainability considerations would
create a more favorable macroeconomic environment and reduce vulnerabilities
(Figure 6). Although maintaining current macroeconomic policies would be financially
sustainable over the next decade, it would eventually require a very large fiscal policy
adjustment once energy resources are depleted. Medium- and long-term sustainability would

9
require a tighter fiscal stance to build enough financial assets to finance a non-energy
primary deficit beyond the exhaustion of energy reserves (Box 3). Bringing the nonenergy
deficit below 10 percent of GDP by 2008 would require significantly scaling down public
spending plans that would, over time, create more space for private investment and
contribute to relatively stronger growth. Under this scenario, the current account surpluses
would fall but remain sizable, portfolio outflows would decline, and the rapid accumulation
of international reserves would continue. Bringing inflation back to the low single-digits
would be feasible and public sector net assets would accumulate rapidly.
IV. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
15.
The discussions centered on how best to develop macroeconomic and structural
policies that use the energy windfall to promote sustainable long-term growth, with low
inflation. Challenges in this context include: (i) managing aggregate demand to avoid
overheating the economy in the short term; (ii) striking an appropriate balance in the use of
energy resources over time; and (iii) accelerating structural reforms to foster economic
diversification.
16.
The authorities are focused on advancing their flagship development plan Vision
2020 aimed at achieving “developed nation status” by 2020. The plan is based on heavy
investments in infrastructure and human capital. While the mission agreed that policies to
tackle structural impediments to diversification and growth are worthwhile, it highlighted the
risk of overheating the economy by raising public spending very rapidly. The mission also
noted that diversification and industrial development strategies should comprise privatesector led initiatives that do not rely on subsidized inputs. The authorities agreed that
industries should be economically viable over the long term without government support. As
regards the risks of overheating, they were of the view that emerging capacity constraints
could be overcome by importing inputs and through immigration
A. Fiscal Policy
17.
The mission argued that a tighter fiscal policy stance is needed in the short term
to reduce inflation and take pressure off the labor market. In this context, the mission
recommended locking in the fiscal overperformance of the first nine months of the fiscal year
and recommended that the budget for FY 2006/07 target a decisive reduction in the
nonenergy fiscal deficit from current levels. In addition, the mission underscored the
importance of resisting pressures in the ongoing public sector negotiations to grant wage
increases beyond overall productivity gains. The authorities stated their intention to limit
somewhat the deterioration in the nonenergy deficit envisaged in the mid-year budget review,
including by saving revenues in excess of projections, but were noncommittal about locking
in the overperformance verified so far this year. They concurred that wage increases should
be determined by productivity gains but commented on the challenge of measuring public
sector productivity gains.
18.
Careful management of the energy revenue windfall is essential also to avert the
need for drastic policy reversals when energy income declines. The mission argued that

10
pacing the use of energy resources now would allow Trinidad and Tobago to sustain
investment and social spending. The mission discussed alternative ways to calculate the
sustainable nonenergy deficit, which staff estimated to be about 10 percent of current GDP or
somewhat below 20 percent of nonenergy GDP. This is based on the latest data on energy
reserves and assumes that energy prices remain high until 2011 (WEO projections) and fall
towards their long-term average thereafter. The authorities agreed with the mission on the
need to safeguard policy continuity and, in that context, noted that the government has saved
a significant part of the recent increase in energy revenues, even beyond the IRSF
requirements. Furthermore, the authorities remarked on their intention to balance the nonenergy deficit by 2020. The mission noted that a more moderate pace of spending in the
short-term would allow the accumulation of enough financial assets to support policy
continuity once energy reserves are depleted, avoiding a wrenching budget adjustment to
balance the nonenergy deficit in 2020. The authorities took the view that the recent increase
in the nonenergy deficit reflected worthy investments in health, education, and infrastructure.
19.
An adequate asset and liability management framework to transform energy
wealth efficiently into financial wealth is a key element of a medium-term sustainability
strategy. The mission supported the initiative to institutionalize a long-term savings
framework within the HSF, but underscored the need for disciplined fiscal policies, adequate
oversight, and transparency in HSF management in relation with the budget. The authorities
reported that the draft legislation consistent with advancing these principles and the overall
objective of stabilization and intergenerational savings received cabinet approval recently.
Liability management is also an important element of the fiscal strategy. The authorities
noted their intention eventually to tap international capital markets again to maintain a visible
presence in the market.
20.
High quality fiscal policy is needed to ensure the best uses of energy resources. In
that context, the mission urged the authorities to pay attention to the following areas:
•

Tax policy and administration. Structural tax reforms and measures to strengthen
tax administration could improve the efficiency and equity of the tax system. The
mission noted that recent income tax changes provided a welcome simplification of
the tax system, although the tax relief component was inconsistent with the need for
fiscal restraint. The authorities indicated that the simplification and reduction in
personal income tax rates have brought relief and improved taxpayer incentives at a
lower-than-initially-projected cost to the treasury due to increased enforcement and
compliance. As regards improving equity, the mission recommended reforming the
property tax and introducing a capital gains tax. The authorities agreed and indicated
that the preparatory work on these tax reforms is ongoing (although their introduction
is unlikely before FY 2007/08). They also reported that work is in progress to make
operational the newly established tax policy unit. The mission welcomed the
authorities’ plan to unify the inland revenue service and customs administration under
a single agency, highlighting a need for adequate checks and balances should the
government give this agency autonomy.

11
Quality of public spending. The mission noted that the traditional safeguards to
ensure minimum quality standards of public spending are likely under stress given the
rapid growth in public spending. The authorities reported their ongoing efforts to
strengthen the capacity to evaluate, select, and implement spending programs. In
particular, measurable indicators of performance are being developed to monitor
spending programs. The mission recommended developing a medium-term fiscal and
budgetary framework to allow a better anchor current policy decisions with
sustainability considerations. The authorities welcomed the suggestion in the context
of the FY 2007/08 budget.

•

Social spending. The mission agreed with the authorities’ view that a well-designed
social safety net is essential to ensure that the population at large benefits from the
energy windfall. The mission recommended reviewing existing social programs to
assess their effectiveness and efficiency. In that context, the mission noted that
although it is common for energy producers to subsidize fuel prices, generalized
subsidies have a tendency

disproportionately to benefit the wealthy.
(In percent of GDP)
14
The mission argued that utility and fuel
12
10
price subsidies could be replaced with a
8
better-targeted income support program.
6
The authorities noted that a new framework
4
2
to set electricity tariffs had been designed
0
and will be implemented as soon as it
receives cabinet approval. They also
reiterated their commitment to reduce fuel
subsidies over time as an adequate social
safety net is developed.

•

Fiscal transparency and accountability. The mission enquired about the
government’s use of SPVs to perform functions traditionally carried out by ministries,
noting the importance of safeguards to avoid weakening public sector governance and
expenditure management. The authorities explained that SPVs will receive resources
from the Infrastructure Development Fund, which is funded through the regular
budgetary process, and that borrowing by SPVs will be within the limits approved by
Parliament for the public sector. The mission recommended that, as the constraints
that prompted the creation of the SPVs are resolved, a plan to reincorporate these
functions back to the ministries be developed. The mission encouraged the authorities
to work with the Fund to prepare a fiscal report on standards and codes (ROSC).

•

Fiscal decentralization. Proposals have emerged recently to move toward fiscal
decentralization. The mission noted that fiscal vulnerabilities introduced by fiscal
decentralization usually outweigh its benefits in small economies. The authorities
explained that the plans under consideration do not envisage the type of fiscal
decentralization observed in large federal countries but rather intend to give local
governments expenditure implementation responsibilities.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
21.
Accelerating inflation poses a challenge for monetary policy. The central bank has
been active in trying to regain control over liquidity in the system but there remains a stock
of excess liquidity and the monetization of the nonenergy deficit continues to be a source of
pressure. The mission recommended a tighter monetary stance to curb inflation, and
suggested that the central bank step up sales of foreign exchange and allow the treasury bill
rate to continue to rise to mop up liquidity. The authorities explained that sales of foreign
exchange had increased threefold in the last 18 months and that shortages have now largely
been alleviated. They explained that decisions on how much foreign exchange to provide are
also taken against the background of past concern over excessive or speculative capital
outflows. Regarding the treasury bill rate, the authorities agreed that the rate should continue
to increase but argued that a sharp rise could prove destabilizing. However, the authorities
noted that the monetary tightening cycle in Trinidad and Tobago will need to continue
beyond the tightening cycle in the United States until a sufficient yield premium on local
assets is established to stem capital outflows.
22.
Strengthening monetary management would promote the central bank’s ability
to provide a credible nominal anchor for monetary policy. Increasing the effectiveness of
monetary policy will require adequate instruments. The mission recommended eliminating
the ceiling on treasury bill sales or at a minimum raising it. The authorities were sympathetic
but explained that increasing the ceiling could prove politically challenging. They clarified,
however, that the central bank could, if need be, issue its own paper to mop up liquidity. The
mission noted that the repo rate, the central bank policy instrument, is not binding in the
current excess liquidity environment, and that treasury bill rates and commercial bank rates
have diverged persistently from the interest rate path signaled by the central bank. The
central bank authorities were of the view that they could adequately signal their policy
intentions and make the interest rate transmission mechanism more effective over time by
raising the repo rate and allowing the rates on treasury bills to increase.
23.
Rising oil wealth inevitably puts upward pressure on the real exchange rate. A
tighter fiscal policy stance would limit the appreciation of the real exchange rate and its
adverse consequences on the competitiveness of the nonenergy economy. Monetary and
exchange rate policies in turn can affect whether the real appreciation occurs through
nominal appreciation, or through inflation, which tends to penalize the poorest segments of
the population.
24.
A more appreciated nominal exchange rate, ideally occurring in the context of
introducing greater flexibility in the exchange rate regime, could be tolerated over time.
The mission argued that the real exchange rate (as measured by unit labor costs) had
depreciated substantially on account of sharp gains in labor productivity and subdued wage
increases in recent years. This should enable the industrial sector to absorb a more
appreciated nominal exchange rate (Box 4). Moreover, staff estimates that the real exchange
rate undervaluation, estimated at 15-20 percent in last year’s consultation, is likely to have
been exacerbated by the sustained improvement in the terms of trade, while the appreciation

13
in the real effective exchange rate has been limited. The authorities noted that unit labor cost
measures only partially capture developments in the labor market and miss the rapid increase
in nonwage benefits and mounting pressures for large wage increases. Although the
possibility of a nominal exchange rate revaluation over time was not ruled out, the authorities
explained that recent large capital outflows and the segmentation of the market had limited
the tendency for such appreciation. The authorities viewed less favorably the
recommendation of allowing for greater flexibility in the exchange rate regime.
C. Structural Issues
25.
Continued reform of the regulatory and supervisory framework is needed to
enhance the resilience of the financial system. The authorities have made considerable
progress in preparing for consolidated supervision of financial groups and in drafting
amendments to financial institutions and insurance legislation along the lines of the 2005
FSAP recommendations. However, delays in the enactment of legislation still hinder the
effective supervision of the financial sector, and the legislative process needs to be
accelerated to strengthen the supervision of statutory corporations, credit unions, and mutual
and pension funds. The authorities reiterated their commitment to pressing ahead with
financial sector reforms, but explained that capacity constraints in drafting laws and an
extensive competing legislative agenda have delayed parliamentary consideration of financial
sector legislation. Stress-testing and the monitoring of real estate prices are two areas where a
significant amount of work has been undertaken by the authorities to assess system-wide
risks and vulnerabilities. Establishing a formal financial stability framework—including
clarification of arrangements for crisis management, emergency lending, and safety net
arrangements—still lies ahead. The mission considered that progress on these fronts is
essential to increase Port-of-Spain’s role as a financial center.
26.
Short-term risks in the banking system seem limited, but capital adequacy ratios
do not sufficiently reflect risks arising from regional sovereign exposure. The banking
sector remains profitable, nonperforming loans are low, and provisioning improved
compared to last year (Table 10). The banking system’s short open foreign exchange position
remains within prudent limits and is not an immediate source of risk given the de facto peg
and the central bank sizable reserves. However, there is large variation among banks and the
mission recommended introducing limits on open foreign exchange positions relative to bank
capital. In addition, the zero risk-weight applied to lower investment grade and non-OECD
sovereign exposure (about 20 percent of banks’ assets according to the FSAP) artificially
inflates capital ratios, and the mission recommended raising the risk-weight in line with
Basel standards. The authorities did not consider it necessary to introduce limits on open
foreign exchange positions, noting that these were carried by foreign banks that responded to
their headquarters regulations, but clarified that work is in progress to address shortcomings
in capital adequacy requirement regulation.
27.
The authorities place importance on economic diversification and reducing
dependency on the extraction of natural resources. The mission noted the importance of
initiatives to develop downstream energy-sector operations being economically viable over

14
the long term without government support and not being based on a subsidization of inputs.
The authorities reported their intention to continue phasing out tax holiday incentives for new
companies. More broadly, staff argued that reforms should generally be aimed at improving
conditions for market-based development The mission welcomed efforts to promote human
capital accumulation and broaden the economic opportunities of the population, but noted
that education expenditure should be well targeted and its effectiveness in advancing social
goals assessed vis-à-vis other social programs.
28.
Trinidad and Tobago has supported the process of regional integration. The
Organization of Eastern Caribbean States signed accords in early July, which operationalize
their entry to the CARICOM Single Market Economy (CSME). The mission welcomed
Trinidad and Tobago support to CSME and the creation of a Regional Development Fund to
provide assistance to small states within the context of the CSME.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
Record high energy prices present Trinidad and Tobago with a historic
opportunity for development but also with challenges. A delicate balance must be struck
in the use of energy windfalls to support sustained growth and higher living standards for
current and future generations. Investments to allow a gradual reduction in dependency on
the energy sector and strengthen human capital must be adequately paced both to avoid
overheating the economy and pushing up inflation, and to ensure sustainable levels of
spending over time.
30.
With the current strong economic growth, fiscal policy must avoid adding to
demand pressures. There are now signs that the economy is overheating and rapid increases
in public spending combined with tax cuts to the non-energy sector are imparting a sizable
fiscal impulse. Capacity constraints are becoming evident, the labor market is tight, real
estate prices are rising rapidly, and inflation has accelerated. A rising nonenergy deficit puts
pressure on the real exchange rate, with potential risks for the development of the nonenergy
sector. Importing inputs and allowing additional immigration may help in overcoming some
capacity constraints. However, domestic asset price bubbles may still be generated,
particularly in the real estate market.
31.
Steps to halt the deterioration in the underlying fiscal position would help avoid
sharp policy reversals in the future. The government’s success in containing expenditure in
the first nine months of the fiscal year is commendable. This effort should be maintained, to
forestall the deterioration in the nonenergy deficit envisaged in the mid-year budget review.
Exceptionally high energy prices are unlikely to be sustained over the medium term and
energy reserves will gradually be exhausted. This suggests that the use of energy resources
should be paced to maintain needed investment and social spending over the medium term.
In light of the historical volatility in energy prices, medium-term spending plans should be
based on conservative energy price assumptions. Staff estimates suggest that a non-energy
deficit of somewhat less than 10 percent of current GDP would be sustainable over the
medium term.

15
32.
Medium-term fiscal sustainability requires an adequate asset and liability
framework to transform energy wealth into financial wealth. While the mission
welcomed the HSF initiative, its effectiveness in achieving the objectives of stabilization and
intergenerational savings will depend on disciplined fiscal policies and an adequate oversight
structure. In particular, the HSF should not become a vehicle for extra-budgetary spending.
Good governance and transparency in the management of the HSF will be essential elements.
33.
The current favorable economic environment provides an opportunity to
improve the quality of fiscal spending by strengthening institutions and improving
policy design. The efficiency and equity of the tax system could be bolstered through
structural tax and revenue administration reforms. On the expenditure side, better targeting of
social programs would be important, as would developing a medium-term fiscal and
budgetary framework. Early work on the latter is key to have it in place on time for the
FY 2007/08 budget. Transparency and accountability are key for effective budgetary
management and it is reassuring that checks and balances are in place on the recently created
SPVs. However, the problems that prompted the creation of these agencies must be tackled
and a plan devised to reincorporate these functions back to the ministries. A fiscal ROSC
could provide useful inputs in the design of expenditure policies. Fiscal decentralization
plans must be carefully designed to ensure that their benefits are not outweighed by increased
fiscal vulnerabilities.
34.
Continued monetary tightening and improvement in policy instruments are
important for the central bank to fight inflation effectively. In the current exchange rate
regime, monetary conditions can be tightened by stepping up foreign exchange sales and
letting treasury bill rates rise. Given the acceleration of core inflation in recent months, it will
be important to use these instruments. Should the ceiling on central bank treasury bill sales
become binding, central bank paper should be issued. Once a sufficient yield premium on
local assets has been established, the focus should turn to enhancing monetary policy
effectiveness by improving the central bank’s capacity to communicate policy intentions to
market participants.
35.
Looking ahead, greater exchange rate flexibility may be needed. The persistent
positive terms of trade shock and the absence of fiscal restraint puts upward pressure on the
equilibrium and the actual real exchange. Staff estimates put the real exchange rate
undervaluation at about 15–20 percent. Adjustment through inflation (already taking place to
some extent) will place a burden on the poorest and most vulnerable segments of the
population. The industrial sector should be in a position to withstand the effect of a nominal
appreciation, particularly if steps are taken to boost competitiveness and improve the
business environment. Greater exchange rate flexibility would allow the authorities to
manage better aggregate demand pressures, in parallel with the central bank progress to
provide a credible alternate nominal anchor for monetary policy. More immediately, the
authorities should continue to reduce the uncertainty in the supply of foreign exchange and
take the first steps towards the development of an interbank market, including for example by
establishing an auction-based allocation of foreign exchange.

16
36.
The speedy enactment of amendments to key financial sector legislation is of the
utmost importance to strengthen financial sector regulatory and supervisory
frameworks. The authorities should also work with the financial sector to raise general risk
awareness and risk management standards from current levels. Regulation for proper risk
weighting of non-OECD sovereign debt would be particularly relevant for containing risks
from regional sovereign exposure.
37.
Structural reforms are needed to raise productivity in the nonenergy sector.
These reforms should aim at removing impediments to growth and diversification in the
nonenergy sector, including deficiencies in economic infrastructure and a weak business
environment, and at increasing regional integration. Creating conditions to foster the
development of the private sector should underpin diversification efforts. In that respect,
industrial development plans should concentrate on industries that are viable over the long
term without the benefit of government subsidies.
38.
The staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

17

Box 1. Developments in Tobago—Opportunities and Challenges
Tobago’s economy differs significantly from Trinidad’s and consequently confronts
unique challenges for achieving strong and sustained growth. With limited potential to
exploit gas and oil reserves, Tobago’s development strategy has focused on strengthening the
service sector, with an emphasis on tourism.
The expansion in international
tourism has supported economic
activity and development. As in many
Caribbean economies, the recent upturn
in the global economy and geographical
shift of tourist destinations following the
tragic events of 9/11 has contributed to a
steady increase in tourist activity in
Tobago. By 2004, domestic and
international airline passenger arrivals
had increased by about 70 percent
relative to 2001 and cruise ship
passenger arrivals reached a record high.
Tourism-related jobs accounted for
about 60 percent of employment.

Despite recent economic gains, Tobago’s economy remains heavily dependent on the
government sector. The public sector which employed more than half of all paid employees
in the economy in 2001 (as compared to a national average of about one-third). Fostering an
environment conducive to greater private sector development—where productivity gains are
usually larger—is a priority. Moreover, a well-educated labor force is critical to compete in
an increasingly knowledge-based global economy. Recent findings on Tobago’s education
profile, however, suggest a deficit in terms of the overall skills set. A Government Task
Force has outlined options to address these challenges.

18

Box 2: Heritage and Stabilization Fund Bill
The Heritage and Stabilization Fund (HSF) bill was submitted to Parliament on
September 15. The draft legislation states that the objective of the HSF is to save and
prudently invest surplus petroleum revenue with the goal of: (i) smoothing public
expenditure capacity during periods of weak energy revenues reflecting declines in
energy prices and/or production; and, (ii) supporting public expenditure capacity
following the depletion of non-renewable petroleum resources.
The main features of the HSF are as follows:
•

Governance Structure: The HSF is to be managed by a Board of Governors that
includes a Chairman and four other members. Board members are to be appointed
by the President on advice of the Minister of Finance for a three-year term.

•

Deposits: Resources in the Interim Revenue Stabilization Fund (IRSF) will be
transferred to the HSF once the legislation is passed. Thereafter, at least
60 percent of oil and gas revenues in excess of budgeted amounts will
automatically be deposited into the HSF without requiring a separate budgetary
appropriation.

•

Investment and Withdrawal Guidelines: HSF resources are to be invested in a
wide variety of high-quality foreign financial instruments. Withdrawals for
stabilization purposes are triggered by shortfalls in petroleum revenues in excess
of 10 percent of budgeted amounts. Withdrawals cannot exceed 25 percent of the
HSF assets.

•

Energy Prices and Revenue Estimates in the Budget: Budget energy revenues
are to be determined using the long-term prices of crude oil and gas; defined as
the 11-year moving average, comprising the current price, actual prices for the
previous 5 years, and projected prices for the next 5 years.

19
Box 3. Medium-Term Fiscal Sustainability and Policy Options1/
Trinidad and Tobago faces the challenge of managing its energy wealth so as to prevent the need
for drastic fiscal policy reversals once reserves are depleted. Achieving this objective requires
accumulating substantial net assets, while energy revenues last, to smooth out public expenditure over
the medium term and beyond the exhaustion of energy reserves. Devising a strategy to achieve this
objective is a priority given that energy reserves will be exhausted in about 20 years at current extraction
rates.
Fiscal sustainability exercises indicate that the nonenergy deficit is already running above the level
that could be sustained over the medium term. The exercise assumes: (i) an annual real return on net
assets of 4 percent; (ii) that proven, probable and possible reserves will be extracted respectively at 100,
75 and 50 percent probabilities; (iii) that the government take from the energy sector is about 27 percent
of total production of crude oil and gas; and, (iv) that oil and gas prices follow the projections from the
IMF World Economic Outlook until 2011 after which they converge on a downward path to a long-term
value of US$45/barrel (the oil price that has triggered funding of the IRSF). Under these assumptions
and based on the sustainable annuity criterion—which estimates a nonenergy deficit in constant Trinidad
and Tobago dollars that is sustainable forever—the sustainable nonenergy deficit is about 18 percent of
current nonenergy GDP or 10 percent of current GDP.2/ The nonenergy deficit has rapidly increased in
recent years and is projected to reach over 15 percent of GDP by the end of this fiscal year.
Maintaining the nonenergy deficit at current levels would require a drastic fiscal adjustment by
2020 when energy revenues are near exhaustion and accumulated assets are not enough to finance
any further deficits. On the other hand, aligning the nonenergy deficit with a level compatible with
medium- term sustainability entails reducing it from 27 percent of nonenergy GDP in FY 2005/06 to
about 16 percent of nonenergy GDP in FY 2007/08, and keeping it constant in real terms thereafter. In
this scenario, the government would accumulate net assets of about 200 percent of nonenergy GDP by
2020, which will finance a nonenergy deficit averaging 9 percent of nonenergy GDP between 2021 and
2030.

A companion Selected Issues Paper discusses alternative criteria to define medium term fiscal sustainability.

This result is lower than that estimated during the 2005 Article IV Consultations which found the sustainable nonenergy deficit to be 13½ percent of current GDP. This reflects several differences in the recent sustainability
exercise, including: (i) the use of varying extraction probabilities; (ii) a lower government take on energy output
over the projection period in line with recent history; (iii) upward revisions to GDP, and (iv) more conservative
medium term energy prices. The impact of these changes was partially offset by higher energy prices until 2011 (as
projected in the WEO).

20
Box 4. Real Exchange Rate Developments
Data suggest that the economy remains highly competitive due to large labor productivity gains that
have exceeded wage increases.
•

The CPI-based real effective exchange rate (REER) has remained at about its long run
average. As of June 2006 the real exchange rate was 12 percent above the 10-year average and in
line with the 1979–2005 average. Even though nontradable price inflation (excluding utility
prices) has been around 3–3½ percent for the past year and a half, it has been rising in recent
months, posing appreciation risks going forward.

•

Large labor productivity gains and subdued wage increases have reduced unit labor costs
but wage pressures might be mounting. Unit labor costs are approximately 20 percent below
the level of 10 years ago and have fallen sharply (34 percent) with respect to unit labor costs of
the United States. ULCs in the nonenergy sector have declined even faster than for the economy
as a whole. However, tight labor markets and an economy growing above potential suggest wages
may start to rise soon. Moreover, there are reports of nonwage benefits being on the rise.

•

The stability of the CPI-based REER coupled with lower relative ULCs means that
profitability in Trinidad and Tobago has improved substantially over the past 10 years,
particularly in the nonenergy sector.

•

The nonfuel export performance has been strong, suggesting it is highly competitive.
Nonfuel exports have grown at double-digits on average in recent years and Trinidad and Tobago
has doubled its share of world exports since 1999, with nonfuel exports explaining close to onequarter of that improvement. Moreover, nonenergy GDP grew on average over 6 percent per year
in the last five years.

Debt-stabilizing
non-interest
current account 6/

1/ Defined as total debt liabilities (portfolio debt + other investment), from the External Wealth of Nations Database.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP
growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
3/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation
(based on GDP deflator).
4/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
5/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and nondebt inflows in percent of GDP.
7/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

Real GDP growth (in percent)
GDP deflator in U.S. dollars (change in percent)
Nominal external interest rate (in percent)
Growth of exports (U.S. dollar terms, in percent)
Growth of imports (U.S. dollar terms, in percent)

APPENDIX III. TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO—RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of August 28, 2006)
In November 2004 the IDB Board approved the new Country Strategy with Trinidad and
Tobago. This document reflects the extensive process of dialogue with all major stakeholders
in the country, and the agreements with Government on three principal and inter-dependent
areas of strategic focus. These three areas are: (i) promoting private sector development to
achieve economic diversification; (ii) promoting public sector modernization to improve
efficiency and effectiveness; and (iii) promoting social development through improved public
services.
In each area, criteria have been established to guide conceptualization and design of
operations, and also to guide program dialogue to define new operational priorities consistent
with the strategy. The strategy recognizes the particular characteristics of Tobago, and pays
attention to considering, as a crosscutting feature of IDB programs, gender issues. The
strategy allows for flexibility to expand this program in line with possible Bank lending
directly to the private sector and/or to support new operations in the out-years stemming from
the public sector reform “road map” exercise that is now underway. An integral objective of
the strategy is to focus on timely completion of projects and programs currently in execution,
and achievement of their development objectives. The IDB is preparing a mid-term review of
the implementation of the strategy. The review should be completed by the end of 2006 and
will guide discussions with the authorities for future programming exercises.
As of August 29, 2006, the IDB has an active public sector lending portfolio of eight loans
with a total value of US$403 million, of which 57 percent has been disbursed. In addition to
loans for the public sector, the IDB lends directly to the private sector and provides grant
resources through technical cooperations. MIF, an IDB institution providing grant resources
for private sector development, has four operations in execution for an amount of
US$2.8 million.
Following is a brief description of the Bank’s public sector loans in execution by strategic
area.
Promoting private sector development to achieve economic diversification
The IDB Private Sector Development Strategy (PSDS) provides a set of guidelines to
coordinate the actions of the Bank Group in their common goal of fostering the development
of the private sector of Trinidad and Tobago. In this context, the PSDS prioritizes private
sector projects of firms: (i) that target their products to CARICOM and global markets;
(ii) that try to develop nonenergy tradable products; and (iii) that support investments in
social capital formation. To develop the private sector, the PSDS also emphasizes the
improvement of the business climate and the maintenance of a stable macroeconomic
environment. According to the Bank’s Country Strategy the IDB exposure to the private
sector should reach 10 percent of the total Bank exposure in Trinidad and Tobago by 2007.
To date, the following are loans in execution that promote private sector development.

44
In March 2003, the IDB approved a loan of US$5 million for a Trade Sector Support
Program. The operation was developed under a new sector facility and its main objective is
to improve the international trade performance of Trinidad and Tobago. That goal will be
met by strengthening the country’s technical and institutional capacity to formulate and
implement trade policy, to participate effectively in trade negotiations, to implement trade
agreements, and to increase and diversify exports.
In 1996, the IDB approved US$120 million in lending for the National Highway Program.
The program aims to improve and sustain road services provided by the main national road
network, reduce road transportation costs, and provide incentives for the development of
small contractors and microenterprises.
Promoting public sector modernization to improve efficiency
In May 2005, the IDB approved a US$1.5 million loan with the objective of supporting the
preparation and initial implementation of the E-government and Knowledge Brokering
Program—scheduled to be approved by 2006 for US$35 million. This program is designed to
assist Trinidad and Tobago implement its National Information and Communication Plan or
fastforward in the following areas: (a) Legal and Regulatory Framework; (b) E-government;
(c) Human Capital Development; (d) Connectivity; and (e) Enterprise Development in ICT.
In December 2003, the IDB approved a loan of US$5 million for a Public Sector Reform
Initiation Facility. This facility is aimed at the development and initial implementation of a
long-term strategy to modernize the public sector. The plan or “road map,” which will result
from the project through a consensus-building approach, should be ready by December 2006.
It will include actions to improve the composition of public spending by optimizing the size,
management, structure, organization, functioning, human resources, legal framework,
accountability, and service delivery mechanisms of the Government.
Promoting social development through improved public services
In November 2005, the IDB approved a US$750 thousand loan for the preparation of the
Citizen Security program. The project will finance professional services and other technical
support to prepare the components of the Citizen Security Program, and to initiate the
implementation of some smaller pilot activities. The Citizen Security program is scheduled to
be approved by 2006 for US$14 million.
In 2002, the IDB approved funding in the amount of US$32 million to support the National
Settlements Program-Stage Two. The general objective is to establish a more equitable,
transparent and sustainable system of affordable housing, and more specifically to improve
housing conditions for low-income groups. The program includes support for squatter
upgrading, family subsidies and institutional capacity building.
In 1999, the IDB approved financing in the amount of US$l05 million for a Secondary
Education Program. This program's objectives are aimed at providing equitable, high quality
secondary education; updating educational content and teaching methodologies; and
developing a more efficient management of resources at the central and local levels.

45
In 1996, the IDB approved a US$134 million loan for a Health Sector Reform Program in
order to strengthen the policy-making, planning and management capacity of the Ministry of
Health. The program is financing activities aimed at separating health services from
financing and regulatory responsibilities, shifting public expenditures, redirecting private
expenditures to priority areas and finding cost effective solutions; establishing new
administrative and employment structures that encourage accountability, increased
autonomy, improved productivity and efficiency; reducing preventable morbidity and
mortality through lifestyle changes and social interventions; and financial sustainability of
the service delivery system.

46
APPENDIX IV. TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO—STATISTICAL ISSUES
Trinidad and Tobago produces a wide range of economic and financial statistics that are
largely based on sound methodological principles, and data provision is adequate for
surveillance purposes. On September 30, 2004 Trinidad and Tobago started participating in
the IMF’s General Data Dissemination System and hopes to subscribe to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard in the near future. However, institutional arrangements need to be
strengthened to facilitate improved compilation and reporting as well as collaboration among
the central bank, the central statistical office, and the ministry of finance, planning, and
development, and to avoid duplication of data production efforts and some inconsistencies
across sectoral databases.
Real sector
The Central Statistical Office (CSO) makes good use of available source data to produce
annual national accounts. In line with the recommendations of STA technical assistance (TA)
(2000), the CSO has revised the real GDP series by rebasing it from 1985 to 2000, improved
the methodology for calculating production at each sector level, and switched from valuation
at factor cost to market prices. This upgrading of the national accounts involved, in
particular, the inclusion of the large gas sector which came on stream in 2000; and changing
the estimation techniques in the telecommunications sector (by using the number of call units
as opposed to the number of callers) and in the financial sector (by constructing individual
extrapolators for each sub-industry and then aggregating them). A supply and use table was
also completed in 2005 with TA from CARTAC. The central statistical office does not
currently produce quarterly GDP estimates. Although the central bank currently compiles
quarterly indicators of real GDP, eventually the central statistical office should assume
exclusive responsibility for compiling quarterly national accounts and a recent STA mission
on national accounts in September 2005 encouraged the CSO to start the compilation
process. The mission also found that institutional weaknesses at the CSO remain. Although
there is no serious shortage of staff that could affect the production of the statistics, a
reallocation would improve efficiency.
Recently the public can have access to the retail price index directly from the CSO’s website
rather than from the Central Bank who redisseminate the index. The retail price index has
been rebased from 1985 to January 2003 reflecting the 1997/98 Household Budgetary
Survey, and correcting the aggregation formula. The CSO should ensure that a similar
methodology is used to revamp the producer price index.

47
Fiscal accounts
Data on central government operations and debt are compiled separately by the Ministry of
Finance, Planning, and Development (MFPD) and the central bank, and show significant
differences. The authorities should work to reconcile on a regular basis these two sets of data.
Transfers to the revenue stabilization fund are recorded as an expenditure item, but should be
recorded as a financial flow below the line. Data on the nonbank financing are derived as a
residual owing to the absence of reliable data. The national classification system for
government transactions and debt of the central government seems to be sufficiently detailed
for use in compiling data according to GFSM 1986 methodology. No data have been
published in recent Government Finance Statistics Yearbooks (GFSY), but a submission has
been received by STA of cash data for the years 2001 to 2004 classified by the Government
Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) classifications for publication in the 2006
GFSY.
Data on selected public enterprises and statutory bodies are being compiled by the
investment division, the domestic debt division, and the budget division of the MFPD. The
data from these divisions have to be reconciled, particularly on the transfers for debt
servicing, transfers for government capital projects, guaranteed debt, and letters of comfort.
Government capital expenditure should be classified as such, and not as expenditure on other
goods and services.
Monetary accounts
The monthly monetary account for other depository corporations (ODCs) currently covers
only financial institutions that are licensed by the central bank under the 1993 Financial
Institutions Act. Nonlicensed ODCs only report voluntarily on a quarterly basis. No data are
reported by credit unions and the Post Office Savings Bank. The lack of these data has
prevented the compilation of a more comprehensive Depository Corporation Survey. The
authorities should also consider developing systems for reporting balance sheet accounts for
the mutual funds, with a view to compiling a more comprehensive financial survey in the
future. As of August 2006, the authorities have not submitted test data for the standardized
report forms for the submission of monetary statistics.
Balance of payments
Quarterly aggregate balance of payments estimates and annual balance of payments data are
disseminated by the central bank in its national publications. Annual balance of payments
data are also sent to STA, although with some delay. The presentation of the balance of
payments data is in broad conformity with guidelines outlined in the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). The Private Sector Capital Flows and Investor
Perception survey need to be improved on the quantity and quality of responses, and by
estimating market value shares. There are sizable differences between some items of the

48
external public debt compiled by the Central Bank and the MFPD. The Central Bank should
expand its current debt reporting system to include comprehensive coverage of external loans
and debt of the entire public sector, as well as publicly guaranteed debt.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
October 11, 2006

1.
This statement provides additional information that has become available since the
circulation of the staff report on September 21, 2006. This information does not alter the
thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.

3.

Recent data confirm that the economy is operating at full capacity.
•

In the second quarter the unemployment rate was 7.2 percent compared to
8 percent in the same quarter of last year. The 12-month average unemployment
rate fell to 7.2 percent from 7.4 percent in the first quarter.

•

In August, inflation reached 9.0 percent on a year earlier, compared to 8.6 percent
in July. Core inflation fell to 3.9 percent from 4 percent.

The central bank has continued to tighten monetary conditions.
•

Yields on treasury-bills have continued to increased faster than in the U.S. The
spread between U.S. and Trinidad and Tobago short-term interest rates has
widened to 193 basis points, compared to 61 bp in February when rates on
treasury-bills were allowed to rise.

•

The repo rate was increased on September 29 by 25 bp to 8 percent.

•

A remunerated reserve requirement of 2 percent on prescribed liabilities was also
introduced at that time. This additional reserve requirement is remunerated at repo
rate minus 350 bp. In staff’s view, it would have been preferable to set the
remuneration in line with market interest rates.

4.
The FY 2006/07 budget was submitted to parliament. The budget is predicated on
conservative assumptions: real GDP growth of 6.2 percent, inflation of 7 percent, and oil
prices of US$45 per barrel. The budget provides for an increase in pensions and broadens the
eligibility criteria, reduces residential property transfers tax, and increases taxes on tobacco
products and alcohol. Staff estimates indicate that the nonenergy deficit envisaged in the
FY2006/07 budget is in line with projections presented in the staff report.
5.
Staff has obtained additional information on the exchange system-related issues
identified in paragraph 7 of the staff report. However, further information is required
before staff is a position to assess the jurisdictional implications of the developments
observed in the foreign exchange system.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with
Trinidad and Tobago
On October 11, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Trinidad and Tobago.1
Background
Trinidad and Tobago has one of the highest per capita incomes in Latin America and the
Caribbean. Its wealth partially stems from a rich enddowment of oil and gas reserves. The
energy sector accounts for over 40 percent of GDP, about 90 percent of exports, and over half
of government revenues. In terms of broader social and development indicators, Trinidad and
Tobago’s life expectancy and literacy rates are among the highest in the Caribbean, however,
its Human Development Index ranking is slightly above the regional average. Within the
Caribbean region, Trinidad and Tobago is also a regional financial center and a significant
source of capital flows to sovereign and private entities in the Caribbean.
Economic developments continue to be underpinned by a favorable international environment.
Surging energy prices, the exploitation of new gas fields, and an expansion of industrial
capacity helped sustain robust economic activity, contributed to a strengthening of external
accounts, and contributed to excess liquidity in the financial system. However, there are signs
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

that the economy is operating at, or near, potential. Capacity constraints have become evident
in some sectors (notably construction), the labor market has tightened with the unemployment
falling to 6¾ percent—an all time low—and inflation has accelerated.
In 2005, the economy expanded at about 8 percent underpinned by generally strong growth in
the energy sector totaling 8¼ percent. The nonenergy sector also showed signs of strength,
expanding, by 7¾ percent, supported by public infrastructure spending and rapid credit growth
that fueled private spending. Against the backdrop of sustained high energy prices, the
economy is on pace to expand by 12½ in real terms in 2006, driven by double digit growth in
the energy sector in excess of 20 percent.
The balance of payments is in large surplus, reflecting a sharp improvement in the trade
surplus to 24 percent of GDP in 2005. Imports grew by 17 percent but rising energy exports
pushed total exports up by 51 percent. As in previous years, some of the gains on the current
account were offset by private capital outflows but the overall balance of payments surplus
strengthened sharply to 11 percent of GDP in 2005 as compared to about 5½ percent last
year. Net foreign assets continued to rise in 2005 and gross international reserves reached
US$4.8 billion (10 months of imports). Looking ahead, the external sector is set to exhibit a
similar strong performance in 2006 with a projected trade and balance of payments surplus of
about 27 percent of GDP and 15 percent of GDP respectively.
Although rising energy revenues has contributed to an improvement in the government’s
balance sheet, the underlying fiscal position has deteriorated. A rapid increase in public
spending contributed to a widening in the non-energy deficit—the overall deficit excluding
energy revenues—by about 2 percentage points to 10¼ percent of GDP in FY 2004/05. This
outturn reflects rising transfers and subsidies on utilities and fuels and mounting public
investment. Moreover, preliminary figures indicate that the nonenergy deficit rose to nearly
15 percent of GDP, partly reflecting an increase in spending execution of the ambitious public
investment program.
The monetization of foreign currency energy receipts by the government has introduced a
substantial degree of liquidity into the financial system. Although monetary policy was largely
accommodative in 2005, the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago (CBTT) has actively been
trying to regain control of liquidity in the system this year through stepped-up foreign exchange
sales, sustained open market operations, and steady increases in the policy rate. Headline
inflation for the 12-month period ending in August was 9 percent, up from 7¼ percent and
5½ percent at end 2005 and 2004 respectively. Furthermore, core inflation, which excludes
food prices, has reached and remained at 4 percent since July. The CBTT has raised the
benchmark repo rate by a cumulative 300 basis points since February 2005 to 8.0 percent as
of September 2006.

3
Local financial markets have gone through an orderly correction since mid-2005. The local
stock market index has fallen by over 20 percent from its peak in May 2005. Mirroring
developments in the stock market, mutual funds’ growth rate slowed to 16 percent, compared
to an average growth rate of 44 percent in the previous five years. In 2005, the primary bond
market continued to be very active with 37 placements with a face value equivalent to
8 percent of GDP, about one-third in foreign currency. The banking sector remains profitable,
nonperforming loans are low, and provisioning increased compared to last year.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Trinidad and Tobago’s strong economic performance in the
context of a favorable external environment, and noted that economic activity remains robust.
Directors were encouraged by the overall improvement in the external accounts and the
government’s balance sheet.
Directors stressed that the current favorable environment of high energy prices presents both
opportunities for economic development and challenges for macroeconomic management.
They stressed that raising living standards for current and future generations involves striking
a delicate balance of investing energy windfalls efficiently to promote economic diversification
and social objectives, while pacing the use of energy revenues to avoid overheating the
economy and pushing up inflation.
Directors noted that, despite an overall improvement in fiscal balances due to rising energy
receipts, the nonenergy fiscal deficit has widened in recent years with a rapid increase in
public spending. They supported the objectives of the authorities’ development initiatives
through high-quality spending on human development and infrastructure. At the same time,
Directors cautioned that the authorities should exercise greater overall budgetary restraint so
as to avoid putting further upward pressure on inflation and the real exchange rate, which
would have potential implications for the development of the nonenergy sector over the short
and longer run.
While agreeing that fiscal policy has an important role in containing demand pressures in the
near term, Directors underscored that sustainability considerations should ultimately underpin
policy decisions so as to avoid disruptive policy reversals when energy resources are
eventually depleted. In that context, they recommended that the authorities target a nonenergy
deficit of about 10 percent of current GDP over the medium term. Directors welcomed the
submission to Parliament of the Heritage and Stabilization Fund (HSF) bill with the aim of
saving and prudently investing surplus petroleum revenues. They stressed that the
legislation’s effectiveness depends on disciplined fiscal policies, adequate oversight, and
transparency in HSF management in relation with the budget.
Directors considered that the current favorable economic environment provides an opportunity
to improve the quality of fiscal spending. While Directors noted that the authorities have put in
place checks and balances with respect to the special purpose vehicles (SPVs), they pointed

4
out the need to resolve institutional constraints that prompted the creation of these agencies.
In addition, generalized subsidies should be replaced by well-targeted income supporting
programs for the poor. Directors encouraged the authorities to participate in a fiscal ROSC.
As regards monetary policy, Directors agreed that containing mounting inflationary pressures
was a top priority. They encouraged the central bank to continue to tighten monetary policy,
making full use of its instruments to regain control over the stock of excess liquidity in the
system. Given the de facto fixed exchange rate regime, Directors remarked that the central
bank should increase foreign exchange sales, and continue to let treasury bill rates rise to
further tighten the monetary stance. They also encouraged the authorities to address market
characteristics that may have contributed to unsatisfied customer demands for foreign
exchange.
Directors noted that, while the current exchange rate regime had served Trinidad and Tobago
well, the de facto peg could complicate the conduct of macroeconomic policy, given increasing
inflationary pressures from a potentially overheating economy, the monetization of the
nonenergy deficit, and excess liquidity. In this context, they encouraged the authorities to
remain vigilant to accumulating inflation pressures, and take further measures as needed,
including consideration of greater exchange rate flexibility in the medium term in the event that
the positive terms of trade shock persists.
Directors supported the authorities’ structural agenda, which was appropriately focused on
growth and diversification and improved macroeconomic management. They highlighted as
key among the reform priorities to strengthen the financial sector regulatory and supervisory
frameworks. Directors welcomed the progress that has been made in preparing for
consolidated supervision of financial groups and in drafting amendments to financial
institutions and insurance legislation along the lines of the 2005 FSAP recommendations. They
urged the authorities to take this process forward in a timely manner by securing swift passage
of these amendments and draft legislation.
Directors stressed the need to raise productivity in the nonenergy sector by removing
impediments to growth and diversification of the sector. They clarified that diversification
efforts should be firmly based on initiatives to foster the development of the private sector by
improving the business environment. In that respect, Directors stressed that the authorities’
industrial development plans should concentrate on industries that are viable over the long
term without the benefit of government subsidies.
