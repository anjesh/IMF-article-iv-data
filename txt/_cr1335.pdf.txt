STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 8, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context. Following buoyant economy activity in 2011, growth is moderating to
potential, largely reflecting the lagged impact of countercyclical policies and weak
external demand. Inflation remains subdued. A cabinet reshuffling in early September
and ongoing peace negotiations have provided a renewed momentum to structural
reform initiatives.
Policy stance is broadly appropriate. The 2013 budget is in line with medium-term
fiscal consolidation plans. Monetary policy remains broadly neutral, with ample room for
easing if growth surprises on the downside. The central bank continues to strengthen its
international reserves position gradually, and strong FDI inflows continue to exert
pressure on the exchange rate.
Risks. Direct linkages to foreign banks (including from Europe) are limited, but Colombia
is vulnerable to a sharp growth slowdown in trading partners, a steep drop in oil prices,
or a sharp rise in global risk aversion. The flexible exchange rate, the comfortable level of
international reserves reinforced by the FCL arrangement, and low ratios of external and
public debt provide adequate buffers.
Medium-term. Key medium-term challenges are to sustain stable and inclusive growth
with macroeconomic stability, while avoiding overdependence on the volatile
commodity sector. Addressing these challenges would require reforms to boost
competitiveness and productivity and increase national saving. Reforms should focus on
(i) reducing the high rates of informality and structural unemployment, including
through the envisaged tax and pension reforms; (ii) adhering to fiscal consolidation
(while closing the infrastructure gap); and (iii) preserving financial stability and
promoting financial deepening.

COLOMBIA

BACKGROUND
A. Context
1.
Colombia’s economy has been resilient to the adverse global shocks of recent years. A
very strong policy framework—anchored by an inflation-targeting regime, flexible exchange rate,
effective financial supervision and regulation, and a medium-term fiscal framework—and skillful
policy management provided the authorities with policy space to undertake timely and effective
countercyclical measures following the global crisis of late 2008. Growth slowed significantly in 2009,
but output rebounded strongly in 2010 supported by sound macroeconomic policies. Reflecting
these achievements and a marked improvement in security and confidence, Colombia’s sovereign
debt regained investment grade status in 2011. Financial stability has been underpinned by a
resilient banking system and sound framework for regulation and supervision.
2.
The authorities’ macroeconomic policies over the past year have been broadly in line
with Fund advice. As recommended by Directors at the conclusion of the 2011 Article IV
Consultation, fiscal and monetary policy stimulus was gradually unwound to stave off overheating
pressures. The authorities also advanced reforms to bolster the fiscal policy framework,
strengthened financial sector regulation and supervision, and maintained a rules-based system of
foreign exchange intervention.
3.
On May 4, 2012, the Executive Board completed its review and reaffirmed Colombia’s
continued qualification to access resources under the Flexible Credit Line (FCL) arrangement.
Directors agreed that the two-year FCL arrangement for 500 percent of quota, approved on May 6,
2011 in the context of heightened external risks, has supported the authorities’ macroeconomic
strategy, providing insurance against global tail risks. Directors also noted that despite the downside
risks stemming from lingering global uncertainty, Colombia had maintained ample policy space to
mitigate the potential fallout from adverse shocks, and the authorities remained committed to
adjust policies as needed within their rules-based framework.
4.
Exchange system and data. Colombia has a floating exchange regime (de jure and de
facto). Colombia maintains an exchange restriction subject to Fund approval under Article VIII
arising from the special regime for the hydrocarbon sector. Data provision is adequate for
surveillance.

B. Recent Developments
5.
Growth moderated in 2012, reflecting countercyclical policies adopted the previous
year, tepid external demand, and supply shocks. As real GDP growth surged to nearly 6 percent
in 2011 and the output gap closed, the central bank raised the policy rate from 3 percent to
5.25 percent between end-2010 and February 2012. Ripple effects from a weak external
environment and unexpected supply shocks (e.g., disruptions in oil production related to the
guerrilla attacks) also dampened economic activity. Manufacturing and retail sales slowed, and

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

COLOMBIA

consumer and business confidence declined. Output growth in 2012 is projected at 4.3 percent,
supported by the acceleration in budget execution during the second half of the year.
6.
Inflation has been subdued, but unemployment remains high. After peaking at 4 percent
in late 2011, headline inflation fell to 2.8 percent (y-o-y) in November 2012, reflecting the unwinding
of transitory supply factors (e.g. adverse weather conditions), the normalization in policies, and
lower increases of administered prices. Inflation expectations have remained anchored at 3 percent
(the midpoint of the official inflation target band). Strong economic growth in recent years has led
to an increase in labor participation rates and a decline in unemployment (from more than
17 percent in 2002), but the unemployment rate remains high (nearly 10 percent).
7.
Credit growth has eased. Banking credit to the private sector expanded at about
19 percent in real terms in 2011, among the highest in the region (Annex II). Strong aggregate
demand and the entry of retail-lending-oriented foreign banks may have played a role in fueling
strong growth in consumer credit. In response, in May 2012, the authorities increased provisioning
requirements on consumer loans. As a result of this measure and the monetary tightening in 2011,
credit growth slowed from 23.5 percent y/y in September 2011 to 16.1 percent y/y in September
2012.
8.
Financial soundness indicators are relatively strong. The banking system is wellcapitalized and profitable, and nonperforming loans remain low (2.9 percent at end-October 2012)
and well-provisioned (Figure 4), although concentration risk remains a source of fragility. In
November 2012, the authorities intervened and liquidated assets of the largest brokerage firm,
Interbolsa, after it failed to meet a loan repayment; the authorities indicated that losses were small
and did not pose systemic risk. Nonetheless, to prevent contagion, the central bank created a
temporary liquidity facility for other brokerage firms.
9.
The strong balance of payments, particularly FDI inflows, continues to put upward
pressure on the peso. Despite high export prices and the moderation in growth, the external
current account deficit remained broadly unchanged at 3 percent of GDP during 2012, reflecting the
strong demand for investment-related imports, and large profit repatriations by foreign firms. That
said, the current account deficit continues to be more than offset by a sizable surplus in the financial
account largely driven by net FDI inflows. Reflecting this, the surplus in the balance of payments is
likely to be close to US$5.2 billion (US$3.8 billion in 2011) and the nominal exchange rate
appreciated by about almost 7 percent through November 2012.
10.
The macroeconomic policy stance during 2012 was broadly neutral. Amidst a slightly
more pronounced economic slowdown than anticipated, the central bank lowered the policy rate by
75 bps in the second half of the year. In addition, it extended its program of daily purchases of
foreign exchange (of at least US$20 million) until March 2013. Fiscal consolidation, as measured by
the structural balance, is estimated to have been somewhat stronger than envisaged in the mediumterm fiscal framework, reflecting higher tax revenues (linked to windfall gains in the oil-sector in
2011) and lower-than-expected expenditures. Measured in terms of the non-oil balance (a metric

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

COLOMBIA

that captures better the effects of fiscal policy in commodity-producing countries), the fiscal stance
is estimated to have been broadly unchanged.

C. Outlook and Risks
11.
In 2013, growth is expected to rise to potential and inflation to remain on target.
Higher public investment spending, favorable export prices and continued large FDI inflows are
expected to sustain a moderate expansion in domestic demand, with growth envisaged to settle at
about staff’s estimate of Colombia’s potential growth rate (4½ percent). Staff projects that inflation
will remain close to the mid-point of the central bank’s 2−4 percent inflation target range. The
external current account deficit is expected to remain at about 3 percent of GDP.
12.
Short-term risks to the outlook continue to be tilted to the downside owing to global
uncertainties. Colombia has not been significantly affected by the financial turmoil in Europe, as
direct financial linkages are limited (Annex I). However, it remains vulnerable to a sharp
intensification of the global downturn (e.g., through a worsening of the euro area crisis, an
unsatisfactory resolution of the U.S. fiscal cliff, or a hard landing in China) and to a steep drop in oil
prices (which could adversely affect Colombia’s commodity exports, remittances, and FDI). In
addition, a sharp rise in global risk aversion could increase Colombia’s risk premium, dent
confidence, and slow economic growth. Domestic credit growth, albeit still at a high level, has
declined significantly during 2012, dissipating concerns of overheating pressures. Mitigating factors
of high credit growth include the low level of financial deepening and household debt, resilient
corporate balance sheets, and low risks of currency mismatches in banks (Annex II).
13.
The authorities broadly agreed with the outlook and characterization of key risks. Staff
forecasts of actual and potential growth are in line with those of the central bank and the consensus
of market analysts. However, the government expects the economy to grow by 4.8 percent in
2012−13, buoyed by strong public investment. The government also considers that Colombia’s
potential growth rate has risen to about 5 percent as a result of high investment rates in recent
years.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions focused on the macroeconomic policy mix for 2013 and on policies and
reforms to sustain strong and inclusive growth, while preserving macroeconomic stability.
These include pending fiscal reforms, including to the tax and pension systems, measures
to strengthen financial supervision and regulation, and policies aimed at reducing
structural unemployment and labor market informality.

A. Near-Term Policy Mix
14.
The broadly neutral macroeconomic policy stance expected for 2013 seems adequate.
Staff noted that the 2013 budget is in line with the government’s medium-term fiscal consolidation
plans and includes a welcome increase in public investment on infrastructure. Combined with a
policy interest rate that is near or below the neutral rate, the policy stance is conducive to output
expanding at its potential rate and inflation remaining within the 2−4 percent target range. The
authorities agreed, but considered that the economy had slowed more than expected in 2012. Weak
global conditions depressed external demand for Colombia’s exports, especially in the
manufacturing and agricultural sectors, underscoring the central bank’s decisions to cut policy
interest rates in the second half of the year. The authorities stressed that inflation expectations
remain well anchored at 3 percent.
15.
There was agreement that Colombia is well-positioned to cope with downside risks.
The authorities agreed that there are ample buffers to absorb adverse shocks. Monetary policy and
the flexible exchange rate would remain key shock absorbers. International reserves are at relatively
comfortable levels, reinforced by the FCL arrangement, and the ratios of external and public debt
are low. With inflation projected close to the target, staff advised that further monetary easing could
be considered if downside risks materialize, but noted that discretionary fiscal expansion should be
considered only if the growth slowdown is too large.

B. Enhancing External Stability
16.
The authorities agreed that Colombia’s overall external position was relatively strong.
The government has accessed international capital markets at increasingly favorable terms and the
current account deficit is predominantly financed by stable FDI inflows (Annex III). The external debt
ratio remains low and is expected to decline over the medium term (Figure 8), reflecting low
borrowing from corporations, banks and the public sector. Colombia’s international investment
position has improved over the decade, and the share of FDI is high compared to peer countries.
The level of international reserves is relatively comfortable, according to several metrics (Figure 6).
17.
The real exchange rate appreciation and persistent current account deficits in recent
years mainly reflect underlying fundamentals. The results of the Fund’s pilot External Balance
Assessment (EBA) exercise indicate that an improvement in terms of trade and other fundamentals
have driven much of the appreciation in the real exchange rate since 2004 (Annex III). EBA results

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

COLOMBIA

nonetheless suggest that the current account deficit is larger, and the real exchange rate is more
appreciated (by 1−8 percent), than levels that can be explained by fundamentals and desirable
policies. Staff considers that taking into account key country-specific factors (such as the large profit
repatriations by multinationals investing in Colombia and the strong import demand associated with
the recent expansion in exploration and development of the oil and mining sectors), the current
account and the real exchange rate are broadly in line with fundamentals.
18.
The authorities also are of the view that the exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals. They noted that the results of the EBA exercise for Colombia yield large unexplained
residuals and the central bank’s models indicate that exchange rate overvaluation is at most
10 percent. They emphasized that the current account deficit has been stable, and comfortably
financed by FDI inflows, limiting vulnerabilities.
19.
There was agreement that domestic policies can play a role in containing appreciation
pressures and improving the current account. The authorities plan to improve the fiscal balance
over time and lower the structural balance to 2.3 percent by 2014, but staff argued that a faster pace
of consolidation could help further mitigate appreciation pressures. The authorities noted that the
recent reform of the royalty system would also contribute to increasing national savings. They also
emphasized that factors different from the exchange rate were critical for competitiveness. In this
regard, they viewed reforms to reduce labor market informality and an improvement in the country’s
infrastructure as key to raising productivity and export potential. Agricultural reforms and measures
to enhance the business environment and security also would be important. The authorities also
highlighted their recent efforts to diversify export markets and products by negotiating free trade
agreements with several trading partners.
20.
The central bank’s intervention policy is geared at containing exchange rate volatility
and strengthening external buffers. Staff supported the goals of reducing volatility and gradually
building international reserves in line with the growth of trade and economic activity, and noted that
those objectives were consistent with the inflation targeting framework.1 Staff argued, and the
authorities concurred, that although intervention in the foreign exchange market may slow the pace
of nominal appreciation, it would not be effective in altering the path of the equilibrium real
exchange rate. Staff advised the government to communicate clearly that its recent foreign asset
purchases were part of the asset management strategy associated with the royalty reform (¶23), and
not an attempt to influence the level of the exchange rate.
21.
Colombia’s exchange restrictions have changed since the last Article IV consultation.
The multiple currency practice and exchange restriction arising from a tax on outward remittances of
nonresident profits earned before 2007 and retained in the country for less than five years phased
out on January 1, 2012. However, the authorities have no plans to remove the exchange restriction

The issuance of Treasury bills to sterilize the foreign exchange intervention operations made by the government as
part of its asset management strategy have been coordinated with the central bank. Proceeds from the issuance of
Treasury bills for this purpose will be deposited in a government account at the central bank.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

arising from the special regime for the hydrocarbon sector, in which branches of foreign
corporations are required to either surrender their export proceeds or agree to a government
limitation on their access to foreign exchange. The authorities noted that the special regime serves
to minimize foreign exchange volatility and that participation in the special regime is voluntary, and
bestows advantages such as the simplification in reporting requirements of the offshore foreign
exchange operations of those branches. While Colombia is free under the Articles to impose
surrender requirements and to exempt the application of these requirements, conditioning such
exemptions to the acceptance of limitations on the availability of foreign exchange for the making
of current payments and transfers for current international transactions is inconsistent with a
member’s obligation under Article VIII, Section 2(a) of the Fund’s Articles. This obligation cannot be
modified or contracted away by members in agreement with third parties.

C. Strengthening the Fiscal Policy Framework
22.
The authorities are committed to continue strengthening Colombia’s fiscal framework.
Constraints on sub-national fiscal balance were introduced during the late 1990s, and a fiscal
responsibility law (underpinning the formulation of a medium-term fiscal framework) was approved
in 2003. In 2011, the government adopted reforms to strengthen the management and distribution
of oil and mining royalties, added a fiscal sustainability principle as a constitutional criterion, and
enacted a fiscal rule on the central government balance that would lower the structural deficit to
2.3 percent of GDP by 2014 and keep it below 1 percent from 2022 onwards.2 In 2012, the
government outlined its debt management strategy, focused on minimizing risks and costs, with a
composition tilted towards domestic debt. The momentum for structural fiscal reform initiatives has
gathered further steam, following the cabinet reshuffling in early September and the peace
negotiations with the insurgence group launched in October.
23.
The implementation of recent fiscal reforms is on track. As mandated by the new oil and
mining royalty regime, in 2012 the government formulated a bi-annual royalty-funded capital
budget and created investment committees to approve viable projects. In addition, the government
made the initial contribution to a savings fund to smooth regions’ royalty-related spending, through
the purchase of US$500 million in the foreign exchange market. In mid-2012, the government
created two technical committees that will provide inputs on the output gap and structural oil prices
to the Consultative Committee charged with devising the methodology and other operational
aspects of the structural fiscal balance rule for the central government (Annex IV) to ensure the full
implementation of the rule in 2013. Staff recommended prudence in the choice of structural oil
prices to make those calculations, arguing that a sharp and persistent decline in oil prices was a key
risk to the fiscal position.

2

The authorities have received technical assistance from the IMF to further improve their framework in a number of
areas, including fiscal rule, the fiscal regime for oil and mining, revenue administration, and pension reform.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

COLOMBIA

24.
Staff advised adopting more ambitious targets for medium-term fiscal consolidation.
The authorities considered that the pace of fiscal consolidation implied by the structural balance
targets is sufficient to continuing reducing the public debt ratio and preserve fiscal sustainability.
Staff agreed, but argued that a more ambitious medium-term target could help ease pressures on
the currency, as well as build buffers against adverse commodity price shocks and potential
exhaustibility of commodity resources.
25.
Staff recommended that fiscal consolidation focuses on revenue mobilization. The
government’s medium-term fiscal framework projects a decline in revenue ratios over time, largely
as a result of the scheduled phasing out of the financial transactions tax and the wealth tax starting
in 2014. This decline in the revenue ratio is to be offset by lower capital spending, despite the
existing infrastructure gap, high inequality and the need to raise productivity in the medium-term.
Staff stressed the importance of more than offsetting this decline in order to increase the noncommodity revenue ratio (which is among the lowest in the region). It noted that higher noncommodity revenues would help create fiscal space for the much-needed increase in public
infrastructure and help reduce the budget’s exposure to oil price swings.
26.
Congress recently approved a comprehensive tax reform. The authorities are confident
that the replacement of payroll taxes (parafiscales) with a component of the corporate income tax
contained in the proposal will reduce non-wage labor costs and spur employment creation. In
addition, the tax reform proposal would simplify and improve fairness in personal income taxes and
reduce the number of VAT rates. More generally, the proposal aims at improving the income
distribution, curbing incentives to remain in the informal sector, facilitating tax administration and
enhancing compliance. The authorities emphasized that reforms to the structure of the tax system
were more pressing than increasing the revenue intake, because reducing labor informality and
unemployment were key planks of the government’s strategy (Annex V). They also noted that by
raising employment and long-term growth, the tax reform would eventually increase revenues.
27.
Staff agreed with the authorities’ intention to reform the public pension system to
improve coverage and fairness. Current parameters of the public pension system and
constitutional restrictions on minimum contributions and benefits significantly limit coverage and
skew pension access to the high income pensioners. The government is considering options for
reform, as well as other initiatives to support elderly low-income workers. Staff noted that the new
government-subsidized savings program (BEPS) for informal workers was useful, but would not be a
sufficient solution. Staff also advised reviewing the health care system to ensure that costs are
contained and to encourage participation in the contributory regime.

D. Preserving Financial Stability
28.
As discussed in the companion Financial System Stability Assessment, the financial
health of Colombia’s credit institutions appears sound. Credit quality is strong and banks are
quite profitable, largely because borrowers have strong balance sheets. Funding is stable, relying
mostly on domestic deposits and only minimally on short-term wholesale funding. The stress tests

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

COLOMBIA

show that Colombian banks appear resilient to a variety of shocks, although some vulnerabilities do
arise from the high concentration of the commercial loan portfolio to large corporate borrowers.
The FSAP noted that fostering capital and money market deepening and promoting financial
inclusion would help reduce concentration risk. Nonbank financial intermediaries generally have
been performing well.
29.
All financial institutions are effectively supervised by the Financial Superintendency of
Colombia (SFC). The broad authority of the SFC offers several critical benefits, including the ability
to develop a common supervisory framework for the financial sector, secure information on financial
groups, and contain regulatory arbitrage. Because of the broad regulatory perimeter, there are
several critical supervisory issues that apply to all financial institutions. In particular, the SFC has
considerable de facto independence to undertake operations required by its mandates, and the
supervisor carries out his functions with no political interference. However, its de jure independence
could be strengthened. Also, the SFC would benefit from the adoption of a law extending its full
regulatory and supervisory powers to holding companies of financial institutions and the extension
of legal protection for good faith actions taken in discharging official duties. The adoption of a
Basel II, Pillar II supervisory review process would give the SFC a clearer mandate to tailor prudential
norms to the risks of each bank. In addition, the financial safety net could be strengthened by
shortening and clarifying the resolution process and developing an action plan to deal with systemic
events.

STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
Colombia’s economic performance in recent years has been very strong. The economy
has been resilient to adverse shocks, growth rates have been relatively high and stable, and inflation
has been low. The cornerstone of these achievements has been a strong policy framework, prudent
macroeconomic management, and a sound and well-supervised financial system.
31.
Macroeconomic performance remained favorable in 2012. The moderation of growth is
largely a result of the prudent countercyclical policies adopted to tame high credit growth and
overheating pressures in 2011 and weak external demand.
32.
The broadly neutral policy stance planned for 2013 is appropriate. The output gap is
closed and output growth is expected to converge toward its potential rate of 4½ percent in 2013.
Moreover, inflation remains subdued and expectations well anchored at the midpoint of the
inflation target band.
33.
There is ample space to adjust policies if downside risks materialize. Spillovers from the
global turmoil have been limited so far, but Colombia is vulnerable to a sharp worsening in the
external environment. Monetary policy retains room for easing if growth surprises on the downside,
and the flexible exchange rate should continue to serve as a shock absorber. A comfortable level of
international reserves reinforced by the FCL arrangement, and low ratios of external and public debt
provide additional buffers.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

COLOMBIA

34.
Despite strong recent economic performance, medium-term challenges remain. The
economy and public finances are becoming increasingly dependent on the volatile oil and mining
sectors. Moreover, despite strong growth, unemployment and income inequality remain high and
labor productivity low. Addressing these challenges will require decisive actions to boost
competitiveness, reduce the high rates of informality and structural unemployment, increase
national saving, and diversify exports.
35.
The external position has been stable. The current account and the real exchange rate are
broadly in line with fundamentals. The current account deficit is expected to remain comfortably
financed by large FDI inflows to the hydrocarbon sector. These inflows and related imports, rather
than flows driven by short-term factors, are the principal source of exchange rate appreciation. In
view of this, medium-term reforms and fiscal consolidation would be key for boosting
competitiveness and productivity, raising national saving, and easing appreciation pressures. The
central bank’s strategy of gradual preannounced purchases of foreign exchange is appropriate for
continuing to strengthen the external position. The government should communicate clearly that its
recent foreign asset purchases were part of an asset management strategy and not an attempt to
influence the level of the exchange rate.
36.
Fiscal consolidation over the medium term could be more ambitious, and focused on
revenue mobilization. A faster pace of fiscal consolidation or more ambitious fiscal target could
help mitigate pressure on the currency, and further build buffers against adverse shocks. An increase
in non-commodity revenues would ensure fiscal space for public investment in infrastructure, and
help reduce the budget’s exposure to oil prices swings.
37.
Staff welcomes the tax reform recently approved by Congress and the plans for
pension reform. The measures to reduce non-wage labor costs, lower the regressivity of the tax
system, and facilitate compliance go in the right direction. Staff also supports the plans to increase
coverage and fairness in the pension system, further reducing incentives for informality.
38.
The financial system appears resilient to a wide range of shocks and is effectively
supervised, although there is scope for further improvements. In particular, further efforts would
be useful to improve the risk-based approach to supervision in line with Pillar 2 of the Basel II
framework, promote the independence and legal protection of supervisors, strengthen the financial
safety net, guard against concentration risks, and extend supervisory and regulatory powers to
holding companies of financial institutions.
39.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation takes place on the standard
12­month cycle.

Annex I. Risks and Channels of Contagion1
1.
Colombia is navigating the current episode of global turbulence from a position of
strength. Macroeconomic management has been underpinned by a strong policy framework,
including a flexible exchange rate and inflation targeting regime. In recent years, the authorities
have considerably strengthened the policy and prudential frameworks, including by adopting
fiscal responsibility legislation, and enhancing financial sector supervision. This strong record of
macroeconomic management has allowed a decline in debt-to-GDP ratios and an increase in
financial and external buffers.
2.
Despite the strong policy framework, the Colombian economy remains exposed to
external shocks.
Trade and FDI linkages have increased. Trade openness, as measured by the sum of total
exports and imports, has increased from 28 percent of GDP in 2000 to 34 percent of GDP in
2011, largely reflecting the increase in oil and mining exports. FDI inflows have also been
strong, averaging 4 percent of GDP, and are heavily concentrated in those sectors. The share
of government’s commodity-based revenue has also increased to 14 percent of total central
government revenue (up from 6 percent in 2005). Colombia has thus become a major
commodity exporter, with its current account, public finances, and activity heavily influenced
by world commodity prices. In addition, Colombia remains heavily dependent on U.S. and
European Union markets despite progress in increasing trade with neighboring countries
(Peru, Brazil and Chile). Therefore, a protracted global recession or a hard landing in China (a
major market for Colombian commodity exports), could be detrimental to growth and
government revenues.

Direct financial linkages are limited, but a deterioration in global sentiment would
have an adverse impact. Foreign bank participation, at 22 percent of banking assets, is
lower than in regional peers. European banks (comprising two Spanish banks) account for
only 11 percent of banking assets. Colombian banks and non-financial corporations have
limited foreign borrowing, either through cross-border banking loans or bonds, especially
from the Euro area. Reflecting regulatory and tax barriers, portfolio inflows and non-resident
holdings of public debt remain low in comparison to regional peers. That said, a sharp rise in
global risk aversion or global interest rates, could affect Colombia’s relatively low but fluid
access to external financing or, in an extreme case, lower FDI inflows.

with new technologies and business models,
which resulted in a large increase in credit card business. The government’s program to subsidize
interest payments of mortgages, as part of the fiscal stimulus implemented in 2009, may also
have contributed to credit growth.
2.
The benefits from the strong credit expansion are likely to have been sizeable, but
new vulnerabilities have arisen. These include:
A shift in credit composition towards
household consumption. The share of
consumer loans in total credit has increased
to almost 30 percent (up from 18 percent in
2004). Mortgages, however, account for only
12 percent of total credit. The caps on
mortgage rates (at 10 and 12 percent for
social and non-social housing, respectively)
may exclude some higher-risk debtors from
the mortgage market and tilt their borrowing
toward short-term consumer finance.

Credit growth in recent years has mainly reflected an increase in the average size of
loans rather than in the number of debtors. The exception to this has been micro-finance.
Thus, the expansion in banking credit has not brought a commensurate increase in the
population’s access to the banking system, which would help promote investment and
reduce concentration risk.

Risks from currency mismatches and
floating interest rates appear contained.
Reflecting strict regulations on foreign
currency-denominated operations and
banks’ net open positions, local currency
loans account for 93 percent of bank loans.
Moreover, more than half of the banks do
not offer any foreign currency loans.
Housing and microcredit loans are generally
denominated in local currency. On average,
51 percent of loans are contracted at a
floating rate. Most loans for consumption,
mortgage and microcredit carry a fixed rate.

Nonperforming loans (NPLs) are manageable. NPLs increased during the global financial
crisis, reaching 4 percent at end-2009, but have since declined, partially due to increased
write-offs during this period. NPL ratios vary by portfolio, with consumer and micro loans
exhibiting slightly higher ratios at 4.8 and 4.5 percent, respectively, and commercial and
housing at 1.8 and 2.5 percent, respectively. Provisions appear adequate, covering
163 percent of total NPLs (one-fifth of the provisions come from the dynamic provisioning
system).

A 300 basis point interest shock will reduce the average ICR to 13 percent and will increase the share of firms
financially stressed to 23 percent and the debt-at-risk to 38 percent.

Annex III. External Sector Assessment1
Results from the External Balance Assessment (EBA) suggest that Colombia’s current
account is weaker than its medium-term norm and its exchange rate is above levels
that can be explained by underlying fundamentals and desirable policies. Key countryspecific characteristics, such as the large profit repatriation by foreign firms investing
in Colombia and the recent expansion of the oil and mining sectors, do not seem to be
appropriatetely captured in those results. Domestic policies that strengthen the
current account balance can play a role in addressing the appreciation pressure,
including continued fiscal consolidation, enhancing productivity through labor market
reforms, and efforts to diversify export markets and products.

A. Current Account
1.
Colombia has had a current account (CA) deficit since 2001, which widened after
the global financial crisis, despite improvements in terms of trade and an expansion of the
commodity sector. A strong oil balance owing

Moreover, recent trade data indicate that the
recovery of exports to Venezuela has accelerated. While products heavily reliant on the
Venezuelan market, such as textile and paper products, have not fully recovered, some other
exports, such as chemicals and metal-related products, have been growing steadily.

3.
The results of the CA regression approach of the pilot External Balance Assessment
(EBA) indicate that Colombia’s actual CA deficit is close to its norm, with a large
unexplained residual offset by policy gaps. Some country-specific characteristics might not be
well captured in the analysis. According to the results, Colombia’s cyclically-adjusted CA norm in
2012 is -2.6 percent of GDP, compared to an actual cyclically-adjusted CA balance of ­2.7 percent
of GDP.


In terms of the cyclical adjustment, the higher terms of trade is more than offset by the
relative output gap; although Colombia’s output gap is almost closed, its main trading
partners have larger negative output gaps on average.



The total CA gap of -0.2 percent of GDP can be divided into policy gaps (fiscal balance, social
spending, capital controls, and international reserves), which total 2.2 percent of GDP (of

weakening terms of trade on exports. The recent rate of profit repatriation has been high, but is
expected to decline in percent of GDP in line with the projected gradual decline of oil prices.

B. Capital Flows and International Investment Position
5.
Since 2005, Colombia has received
capital inflows in the range of 5‒8 percent of
GDP, mainly in the form of FDI. Inflows into
Colombia have been stable compared to those
in other countries where the share of portfolio
and other short-term flows is larger. The
increase in other investment inflows in 2010−11
reflects external borrowing to finance FDI by
Colombian corporations and financial
institutions, while equity inflows have also
increased against the background of favorable
growth prospects.

6.
FDI inflows to Colombia are projected to remain at large owing to its strong
medium-term fundamentals. In order for the oil and mining sectors to maintain their current
level of production, FDI inflows are necessary. Colombia’s investment climate is assessed to be
42nd of 183 countries in World Bank indicators on ease of doing business, which is higher than
some regional peers. The improved security situations relative to the 1990s and earlier also boost
Colombia’s status as one of the main investment destinations in Latin America.
7.
Despite their recent increase, portfolio and other short-term inflows to Colombia
remain relatively low. Colombia’s relatively small financial markets, partly a result of tight
regulations on currency and maturity mismatches and net foreign exchange positions, is part of
the reason. The absence of short-term instruments, and requirements for participation of foreign
investors in the Colombian market (such as the requirement that their transactions be
undertaken through a Colombia-based custodian or broker) are the others.

40

8.
Colombia’s net international
investment position (IIP) and, in particular,
its composition have improved with
increasing share of FDI liabilities. The net IIP
position in 2011 rose to ­24 percent of GDP,
from -30 percent in 2003. Liabilities amount to
54 percent of GDP, and the share of FDI in total
liabilities increased from 23 percent in 2000 to
54 percent in 2011, which is relatively high.
Colombia’s net IIP position and level of external
debt are relatively low compared to its peer
countries.

C. Real Exchange Rate
9.
The real exchange rate has been trending upwards since 2004. The EBA’s real
exchange rate (RER) regression approach points to commodity terms of trade and the output
gap (relative to Colombia’s trade partners) as main drivers of an appreciation of the equilibrium
exchange rate, consistent with the results of the CA regression approach (see Section A above).
10.
The EBA results indicate that the real
exchange rate is overvalued by a range of 1 to
8 percent, but large residuals warrant caution in
interpreting the assessment. The RER regression
approach points to an overvaluation of about
8 percent in 2012, after taking into account policy
gaps of -10 percent, including from the fiscal
balance and financial openness. The CA regression
approach suggests a CA gap of ­0.2 percent of GDP

D. Volatility in the Nominal Exchange Rate
12.
The nominal exchange rate has
fluctuated broadly in parallel with those in
other countries in the region. There have
been noticeable short-term fluctuations in
recent years—for example, the peso
appreciated by 12 percent in the first six
months of 2011 but returned to end-2010 level
by November, then appreciated again by 12
percent from December 2011 to April 2012 and
became more stable thereafter. These
fluctuations appear to be driven by changes in
the degree of global risk aversion.

Annex IV. Operationalizing Colombia’s Structural Balance
Fiscal Rule11
1.
Colombia introduced a structural fiscal balance rule for the central government in
2011 as part of a reform package to further strengthen the fiscal framework. The new rule
will provide a stabilizing and sustainable anchor for its fiscal policy by basing policy decisions on
the country’s underlying fiscal position adjusting for the impact of economic and commodity
cycles. This framework helps avoid pro-cyclical fiscal policies that undermine macroeconomic
stability and long-term public finances.
2.
The aim of the structural balance rule is to help insulate fiscal policy decisions from
cyclical developments and to smooth the use of revenue gains over time. The law
establishes a ceiling on the central government structural deficit of 1 percent of GDP effective in
2022 and mandates that windfall revenues be saved in a stabilization fund. The resources in the
stabilization fund could be used to finance counter-cyclical stimulus during years in which the
output gap is negative and real growth is projected to lag potential growth by 2 percentage
points or more. The law also establishes an independent advisory commission to help
operationalize the rule and assess its implementation.
3.
To implement the fiscal rule, the

revenues can be derived on an aggregated
basis; and the reference price and reference production level for oil can be based on relatively
short moving averages of past and projected future oil prices and production volumes,
respectively. One-off factors could be removed to better measure the underlying fiscal position,
but should be used very sparingly to preserve transparency and credibility of the rule. Over the
next two or three years, a more sophisticated approach could be developed where the output
gap is estimated using a production function approach, revenue elasticities are estimated relative
to individual taxes and tax bases, and additional commodities are added to the calculation once
they contribute a substantial amount to government revenues.

4.
An important policy decision facing the authorities is on what basis to save windfall
oil revenues. The method for determining the reference price for oil has a key influence on the
degree of savings and smoothing of oil price fluctuations. Basing the reference price on a long
backward-looking moving average (MA) approach would typically provide a greater degree of
smoothing compared to approaches emphasizing shorter moving averages including current and
projected future prices. A long backward-looking MA approach would also generate more
savings if oil prices trend upward over time. However, this approach could also undermine
credibility and acceptance of the rule if it leads to significant over-saving. Likewise, if oil prices
trend down over long periods, the associated under-saving could threaten fiscal sustainability,
especially if the price decline occurred before a sufficient savings buffer had been built.
According to staff calculations, a symmetric (forward and backward) MA approach would be
likely to deliver structural balances consistent with the authorities’ 2014 target while also building
some windfall savings.

2.
Redistribution through fiscal policy is largely ineffective due to distortions in the
institutional and policy framework. Public monetary transfers and tax policy (direct and
indirect) are key policy levers to reduce income inequality. In Colombia, institutional policy
weaknesses in these areas have contributed to high inequality.3 A recent World Bank report
characterized Colombia’s tax system as overly complex, inefficient—as measured by revenue
yields using regional and developmental metrics—and regressive. The report attributed these
deficiencies to the pervasive use of tax expenditures. Specifically, tax expenditures, which have
increased by 60 percent over the past decade, have seriously eroded the tax base (by an
estimated 4½ percent of GDP) and generally benefit the richest segment of the population, thus
compromising the system’s redistributive potential. Additionally, Colombia’s public pension
system is regressive, with 86 percent of all pension payments being received by the richest

Pre market income inequality (i.e. pre tax and transfers) in Colombia is similar to that observed in the United

quintile of the population, and has low coverage (only 25 percent of the population). Labor
market studies have also identified high non-wage costs and the rapid real increases in the
minimum wage as main contributing factors to the high structural unemployment and
informality, which in turn perpetuate a cycle of poverty (see 2011 Article IV Consultation). Finally,
the tradition of linking the increase in monetary transfers—such as the minimum pension
payment—to minimum wage growth has, in practice, effectively reduced the resource envelope
that could be dedicated to other redistributive initiatives.

3.
The government considers reducing income inequality to be a policy priority and
has taken some modest measures. The National Development Plan targets a reduction of
1 percentage point in the Gini coefficient per year between 2010 and 2014, and the
administration has introduced several policy measures that may help in achieving this objective.
The recently approved Victim’s Law is likely to improve land distribution. A 2010 tax reform
increased the rate and base of the wealth tax paid by corporations and individuals, but is a
temporary measure that lapses in 2014. The government is making progress in phasing in
universal and equal access to healthcare, and the recent reform of the royalty system from
natural resource production implies a more equitable distribution of revenue across sub-national
entities. Finally, a recent tax reform approved by Congress has equity as a main objective.
4.
A comprehensive and coordinated overhaul of existing institutional redistributive
frameworks could achieve multiple priority policy objectives. Strengthening inclusive growth,
improving economic efficiency, and securing needed fiscal savings to safeguard fiscal
sustainability are not mutually exclusive objectives. A holistic tax reform package coupled with
other priority structural reforms could make meaningful progress on all these fronts. For
example, streamlining the VAT system, including by consolidating VAT rates and eliminating VAT
exemptions (except on health, education, transport and leasing), alongside reforms to the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

47

COLOMBIA

personal income tax system that (i) eliminate the exemption on the first 25 percent of income;
(ii) remove the deduction for other voluntary savings accounts; and (iii) introduce the taxation of
pension income in line with international best practice, are estimated to generate fiscal savings in
the order of 2½ percent of GDP. Part of these savings could be allocated to increasing
Colombia’s conditional cash transfer program, which has proven to be an effective poverty
reducing scheme. This tax overhaul could be complemented by parametric reforms to the public
pension system—including equalizing and increasing the retirement ages for men and women,
reducing replacement rates for new retirees, and imposing a 10 percent surcharge on highincome retires—to help improve equity and secure important fiscal savings.41Finally, Colombia’s
tradition of linking the increases in fiscal transfers to the growth in the minimum wage could be
dismantled.

4

A recent Fund TA mission estimated that these reforms would generate fiscal savings of 1 percent of GDP over
the long-term. Nevertheless, even after these reforms, Colombia’s replacement rate would remain among the
highest in the world and additional fiscal measures would be necessary to meet the targets under the fiscal rule.
In this context, a fuller range of pension reform measures should be considered, including increases in the degree
and magnitude of contribution rates as well as shifting to a framework where benefits are calculated on the basis
of average lifetime incomes.

WORLD BANK RELATIONS1
The current IBRD Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY 12‒16 aims to support selectively
Colombia’s National Development Plan. The World Bank Group (WBG) is stepping up efforts to
enhance development impact through selectivity, as a means to provide added value to the country.
The WBG has been carrying out activities for which the Government or the private sector have
expressed explicit need either through financial, knowledge, or convening services. These activities
are combined as a results-focused package of support grouped under three strategic themes:
(a) Expanding Opportunities for Social Prosperity; (b) Sustainable Growth with Enhanced Climate
Change Resilience; and (c) Inclusive Growth with Enhanced Productivity. Each of these strategic
themes has three areas of results with specified outcomes. In some cases, outcomes in this CPS
cannot solely be attributed to the WBG since activities are often jointly accomplished with the
Government or other partners.
For FY 13‒16 the lending program is expected to be US$800−1,000 million per annum. Actual
delivery of the lending program will depend on Colombia’s performance, IBRD lending capacity,
demand from other borrowers, global economic developments, and disbursement profiles that keep
exposure within the country limits.
Trust funds have continued to be an integral part of the Bank’s engagement with Colombia. As trust
fund resources are not predictable for the purpose of the CPS, the WBG is ensuring that activities
financed by trust funds follow the thrust of this strategy in agreement with the government
counterparts.
The CPS thematic areas are managed under an enhanced thematic business model approach. This
approach aims to improve the impact of the Bank’s engagement in Colombia. Financial, knowledge,
and convening services are developed as a comprehensive package of support under each theme to
deliver timely and flexible development solutions.
As of end of November 2012, Colombia was among the 10 top Bank borrowers in terms of
IBRD exposure with US$7.4 billion debt outstanding, representing close to 6.8 percent of the
IBRD's total portfolio. Net commitments currently stand at US$2.5 billion of which US$1.2 billion
remains undisbursed. The active portfolio is composed of 21 IBRD projects. During FY 12, the Bank
approved three projects for a total of US$600 million. Total FY 13 lending is envisaged at around
US$700 million and FY 14 US$450 million.

INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK RELATIONS2
The Bank’s ongoing country strategy with Colombia (2012–2014) identifies the main targets
of engagement in the areas of Transportation, Science, Technology, and Innovation, Trade
and Integration, Access to Financial Services, Education and Vocational Training, Social
Protection, Health, Water Supply and Sanitation, Housing and Urban Development, Risk
Management.3 These areas are part of a comprehensive vision for the development process of the
country, aimed at creating a “virtuous circle” between the objectives of increased growth, and
reducing poverty and inequality. There are cross-cutting requirements associated with these areas,
in order to overcome conditions of poverty and inequity, which are: (i) targeting actions and
resources to a balanced, multidimensional approach to regional development in relation to public
management and competitiveness, and (ii) recognizing both infrastructure development, and human
and social capital development, as necessary factors for greater competitiveness, stronger
institutions and better governance.
The sovereign guarantee lending envelope under the current Strategy was estimated at
US$852 million per year, which total US$3.40 billion for the years 2012 to 2014. During 2012 the
Bank approved US$508 million in sovereign guarantee operations, non-sovereign guarantee lending
reached US$7.2 million, US$13.1 million were approved for Technical Cooperations, and
US$4.25 million were approved for Investment Grants. This year disbursements of US$454.2 million
took place.
The Bank portfolio is currently composed of 27 sovereign guarantee operations totaling
US$2.86 billion, with a disbursed amount of US$1.73 billion (60 percent). A total of
14 operations for US$1.54 billion are concentrated in competitiveness, trade and integration areas
(52 percent of the portfolio), 5 are operations for social development (18 percent) and 8 are
operations of governance and institutions (30 percent). The non-reimbursable technical cooperation
portfolio includes 109 operations with an approved value of US$68.9 million.
The current portfolio of private sector initiatives (non-sovereign guarantee) in Colombia
consists of 7 loans, totaling US$219.08 million. This portfolio supports interventions in the
transport sector, infrastructure financing, expanding low-income families’ access to commercial
credit and the promotion of international trade. In addition, the Multilateral Investment Fund has a
portfolio of 38 operations valued at US$40.46 million that supports microfinance institutions in

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(as of December 26, 2012)
I.
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
Real sector
The National Department of Statistics (DANE) is responsible for the compilation of the national
accounts, although the Banco de la República (BdR) compiles the financial accounts. Annual and
quarterly estimates of GDP by the production and the expenditure approaches use 2005 as
reference year. GDP compilation conforms to the methodological recommendations of the System
of National Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA) and some recommendations from the 2008 SNA. The
rebasing of the national accounts’ base year included a methodological change regarding the
volume measures from a fixed-base Laspeyres index to a Laspeyres chain index with 2005 as a
reference year. The main implications of the rebasing are that the 2000 and 2005 are not
comparable and the chain index is associated with non-additivity of the components. The rebasing
also resulted in an upward revision of the nominal GDP reflecting improvements in source data.
Government finance statistics
The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MFPC) is responsible for the compilation of public
revenue, expenditure, and financing data. The Colombian authorities have reaffirmed their
commitment to adopt the GFSM 2001 framework, enhance inter-institutional coordination, and
increase the resources allocated to compiling government finance statistics. While significant
progress has been made, there is still a need to take additional steps. In the short term these
include: adopting a common list of public sector entities, and disseminating high-frequency data on
a national and international level.
The General Accounting Office (GAO) has developed a single accounting database for the public
sector. The GAO accounting classification is bridged to the GFSM 2001 framework to compile GFS on
accrual and cash bases.
Financial sector statistics
The BdR is in charge of compiling data on the financial sector, while the Financial Superintendence
(FS) and the Superintendency of Securities compile data in their respective areas. Fund technical
assistance missions have placed special emphasis on issues supportive of data quality, including
interagency cooperation and procedures to ensure data consistency.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

COLOMBIA

Balance of payments and external debt
The BdR is in charge of compiling and disseminating balance of payments statistics. Quarterly data
have been produced since 1994, and the BdR adopted the BPM5 standard in 1998. Balance of
payment statistics have been extended to cover transactions in the free trade zones. Improved
surveys, particularly in the services sector, have enhanced coverage and consistency and financial
account data are now based on actual disbursement rather than registers.
The 2005 data ROSC mission recommended that the BdR, in consultation with the DANE, develop a
methodology to include unrecorded trade in the balance of payments on a timely basis. The BdR
should reclassify some FDI equity transactions to portfolio equity, and adjust the related investment
income series accordingly. Also, it should continue efforts to identify government bonds issued
abroad and purchased by residents as well as those purchased by residents on the secondary
market.
The BdR also compiles and disseminates data on International Investment Position statistics, External
Debt statistics, and the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity.
II.
Data Standards and Quality
Colombia subscribes to the Special Data
A data ROSC was published in October 2006.
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and metadata
are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB).
III.
Reporting to STA (optional)
Colombia reports annual GFS to STA for general government and its subsectors on accrual and cash
bases for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFS Yearbook). Data for the
consolidated general government are only available from 2008 onward after a major revision was
performed in stock data. Currently, no high frequency data are reported for publication in IFS.
However, an action plan currently being implemented by the authorities is aimed to address this
issue. Colombia is also expected to start reporting debt statistics for the IMF-WB Public Sector Debt
Statistics database. The BdR uses the standardized report forms for reporting monetary data for the
central bank (Form 1SR), other depository corporations (Form 2SR), and other financial corporations
(Form 4SR) to STA. The FS reports 11 of the 12 core financial soundness indicators (FSIs) and 10 of
13 encouraged FSIs for deposit takers on a regular monthly basis.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Colombia
January 23, 2013

1.
This statement provides additional information that has become available since the
staff report was issued. It does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Real GDP growth slowed to 2.1 percent in the third quarter (y/y), from
4.9 percent (y/y) in the second quarter. The slowdown mainly reflects weak performance
of the construction and the oil and mining sectors, resulting from delays in the approval of
construction licenses and slow implementation of public investments. In light of these, the
staff report projection of annual output growth of 4.3 percent may prove optimistic.
3.
Headline inflation fell to 2.4 percent in December (y/y) from 2.8 percent (y/y) in
November, owing to lower regulated and food price inflation. Core inflation eased slightly to
3.2 percent.
4.
Unemployment fell to 9.2 percent in November 2012, down from an average of
10.8 percent in 2011.
5.
According to preliminary data, the central government deficit in 2012 was
2.4 percent of GDP, somewhat above the staff report’s projection. Lower-than-envisaged
revenue accounts for the difference.
6.
Monetary policy was eased further in December. On December 21, the central
bank lowered the policy rate by 25 basis points (to 4.25 percent), bringing total cuts to
100 basis points in the second half of 2012. The nominal exchange rate closed the year at
1,768.2 pesos per dollar (1,942.7 at end 2011) while gross international reserves at endDecember were US$37.0 billion (US$31.9 billion at end-December 2011).
7.

On January 1, 2013, the government raised the minimum wage by 4 percent.

8.
The tax bill approved by Congress on December 20, 2012 preserved most of the
government’s proposals to address inequality and informality. The reform (effective
January 1, 2013) mandates:
i.

the elimination of payroll taxes for salaries less than 10 minimum wages;

ii.

the creation of an “equity tax” for corporations, with a statutory rate of 9 percent for
2013–2015 (8 percent afterwards) and a tax base slightly broader than the corporate
income tax; proceeds from this tax will be earmarked to social spending programs
previously financed by payroll taxes;

2
iii.

a reduction in the statutory corporate income tax rate (from 33 percent to 25 percent);
and a reduction in the withholding tax rate on non-residents’ earnings from portfolio
investment (from 33 percent to 14 percent);

iv.

the creation of a minimum personal income tax with rates from 0 percent to
27 percent, levied on individuals with monthly incomes above 4.2 minimum wages;

v.

a consolidation of seven VAT rates to three rates of 0, 5 and 16 percent; and the
creation of a national consumption tax for certain goods (e.g. luxury goods, vehicles)
and services (e.g. restaurants);

vi.

other administrative measures aimed at reducing tax evasion.

9.
In early January 2003, the Ministry of Health announced the government’s
intention to submit draft legislation for health care reform to Congress by March. The
reform would include: (i) the definition and costing of health services, especially under the
subsidized regime; (ii) the unification of public funds earmarked to finance health services;
and (iii) the modernization of the Superintendence of Health Services.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation
with Colombia

On January 23, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Colombia.1
Background
Colombia’s economy has been resilient to the adverse global shocks of recent years. A very
strong policy framework and skillful policy management provided the authorities with policy
space to undertake effective countercyclical measures to mitigate the impact of the global crisis
of 2008-09. Output growth rebounded strongly in 2010 and rose to almost 6 percent in 2011,
supported by sound macroeconomic policies, favorable terms of trade, and Flexible Credit Line

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with

members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

arrangements. As the output gap closed, the central bank raised the policy rate from 3 percent
at end-2010 to 5.25 percent in February 2012.
During 2012 growth is expected to have moderated to below its estimated potential rate of
4½ percent, largely reflecting the lagged impact of countercyclical policies, supply shocks, and
weaker external demand. Headline inflation fell to 2.4 percent (year-on-year) by end-year, from
4 percent in late 2011. Following several years of robust economic expansion, the
unemployment rate declined to 9.2 percent at end 2012 (from more than 17 percent in 2002).
The external current account deficit remained broadly unchanged at 3 percent of GDP despite
the moderation in growth and the high export prices; large imports and profit repatriations by
multinational firms seem to have been key contributing factors. The current account deficit
continued to be more than covered by large net inflows of foreign direct investment, putting
upward pressure on the peso and leading to a balance of payments surplus that is likely to
exceed US$5 billion.
The macroeconomic policy stance during 2012 was broadly neutral. The fiscal stance,
measured in terms of the non-oil balance, is estimated to have been broadly the same as in
2011, and the public debt ratio is projected to fall to 33½ percent. The monetary tightening of
2011, combined with higher provisioning requirements, helped rein in the rate of growth of bank
credit. Amidst an economic slowdown that was more pronounced than anticipated, the central
bank lowered the policy rate by 100 basis points to 4.25 percent in the second half of the year.
The financial health of Colombia’s credit institutions appears sound. The banking system
remains well-capitalized and profitable; nonperforming loans are low and well-provisioned; and
funding is stable, relying mostly on domestic deposits. The Financial Superintendency
effectively supervises all financial institutions, and is taking steps to strengthen supervision
further.
In 2013, Colombia’s real GDP growth is projected to be around its estimated potential rate while
inflation is projected to remain close to the midpoint of the central bank’s target range. The
external current account deficit is expected to remain at about 3 percent of GDP. Spillovers from
the global turmoil have been limited so far. However, Colombia remains vulnerable to a sharp

3

growth slowdown in trading partners, a steep drop in oil prices, or a sharp rise in global risk
aversion.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Colombian authorities for their strong policy framework and
skillful macroeconomic management, supported by the Flexible Credit Line (FCL) arrangement,
which have helped increase resilience to adverse shocks and maintained strong growth and low
inflation. Directors recognized that spillovers from the global turmoil had been limited so far, but
noted that the economy remains vulnerable to a steep drop in oil prices, a sharp growth
slowdown in trading partners, and a sharp rise in global risk aversion. They considered,
however, that Colombia appears well positioned to address the important medium-term
challenges facing the economy.
Directors agreed that the broadly neutral policy stance planned for 2013 is appropriate, and that
the 2013 budget is in line with medium-term fiscal consolidation plans. They concurred that, in
the context of a flexible exchange rate regime, there is room for further monetary easing if
downside risks materialize. A comfortable level of international reserves, reinforced by the FCL
arrangement, and low ratios of external and public debt provide additional buffers. Directors
noted the staff’s assessment that the exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals.
Directors commended the authorities for the recently approved tax reform and their plans to
reform the pension system. Most Directors encouraged the authorities to consider a more
ambitious fiscal consolidation plan, focused on increasing non-commodity revenues, which
could help mitigate the appreciation pressures, build buffers against adverse commodity price
shocks, and create fiscal space for improving public infrastructure.
Directors noted the soundness of the financial system, which appears resilient to a wide range
of shocks and is effectively supervised, although concentration risks remain a source of fragility.
They urged the authorities to step up their efforts to improve the risk-based approach to
supervision in line with Pillar 2 of the Basel II framework, promote the de jure independence and
legal protection of supervisors, strengthen the financial safety net, guard against concentration

4

risks, and extend supervisory and regulatory powers to holding companies of financial
institutions. Directors emphasized the need to continue making progress in financial deepening
to entrench financial stability further and reduce the risks from concentration.
Looking ahead, Directors considered that Colombia’s strong policy frameworks bolster its ability
to address medium-term challenges, including the uncertain global environment, high
unemployment and income inequality, high reliance on commodity-based revenues, and low
labor productivity. Addressing these challenges will require decisive actions to boost
competitiveness, reduce the high rates of informality, increase national saving, and diversify
exports.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat

Statement by Maria Angelica Arbelaez, Alternate Executive Director for Colombia
January 23, 2013
Article IV Consultation
The Colombian authorities thank the mission team for the constructive and open-minded
discussions held in Bogota. They broadly agree with staff’s assessment and policy
recommendations. The marginal differences in perception in some specific areas were
adequately addressed in the staff report.
Economic outlook
After reaching a growth rate of 5.9 percent in 2011, the economy slowed down in 2012 with
growth expected to be around 4 percent. The deceleration is partially explained by the
tightening of monetary policy undertaken by the central bank (Banco de la República, BR)
since the first quarter of 2011 in response to demand and credit pressures. However, other
factors have accentuated the downward trend in the second semester, such as the decline in
external demand, currency appreciation and supply difficulties that emerged in some sectors.
Growth has been led mainly by domestic investment (25.5 percent of GDP), as well as by
foreign investment (4.5 percent of GDP). It is expected that the economy will grow by
around 4.5 percent in 2013, close to its potential.
Macroeconomic policies have continued to be prudent and well complemented by the FCL,
and economic fundamentals remain strong. In 2012 inflation held at 2.4 percent; the
consolidated fiscal deficit slowed to around 0.4 percent of GDP and the central government
deficit to 2.4; the debt of Non Financial Public Sector declined to 26 percent of GDP (to
34 percent for the Central Government); the current account deficit remained around
3 percent of GDP financed mostly by FDI inflows; and the level of international reserves
increased and remains adequate. Access to markets has continued to be comfortable and
spreads have constantly narrowed. In September 2012, Colombia issued foreign sovereign
debt denominated in Colombian pesos at the lowest rate in history (4.5 percent).
Looking ahead, while maintaining sound macroeconomic fundamentals, bringing down
unemployment and informality, as well as closing the infrastructure gap, remain pressing
challenges that the authorities have already been addressing. Although the authorities
acknowledge that more efforts are needed, social indicators have improved and
unemployment has declined.
Monetary policy and exchange rate
The inflation targeting regime has served the economy well and the BR benefits from great
credibility. Inflation is below the 3 percent target, the interest rate is close to the neutral level
and the output gap is close to zero. The authorities started tightening monetary policy in the

2
first quarter of 2011 based on a forward-looking assessment of the economy, with the double
objective of keeping inflation low and smoothing the business and credit cycles. However,
owing to a reduction of inflation (below target) as well as a larger-than-expected deceleration
of growth, the BR has adopted an accommodative monetary stance and the benchmark
interest rate was reduced by 25 basis points in December 2012. The authorities concur with
staff that, should the economy slows down further and forecast inflation remain on or below
target, there is room for more monetary easing.
Exchange rate flexibility (de jure and de facto) has continued to be the main shock absorber.
The BR renewed its pre-announced daily purchases in the FX market of 20 million USD until
next March with the main objective of building up reserves and curbing the downward trend
in some IR indicators, although it also helps mitigate exchange rate volatility.
The authorities consider that the current account deficit of around 3 percent of GDP is well
financed by FDI and is consistent with the country’s position with regards to the oil sector.
Colombia is still in a phase of high exploration and exploitation (which means sharp
increases of FDI and imports) that partially offset income from oil exports. Therefore, higher
oil prices are less reflected in an expansion of production (which would improve the current
account), than rather in more exploration and exploitation.
Fiscal stance and policy
The solid institutional framework adopted in past years at the level of regional and the central
governments (e.g. Fiscal Responsibility Law, Fiscal Rule, Lights Law) has allowed the fiscal
stance to approach equilibrium. The authorities anticipate a lower-than-expected combined
public sector deficit of around 0.4 percent of GDP in 2012 and 2.4 percent for the central
government, which will be further reduced to attain the surplus goal of 0.2 percent in 2016
and a deficit of 1.7, respectively. The short-term fiscal policy, based on the Medium-Term
Fiscal Framework that is updated and approved by Congress every year, is guided by the
main objectives of debt sustainability and reduction, and increase in the primary balance in
order to meet the fiscal rule which will enter into force in 2014. According to the rule, the
structural deficit of the central government of around 2.4 percent of GDP in 2012 will
decrease gradually to reach 1 percent in 2022, and the Non-Financial Public Sector debt will
fall from 26 percent to 8.8 percent and that of the Central Government from 34 to 24.5.
With regard to revenues, an ambitious structural tax reform was recently passed in Congress
which seeks to increase employment, reduce informality and inequality, enhance
competitiveness, improve tax collection efficiency and administration and reduce evasion.
Although the reform is considered revenue neutral in the sense that it does not raise tariffs, it
will certainly increase structural revenues. Staff mentions in the report that a reduction in
revenues is foreseeable in the next years (owing to the phase out of some taxes) and will be
offset by capital expenditure cuts. In this regard, it has to be highlighted that the additional
revenues stemming from the tax reform have not been considered yet in the projections; the

3
authorities’ strategy is to wait for the proceeds of the tax reform and mobilize new revenues
if needed to finance capital spending.
Revenues in 2012 behaved better than projected (reaching historical records) resulting in part
from oil-related activity but also from improvements in tax collection. Some of these extra
revenues were used to reduce the deficit, and some went to finance investment in
infrastructure. Indeed, public investment played a critical role in supporting domestic
demand in the third quarter of 2012 when signs of deceleration were more pronounced. The
2013 budget also includes a higher rate of capital spending relative to the current component.
The authorities concur with staff on the importance of strengthening savings. In fact, public
and national savings have been increasing and will continue to do so as a consequence of the
planned deficit reduction and, most importantly, of the royalty savings mandated by the fiscal
rule and the royalty law recently approved.
Structural reforms
The promotion of sectors different from oil and minerals, with emphasis on agriculture and
manufacturing (more labor intensive), is a priority for the government. Several reforms have
been undertaken in agriculture as well as measures to enhance productivity and
competitiveness. Among others, the tax reform will reduce labor costs significantly; the
Ministry of Finance is working with the Energy Commission to reduce energy costs and an
ambitious plan to enhance infrastructure and transportation is being adopted.
The authorities are preparing a structural Pension Reform to address the pressing issues of
the system, which are low coverage, low progressivity and arbitrage between public and
private systems, rather than unsustainability. To tackle the coverage issue, a mechanism to
allow informal workers to attain a pension (Beneficio Económico Periódico, BEPS) was
recently implemented. They are also designing a comprehensive health care reform aiming at
correcting deficiencies of the system and containing costs.
Social Issues
Unemployment, inequality and informality remain the most urgent challenges. The
authorities have adopted several measures to address them and some progress has been
achieved. Although still high, unemployment fell to single digits and stands now at
9.2 percent. October’s unemployment rate of 8.9 percent was the lowest in 12 years of
comparable data. In addition, the reduction in labor costs stemming from the tax reform is a
critical step in the direction of bolstering formal employment. Inequality is being tackled not
only through pension and tax reforms (through more progressivity), but also several targeted
assistance programs to reduce social gaps and poverty have been put in place. Indeed, the
poverty rate dropped 10 percent from 2006 to 2011.

Financial System Stability Assessment
In 2011, Colombia requested the IMF and the World Bank to conduct a comprehensive
financial sector assessment, including the specific analysis of standards applicable to the
banking, insurance, securities, payment systems, and financial infrastructure providers. The
last FSAP was done in 2004, previous to the international financial crises and with a different
institutional arrangement, insofar as there were two supervisory authorities (banking and
securities) responsible for oversight of the entities within the financial sector. The authorities
are grateful to the Fund for the opportunity to have an updated, deep and comprehensive
assessment of the financial sector and particularly to the mission team for their dedication,
skillful work, and useful discussions and recommendations.
The FSSA concludes that Colombia has a broad financial system, with complex financial
conglomerates and with a variety of intermediaries. Credit institutions are sound, with
healthy corporate and households balance sheets, strong credit quality and profitable banks.
Nonbank financial intermediaries have been performing in a satisfactory fashion.
Most importantly, the stress tests conducted by the mission show that Colombian banks are
resilient to a variety of shocks that included extreme scenarios of external crises and its
effects on the quality of the loan portfolios. The authorities used in the past different
macroprudential tools and policies that have proved to be beneficial for the financial system
as a whole and are prepared to implement new ones, if necessary. Adequate coordination
between the different institutions that are responsible for the Financial Safety Net (BR,
Ministry of Finance, MHCP, Colombian Financial Superintendent, SFC, and FOGAFIN) has
been crucial for adopting sound preventive policies.
The FSSA also concludes that Colombia has demonstrated considerable progress in
implementing the standards and principles applicable to the regulation and supervision of
banks, insurance companies, the securities market, and providers of financial infrastructure.
The assessment recognizes that the SFC has improved its capacity to fulfill its
responsibilities. In particular, the mission underscored the progress of the supervisory
mechanism since the merger of the banking and securities in the SFC and the enactment of
important laws (Law 964 of 2005 and Law 1328 of 2009). A single supervisory authority
serves to cover all financial sectors and activities, ensuring transparency and efficiency in
terms of regulatory enforcement and eliminating regulatory gaps and arbitrage that may arise
when there is more than one supervisory authority. This is important in Colombia due to the
existence of important financial conglomerates with activities in different financial services.
The authorities are aware that more work has to be done in order to improve regulation and
supervision and will include in the pipeline of reforms some of those suggested in the FSSA.
Nevertheless, we would like to highlight that the new capital adequacy regime, which was
published in August 2012 and will take full effect on August 1, 2013, will address many of
the shortcomings pointed out in the assessment. In the same token, regulation related to the

5
adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) has been implemented.
Financial institutions must issue IFRS financial statements starting in 2015, with a clear
timetable established for that purpose. Additional reforms have been undertaken in other
areas such as new reserves and solvency requirements for insurance companies.
On the issue of the independence of the SFC, we want to emphasize that, while Colombia’s
legal and constitutional framework may make it difficult to establish de jure independence
(an aspect that could be improved), the SFC has full de facto independence. It conducts
supervision of the financial system without any political interference whatsoever, and works
with the MHCP to develop regulations and other aspects of the legal framework without
political influence.
On enhancing risk supervision, we would also like to feature the close collaboration of the
SFC with the Toronto Center over the past few years, which has strengthened the capacity for
risk-based supervision and improved the comprehensiveness of risk assessments conducted
by the SFC as well as by the financial institutions themselves. We fully expect that this
program of technical cooperation will continue to bear fruit in the next years and to
strengthen supervision even further.
On the risks of credit growth, it is worth noting that the SFC established in June 2012 an
additional provision applicable to banks that show a sustained increase in NPLs. In these
cases banks are requested to raise each loan provisioning to a value between 0.2 percent and
0.5 percent over the corresponding balance loan. Based on figures as of November 2012, the
additional provision represents an increase of 4.7 percent in the provisions of the consumer
portfolio. In addition, a robust monitoring of the origination process was undertaken. Both
measures proved to be effective in reducing the upward trend of consumption credit since
2009.
Strengthening the consolidated supervision is a key recommendation from staff. Indeed, the
government is considering presenting a legal reform to include, under full supervision of the
SFC, the holding companies of financial institutions.
On the stress testing methodologies, the BR continues to enhance its models and during the
exercises conducted for FSAP new improvements were introduced and permanently adopted.
With regard to concentration of commercial loans, the authorities welcome FSSA
recommendations and acknowledge that high levels of concentration increase risks and can
harm the financial sector’s stability. We would like to offer some comments.
Although 90 percent of commercial loans are concentrated in 7 percent of total
debtors, this proportion corresponds to a significant amount of companies (28,101 firms). In
addition, institutions diversify their portfolios in different economic activities that are not

6
necessarily positively correlated. This is one among other tools adopted by them to mitigate
the possible effects that concentration can have on their balance sheet in case of default.
Concentration is a common phenomenon in emerging economies. Social and
economic development requires that credit institutions finance important projects in areas
such as the ones involved in mining, energy and infrastructure sectors. Due to their size and
value, these projects need an important capital investment and are financed mainly by credit
institutions.
The SFC has several credit risk administration requirements to credit institutions,
especially regarding loan origination and monitoring, which force the credit institutions to
make proper risk evaluations from the moment the loan operation is done and periodic
monitoring during its lifetime. Furthermore, taking into account that the aforementioned
requirements are fully met by the credit institutions so they are able to respond appropriately
should risk factors materialize, an instant and unexpected impairment of borrowers, including
those who have important participations in the institution’s portfolio, is unlikely. Regulation
establishes credit exposure limits, tolerated loss levels and methodologies for credit granting
that allows monitoring of the credit exposure in the institution’s portfolios.
The stress tests show that when a 1 or 2 notch downgrading is done to the system’s
most significant borrowers, only one credit institution falls under a solvency level of
9 percent and only 3 institutions below the Tier 1/Risk Weighted Assets ratio of 4.5 percent.
This exercise allows us to conclude that, given a sudden and unexpected impairment of
systemic borrowers, credit institutions are able to respond properly due to their capacity to
absorb losses that derivate from the significant increase in provision volume. Then, the risk
associated to concentration is mitigated by the different mechanisms used by institutions
(proper loan origination, permanent monitoring, provisions, countercyclical component and
capital).
Finally, regarding coordination among entities, in October 2012 the SFC and Fogafín signed
a MOU to improve coordination and resolution mechanisms. It was agreed that the SFC will
inform Fogafín when an institution is at significant risk of being intervened and the SFC will
support Fogafín in the process of collecting information about bank’s deposits directly from
banks. For that purpose, it was decided that banks must submit this information directly to
Fogafín beginning in 2014 and that banks and Fogafín shall work jointly during 2013 on the
systems and coordination procedures required for this purpose.
