EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Scope and focus. Against the backdrop of slowing U.S. growth, currency appreciation, and
global financial strains, the mission focused on near-term outlook risks and policy responses.
The discussions also covered the enhancing of productivity and financial sector efficiency.
Background. Canada has enjoyed an enviable macroeconomic performance over the past
decade. Reflecting prudent macroeconomic policies and favorable external conditions, real
GDP has grown faster than in other G-7 countries, inflation has been low and stable, and fiscal
balances have been in surplus (Table 1 summarizes previous policy positions not discussed).
Outlook. The baseline anticipates growth moderation through mid-2008, reflecting weaker
external demand and tighter credit conditions. The balance of risks is on the downside given
concerns about U.S. growth and unsettled global financial markets, although domestic demand
could slow by less than expected.
External currency value. At near parity against the U.S. dollar and with oil prices of
$90–100 a barrel, the Canadian dollar seems broadly in line with fundamentals, although some
measures suggest modest overvaluation.
Monetary policy. The Bank of Canada appropriately shifted from tightening to easing in
response to the evolving balance of risks. Future moves will depend on incoming information.
Financial sector. The Canadian banking system is conservatively regulated, but has not been
immune to spillovers from the global liquidity squeeze, including via a shutdown in parts of
the asset-backed commercial paper market that was recently resolved in principle. While
Canadian banks appear better placed to weather balance sheet problems than those in other
major markets, their resilience partly reflects barriers to market contestability that likely
hamper access to finance.
Fiscal policy. A prudent policy framework aims at achieving budget surpluses and reducing
public debt ratios further. The 2007 Economic Statement appropriately emphasizes tax relief,
although lowering the federal GST tax rate has limited efficiency benefits.
Macro-structural policies. The recent policy focus on enhancing productivity growth is
timely in view of pressures from real dollar appreciation and an aging population. Besides tax
reforms and improving financial intermediation, the focus should be on product market reform.
Analytical work. Background studies examine financial and other spillovers, labor churning,
Canada’s inflation targeting framework, and access of small borrowers to finance.

I. MACROECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PROSPECTS AND RISKS
A. Overview
1.
Canada has enjoyed high growth while adjusting smoothly to commodity price
gains, currency appreciation, and, more recently, slowing U.S. demand. Over the past
five years, the commodity boom has strengthened the external position and boosted domestic
demand (Tables 2 and 3). There has been some offset from real net exports, as the real
exchange rate has appreciated sharply in response to rising terms of trade and the resulting
pressures on resources (Figure A). Reflecting strong domestic demand, the unemployment
rate remains close to its recent 33-year low and staff and most analysts view the economy as
currently operating above potential. Having been in the upper half of the Bank of Canada’s
1–3 percent target range since the fall of 2006, however, core CPI inflation recently dropped
below the midpoint on stronger-than-expected exchange rate passthrough.

2.
Looking forward, however, officials and private analysts agreed with the staff
that near-term prospects are less favorable. With the U.S. downturn now expected to be
more severe than earlier assumed and last year’s strong upward momentum in the Canadian
dollar, the drag from real net exports will intensify. At the same time, domestic demand
growth is forecast to moderate from its recent rapid pace, as the boost to real income growth
from rising commodity prices dissipates and tighter financial conditions limit credit
availability.
3.
It was also generally agreed that external factors tilted the risks to the near-term
outlook to the downside. In particular, there is a clear risk that the slowdown in the United

States could be deeper than currently anticipated. A further tightening of financial conditions
is also very possible given unsettled global financial markets. That said, domestic demand
growth could slow by less than expected, particularly given recent buoyancy in some
commodity prices.
4.
Risks from extremely unfavorable external conditions are illustrated in the
alternative scenario used for stress tests reported in the accompanying FSSA Update.
While highly unlikely, a “perfect storm” involving a combination of a significant U.S.
recession, associated U.S. dollar depreciation, and falling commodity prices could put the
Canadian financial sector and economy under greater strain than the sharp recession of the
early 1990s, when real GDP fell by 2 percent in 1991.

B. How Much Will Domestic Demand Growth Slow?
5.
Consumption has been buoyant since 2002, driven by commodity-related terms
of trade improvements. This boost to real income and net worth (Figure 1) has been
reinforced by rising employment and accommodative credit conditions. Going forward, staff
and most analysts project that consumption growth will decelerate moderately from recent
exceptionally high rates, reflecting tighter financial conditions and a moderation in household
real income growth as external demand slows and the terms of trade stabilize.
6.
Strong housing demand is expected to moderate somewhat. House prices have
recently started to decelerate. While overall residential investment remains buoyant, private
sector analysts observed that there were signs of slowing in the exceptionally strong Alberta
market where most of Canada’s oil field development is occurring. Going forward, Bank of
Canada and Finance Canada officials agreed with staff that residential investment growth is
expected to decelerate as income growth moderates and affordability decreases.
7.
Most analysts were cautious regarding prospects for business investment.
Reflecting strong dependence of some capital expenditure on U.S. cyclical developments,
investment growth has been moving in tandem with U.S. real GDP growth (Figure 2). Thus,
the impending slowdown in the U.S. economy and tightening financial conditions temper
investment prospects despite high profitability, healthy corporate balance sheets, and lower
prices of capital goods (that are mainly imported).

6
8.
Looking forward, it was generally agreed that domestic demand is likely to slow,
although there are upside risks given its unexpected strength over the past two years.
Private consumption and residential investment in particular could continue their current
momentum, reflecting robust income growth, wealth increases, and favorable consumer
confidence, as well as the recent increases in some commodity prices and tax cuts announced
in the October 2007 Economic Statement. The boost to real incomes from recent greaterthan-anticipated exchange rate passthrough into prices could also stimulate demand.
9.
Staff and officials also agreed that the risk of a rapid downturn in the housing
market of the type seen in the United States and feared elsewhere is small. This view
was echoed by market professionals, who pointed out that while there might be some
localized signs of speculative behavior, the strength of the broad housing market reflects
fundamentals. House price appreciation has lagged relative to many other industrial
countries, inventories are still below average, and recent readings of housing starts and
building permits suggest continued favorable housing market conditions.
C. How much of a Risk is a Weaker U.S. Economy?
10.
There is widespread skepticism that Canada can decouple from a U.S.
slowdown. Staff observed that trade and financial linkages between the United States and
Canada are among the strongest in industrial countries, with the U.S. receiving ¾ of
Canada’s exports and financing about ¼ of the capital raised by Canadian corporations.
Consistent with previous analysis, Chapter 1 of the Selected Issues paper suggests that on
average a one-percentage point shock to U.S. GDP changes Canada’s growth by between
½ to ¾ of a percentage point, operating through trade, financial, and commodity price
channels. Most interlocutors saw this as a reasonable estimate of U.S. spillovers to Canada.
11.
Staff and officials agreed that the impact of the U.S. slowdown on Canada is
likely to rise as the U.S. slowdown moves beyond the housing sector. With U.S. weakness
through the third quarter primarily reflecting a housing downturn, spillovers have continued
to be limited. The direct impact has been confined largely to building material-related
industries, especially lumber. As the U.S. slowdown broadens to consumption, it is likely to
generate more general trade effects. Officials stressed the importance of U.S. demand for
automobiles, whose production is highly integrated (autos and parts represent one-third of
Canadian goods exports). In addition, the tightening in U.S. financial conditions is also likely
to slow the Canadian economy significantly as discussed in Section E—Selected Issues
Chapter 2 analyzes these financial linkages in more detail.
D. Is the Strong Canadian Dollar Consistent with External Stability?
12.
Responding to higher commodity prices, the freely floating Canadian dollar has
appreciated by almost half in real effective terms between early 2002 and end-2007. As
Canada is susceptible to external shocks in general, commodity price hikes (falls) have
traditionally led to exchange rate appreciation (depreciation) against the United States and
other trading partners (Figure B). Indeed, the Canadian dollar is widely considered a
commodity currency. By offsetting pressures on domestic demand, currency fluctuations
generally support macroeconomic stability by acting as shock absorbers.

13.
Strong appreciation during 2007, however, has intensified earlier concerns about
the economic cost of rapid currency movements. Even after plunging some 10 percent
from November’s record high of US$1.10—partly reflecting changing expectations about the
course of monetary policy—the Canadian dollar appreciated about 20 percent against its U.S.
counterpart in 2007, more than other major U.S. trading partners. Given the dominance of the
United States in Canada’s trade, this reinforced officials’ earlier concerns that Canada has
borne a disproportionate share of U.S. dollar adjustment with associated pressures on
exposed sectors. Staff estimate that roughly one-half of last year’s appreciation against the
U.S. dollar reflects higher oil prices (non-energy commodity price changes have been
modest), and that recent ups and downs have also reflected momentum trading.
14.
Background work using exchange rate models suggests that much of the
appreciation since 2002 has reflected the global commodity boom. At near parity against
the U.S. dollar and with oil prices of $90-100 a barrel, the currency currently appears broadly
in line with fundamentals, although some measures suggest modest overvaluation. More
specifically, the team’s analysis using several exchange rate models suggests there could be a
small overvaluation by the end of 2007, as does the Consultative Group on Exchange Rate
Issues (CGER) equilibrium exchange rate approach. However, CGER analysis based on
external balances suggest that the currency is fully consistent with fundamentals. This
diversity corresponded to the views of most analysts, who pegged the equilibrium value
against the greenback at between 90 cents and parity. In early January, Governor Dodge said
that a value in the “low to mid 90s” was justified by historical relationships.
15.
Staff and officials agreed that real net exports are likely to be a major drag on
activity through at least the first half of 2008 (Figure C and Table 4). Past currency
appreciation and weakening U.S. activity are projected to lead to a significant deterioration in
exports of manufactures and services, which remain the bulk of Canadian exports. This
weakness has been exacerbated by the recent spike in cross-border shopping as the currency
surged to parity against the U.S. dollar, which made price comparison easier.
16.
Staff noted that, at a constant real exchange rate, the current account surplus is
expected to continue to narrow despite high projected commodity prices. Officials
agreed that the favorable effects of elevated commodity prices, further modest increases in
fuel export volumes, and declining net income payments would only partly offset weaker
exports of manufactures and services.
17.
Reflecting flexible labor markets, the domestic adjustment to currency
appreciation and rising commodity prices has been remarkably smooth. Unemployment
rates have steadily declined, including in the more manufacturing-oriented central provinces,
as employment gains in services, construction, and mining as well as interprovincial
migration have more than offset manufacturing job losses (Figure 3).
18.
Rising labor demand in the resource-rich provinces has been partly met through
net migration from elsewhere in Canada, as local wages have been bid up. At current
exchange rates, staff suggested that this relatively smooth adjustment is likely to continue.

Senior officials broadly agreed, while noting that activity in parts of manufacturing and
forestry may well lead to local difficulties.
E. Will Financial Strains Feed Through to the Real Economy?
19.
Bank balance sheets have deteriorated in response to global financial problems,
although strains appear smaller than in other major markets. While the size of current
financial vulnerabilities is inevitably subject to much uncertainty and varies from bank to
bank, estimated exposures to asset-backed securities and related products appear more
limited than in the United States or Europe. As a result, while synthetic credit default
insurance spreads have risen significantly since the late summer, they remain lower than in
the United States. This is consistent with stress tests conducted for the accompanying FSSA
Update that suggest that the major banks have sufficient capital to withstand large shocks.
20.
As elsewhere, interbank money markets remain under strain. Interbank spreads
for major Canadian banks have risen and remained elevated, albeit generally at lower levels
than in the United States and Europe (Figure D). Indeed, Canadian interbank rates have been
particularly highly correlated with U.S. rates since financial strains emerged in August,
reflecting their close integration with U.S. wholesale financial markets. This illustrates one
channel through which global financial turmoil is affecting the financial sector.
21.
Staff and Bank officials agreed that overall financial conditions had tightened
noticeably since the summer. The October Monetary Policy Report had estimated that the
average cost of borrowing for households and businesses had risen by some 25 basis points,
while the availability and terms of credit had also tightened modestly. It was agreed that
financial conditions had continued to deteriorate subsequently and that strains were likely to
persist, with staff suggesting that in early December the increase in the cost of borrowing
might well be double that estimated in October.
22.
Staff observed that in the face of balance sheet strains, recent strong growth in
credit is likely to decelerate, slowing future activity:
•

Officials responded that the increase in domestic credit risk will likely remain limited,
given relatively low household debt ratios and high commodity prices that support
incomes (see Table 5). This view was largely mirrored by private sector analysts.

•

Officials suggested that writedowns to date have fairly accurately reflected the likely
scale of losses and that comfortable risk-adjusted capital ratios allow banks to absorb
these developments.

•

Officials agreed with staff that uncertainties related to banks’ foreign exposures were
greater and less predictable, following an historical pattern. A further deterioration in
U.S. market conditions is a particular concern, given significant U.S. operations and
exposures of some Canadian banks (Figure E).

13
23.
Prior to a late-December agreement, staff and officials saw the shutdown of onethird of the asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) market as posing contagion risks.
The team observed that the shutdown of the market for paper sponsored by non-banks
reflected regulations that gave incentives to provide only limited support. With foreign banks
refusing backstop liquidity, there was a risk of a fire sale of assets. By contrast, the remaining
two-thirds of ABCP (backed by the main domestic commercial banks) remained liquid,
reflecting better quality underlying assets and reputation-induced liquidity support. However,
higher rates and shorter maturities indicate some strains.
24.
After delays and difficult negotiations, an agreement in principle was reached on
December 23, 2007, to restructure almost all of the 2½ percent of GDP of frozen ABCP.
The agreement between all of the main parties, including the major Canadian banks, has
substantially reduced the risks of contagion. It converts the commercial paper into longerterm notes, whose maturity corresponds to the underlying assets. The difficulties in obtaining
an agreement partly reflected the reduction in value of U.S. and other foreign assets
underlying the ABCP, illustrating another way that global financial strains have been feeding
through to Canadian markets.
F. Is Core Inflation Likely to Rebound?
25.
The recent downward pressure on inflation from exchange rate passthrough has
come as a surprise. The limited passthrough of currency appreciation since 2002 has been
abruptly reversed since October, as parity with the U.S. dollar has simplified comparison of
Canadian and U.S. prices and cross-border shopping (including through the internet) has
spiked up. As a result, core inflation has fallen abruptly to below the 2 percent mid-point of
the target range despite strong domestic demand and tight labor markets that had earlier
boosted inflationary pressures (Figure 4).
26.
Staff and Bank of Canada officials concurred that core inflation is likely to
remain below the 2 percent target for some time. Bank officials emphasized that the size
and length of this current downward adjustment in Canadian prices relative to U.S. prices
remains highly uncertain, as does the associated downward pressure on inflation. Staff
agreed, noting that, at one extreme, some private analysts had indicated that core inflation
(which will be adjusted to exclude the impact of January 1 indirect tax cuts) could fall to the
bottom of the 1–3 percent target range. Like the Bank, staff see core inflation as moderating
more modestly, with downside risks from financial strains and weaker-than-expected
external demand and upsides from stronger domestic demand and weaker productivity
growth.
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
27.
With a minority government in place, the policy agenda is being shaped against
the possibility of an early election. The Conservative party won the January 2006 election
and formed a minority government, led by Prime Minister Harper. With Canadian minority
governments having historically had short lifespans, there is widespread discussion of the
potential timing of the next election.

14
28.
The discussions focused on policies to mitigate the impact of increased near-term
risks to macroeconomic stability, and to enhance productivity growth. The main nearterm issue is the appropriate monetary policy stance given large competing risks, involving
possible downsides from unsettled financial conditions and U.S. growth, and upsides from
strong domestic demand. The discussions on key longer-term structural issues took place
against the background of the October 2007 Economic Statement, which proposed a range of
tax cuts. Table 1 summarizes previous policy positions not highlighted in this report.
A. Balancing Strong Domestic Demand with Risks to External Stability
29.
Bank of Canada officials explained that monetary policy has shifted in response
to increasing downside risks to output and inflation. The inflation-targeting Bank, which
focuses on the output gap and core inflation as indicators of future inflationary pressures, had
tightened through July 2007 on concerns about the upward creep in core inflation from strong
domestic demand and tight labor markets. Monetary policy subsequently paused in the fall
despite continuing domestic pressures, on concerns about the impact of slowing U.S. activity
and global financial strains on the outlook. As these concerns intensified, the policy rate was
cut in early December, using the room afforded by the fall in core inflation from strengthened
exchange rate passthrough. Staff supported this decision, which took into account the
evolving balance of risks.
30.
Staff agreed with officials that large upsides and downsides around the current
forecast made the future path of monetary policy particularly difficult to chart.
Officials emphasized that the Bank was content with the current level of monetary
conditions, and that there was no presumption about the direction of the next move in rates.
Staff observed that, looking forward, strong recent exchange rate passthrough could
complicate policy decisions by temporarily lowering inflation even though underlying
inflationary pressures may not have dissipated.
31.
Bank officials agreed that worsening financial conditions had been a factor in
the easing of monetary policy in December and remain a concern. The estimate that
financial strains were equivalent to a 25bp rise in spreads, published in the October Monetary
Policy Report, was based on average market rates over a range of instruments and maturities.
They were comfortable with this approach even though several observers, who had focused
on selected markets where tightening was more substantial, had suggested the estimate was
too low.
32.
Staff asked if the Bank’s statutory limitations to liquidity provision were
hampering its response to term money market strains. Officials responded that the
current facilities have been adequate to deal with evolving market strains. The initial focus
on overnight open market operations had largely reflected concerns about the effectiveness of
term operations rather than statutory limits. Recently, though, the Bank participated in term
interventions with the Federal Reserve, ECB, Bank of England, and Swiss National Bank, as
coordinated action was more likely to have an impact on term money market spreads. Staff
view this as an appropriate response to current financial strains, as is the recently-announced
expansion of the list of eligible securities for some forms of liquidity provision.

15
33.
While the floating currency is generally a shock absorber, it was agreed that
monetary policy should respond to disequilibrating exchange rate movements. Such a
response is consistent with the Bank of Canada’s exchange rate assessment framework. Staff
and officials agreed that, in hindsight, the Bank has relatively successfully distinguished
currency movements that rebalance external and internal demand from those that do not,
thereby keeping output fairly close to potential.
34.
Staff agreed with Bank officials that foreign exchange interventions are
generally ineffective. Officials observed that the Bank started with the presumption that
exchange rate movements reflect fundamentals. Indeed, the Bank had not intervened even
when the currency briefly hit US$1.10 in November, and had limited its communication at
that time to clarifying its assessment of economic and financial conditions and risks to
markets. Subsequently, however, Governor Dodge has been much more specific about the
Bank’s views on the appropriate value of the currency.
35.
Officials observed that the Bank had adopted a gradual approach to increased
transparency, in part because such changes are difficult to reverse. They pointed to
greater discussion in Monetary Policy Reports of risks around the forecast and to an
increasing range of issues covered in speeches. At the same time, given that decisions were
made by the governor and staff who reported directly to him, the Bank continued to present a
uniform public view, and therefore focused on the consensus assessment while avoiding
publishing minutes.
36.
Responding to a staff suggestion that further increases in transparency could be
beneficial, officials observed that they monitored other central banks’ practices closely.
Possible innovations included publishing minutes, providing the projected path of interest
rates in the forecast, and increasing use of probabilities of outcomes or alternative scenarios
to illustrate risks around the forecast.
37.
In light of recent events, the team inquired about the appropriate role of
domestic asset prices in monetary policy. It asked whether the Bank’s relatively
sophisticated exchange rate assessment framework could be adapted to include domestic
asset prices. Officials responded that assessing appropriate asset price levels is extremely
difficult, and that it is best to include the expected consequences of domestic asset price
movements directly in economic forecasts rather than to provide public assessments of their
relationship to fundamentals.
38.
Officials noted arguments in favor of price level targeting and a lower inflation
target, but emphasized that the bar is high for changing the current regime. The initial
results of the Bank’s research program on these issues suggested that the benefits of reducing
nominal distortions from inflation and reducing uncertainty about the future price level could
outweigh the costs. However, in their view the evidence would need to be compelling before
altering the successful current policy regime. The team concurred, and outlined the analysis
in Chapter 3 of the Selected Issues paper suggesting that Canada—as well as some other
inflation targeters who have kept average inflation close to target—may already be reaping
some of the benefits of price level targeting in terms of anchoring expectations about the
future price level.

16
B. Safeguarding Financial Stability and Fostering Bank Competition
39.
The accompanying FSSA Update finds that Canada’s financial system is stable,
conservatively regulated, and relatively well capitalized. The regulatory and supervisory
framework meets best practice in many dimensions, including with regard to the revised
Basel Core Principles for effective banking supervision. The Basel II capital adequacy
framework started to come into effect in November and will be fully operational in February
2008.
40.
Staff observed that the ABCP shutdown (now resolved in principle) reflected the
interaction between Canada-specific regulation and insufficient investor due diligence:
•

Conditional liquidity in Canada (triggered only by general market disruption)—which
was absent in other markets—reflected regulation aimed at bank stability that provided
incentives for such arrangements. In particular, domestic banks faced a capital charge
for unconditional liquidity support but not for conditional support.

•

As in the U.S. subprime market, lax ratings and insufficient investor due diligence
were central to eventual financial problems. The local rating agency gave a top rating
to Canadian ABCP with conditional liquidity support even though Moody’s and S&P
refused, while large investors used such paper despite the lack of a second rating.

•

Officials responded that Canadian capital charges had reflected international best
practice. In addition, Canadian capital charges had only covered domestic banks,
which in the event had provided backstop liquidity, while the foreign banks that had
not provided such liquidity were subject to home-country regulation.

•

It was agreed that recent changes in market behavior have ensured no near-term
repetition of the problems seen in third-party ABCP conduits. All continuing banksponsored conduits now have unconditional liquidity support, and the local rating
agency is no longer rating paper with conditional support.

41.
Officials and staff discussed the lessons from Canada’s experience with ABCP
conduits. It was agreed that these included the interaction between the reputation of banks
and the support they provide for nonbank entities, the appropriate charges for unconditional
and conditional support, the transparency of unregulated entities, and whether Basel II should
allow regulated institutions to limit and scale credit risk exposure based on only one rating.
Officials observed that these issues were being actively discussed, largely in international
forums.
42.
Officials explained that they had supported an orderly private-sector resolution
of third-party ABCP to avoid a fire sale of structured assets. In the absence of a
standstill, third-party conduits would have been forced to sell assets rapidly into illiquid
markets, causing further market disruption and significant losses for Canadian investors.
Staff agreed that the risk of a fire sale had made it appropriate for the government to support
an orderly workout.

17
43.
Staff and officials observed that the “passport plus” system of provincial
securities market regulation under implementation is a significant step forward. While
the federal and Ontario governments pushed for a single securities regulator, the other
provinces have developed a passport system. The result is an agreement in which regulators
in every province except Ontario are bound to accept the rulings of other provinces, while
Ontario (which contains the vast majority of securities markets and hence regulatory
expertise) can opt out of any decision. This is an improvement over the previous system in
which all provinces had independent powers.
44.
Staff agreed with federal and Ontario officials that a single securities regulator
would promote timely policy responses, lower costs, and consistent enforcement. While
provincial authorities contend that a passport system ensures that province-specific issues are
adequately taken into account, federal officials observed that this could also be largely
achieved through a well-designed single regulator. They also noted that maintaining multiple
jurisdictions raises costs for issuers operating across provinces, complicates elements of
investor protection, and delays policy development by requiring cumbersome negotiations.
45.
Staff suggested that increased competitive pressures across banks would support
more dynamic firms and individuals, boosting economic flexibility and productivity.
While banks’ conservative practices have proved helpful in the face of current financial
strains, eliminating barriers to large-scale foreign bank entry would widen access to finance:
•

The rule that major banks (which control 85 percent of bank assets) be widely-held
guards against takeovers, including from abroad, while mergers, which require the
approval of the finance minister, are at present effectively prohibited.

•

With limited competitive pressures, banks maintain low-risk balance sheets and
achieve high returns on equity. Stress tests performed for the FSSA Update suggest that
systemic banking sector problems are unlikely even when faced with a large adverse
shock.

•

Against this, the team suggested that, while performing classic intermediation
reasonably efficiently, banks appear to shy away from pricing risk. This underserves
high-growth enterprises, as discussed in Chapter 4 of the Selected Issues paper.
Increasing contestability would raise competitive pressures, supporting financial
innovation and fostering efficient capital allocation.

•

This is particularly important given the underdevelopment of other sources of
financing for small firms—there is no high yield bond market and the venture capital
market is inefficient, likely reflecting the large role of tax-advantaged labor-sponsored
venture capital corporations.

46.
Finance officials responded that standard measures suggested that the banking
system appears competitive and responds appropriately to changes in costs:

18
•

Unlike a blanket FDI restriction, foreign banks were only prohibited from buying
large Canadian institutions. Foreign subsidiaries, together with smaller domestic
companies, provide a competitive fringe that could introduce innovation.

•

Studies find that Canadian banks’ response to changes in costs is consistent with a
high level of competition.

•

Even if the system has limited competition, it is not clear that allowing takeovers
(foreign or domestic) would improve contestability, as a takeover would not increase
the number of banks competing in the market.

•

That said, an expert panel examining competition in Canada has shown an interest in
studying the financial sector.

47.
Staff answered that foreign ownership of core financial institutions is more likely
to promote innovation than ownership of marginal ones. Representatives of small
businesses have amassed considerable evidence that banks do not serve this sector well,
while a range of private sector analysts—including some economists in the financial sector—
view the banking system as uncompetitive and lacking innovation. While it is difficult to
prove conclusively that innovation is wanting, the evidence points in that direction.
48.
Staff expressed concern that government guarantees associated with the housing
sector could be distorting behavior. As the Bank of Canada has observed, the significant
government support provided to induce private sector entry to compete with the governmentowned mortgage insurer, and government guarantees of mortgage-backed securities arranged
by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, could provide artificial incentives for risk
taking. Officials responded that this issue is being examined.
C. Improving Tax Efficiency within a Sound Fiscal Framework
49.
A prudent fiscal policy framework has underpinned ten consecutive years of
federal budget surpluses. In 1997, Canada adopted a framework based on the principle
“budget balance or better,” which was modified in 2006 to target an annual reduction of
C$3 billion in federal government debt (around ¼ percent of 2007 GDP), buttressed by a
medium-term target to reduce federal debt to 25 percent of GDP. Within the framework,
budgeting has been conservative, with actual surpluses typically exceeding projections. At
1 percent of GDP, the FY 2006/7 surplus was a half percentage point above the budget
forecast, owing largely to buoyant corporate income tax revenue (Figure 5 and Table 6).

1/ The projections are based on the baseline provided by the authorities' 2007 Economic Statement adjusted for staff
macro assumptions.
2/ Planning surplus = budget balance minus debt reduction.
3/ Assuming future planned debt reduction is achieved.

50.
This year’s budgetary overperformance is to be used for tax relief and debt
reduction. With higher-than-expected nominal GDP growth and corporate income tax
revenue, the budget surplus based on current policies is again expected to be substantial
(¾ percentage points of GDP) this fiscal year. In the Economic Statement, the government
proposes to use this overperformance to finance tax relief (¼ percentage point of GDP) and a
one-off additional debt reduction (½ percentage points of GDP). Next fiscal year, the
overperformance would be used to finance the full annual cost of the tax relief measures, and
the projected surplus remains around the debt reduction target.
51.
The mission agreed with officials that the comfortable projected fiscal position
provides room for permanent tax relief. Indeed, given the worsening of the economic
outlook, the fiscal stimulus in 2008 appears fortuitously timed. However, staff observed that
there was a risk that some recent revenue gains (particularly from commodity industries) may
be more temporary than expected. This underscores the importance of expenditure restraint,
particularly given relatively rapid recent spending growth. While acknowledging the risk,
officials emphasized that the Statement incorporated private economic and budget forecasts
and that the assumed tax buoyancy appeared appropriately conservative, particularly in the
light of past revenue overperformance.
52.
The major short-term uncertainty for the budget is the economic outlook given
that the current fiscal framework does not encompass discretionary policy. Staff
calculations suggest that, given the size of automatic stabilizers, nominal GDP would need to
slow by 1 percentage points more than in the baseline to push the federal government into
deficit in fiscal year 2008–09. This implied either significantly lower real growth or a large
fall in commodity prices. Senior officials emphasized that the current fiscal framework
incorporated a fixed target surplus but did not exclude the possibility of running a deficit
under unexpectedly adverse circumstances.
53.
Staff viewed the reduction in the federal GST tax rate (the Canadian value
added tax) by a percentage point to 5 percent in the Statement as a missed opportunity.
As has been noted in previous consultations, larger gains in efficiency could have been

20
obtained by cutting other taxes (see also Chapter 6 of Northern Star, IMF Occasional
Paper 258).
54.
Staff suggested that the priority for tax relief should be to reduce high marginal
effective rates (METRs) on capital, saving, and labor income (in that order):
•

Accordingly, staff welcomed the 1 percentage point cut in the general corporate income
tax rate in 2008 and its further reduction to 15 percent tax rate by 2012. This will have
the added benefit of making corporate taxes more neutral with regard to firm size.

•

Staff and federal officials agreed that harmonizing remaining provincial sales taxes
with the GST base, thereby exempting business inputs, is also central to lowering
METRs on capital. Senior officials observed that the government has stated its
willingness to work with provinces on harmonization. Staff suggested that a more
explicit offer of assistance—as had occurred in earlier efforts to harmonize sales taxes
and to eliminate provincial capital taxes—might be a more effective approach.

•

The team noted that marginal effective taxes on most forms of saving remain high.
Additional measures, such as protecting all types of saving from taxes up to a cap,
could help support wealth creation by moving personal income taxes closer to a
consumption tax. Senior officials were sympathetic, while pointing out that it was also
important to ensure neutrality of taxation across saving vehicles, and that there had
recently been a significant rise in the pension income amount eligible for tax relief.

•

Staff welcomed the reduction in the lowest personal income tax rate by half a
percentage point to 15 percent and the introduction of the Working Income Tax Benefit
(a negative income tax).

55.
The team suggested that increasing the relative importance of indirect to direct
tax revenues is one way of lowering high marginal tax rates on income. This proposal,
which has also been suggested by some think tanks, would also help maintain the tax base in
the face of commodity cycles and population aging. One option for creating room for income
tax relief would be to follow the example of British Columbia and explore introducing a
carbon tax. Officials responded that the government had chosen to reduce carbon emissions
through other means.
56.
While generally supporting the reformed system of equalization transfers to
provinces, the mission noted some areas where transparency is still lacking. Among the
key elements of the system are a return to including all provinces in the formula determining
transfer payments, the partial inclusion of revenue resources, and a cap on Equalization
transfers so that no receiving province has a higher fiscal capacity than a nonreceiving one.
Staff observed, however, that agreements allowing some provinces to obtain additional
transfers implied by the old system increased complexity. As with the previous Offshore
Accords agreed in 2005, this could gradually undermine the rules-based approach.

21
57.
The team welcomed the renewed commitment in the October Statement to
eliminate net general government debt by 2021. They noted that Fund analysis finds that
fiscal surpluses have helped ensure that Canada is closer to long-term budget sustainability
than other G-7 countries. Staff and officials agreed that it was important to continue to run
surpluses and lower federal and general government debt to help prepare for the costs
associated with population aging and health innovation. Staff looked forward to the early
publication of the long-term fiscal sustainability analysis that had been promised for the
recent Statement. Officials responded that work continues on the report.
58.
Staff suggested that on current policies public health care spending would likely
continue to expand rapidly, driving a rise in general government debt after 2021. While
provinces are responsible for health care delivery, the federal budget is also involved given
this is an area of national priority and there is a constitutional requirement to provide federal
support to help ensure that provincial governments provide reasonably comparable levels of
public services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation.. Officials explained that they
were supporting provincial and territorial efforts to make health care delivery more efficient,
including developing indicators that allowed outcomes to be compared across jurisdictions,
but observed that there was little case for reducing services given that academic studies
suggested that the social return on health spending is high.
D. Promoting Rapid Productivity Growth
59.
The government’s structural reform agenda focuses on boosting productivity.
Canada’s productivity performance in recent years has been disappointing. Fast growth has
primarily reflected increased labor participation, while both business investment and total
factor productivity growth have lagged behind U.S. rates. Looking forward, the
government’s structural policy blueprint Advantage Canada, released in late 2006, is aimed
at raising productivity. Staff observed that this is particularly pertinent given pressures from
dollar appreciation as well as gradual population aging.
60.
The team agreed with officials that measures proposed in Advantage Canada
address many key impediments to higher productivity growth. In particular, the
structural policy blueprint recognizes the importance of reducing high marginal effective tax
rates—to which some of the tax relief measures proposed in the Statement would
contribute—and creating a dynamic and globally competitive financial system that would
provide broader access to finance. In addition, the blueprint includes plans to encourage
interprovincial labor mobility and to facilitate immigration of skilled labor.
61.
Staff emphasized the importance of lowering product market barriers for
improving productivity growth. Previous staff analysis has highlighted that Canada has a
relatively efficient labor market by international standards, but that product market
restrictions remain relatively high compared to other industrial countries, most notably in the
financial sector (discussed earlier) and network industries (airlines, telecommunication,
utilities, and media) (Figure 6). These constraints on the efficient allocation of resources
lower productivity (see Chapter 3 of Northern Star, IMF Occasional Paper 258). In addition,
Chapter 5 of the Selected Issues paper finds that labor market churning through firm creation
and destruction is significantly lower in Canada than in the United States.

22
62.
Accordingly, the team suggested that product markets should be a focus of
structural reform:
•

Current restrictions on inward foreign direct investment should be lowered, most
notably in network industries, thereby stimulating competition and the international
transfer of best practices. Officials responded that they recognized this was an issue,
and had formed an expert panel that, as part of its mandate, would report on the impact
of FDI restriction on competition by mid-2008.

•

Senior officials agreed with staff that barriers to interprovincial trade in goods and
services, and to mobility in regulated professions, also hamper competition and
innovation. The recent Trade, Investment, and Labor Mobility Agreement (TILMA)
between Alberta and British Columbia is a particularly important development as it is
based on a presumption that mobility is free unless specifically excluded, which is
breathing new life into a policy issue where progress had been slow. For example,
Ontario and Quebec have started discussions on their own trade deal.

63.
The gradual transition from labor abundance to scarcity puts particular focus
on participation by older workers and successful integration of foreign immigrants.
Staff agreed with officials that the main disincentive to older workers was the lower expected
income for older retirees from the Canada/Quebec Pension Plans and the structure of many
private pension plans. Turning to immigration, staff suggested that the current approach to
economic migration is too inflexible in the face of changing demands for labor. Officials
responded that provinces with particular skill needs were increasingly using established
mechanisms to facilitate hiring of needed workers and that the existing system represented a
long-term social contract that would be difficult to alter.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
64.
After five years of strong growth, the economy is forecast to slow in the next few
quarters. A weakening U.S. economy and recent currency appreciation are likely to reduce
external demand for Canadian goods and services, while domestic demand is expected to
moderate as financial conditions tighten and real income growth normalizes.
65.
The balance of risks to growth is tilted to the downside. This reflects external
risks, particularly those coming from a possible U.S. recession and global financial strains.
However, domestic demand could slow by less than expected given its recent strength,
particularly if recent upward momentum in commodity prices continues.
66.
Monetary policy has appropriately shifted to guarding against increasing nearterm downside risks, and the December interest rate cut was welcome. As financial
conditions tightened, the external environment weakened, and currency passthrough pushed
down core inflation, the Bank nimbly repositioned its policy stance while communicating the
implications of the changes in near-term risks to markets and the public. Given strains in
money markets that are likely to persist, the Bank’s measures to inject term liquidity in
coordination with other central banks and to expand eligible collateral are welcome.

23
67.
At near parity against the U.S. dollar and with oil prices of $90-100 a barrel, the
currency appears broadly in line with fundamentals, although some measures suggest
modest overvaluation. The floating exchange rate continues to support macroeconomic
stability by generally acting as a shock absorber to changes in the terms of trade. While most
of the appreciation since 2002 has reflected booming commodity prices, the rapid
appreciation in 2007 partly reflected momentum buying and general U.S. dollar weakness.
Subsequently, the Canadian dollar has fallen from November’s record high against the U.S.
dollar, when it was modestly overvalued by most measures.
68.
Reflecting flexible labor markets, domestic adjustment to currency appreciation
has been remarkably smooth. Employment gains in services, construction, and mining as
well as interprovincial migration have more than offset manufacturing job losses in the
central provinces. Nevertheless, competitiveness has suffered, underlining the importance of
increasing flexibility and productivity growth.
69.
Staff support the government’s structural policy agenda outlined in Advantage
Canada. In staff’s view, boosting productivity requires greater focus on product market
reform. Regulations and restrictions on inward foreign direct investment, especially in
network industries, weigh on productivity growth. Barriers to interprovincial trade in goods
and services and labor mobility also hamper competition and innovation. The recent Trade,
Investment, and Labor Mobility Agreement (TILMA) between Alberta and British Columbia
provides a model for progress elsewhere.
70.
The financial system appears to be in a position to weather further turbulence,
but balance sheet strains are likely to slow financing and growth. Current capital
positions allow Canadian banks to absorb substantial balance sheet losses, and the banking
system’s exposure to the U.S. subprime market and structured credit products is generally
considered more limited than in other major markets. However, as elsewhere, funding
conditions have tightened, while credit risk from a slowing domestic economy and banks’
exposure to U.S. markets will put pressure on balance sheets.
71.
The agreement in principle to restructure the frozen third-party ABCP has
lowered a major risk to financial conditions. The ABCP shutdown reflected a combination
of weak investor due diligence, ratings that neglected liquidity risks, and a lack of
transparency in a market environment where capital adequacy regulation had provided
incentives for conditional liquidity support. Given the risk of a fire sale of illiquid assets,
staff welcome the agreement in principle, and the support for this private-sector process
provided by the government.
72.
While bank regulation and supervision largely meet best practice, securities
markets would benefit from a single regulator. The automatic interjurisdictional
recognition of decisions of the home regulator (except for Ontario) under the proposed
passport system is a significant step forward. Nonetheless, as in past years, staff believe that
a single regulator is the most effective way to ensure timely policy responses, as well as
lower costs and foster consistent enforcement. More broadly, regulators should address new
challenges from financial innovation, including establishing adequate transparency for new
products, issues that are being discussed in a range of international fora.

24
73.
Banks’ resilience to balance-sheet risk is a benefit in current times, although it
partly reflects a lack of contestability. The “widely-held” rule prevents market entry on a
large scale, leading to low-risk balance sheets and high returns on equity. It also limits
incentives for financial innovation and for serving higher risk borrowers, including dynamic
small- and medium-sized enterprises that contribute to productivity growth. Removing
barriers to acquisition of large banks, including by foreign entities, would foster
contestability and innovation in the financial system.
74.
A sound fiscal framework policy has produced an enviably strong fiscal position
that makes eliminating general government net debt by 2021 feasible. Canada is closer to
long-term budget sustainability than other major industrial countries but, with public health
care spending by provinces set to increase rapidly, the federal government’s reaffirmation of
its objective to eliminate general government net debt by 2021 is welcome. This, together
with health care reform, will help to alleviate long-term spending pressures from population
aging.
75.
The budgetary overperformance provides room for tax relief while maintaining
small budget surpluses. While recognizing the risk that some of the recent revenue gains
may not be permanent, staff welcome this proposed tax relief as well as planned one-off
additional debt reduction. Even though small in size, the related demand stimulus in 2008 is
fortuitous, given weaker growth prospects.
76.
To foster efficiency, the fiscal room should be used to reduce high marginal
effective tax rates on capital, saving, and labor (in that order). Instead, the main tax relief
measure in the Statement is a one percentage point cut in the federal GST rate to 5 percent.
That said, staff welcome progress in reducing high marginal effective tax rates on business
investment, particularly the federal corporate tax rate cut which will gradually bring the rate
to 15 percent by 2012. Harmonization of some provincial sales tax bases with the federal
GST would further reduce marginal effective tax rates on capital, and justify more explicit
incentives than the government’s existing commitment to work with provinces.
77.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Canada will be held on
the regular 12-month cycle.

Labor Markets
Priorities are reducing welfare walls, amending immigration
systems to address skills shortages, and simplifying
recognition of occupational qualifications.

Consideration could be given to funding social benefits of the
Employment Insurance system through general revenues
and to curbing extended regional benefits.

Trade Policy
Canada needs to widen market access for agricultural goods, Canada is pursuing an ambitious Doha outcome and will
including those subject to “supply management” schemes.
continue to support supply management.

Canada has high labor participation rates, but the boom in
the commodity and construction sectors has led to tight labor
markets especially in the Western provinces.

Canada maintains an Employment Insurance system that
offers generous seasonal, regional, and family leave
benefits, funded by a payroll tax.

Canada can play an important leadership role in the Doha
negotiations.

Recent reforms to the Employment Insurance System have
improved the system's funding. No significant changes in
benefits are currently being considered.

The federal government has committed to improving labor
market efficiency, and has enacted a working income tax
benefit and is studying plans for phased retirement. Progress
has also been made in removing obstacles to labor mobility
under the Agreement on Internal Trade.

In 2006, the federal government implemented temporary relief
measures to re-establish full funding in an orderly fashion. The
federal government will continue to examine the broader
challenges facing defined benefit pension plans.

Financial Policy
Entry into public consultation on reform is welcome and early
action is warranted to better align the incentives of plan
sponsors and members.

The funding of Canada's defined benefit plans has
deteriorated over the past several years, but has stabilized
over the past year.

The Canada Health Act allows for private service delivery, and
provinces are actively exploring different approaches to
improve competition. Even low user fees could significantly
reduce access to health care by the poor.

Authorities’ Position

Fiscal Policy
Allowing provinces greater flexibility in using price and other
market-based mechanisms could help align the demand and
supply for health care and reduce costs over time.

Staff Position

The agreement to lock in federal health transfers over the
next 10 years provides provinces with opportunities to
improve the efficiency and quality of health care.

1/ The OECD measure of general government net financial liabilities.
2/ The difference with the OECD measure mainly reflects the inclusion of government employee unfunded pension liabilities in Statistics Canada
definition of general government National Balance Sheet Accounts. Net debt is not adjusted for Financial assets of Social Security Funds. The
"Baseline" path reports projected government debt ratios assuming for the first ten years that the federal government achieves its ten-year debt
reduction target, provinces run balanced budgets, and public health care inflation equals the growth in all prices through 2046. The "No-debt ratio
reduction" path assumes that federal and provincial debt ratios remain unchanged over the next ten years. The "Debt reduction and high health
inflation" path illustrates the impact of public medical costs rising 2 percent per year faster than all prices, with the additional costs offset only though
2016. In all cases, the fiscal system is assumed unchanged after 2016. More details on the model are provided in "Assessing the Long-Term Fiscal
Position of Canada" in IMF Country Report No. 03/34.

Exchange Rate Arrangements: The Canadian authorities do not maintain margins
with respect to exchange transactions. The Canadian dollar is a freely floating currency, with
exchange rates determined on the basis of demand and supply conditions in the foreign
exchange market. However, the authorities may intervene to maintain orderly conditions in
the exchange market. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign
exchange. Canada has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4(a) and
maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions. Canada maintains exchange restrictions for
security reasons, based on UN Security Council Resolutions, that have been notified to the
Fund for approval (most recently EBD/07/121, 11/1/07) under the procedures set forth in
Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51).

The 2008 Article IV discussions were conducted in Ottawa and Toronto from
December 3-11 by T. Bayoumi (head), T. Helbling, R. Balakrishnan, V. Klyuev, and
H. Tong (all WHD). An advance mission team visited British Columbia. Mr. Perrault (Senior
Advisor) attended the meetings. Mr. Singh and Ms. Atkinson (both WHD) and Mr. Fried
(Executive Director) participated in the concluding meeting with Minister of Finance
Flaherty and Bank of Canada Senior Deputy Governor Jenkins in Ottawa on December 17. A
press conference was held on December 19. Outreach included discussions with the private
sector, labor unions, academics, and think tanks.

FSSA Participation and ROSC Assessments

Canada–Financial System Stability Assessment–
Volume II: Report on Observance of Standards
in the Financial System

FO/Dis/00/2, Sup. 1,
04/01/00

Summary: The FSSA report concluded that Canada has a stable and highly advanced
financial system, which is among the soundest in the world. Moreover, it is supported
by a well-developed regulatory system that shows a high degree of compliance with
major international standards. Nevertheless, the FSSA report made a few
recommendations to further strengthen the regulatory framework and financial
system’s resilience, most of which have already been addressed, including:
•

Introducing capital requirements for the guarantees in life insurance
segregated fund (completed by end-2001);

•

Tabling legislation granting the Office of the Superintendent of Financial
Institutions (OSFI) powers to remove a financial institution’s director or
senior officer if the person is deemed not suitable to hold that office based on
a number of criteria. The latter legislation brought Canada into broad
compliance with the Basel Core Principles;

Making significant progress in harmonizing securities regulation and improving
coordination among provincial securities regulators, including through a newly
created association of securities regulators, the Canadian Securities Administrators.
Although there remain multiple regulators at the provincial level, a Senate
commission was created to develop specific recommendations on further
harmonization and streamlining of securities regulation.

Canada: Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes—Fiscal Transparency Module

IMF Country Report
No. 02/51, 03/12/02

Summary: The report found that fiscal management in Canada meets the
requirements of the fiscal transparency code, and in a number of instances represents
best practice. In particular, it highlighted the use of private sector economic forecasts.
Fiscal management was also commended for its statistical integrity, impartial tax
administration, open procurement, and a transparent regulatory process.
The report found several areas where further improvements would be desirable,
including: (i) the preparation of timely, current year estimates of federal and
provincial budgets on a comparable basis, (ii) a comprehensive account of the
procedures for the budget cycle and expenditure management system, (iii) systematic
reporting of the use of reserves for non-economic contingencies, (iv) resumption of
publication of reconciled national and public accounts forecasts of major aggregates
over the forecast horizon, and (v) publication by all governments of quasi-fiscal
activities.
Many of these issues have been addressed, including: (i) the release by Statistics
Canada of consolidated data for federal and provincial budgets for 2001–02 (on a
Financial Management System basis); (ii) the publication of comprehensive
descriptions of budget and expenditure management procedures, including a joint
document entitled “Budgeting in Canada” by the Government and the OECD, detailed
accounts of policies and procedures on expenditure management at the website of the
Treasury Board Secretariat, and the explanation of the budget cycle and process in
Budget and Update documents; and (iii) publication of reconciled national and public
accounts forecasting.
Canada: Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes—Data Module

IMF Country Report
No. 03/328, 10/23/03

Summary: Canada’s macroeconomic statistics are comprehensive, timely, and
accurate and thus adequate to conduct effective surveillance of economic and
financial policies. Official institutions responsible for the compilation and
dissemination of the macroeconomic datasets are supported by adequate legal and
institutional frameworks. These frameworks protect confidentiality and ensure that
statistical work is conducted within a quality assurance program and with sufficient
resources. Integrity is ensured by the professionalism of the staff, transparency in
statistical policies and practices, and the provision of ethical guidelines for staff.
Compilers generally follow internationally accepted guidelines in the production of
the macroeconomic statistics, which is well-supported by excellent efforts to develop
source data that facilitate a high degree of accuracy and reliability. Statistics are

5
generally relevant, well documented, available with good frequency on a timely basis,
and readily accessible to users, who trust them as objective.
While recognizing the high quality of the macroeconomic data, the report makes
recommendations to further strengthen the statistical system, most of which are
already being addressed, including these priorities:
•

Articulate the roles of Statistics Canada and the Bank of Canada in producing
financial sector statistics and explore possibilities for more data sharing of
monetary and financial statistics;

•

Estimate consumption of fixed capital at replacement cost rather than historic
costs now used for the corporate sector in the Canadian System of National
Accounts (CSNA);

•

Disseminate information on the sources and methods used in compiling quarterly
public sector statistics for the quarterly CSNA; and

•

Reclassify certain transactions that are not recorded in line with the 5th edition of
the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5).

6
Annex II. Statistical Issues
The quality, coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of Canada’s economic data are considered
to be excellent both in the context of the Article IV consultation and for purposes of ongoing
surveillance. Canada has subscribed to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard
(SDDS), and its metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(DSBB).
Real Sector. Statistics Canada provides timely and adequate data in monthly, quarterly, and
annual frequency thereby facilitating the analysis of economic developments and assessment
of policy proposals within a quantitative macroeconomic framework. In May 2001, Statistics
Canada effected a smooth transition from Laspeyres methodology for estimating real

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Canada
February 6, 2008
1.
This note reports on recent developments since the staff report was issued. They
do not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Signs of slowing activity and inflation from weaker external conditions are
emerging. Payroll employment fell 0.1 percent in November, real GDP growth decelerated
to 0.1 percent from 0.2 percent the previous month, although strong retail sales suggest
continued momentum in consumption. The leading indicator index fell in December, for the
first time since 2001, housing starts dropped, and manufacturers expect to lower production
and employment in the first quarter of 2008. Despite continuing strong wage growth, both
headline and core inflation declined in December, the latter to 1.5 percent—the lowest rate in
two years—likely reflecting continued exchange rate passthrough.
3.
The Bank of Canada lowered its target for the overnight interest rate by 25 basis
points to 4 percent at its January 22 meeting and adopted an easing bias. In the
accompanying Monetary Policy Report Update, the Bank noted a further tightening in the
prices, terms, and availability of credit in the last three months and a deteriorating outlook for
the United States. The Bank also lowered Canadian real GDP growth projection for 2008
from 2.3 to 1.8 percent. The Bank noted the strong downward pressure on retail prices since
the exchange rate against the U.S. dollar reached parity.
4.
Staff revised down the growth rate projections for 2008 and 2009 in the January
WEO Update. 2008 growth was revised from 2.0 to 1.8 percent and 2009 growth from 2.7 to
2.4 percent. The revision primarily reflects the downgrading of the staff’s U.S. forecast,
which exacerbates the drag from net exports, as well as the recent tightening of Canadian
financial conditions. With the revision reflecting the realization of the downside risks
specified in the Staff Report, the risks to the current forecast are now more balanced. Staff’s
growth projections are: (i) somewhat below the January private sector consensus; (ii) in line
with the Bank of Canada’s forecast for this year; (iii) but more pessimistic for 2009, with the
Bank expecting a faster recovery both in Canada and in the United States.
5.
Several major Canadian banks have announced significant further write-downs
on their holdings of structured products, including ABCP, CDOs and RMBSs. These
actions reflect both reductions in the value of underlying assets and the downgrading of some
of the banks' hedging counterparties (e.g., financial guarantors). Canadian banks are exposed
to market turbulence through a variety of channels, including liquidity support commitments,
participation in LBO transactions, and the management of SIVs. Still, they remain well
capitalized. One of the banks has raised additional capital from domestic and international
investors.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 25, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with Canada
On February, 6, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Canada.1
Background
Canada’s strong economic performance of the past decade continued in 2007. Real GDP
growth was around 2½ percent in 2007, driven by robust growth in domestic demand—
particularly private consumption and residential investment—of close to 4 percent. Domestic
demand was boosted by large terms-of-trade gains and by improvement in employment—as the
unemployment rate fell below 6 percent to its lowest level in 33 years.
Growth slowed toward the end of the year, and is expected to decelerate further to 1.8 percent
in 2008 reflecting a sharp downturn in the United States, past currency appreciation, and a
tightening of financial market conditions. Core inflation, which had been on the rise earlier in the
year, declined in the second half of 2007 owing to stronger-than-expected exchange rate passthrough, although headline remained elevated due to rising gasoline prices.
Despite strong gains in the terms of trade, the external current account surplus narrowed to
1 percent of GDP in 2007 as real net exports declined sharply. The latter largely reflected a
sharp deterioration in the manufacturing trade balance in response to the currency appreciation
and the slowing U.S. economy, but also increasing imports. The Canadian dollar has
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

appreciated by 45 percent in real effective terms since 2002, although domestic adjustment to
the appreciation has been very smooth thanks to the flexible labor markets.
After maintaining a neutral monetary policy stance for most part of 2007, the Bank of Canada
(BoC) reduced its policy rate to 4 percent—in two consecutive cuts of 25 basis points in
December 2007 and January 2008—in response to the deteriorating economic prospects and
declining core inflation. In its January statement, the BoC noted that the weak U.S. economic
outlook and tighter credit conditions in Canada would likely continue to pose challenges for the
Canadian economy, in response to which further monetary easing might be needed in the near
term.
Financial conditions have been modestly affected by the spillovers from the global liquidity
crunch in the money markets. Interbank spreads for major Canadian banks rose, although not
as much as in other major markets. The extent of financial vulnerabilities has so far been limited
owing to relatively low exposures to asset-backed securities, but uncertainties remain with
respect to the impact of further deterioration in U.S. financial market conditions. An agreement
in principle in late December to restructure the local frozen third-party ABCP has reduced
contagion risks in other domestic financial markets. In its January 2008 Monetary Policy Report
Update, the BoC noted that the average cost of borrowing for households and businesses had
risen by 15-25 basis points relative to October 2007, and credit conditions could tighten further.
A prudent fiscal policy framework for the last decade has provided for 10 consecutive years of
budget surpluses, and public debt ratios have declined. The budget surplus for fiscal year
2006/07 was estimated at 1 percent of GDP, half a percentage point above the budget forecast,
reflecting buoyancy of corporate income tax revenue. In its October 2007 Economic Statement,
the government emphasized tax relief (the federal goods and services tax rate was cut by
1 percentage point to 5 percent, effective January 1, 2008, and the corporate and personal
income taxes have also been reduced), and debt reduction to be the key priorities for the use of
budget over performance.
The government’s structural policy blueprint—Advantage Canada, released in late 2006—
emphasized boosting productivity as a high priority in the structural reform agenda. Key
measures identified in the blueprint include: enhancing business productivity by reducing the
high marginal effective tax rates (which was supported by the tax relief measures proposed in
the Economic Statement), creating a dynamic and globally competitive financial system, and
enhancing interprovincial labor mobility.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Canada’s impressive macroeconomic track record since the
mid-1990s, which has been underpinned by sound monetary and fiscal policies and favorable
external conditions. They welcomed, in particular, the strong GDP growth and declining
unemployment, low and stable inflation, and consecutive fiscal surpluses with attendant
reductions in the federal debt-to-GDP ratio achieved during this period.

3
Looking ahead, Directors observed that the near-term economic outlook would be affected by a
potential sharp slowing of the U.S. economy, the effects of past currency appreciation, and
tighter credit conditions--although domestic demand would likely remain solid. Against this
background, Directors welcomed the recent measured easing of policies, noting that Canada’s
strong monetary framework, as well as exemplary budgetary performance, have provided room
for supportive policy actions. More generally, Directors considered that the economy, grounded
in strong fundamentals, is well poised to meet the near-term challenges. At the same time, they
welcomed the authorities’ recognition of the uncertainties in the evolution of both domestic and
external demand. Directors also supported the authorities’ continued attention to medium-term
considerations of productivity growth and policy reforms.
Directors commended the Bank of Canada’s recent move to reduce policy rates in December
and January. In light of a potential further deterioration of the economic outlook, Directors
welcomed the authorities’ intention to monitor developments closely and act as required. Some
noted that there may be room for further reductions in the overnight rate in the near term.
Directors took note of the Bank’s ongoing examination of possible refinements to its monetary
policy framework. In view of the proven success of the present inflation targeting framework,
they concurred with the authorities and staff that there must be compelling evidence in support
of price level path targeting before changing the monetary regime. Directors welcomed the
Bank’s commitment to increasing the transparency of its decision-making process.
Turning to fiscal policy, Directors considered it appropriate to allow automatic stabilizers to
operate. They agreed that the budgetary over-performance projected for the current year had
provided room for the tax relief, and noted that this would be timely given weaker economic
prospects. Directors pointed out, however, that some of the revenue gains underlying the
budget surplus could prove temporary, which underscored the importance of maintaining
expenditure restraint over the medium term.
Directors commended the government’s objective of lowering the tax burden and continuing
debt reduction as highlighted in the 2007 Economic Statement. In particular, they welcomed the
authorities’ objective to eliminate general government debt by 2021, and agreed that this would
help provide the fiscal space needed to meet impending costs related to population aging.
In light of the relatively high level of Canada’s marginal effective corporate tax rates, Directors
welcomed the reduction in the general corporate income tax rate in January, and planned
further reductions over the medium term. Several Directors noted that lowering marginal
effective tax rates on saving and capital could provide greater efficiency benefits rather than
lowering consumption taxes. Directors welcomed the steps taken to reform the equalization
system by moving to a more rules-based system for equalization transfers.
Directors agreed that the Canadian dollar is broadly in line with the economy’s fundamentals
given high commodity prices. They observed that the domestic adjustment to the 45 percent
appreciation in the real effective exchange rate since 2002 has so far been remarkably smooth,
reflecting flexible labor markets--although some Directors noted that the appreciation has posed
increasing challenges for many exporters.

4

Directors were reassured by the findings of the recent Financial Sector Assessment Program
Update, which indicated that the Canadian banking system is sound, profitable, and largely
robust to adverse shocks. The agreement in principle to restructure the non-bank ABCP market
has mitigated a major risk to financial market conditions.
Directors welcomed the relative resilience of Canadian banks to financial market strains
compared with many other countries, while stressing the importance of continuing vigilance in
this area. At the same time, a number of Directors noted that a further opening of the Canadian
banking system to takeovers would boost market flexibility, support financial innovation, and
widen access to finance. Some Directors, however, felt that the benefits from such a policy were
outweighed by benefits of the current system in terms of resilience.
While noting that the “passport plus” system of provincial market regulation under
implementation is a significant improvement in securities market regulation compared with the
current fragmented system, Directors believed that there would be benefits in embracing a
single securities regulator, as in many other industrialized countries, to improve further the
efficiency and effectiveness of securities’ market regulation
Directors supported the authorities’ focus on structural reforms to boost productivity, as outlined
in Advantage Canada. There was scope for further product market reform, by reducing
restrictions on inward foreign direct investment in network industries and removing barriers to
interprovincial trade in goods and services. Directors welcomed the creation of a Competition
Policy Review panel to examine possible changes to enhance competition.
