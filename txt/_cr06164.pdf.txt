EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
The dominant financial sector has supported a steady rebound in economic activity. Growth
is projected to remain healthy in the near term, but trend growth may decline as the rapid
financial sector expansion may decelerate. The recovery notwithstanding, the fiscal deficit
has widened to 2.3 percent of GDP in 2005, driven primarily by social expenditure growth,
while unemployment has edged up to 4½ percent. The government plans to announce in May
a comprehensive reform package to address fiscal and structural challenges.
Policy discussions focused on the following areas:
•

Financial sector importance for growth. The financial sector’s successful shift from
traditional banking services to the investment fund industry (IFI) is well advanced.
Notwithstanding farsighted initiatives to position the sector for future opportunities,
its pace of expansion is likely to decelerate, moderating trend GDP growth. Hence,
staff estimates that growth may fall short of the authorities’ medium-term projections
of 4½ percent a year by nearly 1 percentage point.

•

Financial sector soundness. The financial system remains sound, resilient to
potential adverse shocks, and well supervised. The close integration of Luxembourg’s
mostly foreign-owned financial institutions with their parent companies tends to
enhance soundness, including asset quality and capital adequacy. Rising commission
income, spurred by the shift into the IFI, bodes well for continued diversification of
earnings and financial sector stability.

•

Fiscal policy. There was broad agreement that social expenditures needed to be
curtailed to reverse adverse fiscal trends. Staff called for a return to a moderate
surplus, given the underfunding of future liabilities of the public pension system.
While supporting the authorities’ intention of restoring budget balance soon after
2008, staff noted durable expenditure measures remained to be defined and the
adjustment needed to be strengthened. Staff proposed the adoption of a medium-term
fiscal framework to anchor policies.

•

Labor market. There has been a steady increase in structural unemployment, largely
owing to a labor supply shock triggered by benefit reforms in neighboring countries.
A widening gap between the entitlements to resident and foreign job seekers has
heightened competition in Luxembourg’s regional labor market and pushed a growing
number of resident workers into unemployment. Addressing this issue requires
modifying major entitlement benefits, including unemployment assistance and the
minimum guaranteed income.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
While among the smallest EU countries, Luxembourg’s successful policies have
given it a reach that extends well beyond its borders. Following the steel crisis of
the 1970s, Luxembourg managed the transition to a financial services-based economy
because of its (i) advantageous tax and regulatory regime; (ii) early financial market
liberalization; and (iii) responsible financial policies. These policies generated a virtuous
growth cycle in the “golden 1980s and 1990s,” permitting the public sector to accumulate
substantial wealth.1 Relying to a considerable extent on foreign labor and capital, this growth
steadily raised the country’s profile in the global financial system. Luxembourg’s
international banking industry is comparable in size to those of Hong Kong SAR and
Singapore, while its investment fund industry (IFI) has become the second largest worldwide.
II. BACKGROUND
2.
The momentum these policies imparted to the economy is waning, although
growth remains well above the EU average. Growth has decelerated this decade to an
annual average of 3 percent from 5 percent in the 1980s and 1990s. This reflects in part the
slowdown following the bursting of the equity bubble in 2000, and the fact that the 2004-05
recovery—with growth averaging nearly 4½ percent—was less buoyant than earlier
upswings.
3.
The dominant financial sector helped extend the economic recovery in 2005
(Figure 1). The financial sector—together with the closely linked real estate, telecommunications, and other sectors—accounted for two thirds of GDP in 2005. Amid strong gains in
European equity markets, services exports grew by an estimated 16 percent, fueling a
substantial current account surplus last year (Figure 2). Contrary to earlier fears, the EU
Savings Directive—introducing a withholding tax on interest income on foreign-held
deposits in July 2005—does not seem to have undermined the private wealth business of the
financial sector. Indeed, in anticipation of the tax, banks successfully facilitated a shift of
foreign deposits into investment vehicles exempt from
30
taxation, thereby boosting their commission income.

Nevertheless, the financial services industry—
especially the banking sector—is maturing, following
a successful shift into fund management services
(Figures 3 and 4). Since the late 1990s, the financial
sector has successfully specialized in custody and
brokerage services for the IFI. However, stiff competition
has kept portfolio management activities abroad, and

Luxembourg has not participated in the rapid growth of the hedge fund industry. Assets
administered by Luxembourg’s IFI reached €1.5 trillion in December 2005. Fund
management companies and banks split the market almost evenly, which has supported a
steady increase in banks’ commission income. Nevertheless, banking sector profit growth has
fallen short of its long-term average in recent years.

While headline inflation is high compared to
the EU average, underlying inflation has remained
subdued (Figure 5). HICP headline inflation was
3.9 percent in February, but this measure exhibits an
upward bias.2 There has been a modest widening of the
underlying inflation differential with the euro area, as
service price inflation has exceeded goods price
inflation. Rental costs have risen sharply, reflecting a
boom in the housing market.

6.
Unemployment is rising and becoming increasingly structural, while wage
competition is intensifying in the regional labor market. Cross-border employees are
filling two out of three vacancies (Figure 6). The wage differential with abroad is rising, in
part driven by the almost full indexation of incomes to the consumer price index (CPI).
7.
The fiscal deficit is widening, amid rising social expenditures, sizable investment
outlays to mitigate structural bottlenecks, and less

buoyant revenues. Despite the recovery, the general

2.3 percent of GDP. Delayed effects of the economic
Expenditure
slowdown on corporate taxes and, more recently, shortfalls 45
in VAT revenues—due to large reimbursements following
40
a court order to speed up settlements—contributed along
with an ambitious public investment program (5 percent of

protracted deterioration are rapidly rising social
expenditures—especially for pensions and health care—

and these have been the longstanding focus of staff advice

Box 1. Past Fund Policy Recommendations and Implementation
Given the comfortable net asset position of Luxembourg’s general government, Fund policy
advice has tended to focus on medium- and long-term policy challenges. Key among those
are the fiscal pressures stemming from generous social welfare policies, pension pressures
relating to aging; rising health care costs; and labor market rigidities. While progress has
been uneven, Fund surveillance has contributed to focusing the policy debate on critical
tasks.
Fiscal policy. It has been longstanding Fund advice to curtail social expenditure growth to
bring public finances back into surplus over the medium term. Important measures taken
include tightened access to disability pensions and better enforcement of eligibility criteria
for sickness allowances. However, a recommended scaling back of unemployment benefits
or the minimum guaranteed income was not pursued. The latest Stability Program envisages
a return to near balance by 2008.
Pension and health care reform. On pensions, the Fund has consistently advised that the
pay-as-you-go pension system is unlikely to be sustainable under plausible growth
assumptions. Future funding problems, therefore, needed to be addressed upfront, taking
advantage of Luxembourg’s overall favorable growth developments. Proposed measures
included linking the replacement rate to the contribution base and the statutory retirement age
to life expectancy, while introducing an intergenerational solidarity factor in the benefit
adjustment formula. An increase of the retirement age is currently under consideration. The
Fund advised the authorities to preempt an increase in health care contribution rates through
comprehensive health care reforms, including higher co-payments, use of generic drugs, and
rationalizing of hospital services. Efforts to rein in escalating costs have not been successful.
Instead, an increase in payroll taxes became necessary in 2005. A reform plan to lower costs
is currently under preparation.
Financial sector. The continuous strengthening of supervision has been largely consistent
with Fund advice, including the higher frequency of stress testing for the insurance sector.

III. REPORT ON THE POLICY DISCUSSIONS
8.
The discussions focused on the policies required to overcome challenges to
Luxembourg’s trend growth and how to conduct fiscal policy in a lower growth
environment. The mission pointed to challenges from the maturing financial sector,
heightening international competition, and rising international pressure to eliminate tax and
regulatory advantages.3 The authorities expressed confidence that innovation would allow the
financial sector to continue functioning as an engine of growth and maintain its
competitiveness (Box 2). Nevertheless, they concurred that a more prudent fiscal policy
framework was needed, and that the generous social and pension system should be reviewed
to ensure its viability and enhance potential growth. A broad-based policy package
addressing these issues was under preparation and expected to be unveiled in May, but few
details were made available to the mission.
9.
There was consensus that the near-term growth outlook is positive (Table 1).
Upward revisions to global growth and signs that the recovery in the euro area was taking
hold boded well for the outlook. External demand would continue to be a major driver of
growth, while the prospects for domestic demand and consumption remained uncertain, amid
planned restraint of social expenditures, disappointing retail sales, limited real wage gains
and continued weak consumer sentiment (Figure 7). However, monetary conditions were
supportive, and investment demand would continue to strengthen gradually, driven largely by
replacement investments. The authorities acknowledged that their 2006 forecast might need
to be lowered to the staff’s 4.0 percent projection.

All agreed on a number of downside risks. Higher-than-expected oil prices or a
disorderly unwinding of global imbalances might choke the recovery in the euro area, the
destination for nearly all of Luxembourg’s exports. Either scenario could spell serious risks
for capital markets and, consequently, financial sector profits. On the domestic front, the

Box 2. Competitiveness
Given the unique characteristics of its economy, it is not straightforward to analyze
Luxembourg’s competitiveness. Financial service and steel exports combined represented
about two thirds of total exports in 2005. Exporters in these sectors tend to be price-takers in
international markets and, therefore, movements in the CPI-based REER provide little
insight. At the same time, standard indicators—such as unit labor costs (ULC)—are not
available for the dominant financial sector.
The financial sector is potentially becoming more vulnerable to competition,
notwithstanding its continued export success. The shift from high to low profit margin
activities point to heightening risks of competition, especially for the custody business. At
the same time, financial sector wage developments have been relatively favorable and costincome ratios remain low compared to other financial centers.1

While ULC in manufacturing have been decreasing since late 2001, Luxembourg’s
large steel industry is confronted with heightening competition. Global capacity in the
steel industry is rising, especially in Asia. The decline in relative ULC has been driven by
output gains combined with a moderate reduction in employment, including in the steel
sector. With the steel boom possibly ending, as additional capacity comes online, wage
moderation and layoffs may be necessary to prevent unit labor costs from rising.

authorities viewed the repercussions from a possible decline in housing prices as
manageable. House price inflation had been concentrated in the upper price segment of the
market, where the fallout for consumption would be more limited.
A. Financial Sector and the Medium-Term Outlook
11.
The financial sector and its key role for the Luxembourg economy featured most
prominently in the discussions. There was agreement that there had been a slowdown in
traditional banking activities and that Luxembourg’s banking sector was losing market share
within the EU. The authorities ascribed these developments largely to the cyclical decline of
credit in Germany. Nevertheless, slowing asset growth was also due to the banks’ shift into
off-balance-sheet activities, especially their IFI-related business.4
12.
The authorities were more sanguine than the staff about the prospects for
continued rapid financial sector expansion. They agreed that the profit margins of IFIrelated activities were lower than in traditional banking, but they expected strong retail and
institutional demand for investment funds to continue. Therefore, the IFI would remain an
engine of financial sector growth, notwithstanding the advanced stage of the sector’s
expansion. Moreover, Luxembourg stood to gain from ongoing EU financial market
integration, including efforts to further simplify and streamline procedures underlying the
distribution of investments funds across the EU. Laws on pension funds (SEPCAVS and
ASSEPS) passed in 2005 were intended to position the industry for potential further
privatization of pension systems within the EU, and a 2004 law would spur private equity
and venture capital business (SICAR). However, all agreed that competition for the pension
fund business was likely to be stiff, and that the impact of these initiatives would be felt only
gradually.
13.
Expectations for trend growth, therefore, diverged (Box 3). Staff argued that less
buoyant, albeit still strong, financial sector growth would lower real GDP trend growth to
3¾ percent over the medium term, almost 1 percentage point below the assumptions
underlying the November 2005 Stability and Program (SP). The authorities, however,
emphasized the sector’s inherent flexibility as a source of future growth, as demonstrated by
its versatile response to the EU Savings Directive.
B. Financial Sector Supervision and Soundness
14.
The authorities noted that financial sector soundness compared favorably with
the EU average (Table 2). As discussed in the 2002 Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP), this reflected in large part the very high foreign ownership of the banking sector and
the close involvement, via the interbank market, of Luxembourg’s subsidiaries in liquidity

4

Off-balance-sheet positions grew by 33 percent during 2005, more than double the 14 percent growth of assets
during the same period.

- 17 -

Box 3. Financial Sector and Growth
To assess Luxembourg’s medium-term growth potential, financial sector linkages need
to be examined. No other sector will be able to take over as the engine of growth in the next
several years. This box assesses two different real GDP growth scenarios for 2006-11,
estimating the strength required of the financial sector for these scenarios to materialize. The
two scenarios are (i) the authorities’ November 2005 Stability Program (SP); and (ii) the
staff’s medium-term scenario. In a stylized model, three sectors are considered: the financial
sector, those sectors that have exhibited close linkages with the financial sector, and other
sectors.
A breakdown of financial sector growth illustrates that the investment fund industry
has been a major driver of growth in recent years (see table below). In both scenarios it is
assumed that the IFI will grow to the extent required to reach the targeted growth path. For
simplicity, it is assumed that the banking industry—excluding investment fund activities—
will maintain its average growth of 2000-05. Growth in the insurance industry and in other
financial sector professionals (OFSP) is assumed to average that of the banking sector and
IFI. Growth in the two nonfinancial sectors has been set either to (i) follow the growth rate in
the financial sector, using observed relationships in 2000-05; or (ii) to equal their average
growth rate in 2000-05.

Reaching the real GDP growth rate assumed in the SP scenario requires strong
financial sector growth. An average growth rate of 5 ¼ percent is about 1 percentage point
below the average for 1986-2004, which includes the period when Luxembourg expanded
rapidly into an international financial center. In particular, unless growth in the more
traditional banking industry will substantially accelerate, the fund industry has to continue
growing almost as rapidly as in 2000-05. The staff’s growth scenario requires close to
4 percent real growth in the financial sector, very similar to its 2000-05 average. More
important, it still implies robust annual IFI growth of slightly less than 7 percent, suggesting
that the staff scenario is not overly conservative.

management of their foreign parent companies.5 Interbank deposits—about half of the
sector’s total liabilities in 2005—were typically channeled back into the interbank market as
short-term loans. These linkages resulted in high asset quality and liquidity ratios, and tended
to enhance capital adequacy ratios.6 The authorities agreed that it would be timely to review
develpoments through an FSAP update in 2007.
15.
The authorities agreed that the sector’s unique characteristics impacted gearing
and profitability measures. They noted that approximately two-thirds of interbank assets
and liabilities resulted from subsidiaries’ involvement in liquidity management with their
EU parent companies (Table 3). These transactions were recorded on a gross basis—only
because parent companies tended to be located abroad—thereby “inflating” assets and
lowering capital-to-asset ratios of Luxembourg-based subsidiaries. Higher gearing explained
banks’ lower returns on assets and higher return on equity compared to the EU average. The
authorities were not concerned by these features, especially given high asset quality. They
clarified that the classification of non-performing loans (NPLs) followed the standards
adopted by the parent company. They agreed with staff that introducing a unified standard
would be desirable, but no immediate steps were envisaged.

An improvement in the quality of earnings was seen to bode well for continued
soundness. The authorities and staff agreed that the successful expansion into the IFI had
resulted in a structural shift towards commission income and diversified the sources of
income growth. The authorities noted that exceptional factors had buoyed commission
income last year, including the strong showing of European equity markets and the shift of

real estate price shock. They reported that the
combination of rising own funds and reduced exposure— to credit risks emanating from
eight selected sectors, including airlines, insurance and the technology, media, and telecom
sector—had limited vulnerabilities. Under the extreme assumption of a full loss of banks’
claims in any individual sector, stress tests showed that there would be no systemic
consequences. However, losses would reduce the capital of a limited number of banks below
capital adequacy requirements, depending on the sector experiencing duress. The mission
suggested that the authorities extend the coverage of credit risk stress tests to sectors
currently experiencing difficulties, including the automobile sector, and to update these tests
more frequently. The authorities reported that—among 17 banks with real estate exposure
exceeding 10 percent of own funds—the capital of virtually all banks would remain above
the required level under the extreme assumptions of 100 percent loan-to-value ratios and full
losses. The banks’ exposure to interest rate and exchange rate risks was minor. Stress tests
for on- and off-balance-sheet interest rate risks—modeled as a 2 percentage point variation in
rates—for the 19 banks with the highest interest rate exposure on their trading and
proprietary books did not lower the capital of any of these banks below the regulatory
minimum.
18.
Banking sector supervision and crisis management had been further
strengthened. The authorities pointed to continued improvements of crisis management—
already closely coordinated with foreign supervisors—through the signing of various
bilateral and multilateral memoranda of understanding. In particular, the authorities noted
that cooperation had been broadened, involving for the first time EU finance ministries, in
addition to central banks and supervisors. Staffing of the banking supervisory authority had
steadily risen over the past two years from 199 to 256 by end-2005, enhancing supervision,
including of the rapidly expanding IFI.
19.
The authorities noted that insurance sector solvency remained high and
supervision was effective. Solvency remained comfortable, but the coverage ratio was

- 20 -

declining, owing to expansion in both life and nonlife segments (Table 4). The authorities
noted that they were conducting regular stress tests, in line with FSAP recommendations. A
25 percent fall of equity markets would lower the solvency of three companies below
standards (September 2005), but the impact of a shift in interest rates would be limited. The
number of supervisory staff had been further increased.
C. Fiscal Policy
20.
There was agreement that additional measures may be needed to reach the 2006
budget deficit target. The budget envisages a reduction in the general government deficit by
½ percent of GDP to 1.8 percent of GDP. Staff noted that the underlying expenditure
measures were not well defined, and saw the deficit stabilizing rather than declining
(Table 5). The authorities responded that the deficit target could still be reached through a
temporary slowdown in investment expenditures. They noted last year’s unanticipated VAT
refunds—which reached 1 percent of GDP largely due to a single company—were unlikely
to be repeated.
21.
The authorities emphasized that at the core of the forthcoming reform package
would be measures to improve fiscal developments. There was agreement that maintaining
Luxembourg’s attractiveness as a destination for foreign labor and capital was of paramount
importance, and, therefore, adjustment should primarily rely on expenditure measures
(Figure 8). These should be front-loaded, given the strength of the cyclical upswing, and—in
the staff’s view—the decline in trend growth.
22.
The authorities stated their intention to return the budget to balance soon after
2008. The staff supported such a stance, noting that the economy’s high degree of openness
caused revenue volatility and required a safety margin. However, the emerging funding gap
of the public pension system needed to be addressed. While official forecasts projected a
funding gap of at least 50 percent of GDP by 2050, staff viewed the underlying growth
trajectory as optimistic (Box 4). Under more realistic assumptions, baseline projections
showed that the gap would reach 100 percent of GDP, excluding aging-related increases in
health care costs. This gap might best be closed through cuts in benefits, but these would
need to be larger than the authorities have been prepared to consider. The gap could also be
closed through smaller cuts in pension benefits and a gradual build-up of the asset position of
the pension fund so that its income would cover its liabilities. Staff estimates suggested this
might require a general government surplus of 1 percent of GDP or more. Such an approach
would forestall harmful increases in contribution rates at a later stage. The authorities agreed
that a small general budget surplus might be required to address the underfunding of the
pension system, and indicated that an increase of the retirement age was under consideration.
In any case, the public sector financial asset position remained comfortable (Table 6).

scenario, which could reach 221 percent of GDP
in case of a sharp deceleration in GDP growth.1 Unusually high replacement rates—exceeding
100 percent of the last salary on average—the low effective retirement age, and automatic benefit
indexation to inflation and wage growth are the main reasons for these developments.
Priority should be given to pension benefit reform. Luxembourg has little room to increase
contribution rates due to its extreme openness of factor markets. Staff suggested the introduction
of a “solidarity factor” (IMF Country Report No. 04/125) to align the pension replacement rates
with the contribution base. The OECD maintains its longstanding recommendations to raise the
retirement age, to put early retirement benefits in relation to the standard retirement age, and to
terminate subsidies for pre-retirement pensions.2 However, the authorities are not considering at
this stage reforms sufficient to fully resolve the funding problem.
Any remaining funding gap should be closed through income from pension fund assets.
Building up an appropriate asset position requires running budget surpluses. The necessary
expenditure savings are determined by (i) the scope of pension benefit reform; (ii) potential

The authorities confirmed their intention to reduce expenditures by a
cumulative 2½ percent of GDP during 2006-08, as set out in the 2005 Stability Program
(SP). The staff supported the authorities’ expenditure target but cautioned that achieving it
would require determination, especially if structural expenditures were to be reduced only
beginning in 2007. Moreover, revenue shortfalls could heighten the need for expenditure
cuts. Growth projections for the outer years in the SP seemed optimistic, and EU action could
trigger revenue shortfalls. The authorities acknowledged the possibility of losses resulting
from an EU decision possibly shifting tax revenues from internet services to those countries
where these services were consumed. Although growth projections were somewhat elevated
for 2007-08, a safety margin was built into revenue projections.

The authorities stressed that comprehensive expenditure measures would be in
place for next year’s budget. They indicated that the automatic indexation of social
expenditures to inflation and their biannual adjustment to wages would be reviewed.
However, the authorities saw little political support for the staff’s proposal to improve the
targeting of social expenditures and enhance means testing for unemployment aid, the
minimum guaranteed income (MGI), and family and education allowances. They agreed that
expenditure reduction should not unduly rely on a shift of investment expenditures to Public
Private Partnerships (PPPs). Instead such decisions would be taken exclusively on efficiency
grounds and ensure adequate risk sharing, monitoring, and transparency.
25.
There was recognition that the health care sector needed reforms. The authorities
acknowledged that reforms initiatives by the health care commission needed to be intensified
given rising cost pressures. Staff stressed that further increases in payroll taxes should be
avoided, following the 2005 hike to 5.4 percent of gross wages, including through (i) setting
financial incentives for the use of generic drugs; (ii) streamlining the list of eligible services
while improving the efficiency of existing services; and (iii) raising co-payments.
26.
The authorities viewed the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) as providing an
appropriate medium-term framework to facilitate adjustment. They noted that the
revised SGP provided enhanced incentives for steady consolidation and would help curtail
expenditure growth to below GDP growth, as set out in the government’s coalition
agreement. Therefore, adopting a formal medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF), as

- 24 -

proposed by the staff, would be duplicative. The mission responded that at a minimum, more
timely fiscal data, regular analysis, and clearer budget prioritization were needed to enhance
transparency, foster public support of policy requirements, and prevent policy drift.
D. Improving Labor Market Flexibility and Participation
27.
Luxembourg is at the heart of a regional labor market attracting an increasing
number of cross-border employees. The authorities expressed concern over the continued
rise in unemployment and its concentration among low-productivity workers and the young
(Box 5). They saw uncompetitive skills as the primary reason for these adverse
developments. Nevertheless, they recognized that a labor supply shock—resulting from
entitlement reforms in neighboring countries—was heightening wage competition. With the
number of unemployed in the neighboring regions exceeding Luxembourg’s resident labor
force three times, staff noted structural unemployment risked escalating and efforts to curtail
social expenditures could be frustrated.

Policy measures to alleviate unemployment would focus on training measures
and life-long learning programs combined with a possible moderation of social benefits.
The authorities reiterated that the indexation of the MGI to wage and inflation developments
was under review. Nevertheless, a general reduction in unemployment assistance and the
MGI, as proposed by the staff to lessen disincentive effects for residents, was politically
difficult.7 Staff questioned whether the measures under preparation could forestall a further
rise in unemployment given much higher social assistance to the unemployed in Luxembourg
compared to abroad. In any event, training should focus on on-the-job measures to maximize
success.

Box 5. Luxembourg’s Structural Unemployment
The unemployment rate has been increasing on a trend line since the early 1990s. A
marked deviation from this trend coincides with the financial sector boom in the late 1990s.
Long-term unemployment has risen sharply—especially in the last three years—although its
share in overall unemployment has remained largely unchanged.

Generous social welfare poses serious impediments to entry into employment. Staff
calculations show that unemployment benefits for unemployed singles in Luxembourg are
almost twice as high as those in neighboring countries, and a similar pattern holds for
families. Furthermore, the net losses from the combined effects of higher taxes and smaller
social benefits when moving from unemployment into employment are estimated to be
among the highest in the OECD.1 The OECD thus maintains its longstanding
recommendation that replacement rates in unemployment insurance be lowered and the
withdrawal rate of social assistance be reduced as recipients’ incomes rise in order to avoid
unemployment and poverty traps. In addition, employment may be impeded because
Luxembourg’s minimum wage is the highest in the EU (18 percent of all employed are being
paid at the minimum wage).

Unemployment rate

The skills gap is widening, reflecting the
increasingly specialized needs of the financial
sector. Indicative of a mismatch between skills
on offer and demanded, the vacancy ratio and
unemployment rate have risen in parallel for
most of the 1990s and again since 2003.
Analysis confirms a deepening mismatch
between job seekers and vacancies on a sectoral
level.2

There was agreement that labor force participation remained low by
international standards, notwithstanding actions taken. While satisfied with last year’s
tightening of eligibility criteria for the sickness allowance and, the continued success in
reducing access to disability pensions, the authorities noted with concern that early
retirement schemes were still serving as a vehicle for corporate restructuring. Reforms were
therefore being prepared to limit early retirement programs to exceptional cases. Staff
ascribed low labor force participation by the young mainly to perverse incentive effects; it
suggested that eligibility criteria for unemployment aid be tightened and granted only after a
minimum period of employment. Also, while female labor force participation was increasing
steadily, staff noted bottlenecks arising from the lack of affordable child care.
E. Other Issues
31.
Against the background of the country’s tradition of openness to foreign capital
(Table 7), the staff queried the authorities’ reaction to the takeover bid for the steel
industry by a foreign investor. The authorities explained that they had acted as any single
largest shareholder—Luxembourg owns 5.6 percent of Arcelor—would when faced with a
potentially hostile takeover bid. However, they did not exclude that the bid would succeed.
They underscored their continued commitment to openness to foreign capital and labor.
32.
The authorities indicated delays in the publication of quarterly national
accounts data. These delays mainly resulted from the inclusion in the accounts of financialintermediation-services-indirectly-measured; quarterly data were soon to be published. Staff
noted—while statistical data were adequate for surveillance purposes—the continued
absence of quarterly national accounts data, including within year information on general
government performance, hampered policy and economic analysis.
33.
Luxembourg transposed into law in 2004 the major EU directive on AML/CFT
issues and explained its contents in a circular in 2005.8 The legal framework was further

The authorities indicated that the wage
indexation mechanism was under review. While
various proposals to alter the near-full indexation of
wages to the CPI were under discussion, the authorities
stressed that the principle of wage indexation should be
maintained. A proposal to align wage developments in
Luxembourg with those abroad—in order to lessen the
wage differential vis-à-vis neighboring countries—was
gaining prominence. The staff welcomed the proposal,
but maintained that indexation—even if modified in
line with the proposal—would continue to distort hiring
decisions at the margin.

strengthened in a number of different ways. Luxembourg targets a further increase of its
official development assistance (ODA) from 0.85 percent of GDP in 2005 to 0.89 percent of
GDP in 2006.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
Its dynamic financial sector and comfortable public sector net financial asset
position leave Luxembourg well placed to meet future challenges. Key among these is the
need to adjust the conduct of fiscal and social policies to likely lower trend growth. Social
policies should be reviewed with the aim of preserving the economy’s dynamism and
reversing the rise in structural unemployment. The authorities’ forthcoming reform package
is an opportunity to address these challenges in a comprehensive manner. While judicious
adjustments to policies might suffice if action is taken soon, delays would risk requiring
more difficult and far-reaching measures.
35.
The near-term growth outlook remains positive, but momentum could weaken
over the medium term reflecting the maturing of the dominant financial sector. The
recovery in the euro area, combined with the continued strong performance of capital
markets, bodes well for the 2006 outlook. However, the financial sector’s successful shift
from traditional—wide margin—banking activities to narrower margin activities supporting
the investment fund industry is entering an advanced stage. Staff welcomes the farsighted
initiatives to position the financial sector for future opportunities, including recent laws on
equity capital funds and private pension funds. Nevertheless, a shift to lower trend growth
appears likely.
36.
The financial sector appears sound and resilient to shocks. Banking sector
solvency seems to have remained at comfortable levels last year, supported in part by
improvements in the quality of banks’ earnings. Stress tests carried out by the authorities
indicate that the financial sector is well positioned to withstand various market risks,
including interest rate risk and potentially adverse developments in the real estate market.
Supervisors should continue such tests, adjusting them as needed to a changing environment,
and continue to monitor the risks stemming from the rapid expansion of the investment
industry.
37.
A large and sustained current account surplus is testimony to Luxembourg’s
continued competitiveness. Nevertheless, the successful shift into the investment fund
industry has lowered the profit margins in the dominant financial sector, thereby leaving the
sector—and the economy—vulnerable to heightening competition.
38.
Sound public finances have been critical to Luxembourg’s success in attracting
substantial foreign capital and labor, and safeguarding these achievements should
remain a priority. Adverse fiscal trends need to be reversed, with the fiscal adjustment
relying on expenditure measures, given the high mobility of capital and labor. Cyclical
strength, a possible decline in trend growth, and potential revenue losses from tax
harmonization across the EU underscore the need to front-load expenditure cuts. Moreover,
medium-term budget targets need to reflect long-term sustainability requirements, including
those arising from aging.

- 28 -

39.
The 2006 budget and the latest Stability Program are welcome steps into this
direction but need to be strengthened. Measures underpinning the targeted tightening of
the budget deficit in 2006 by ½ percent of GDP need to be clarified to ensure that the deficit
target will be reached. Durable expenditure measures to reach the authorities’ target—of a
cumulative reduction by 2½ percent of GDP during 2006-08—should be defined in the
forthcoming reform package. These measures should focus on curtailing social expenditures,
including through enhanced targeting of benefits and means testing, and delinking social
expenditures from wages. Absent a commitment to deep-seated reforms, achieving long-term
fiscal sustainability requires a sustained general government surplus of 1 percent of GDP or
more, and durable expenditure restraint—going beyond the commitments made in the latest
Stability Program—will be necessary.
40.
Sustaining the targeted slowdown in expenditure growth requires pension and
health care reforms. A substantial funding gap of the public pension system is opening up,
and therefore pensions should be reformed to help close the gap. An increase in the
retirement age would be a welcome step, and should be followed by linking the statutory
retirement age to life expectancy and the replacement rate to the contribution base. Benefit
reform should be complemented by enhancing the hitherto low returns generated by the
assets of the pension fund. To forestall harmful increases in contribution rates and close any
remaining funding gap, the asset position of the pension fund should be built up gradually.
Furthermore, health care reforms need to be intensified to prevent deleterious increases in
payroll taxes, including by raising co-payments.
41.
Reversing the rise in structural unemployment requires reducing regional
differences in reservation wages, and further raising labor force participation is
essential. Social benefits, especially unemployment aid and the minimum guaranteed
income, should be aligned more closely with those in the region, with a view to preventing
wage competition from pushing resident job seekers into long-term unemployment. The
apparent skills gap should be addressed by on-the-job training. To further enhance the
competitiveness of resident job seekers, wage indexation should be revised, at a minimum, to
reflect wage developments in the neighboring countries. The authorities’ intention to review
early retirement schemes to raise participation is welcome. Access to unemployment aid by
the young should also be tightened.
42.
Luxembourg’s high level of official development assistance and its leadership in
this field is commendable.
43.
Although Luxembourg’s economic statistics are adequate for surveillance,
improvements are needed, also to allow it to subscribe to the Fund’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard.
44.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Luxembourg be held within
24 months.

1/ General government gross debt.
2/ Derived as [(r - ≅  g≅ - g + ≅  r≅]/(1+g+≅+g≅)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; ≅ = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; ≅ = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ≅ = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ≅ (1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ Historical primary surplus of 3.5 percent of GDP. The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.

Real GDP growth (in percent)
Average nominal interest rate on public debt (in percent) 8/
Average real interest rate (nominal rate minus change in GDP deflator, in percent)
Nominal appreciation (increase in US dollar value of local currency, in percent)
Inflation rate (GDP deflator, in percent)
Growth of real primary spending (deflated by GDP deflator, in percent)

APPENDIX II

Luxembourg: Statistical Issues
In recent years, Luxembourg’s macroeconomic statistics have improved substantially as to
coverage and timeliness. This reflects the authorities’ undertakings in the context of
EU/EMU membership, Luxembourg’s monetary union with Belgium until end-1998, and a
significant increase in budgetary resources. Most statistics are now available electronically to
the public at no cost. Since the last Article IV consultation, the following improvements have
been made:
•

The ESA95 national accounts data were extended back to 1985, from 1995.

•

Central government accounts were compiled on an ESA95 basis.

•

In 2002, the Central Bank of Luxembourg began compiling and disseminating
quarterly balance of payments statements including current and financial accounts, in
accordance with the framework of the Balance of Payments Manual, Fifth Edition
(BPM5).

However, general government accounts are not available at a quarterly frequency, unlike in
almost all other euro-area countries. The publication of quarterly national accounts data,
beginning in 2005, has been interrupted and the work to include FISIM has been delayed
Luxembourg has yet to fulfill its obligations to produce quarterly financial accounts as
specified in the Update of the Guideline on Monetary Union Financial Accounts
(ECB/2005/13).9
The authorities intend to subscribe to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard
(SDDS), and efforts to provide the requisite metadata are under way. The main obstacles to
subscription include the SDDS requirements to provide sub-annual national accounts.
Preliminary data were already discussed in a seminar hosted by STATEC.

9

This matter was taken up in 2005 by the ECB Governing Council, in regard to which
Luxembourg agreed in principle to prepare the accounts, but stated that it would time to
establish in-country arrangements for compilation. It has now been agreed that the National
Statistical Institute will compile the accounts.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
April 26, 2006
This statement provides information that has become available since the staff report was
issued. The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
1.
National accounts data for the period of 1995-2004 were revised, in large part
reflecting the inclusion of financial intermediation services indirectly measured (FISIM), in
line with European System of Accounts 1995 standards. Given the importance of the
financial sector, the level of nominal GDP was revised upwards by about 6 percent in 2004.
GDP data for 2005 remain to be released.
2.
The fiscal deficit came in better than expected in 2005. Based on the authorities’
estimates, the general government budget deficit was 1.9 percent of GDP last year (versus
1.2 percent of GDP in 2004), 0.4 percentage point stronger than the staff estimate. Lower
investment expenditures accounted for close to half of this deviation.
3.
The authorities raised their real growth estimate for 2005 to 4.5 percent and lowered
their 2006 forecast to 4 percent, which is in line with the staff’s forecast. The current account
surplus was higher than expected in 2005—reaching 10 percent of GDP—underscoring the
continued strong contribution of external demand to GDP growth.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation
with Luxembourg
On April, 26, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Luxembourg.1
Background
Luxembourg’s dominant financial sector has supported a steady rebound in economic activity in
recent years and growth is projected to remain relatively strong in the near term. While headline
inflation is high compared to the EU average, underlying inflation has remained subdued.
The recovery notwithstanding, the fiscal deficit widened to 1.9 percent of GDP in 2005, driven
primarily by social expenditure growth, while unemployment edged up to 4½ percent.
The government plans to announce in May a comprehensive reform package to address fiscal
and structural challenges.
Trend growth may decline as the financial services industry is maturing, following a successful
shift into investment fund services. This shift stimulated growth, but the expansion is likely to
decelerate over time given the lower value added of these new activities. The staff projects
growth to slow down to about 3½ percent over the medium term; about 1 percentage point
below the authorities’ forecast.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.
1

-2The financial sector remains sound and resilient to potential adverse shocks. Supervision is
adequate. Financial stability is underpinned by the close integration of foreign-owned financial
subsidiaries with their parent companies, which tends to enhance asset quality and capital
adequacy. Financial sector soundness is also helped by an increasing diversification of income
sources, as the shift to investment fund services has boosted commission income.
The 2006 budget targets a moderate reduction of the deficit and the authorities intend to restore
fiscal balance soon after 2008. Achieving this target requires cumulative expenditure measures
equivalent to 2½ percentage points of GDP during 2006-08, which remain to be defined.
Moreover, securing funding of the future liabilities of the public pension system would require
additional measures.
There has been a steady increase in structural unemployment, largely owing to a labor supply
shock triggered by benefit reforms in neighboring countries. A widening gap between the
entitlements to resident and foreign job seekers has heightened competition in Luxembourg’s
regional labor market, pushing a growing number of resident workers into unemployment.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors noted that Luxembourg’s near-term growth outlook remains positive, supported by the
continued strong performance of the dominant financial sector. Directors welcomed the sector’s
successful shift from traditional banking activities into the investment fund industry and the
authorities’ initiatives to create an environment for future opportunities. Nevertheless, they noted
that growth prospects could weaken over the medium term as the financial sector is maturing.
Against this background, Directors saw the need to adjust fiscal and social policies as
Luxembourg’s major policy challenge. They called on the authorities to address this challenge in
a comprehensive manner in their forthcoming reform package. Directors attached particular
importance to reining in expenditure growth and redesigning social policies with the aim of
reversing structural unemployment.
Directors noted that the financial system appears sound and well supervised. They welcomed
the banking sector’s continued diversification of income sources, and resulting improvement in
the quality of banks’ earnings. Directors noted that the sector is well positioned to withstand
various market risks, as well as potentially adverse developments in the real estate market.
They encouraged the authorities to adjust stress tests in a timely manner to changing market
conditions and to continue to closely monitor potential risks stemming from the rapid expansion
of the investment fund industry. Directors welcomed continued progress in strengthening the
Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism regime.
Directors supported the authorities’ policy of returning the fiscal accounts to balance over the
medium term, noting that sound public finances have been critical to Luxembourg’s success in
attracting substantial foreign capital and labor—highly mobile factors. While commending the
targeted reduction in expenditures over 2006-08, Directors looked forward to specific measures
to underpin this target as part of the authorities’ forthcoming reform package. In this context,

-3Directors called for a strengthening of the 2006 budget and saw a need for curtailing social
expenditures, including through enhanced targeting of benefits and means testing, and
delinking social expenditures from wage developments.
Directors stressed the need for setting medium-term budget targets consistent with long-term
sustainability requirements, including those arising from aging. They called therefore for
sustaining a small general government surplus in the absence of deep-seated reforms, in
particular in the benefit system.
Directors emphasized that the targeted slowdown in expenditure growth will require health care
and pension reforms. In view of the projected emergence of a substantial future funding gap in
the public pension system, Directors called for a benefits reform, including linking the statutory
retirement age to life expectancy and the replacement rate to the contribution base. They called
for pension reforms to be complemented by efforts to raise low returns on pension fund assets.
Directors encouraged the authorities to gradually build up the assets of the pension fund to
close any remaining funding gap and forestall harmful increases in contribution rates. To avoid
deleterious increases in payroll taxes, Directors underscored the need to intensify health care
reforms, including by raising co-payments.
Directors expressed concern over the steady increase in structural unemployment and stressed
the need to raise labor force participation. Reservation wages in Luxembourg need to be
aligned more closely with those in neighboring countries, so as to prevent wage competition
from pushing resident job-seekers into long-term unemployment. To this effect, Directors urged
a review of social benefits, especially unemployment benefits and the minimum guaranteed
income. They also looked forward to a review of early retirement schemes to raise labor force
participation.
Directors welcomed Luxembourg’s high level of official development assistance and
commended its leadership in this area.
Directors observed that Luxembourg’s economic statistics are adequate for surveillance.
Nonetheless, they encouraged further improvements, also to allow subscription to the Fund’s
Special Data Dissemination Standard.

Statement by Willy Kiekens, Executive Director for Luxembourg
and Cedric Crelo, Advisor to Executive Director
April 26, 2006
The authorities convey their appreciation for the constructive discussions they had with the
staff. While Luxembourg continues to be among the good economic performers of the
European Union, the deterioration of public finances and the continued increase in
unemployment cause concern. The government’s priority is to address these challenges,
which are rightly emphasized in the well-written Staff Papers. In order to enable the
Ministers in charge to focus more on the budget and the labor market, the government
cabinet decided to reshuffle ministerial portfolios in February 2006.
A reform package is currently being negotiated with social partners. Recommendations by
the staff serve as a valuable input to this debate, the outcome of which will be announced by
the Prime Minister on May 2, 2006.
Recent Economic Developments and Prospects
After a slowdown in 2001 and 2002, due to a less favorable global environment and dismal
financial markets, the Luxembourg economy began to recover gradually in the second half of
2003 and rebounded strongly in 2004. This momentum was maintained in 2005. Real GDP
grew by 4.5 percent, driven mainly by a robust increase in exports of financial services.
Private consumption, which grew by 1.2 percent, remained rather weak. Higher energy and
real estate prices, the rise in unemployment and an uncertainty about future economic
developments contributed to this tamed enthusiasm.
For 2006 and 2007, economic growth projections have been revised downwards. Real GDP
is now forecast to grow by 4 percent in 2006 and by 4.5 percent in 2007. This is slightly
lower than the projections included in the latest update of Luxembourg’s Stability Program
(November 2005). Potential output is estimated at 4 ¼ percent. Private consumption is
anticipated to be supportive of growth, while the net contribution of the foreign balance is
likely to decrease due to the expected higher imports. Higher wages and a rise in residents’
employment are expected to fuel real disposable income and, hence, stimulate private
consumption. Also, accelerated growth in the euro area is anticipated to be conducive to
increased consumer confidence. The authorities project private consumption to rise by 2.4
percent in 2006 and by 3.2 percent in 2007, an assessment broadly shared by the European
Commission.
Measured by the National Index of Consumer Prices (NICP), which excludes consumption of
non-residents, inflation increased by 2.5 percent. Assuming that oil prices will remain at the
current levels, inflation is unlikely to come down in 2006.
While growth relies heavily on the health of the financial sector, constant efforts are further
being made to promote the financial center and to diversify the economy. Accordingly, the

-2government intends to develop Luxembourg as a major ITC hub. So far, this strategy has
been successful.
Fiscal Policy
The Luxembourg authorities remain strongly committed to the objectives enshrined in the
Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) and aspire to implement a fiscal policy path that will lead to
a balanced budget by 2009.
For 2005, the fiscal deficit outcome was better than expected, 1.9 percent of GDP instead of
the earlier estimate of 2.3 percent. A lower execution rate of public investments, better than
expected revenue mainly due to the strong performance of the financial sector, as well as
statistical impacts relating to the revision of the national accounts and the partial attribution
of VAT reimbursements to previous fiscal years, explain this difference.
Compared to 2004, when the fiscal deficit stood at 1.2 percent of GDP, the deterioration of
the fiscal balance is mainly explained by a series of exceptional VAT reimbursements that
affected the budget deficit in excess of 1 percent of GDP. Also, revenues stemming from
corporate taxes continued to be weaker. These taxes are collected with a lag and currently
relate to the fiscal years 2001 – 2003, a period during which corporate profits were lower.
This effect will gradually phase out. Moreover, expenditure has continued to grow as a share
of GDP.
Given the volatility on the revenue side, fiscal consolidation efforts will be concentrated on
the expenditure side. The cornerstone of this strategy is that expenditure growth should be
compatible with medium-term economic prospects. The consolidation path embedded in the
2006 budget targets a reduction equivalent to 0.5 percent of GDP in the fiscal deficit. The
bulk of the measures are centered on reducing the level of social transfers and improving the
efficiency of public spending, notably investment.
In the area of social security, several measures taken by the authorities, such as a stricter
handling of sick leaves, incentives to increase the use of generic drugs and more stringent
controls over hospital expenditures, are expected to bear results. Additional measures are
currently being negotiated with social partners as, for instance, mitigating the effect of price
increases via the wage indexation mechanism on social security benefits.
Amidst the consolidation efforts, the authorities remain committed to a high level of public
investment. These investments, which aim at addressing certain bottlenecks and at
safeguarding the attractiveness of the business environment, will focus on transportationrelated infrastructures, education, research and health. In order to limit the cost associated
with these investments, the authorities are determined to improve the costing of such
initiatives and to explore the avenue of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs).
Wage moderation in the public sector, after the current wage agreement phases out at the end
of 2006, will also contribute to fiscal consolidation.

-3Public debt, which stood at 6.4 percent of GDP, remains extremely low compared to the Euro
Area average of about 72 percent of GDP. New debt has been issued in order to finance
transportation-related infrastructure. The debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to reach barely 10
percent by 2009.
The authorities are committed to uphold intergenerational equity of the pension system and
stand ready to use the flexibility embedded in the system to safeguard this principle. They are
cognizant of the fact that without structural reforms, the pension system will be unsustainable
over the long-term. Against this background, a stricter enforcement of rules has led to a
decline in disability pensions and a new law was enacted in 2004 to increase the yield on
pension reserves. Also, in line with the staff’s advice, measures to increase the effective
retirement age are being considered.
Labor market developments
While job creation in Luxembourg continued to grow at a pace of 3 percent in 2005, the
unemployment rate increased concomitantly. This conundrum is due to the specificity of the
Luxembourg labor market, which, in fact, is regional rather than domestic. In March 2006,
the unemployment rate stood at 4.7 percent. Prima facie, this rate compares favorably to the
Euro Area average, which hovers around 8.5 percent. Nonetheless, taken from a domestic
perspective, the unemployment rate has increased rapidly over the past years. This increase
stems partly from legislative measures taken in 2002 and 2004 to enlarge the labor force pool
by integrating partially disabled and disabled workers. These measures started to affect the
unemployment rate significantly in 2003. At the end of 2005, this effect accounted for 0.5
percent in the unemployment rate.
That said, the increase in unemployment, mainly confined to unqualified workers, is a cause
of serious concern as it becomes increasingly structural. Initiatives under review pertain to a
better targeting of employment measures, a strengthening of the unemployment agency, and
a greater focus on education and on-the-job training.
Options on how to mitigate the impact of the wage indexation mechanism on wage
developments are also being considered.
Financial sector
Amidst an improving economic environment and positive developments on the stock
markets, the banking sector recorded an increase in net income of around 20 percent in 2005.
While the interest margin dropped by 3.2 percent, net commission income increased by 14
percent. The continued boom of the investment fund industry strongly contributed to this
development. At the end of February 2006, total assets of investment funds reached about
EUR 1,600 billion, an increase of nearly 40 percent compared to the same period in 2005.
Future developments in this industry remain promising against the backdrop of the newlydeveloped investment tools and active prospecting for new markets.

-4As concluded by the FSAP mission that took place in 2002, Luxembourg’s financial sector is
robust, efficient and well supervised. Stress testing exercises made by the banking supervisor
(CSSF) confirmed the robustness of Luxembourg banks. This assessment was corroborated at
the systemic level by the recent macro-prudential analysis conducted by the central bank
(BCL). The resilience of the financial sector can be explained by a combination of good
profitability and liquidity ratios and the high quality of assets.
Banking supervision and crisis management have been further strengthened. Also, in line
with recommendations of the IMF staff, the supervisor of the insurance sector (CAA) is
conducting regular stress tests and its staff has been further increased.
The authorities are considering an FSAP update in 2007.
