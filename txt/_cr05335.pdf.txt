A mission visited Colombo during April 28–May 12, 2005 to conduct discussions for
the 2005 Article IV consultation and met with Prime Minister Rajapaksa, Treasury
Secretary Jayasundera, Central Bank Governor Mendis, and other senior government
officials, as well as representatives from opposition parties, the private sector, NGOs, and
labor unions.

•

The staff team comprised Messrs. Rumbaugh (Head), Fernandez, and Lueth (all APD),
Davies (FAD), and Kock (PDR). Ms. Olin Liu (APD) joined the mission during
May 9–12. Mr. Valdivieso (Senior Resident Representative) assisted the mission, and
Mr. Herat (Alternate Executive Director) also participated in the discussions.

•

The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on March 5, 2004
(IMF Country Report No. 04/68). The Executive Board approved in April 2003 three-year
PRGF and EFF arrangements for SDR 413 million (100 percent of quota). Only the first
disbursements (SDR 59 million), upon approval, have taken place thus far. The first
reviews of the program were initially delayed because of lack of progress with key
structural reforms. During 2004, however, macroeconomic policies also deteriorated.

•

On January 13, 2005, the Executive Board approved the extension of repayment
expectations arising in the remainder of 2005 in the amount of SDR 74 million, and on
March 4, 2005 approved Sri Lanka’s request for a purchase under the Fund’s Emergency
Assistance Policy for Natural Disasters in the amount of SDR 103 million.

Executive Summary
Expansionary monetary and fiscal policies in 2004 helped support growth but added to
inflationary pressures. The fiscal deficit exceeded budget targets, and with a significant
amount of government financing provided by the central bank, the growth in monetary
aggregates increased, contributing to higher inflation. The external current account deficit
increased to 3 percent of GDP and official international reserves declined by $313 million to
2 months of import coverage.
The December 26 tsunami led to extensive loss of life and damaged nearly two thirds of
Sri Lanka’s coastline. The near-term economic outlook is to a large extent shaped by the
post-tsunami reconstruction effort. Reconstruction and a quick rebound in tourism should
maintain growth momentum, but demand pressures and fuel price adjustments are expected
to keep inflation in double digits. A significant increase in imports of oil and construction
materials are projected to increase the external current account deficit to 5½ percent of GDP,
but this is expected to be financed by international assistance on concessional terms.
Managing the economy in the near term will be a challenge. The policy slippages
experienced in 2004 need to be avoided. Monitoring aid flows and ensuring accountability in
their use will be a key priority in mobilizing external financing for tsunami reconstruction. At
the same time, fiscal policy will have to be implemented carefully to reduce demand
pressures by taking steps to enhance revenue, reduce subsidies, and cut back on development
spending in lower priority areas. The authorities have taken steps to tighten monetary policy
and more will be needed to keep inflationary pressures in check.
The medium-term outlook depends on Sri Lanka’s ability to move toward fiscal
consolidation, implement structural reforms, and revive the peace process. High levels
of public debt constrain growth prospects and affect expectations of macroeconomic stability.
Thus far, progress toward a meaningful path of consolidation has been elusive, and debt
sustainability is a concern. Addressing this problem will require stronger efforts to improve
revenue, rationalize expenditure, and improve overall debt management. Inefficiencies in
labor and capital markets and poor infrastructure will also need to be addressed.
Structural reforms have been advanced in some key areas, but restructuring of public
enterprises remains an important priority. Noticeable improvements have been made in
the overall regulation and supervision of the financial system. Tariff adjustments and
restructuring are needed to reduce the fiscal burden of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and
the Ceylon Electricity Board.
Sri Lanka’s commitment to an open trade regime needs to be maintained to benefit from
strong global and regional growth.

I. INTRODUCTION AND POLITICAL BACKGROUND
1.
Since the last Article IV consultation, political constraints and uncertainties have
affected policy implementation (Box 1). In concluding the 2003 Article IV consultation,
Executive Directors noted that uncertainties in the political situation and the peace process
posed a risk to the implementation of essential reforms. Uncertainties have not abated since
then, and while the ceasefire continues to hold, peace talks have been stalled for two years.
The April 2004 elections turned power over to a coalition led by the President’s party
together with several other smaller parties, including the Marxist People’s Liberation Front
(JVP). However, difficulties in building a consensus for key reforms have been a constraint
on policy implementation. The December 2004 tsunami, which took close to 40,000 lives and
caused extensive damage to over two thirds of the Sri Lankan coastline, has added to the
political frictions. As a
result, a parliamentary

2.
The economic strategy of the current government differs in significant ways
from its predecessor’s. Greater emphasis is placed on rural development as the means to
achieve poverty reduction. At the same time, the focus on the public sector as a driver of
growth has increased, as evidenced by the expansion of the civil service and the halt of
privatization plans for several strategic enterprises in favor of a restructuring under the newly
created Strategic Enterprise Management Agency (SEMA). The government’s broad
economic strategy, which was outlined in an election manifesto and the 2005 budget, was
further elaborated in the context of a development forum on tsunami reconstruction held in
Sri Lanka during May 16–17 (donors pledged on the order of $3 billion in assistance over the
next 3–4 years). In addition to the immediate task of tsunami reconstruction, the announced
strategy is based on enhancing public sector financial management and public service
delivery, and promoting small and medium enterprises and rural development. The
government’s strategy was welcomed as a first step toward a more comprehensive poverty
reduction strategy. Several donors emphasized that, while strengthening the role of the state
and provision of public services was useful, attention needs to be equally directed at
incentives for private sector development. It was also noted that the development strategy

Box 1. Sri Lanka: Previous Policy Recommendations
Over the past few years, Fund advice on several macroeconomic and structural reforms played
a key role in policy development—for instance, in floating the exchange rate, introducing a VAT,
and implementing financial sector reforms. These issues were summarized in the 2003 Article IV
consultation report (IMF Country Report No. 04/68).
More recently, the authorities’ implementation of staff’s recommendations has been more
mixed. The following is the status of the Board’s main recommendations in the 2003 Article IV
consultation:
•

Continue process of fiscal consolidation. The overall fiscal deficit in 2004 remained at the same
level as in 2003, while the primary deficit worsened by about 1 percent of GDP. Overruns in
subsidies reached 1¼ percent of GDP.

•

Improve tax administration. The creation of an independent Revenue Authority was envisaged
under the PRGF/EFF-supported program. However, the authorities opted for the creation of a
Revenue Board within the existing civil service. The establishment of the Revenue Board,
together with recent staff changes within revenue agencies, provides scope for improved interagency coordination similar to what was anticipated under the proposed Revenue Authority.
Establishment of a second large taxpayers unit has also resulted in some improvements in tax
administration.

•

Broaden tax base and simplify tax regime. The introduction of the Economic Service Charge, a
broad-based business tax, was a positive step as was bringing civil service income into the tax
net. Some measures in the 2005 budget, however, made the tax system more complex, such as the
introduction of two new VAT bands and surcharges on a broad range of consumption goods.

•

Stand ready to tighten monetary policy if the political situation deteriorates or severe
budget pressures materialize. The end-2004 reserve money growth target was missed by more
than 5 percentage points. Lax monetary policy was supportive of growth and contained the
government’s debt service costs but also contributed to the sharp increase in inflation and the loss
of reserves. Since late 2004, policy rates have been increased three times and open market
operations intensified.

•

Restructure state-owned banks. Financial performance of state-owned banks has improved
significantly reflecting continued operational autonomy. Although privatization plans have been
abandoned, restructuring continues under the supervision of the Strategic Enterprise Management
Agency.

•

Tighten prudential norms and enhance supervision. Changes to provisioning rules and firmer
enforcement of regulations have contributed to improvements in financial indicators in the
banking system.

•

Implement automatic compensation formula for layoffs. Formula has been specified but
implementation remains pending. The level of compensation in the formula, which was originally
very high by international standards, was increased further in March 2005.

remained unclear in several key areas such as agricultural policies and labor market
regulations.
II. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN 2004
3.
Accommodative fiscal and monetary policies helped support growth above
5 percent in 2004, but added to inflationary pressures. These policies helped offset the
adverse impact on growth of rising oil prices and a drought. Export performance was also
strong in 2004, aided by textiles and tourism arrivals, but domestic demand (especially strong
private investment) contributed to rapid growth in imports. Annual inflation reached
16.8 percent (SLCPI; end-of-period), reflecting demand pressures as well as higher food and
oil prices (Table 1).
4.
The fiscal deficit reached 8.2 percent of GDP in 2004, or 1½ percent higher than
budgeted. Revenues fell short of the budget target owing to the late enactment of income tax
amendments and lower than expected profit transfers from the central bank. Expenditure
overruns were due to higher subsidies (mostly for fuel). The impact of these slippages on net
domestic financing, which reached 6 percent of GDP, was exacerbated by lower privatization
proceeds and shortfalls in program financing (Table 2). To bridge this gap, the government
issued $250 million (1¼ percent of GDP) in dollar denominated bonds in the domestic
market. As a result, government debt remained at 105 percent of GDP, underscoring
concerns about overall debt sustainability.
5.
With the central bank purchasing large amounts of treasury bills, ample
liquidity was available for private credit, and money growth increased significantly.
Broad money increased by 20 percent, compared with 15 percent in 2003 and 14 percent
envisaged under the authorities’ monetary program (Table 3). The purchases of treasury bills
aimed to offset the liquidity impact of foreign exchange intervention (which was undertaken
to slow the depreciation of the rupee) and keep the cost of public and private credit low.
Indeed, with the increase in inflation, and despite a modest increase in policy rates by
50 basis points in November, real interest rates remained negative contributing to private
credit growth of 22 percent. In contrast to the previous year, monetary expansion in 2004 was
accounted for by an expansion of net domestic assets (Figure 1).
6.
The balance of payments shifted to a deficit of $205 million in 2004, from a
surplus of $502 million in 2003. Despite robust export performance, the current account
moved from near balance to a deficit of 3 percent of GDP (Table 4), reflecting the effects of
both oil price increases and strong demand for investment goods. Official external
financing—especially program loans—dried up significantly, with donors waiting for an
articulation of the government’s policy agenda. By end-2004, the rupee had lost 8 percent of
its value against the dollar (y/y), despite central bank intervention, and gross official reserves
had fallen to $1.8 billion (equivalent to 2.1 months of imports) (Figure 2).
7.
The 2005 budget, approved in December 2004, envisaged a reduction in the
deficit to 7½ percent of GDP. The budget aimed to improve economic conditions for the
rural poor, increase spending on health and education, phase out numerous subsidies,

-7-

including on petrol and diesel, and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to meet the
targets of the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act, albeit on a delayed timetable
(Box 2).1 While the 2005 budget targets represent a welcome step toward putting government
debt on a declining path relative to GDP, budget estimates appeared overly optimistic,
particularly for revenue. At the time, staff estimated that additional measures equivalent to
1¼ percent of GDP would be needed to meet budget targets.
8.
While some progress was being made on structural reforms by the end of 2004,
financial costs in key public enterprises increased significantly. On revenue
administration, the cabinet approved in June 2004 the creation of a revenue board to
coordinate the activities of various revenue departments. However, much remains to be done
on the concurrently approved restructuring of the Inland Revenue Department. In the
financial sector, the ADB approved a program loan in support of the restructuring of People’s
Bank, whose performance indicators have improved. In the energy sector, however, large
fiscal and quasi-fiscal costs arising from the operations of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation
(CPC) and the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) were incurred in 2004–05. Direct subsidies
from the budget amounting to 1 percent of GDP in 2004, and ½ percent of GDP so far in
2005, have been paid to CPC to cover their losses. While electricity charges are among the
highest in the region, operational inefficiencies in CEB have led to substantial losses
estimated at ¾ percent of GDP in 2004, and accumulated debt and arrears amount to about
4 percent of GDP. Deadlines for reforming CEB have been postponed repeatedly.
9.
While macroeconomic conditions have stabilized somewhat since the tsunami,
the situation remains vulnerable. The rupee ended its downward slide on the expectation of
aid inflows and has appreciated 5 percent against the U.S. dollar through end-May, and gross
reserves increased by about $240 million reflecting the Fund’s emergency assistance and
other donor disbursements. However, weaknesses in fiscal policy remain and, despite efforts
by the central bank to absorb excess liquidity, monetary aggregates continued to exceed
official targets and inflation remained in double digits (15 percent y/y in the SLCPI as of
April). Fuel prices have been adjusted twice so far in 2005, but they remain below cost
recovery levels. Stock prices, after a dip in the immediate aftermath of the disaster, have
continued their rising trend from 2004 and are up by about 25 percent so far this year.

1

The FMRA sets targets to reduce the overall fiscal deficit and government debt to 5 percent
of GDP and 85 percent of GDP, respectively, by 2006. The target date in the Act is not
binding, but the government is required to explain why the target is not met and announce a
new time path.

-8-

Box 2. Sri Lanka: The 2005 Budget—Excluding Tsunami
The budget targeted a deficit of 7½ percent of GDP, a contraction of some 0.7 percentage points
over the previous year. Since the budget was approved, official projections have been revised to
forecast a deficit of around 8 percent of GDP. This revised estimate takes into account the impact of
higher oil prices on subsidies and a lower revenue projection.
Revenue was projected in the budget to increase by 1¾ percentage point of GDP to slightly above
17 percent of GDP. The main measures on the revenue side were as follows:
•

The unified VAT rate of 15 percent introduced in 2004 was supplemented with rates of 5 percent
on essential food items and 18 percent on luxury goods. A 5 percent surcharge was introduced on
the value of imported goods for VAT purposes, and imported capital goods exempted from VAT.
A number of measures aimed at limiting refunds were also introduced.

•

The excise tax base was broadened to include several household appliances, while excise rates
were raised to prohibitive levels on betting and cars. The taxes on cars were raised from 30 percent
to a maximum of 115 percent, depending on engine capacity.

•

A broadening of the corporate income tax base was coupled with a reduction in personal income
tax (PIT) rates. The deductibility of business expenses (e.g., for advertising, travel, entertainment)
under the corporate income tax was restricted.

•

Custom duty bands were reduced from 6 to 5 with the top rate broadly unchanged. However, a cess
(surcharge) of 10–20 percent was imposed on more than 300 items ranging from fruits to footwear.

The authorities have lowered their revenue projection to 16¼ percent of GDP, but staff estimates
that revenue is still likely to fall short of this target by about ½ percent of GDP. The impact of
improvements in revenue administration appear unlikely to materialize to the extent expected by the
authorities, and the sharp decline in vehicle imports in response to the imposition of prohibitive excises
has had an adverse impact on revenue performance. Moreover, privatization receipts are also likely to
fall short of budget estimates.
Expenditure was budgeted to increase by 1 percent of GDP. A steep increase in public investment
more than offset cuts in current outlays. Spending on health and education was budgeted to increase by
30 percent. Subsidies were projected to decline by more than 1 percentage point of GDP, following
adjustments in the prices of oil, wheat, and public services. Provisions for fuel subsidies were limited to
kerosene. The budget also incorporated the 2005 effects of the two-year 40 percent wage increase for
civil servants and new hiring equivalent to 7 percent of existing personnel.
Expenditure increases will now be limited to around ½ percent of GDP. Higher than expected
subsidy payments will be more than compensated for by reductions in domestically and externally
financed capital expenditure (excluding tsunami reconstruction). Continued high world oil prices,
contrary to budget forecasts, mean that the maintenance of administered oil prices requires substantial
ongoing subsidy payments, particularly on diesel.

-9-

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Outlook and Risks
10.
The near-term outlook is to a large extent influenced by the post-tsunami
reconstruction effort, which will have a significant financial impact on the
government’s budget and the balance of payments (see Annex I).
•

The devastation of the fisheries sector will adversely affect growth, but a rebound in
tourist arrivals has been quicker than expected. After declining sharply in January and
February, tourist arrivals rebounded and for the first five months of the year, arrivals
and earnings increased by 8 percent compared with the previous year. Moreover,
reconstruction activity and a bumper crop earlier this year are expected to support
growth at about 5¼ percent in 2005, broadly in line with last year. Demand pressures
arising from tsunami reconstruction and fuel price adjustments are likely to keep
inflation in double digits.

•

While the tsunami’s impact on revenues is projected to be minor, government
spending on reconstruction and relief will amount to 1½ percentage points of GDP.
The authorities’ intention is to finance additional tsunami-related spending through
international support. Overruns on oil subsidies are projected to amount to ½ percent
of GDP (even after assuming further price adjustments are made), and the authorities
plan to reduce locally-financed development projects (compared with budget
estimates) to keep domestic financing of the 2005 budget at 4½ percent of GDP.

•

The external current account deficit is expected to increase by 2½ percentage points
to 5½ percent of GDP in 2005, reflecting higher imports for tsunami reconstruction,
slow growth in garment exports, and a steep oil price increase.2 Total exports
increased by 12 percent in the first five months of the year, and remittances by
24 percent. Coming off strong growth of 9 percent in 2004, garment exports increased
by 6 percent in the first quarter of 2005. While the industry remains concerned about
weaker orders for coming months, the overall adverse impact should be contained
(Box 3).

•

The authorities’ monetary program envisages broad money growth of 15 percent
in 2005. Given a modest increase in net international reserves, and provided the
government meets its domestic financing target, the expansion of private sector credit
would remain at about 20 percent.

2

Oil prices are projected at $51 per barrel in 2005 compared with $38 per barrel in 2004 and
$29 per barrel in 2003. As a result, oil imports have increased in value terms by about
$900 million since 2003.

- 10 -

Box 3. Sri Lanka: Vulnerability to the Removal of Quotas on World Textile Trade
Sri Lanka is one of many nations affected by the removal of quotas under the
WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing on January 1, 2005. Producers have
shifted production to China and India to take advantage of low cost labor in these
countries. The extent and timing of the impact, on Sri Lanka’s and other nations, is
difficult to determine, and depends on importer’s policy responses, producer strategies,
and price effects.
Sri Lanka has adopted policies to mitigate the impact of the quota removal. Large
companies in particular are expected to remain competitive as most of them
restructured their businesses, diversified their production to out-of-quota, high valueadded goods, and expanded into new export markets. Although only 12 percent of the
total, these companies generate more than 70 percent of the total value of textile
exports. Medium sized exporters, with an export share of roughly 25 percent, have
been and will go through further restructuring and consolidation to remain competitive.
Small companies are likely to close down, but they account for only 5 percent of
exports. However, small- and medium-sized companies employ 38 percent of the
workers in the sector. The recent Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement
with India and FTA negotiations with the United States and other countries will also
help improve market access.
Government policies and changing business strategies have prepared the textile
sector for the liberalization. The gradual shift to out-of-quota goods led to a decline
in the quota utilization rate of the U.S. market from 85 percent in 2000 to about
67 percent in 2003. Exports to the European Union have been quota free for some years
now, also suggesting they are competitive. Overall, Sri Lanka’s quota-based exports
have declined from more than 60 percent in the 1990s to about 50 percent in 2003.
Staff assesses the impact of quota removal on Sri Lanka’s external position to be
limited. The global price effect of quota removal is estimated at negative 10 percent
over a three-year period. Although producer margins are likely to be squeezed, some of
the price effect could be compensated by an increase in output. In the medium term, the
volume of textile exports is projected to rise by a modest 2 percent per year.

- 11 -

11.
There are several downside risks to this outlook. As noted above, the authorities
will need to be prepared to take additional measures to meet fiscal objectives, including
further adjustments in domestic fuel prices, which may prove politically difficult. Capacity
constraints in the construction sector could also negatively affect inflation, while limiting the
effectiveness of aid inflows. Shortfalls or delays in mobilizing external assistance could
potentially lead to the same effects as in 2004: inflationary budget financing, recourse to
nonconcessional foreign currency bonds, and pressures on the exchange rate. Further
increases in international oil prices would also cloud growth and inflation prospects and
amplify external vulnerabilities.
12.
The staff and the authorities agreed that the medium-term outlook hinges
critically on Sri Lanka’s ability to move toward fiscal consolidation, revive the peace
process, and raise investment to levels comparable to its East-Asian peers. To support
poverty reduction, the authorities are targeting growth at 6–7 percent annually. Economic
strategies would focus on effective implementation of tsunami reconstruction and providing
more room for private investment by reducing the overall fiscal deficit to 4½ percent of GDP
by 2008, with adjustment predicated on improving revenue performance. In addition, a sound
monetary policy would lower inflation to single digits, and exports would be promoted
through further rationalization of tariff and trade policies, enhanced trade facilitation, and
investment arrangements with partner countries.
13.
Achieving growth and poverty reduction objectives will depend on the
implementation of a sound and credible economic program. In this regard, further work
will be needed to develop the government’s strategy unveiled during the May 16–17
Development Forum into a comprehensive Poverty Reduction Strategy. Looking forward,
there is scope for significant gains in agriculture productivity and further development of
tourism and telecommunication services, and significant untapped growth potential exists in
the North and East of the country.3 There are also good reasons to believe that private
investment will respond strongly if political stability and an improved investment climate can
be established: literacy rates are among the highest in the region, administrative corruption is
moderate, and preferential trade access to the European Union, India, and other regional
partners should help counterweigh any adverse effects from the removal of textile quotas.
However, land and labor market rigidities, poor road infrastructure, and unreliable and
expensive electricity are major obstacles that need to be eased for private investment to
flourish. Credible progress toward fiscal consolidation is also needed to improve investors
confidence and provide a means for ending the financial repression that constrains capital
market development.

reduce poverty to 13 percent
by 2015. The reduction was much larger in urban than in rural areas, with the incidence of
poverty in the seven poorest districts increasing from 30 percent to 37 percent. Persistent
poverty in rural areas, and in the North and East, underscores the need to upgrade
infrastructure and improve performance in the agricultural sector, as well as finding a durable
solution to the civil conflict. The tsunami disaster, which hit hardest in the north, east and
south, has also reportedly aggravated the unequal poverty trend.
B. Fiscal Consolidation and Debt Sustainability
15.
Fiscal developments thus far in 2005 reflect departures from budget estimates in
several areas. While many aspects of the improved revenue performance evident in the
fourth quarter of 2004 have carried over into 2005, collections in several areas have fallen
short of expectations, including excise tax and import duties (as discussed in Box 2). On the
expenditure side, subsidies for fuel have been considerably higher than budget provisions
(despite price increases in May and June), and Rs. 20 billion has already been spent on
tsunami relief. Domestic financing of the budget in the first five months reached
Rs. 50 billion, compared with the budget estimate of Rs. 105 billion for the year. The
authorities explained that, to remain within the budget target for domestic financing, cash
flow relief provided by debt moratoria/cancellation will offset the tsunami relief expenses
incurred earlier in the year and the implementation of locally-financed investment projects
will be paced according to the availability of financing.
16.
Staff indicated that careful implementation of fiscal policy was critical for
maintaining macroeconomic stability, especially in view of demand pressures likely to be
associated with tsunami reconstruction. Staff argued for consideration of additional near-term

- 13 -

revenue measures. These could include reducing the prohibitive excise duty on vehicle
imports, streamlining tax exemptions, or increasing the number of items subject to the top
VAT rate of 18 percent. For expenditure, there is no feasible alternative to further adjustment
in domestic prices to end subsidies for diesel and, while there is a public policy role for
maintaining subsidies on kerosene to protect the poor, there is scope for cutting back on the
size of the subsidy. The authorities’ plans to reduce spending on lower priority locallyfinanced development projects would also be desirable in view of significant spending on
tsunami reconstruction expected in the second half of the year.
17.
The authorities agreed with this overall approach, but remain somewhat more
optimistic on revenue prospects. They expect to achieve the revised revenue estimate of
16¼ percent of GDP and believe that performance would improve significantly by midyear
reflecting the extension of the Economic Service Charge (ESC)—a minimum corporate tax—
to Board of Investment (BOI) companies, and an expected increase in dutiable imports. On
this basis, they would review revenue developments in the first six months and take
additional measures if needed to meet the revised target. Following the fuel price increases in
May and June, they plan to implement further adjustments over the next several months to
eliminate the subsidy for diesel. Price adjustments are also expected to be implemented for
electricity, railways, and buses.
18.
Staff agreed with the authorities that the key priority for fiscal adjustment, and
for meeting medium-term objectives, was revenue enhancement. However, the
authorities’ medium-term framework relies on revenue projections that are very ambitious
(rising from 15 percent of GDP in 2004 to 19½ percent in 2008). The authorities explained
that they were committed to improving revenue but had not yet decided on specific policies,
while they were also more optimistic than staff on the gains from improved tax
administration. The staff emphasized that, until significant progress in improving revenue has
been demonstrated, the medium-term fiscal framework should be based on lower revenue
targets and more adjustment on the expenditure side to meet FMRA targets (Table 5). In
addition to the near-term revenue measures noted above, extension of the VAT to the
wholesale and retail sectors, continued improvements in tax and customs administration, and
other base-broadening measures should be the priorities over the medium term.
19.
Persistent problems in improving revenue performance underscore the
importance of rationalizing and improving the efficiency of government spending.
Expenditure reforms would need to include elimination of most subsidies, improved
administration and targeting of welfare benefits, and better debt management. Increasing
public employment levels and significant pay increases aggravate the problems caused by an
overstaffed civil service and provide yet another factor that complicates medium-term
consolidation. A comprehensive plan for civil service reform needs to be developed that
takes into account the objectives to increase average pay levels, decompress the wage
structure, and improve the efficiency of the civil service.
20.
With public debt over 100 percent of GDP, debt sustainability is a serious
concern. This underscores the importance of having the FMRA in place, and in taking

- 14 -

credible steps to get on a path consistent with meeting the legislative targets by 2008, as
envisaged by the government. The scenarios depicted in Annex II indicate that if this is done,
the debt outlook would be sustainable. However, if fiscal performance does not improve or
failure to address structural problems undermines future growth, the outlook quickly
deteriorates. The staff also expressed concern about debt management, especially since
recent developments such as the terms of the Paris Club debt moratorium and issuance of
domestic bonds at high coupon rates will increase debt service costs in the future.4 5 While
the authorities have expressed interest in an extension of the Paris Club debt service
moratorium to help finance tsunami reconstruction, they also want to maintain their future
access to commercial credit and are considering requesting an international sovereign rating.
21.
Some welcome improvements in tax administration over the last six months are
evident. The new Revenue Board has created the potential for improved inter-agency
coordination, the scope of the Large Taxpayers Unit has been expanded, civil servants have
been brought into the tax net, and the introduction of the Economic Service Charge has
improved income tax collections. While this is a good start, much more will be needed to
underpin improved revenue performance in the future. Consistency in tax policy by avoiding
ad hoc adjustments in rates and charges would help improve administration. Efforts should
also be focused on upgrading technology, introducing a uniform taxpayer ID number and
risk-based audit procedures, and strengthening collection and enforcement efforts.
22.
Since the 2002 fiscal ROSC, some progress has been made in improving
budgetary procedures, but many of the weaknesses still remain. There has been progress
with respect to the quality of budget documentation and in the reporting of intra-year fiscal
data. Problems remain, however, in the coverage of fiscal data. Priority should also be given
to a more comprehensive monitoring of fiscal risks—such as those posed by the losses of
CEB—in particular by systematically accounting for implicit and contingent liabilities in
both the short and medium-term and through analysis of the overall public sector debt
burden.

4

Because of the high interest rates, purchasers are willing to pay more than face value for the
bonds with receipts above face value recorded as negative interest payments in the current
year (amounting to ½ percent of GDP in 2005). While this is a proper statistical treatment, it
holds down interest payments (and the overall deficit) in the current year at the expense of
higher interest payments in future years.

5

Paris Club creditors have granted a one-year moratorium on debt service payments due in
2005, which are now to be repaid in the period 2006–2009. Interest accrued during the
moratorium period will be capitalized and repaid along with the rescheduled payments.

The staff welcomed recent central bank efforts to reduce liquidity and
recommended a more aggressive tightening of monetary policy. Outstanding credit to the

that a faster tightening would

reduce the risk of a sharper and
potentially disruptive
correction in interest rates later
on. Delays in tightening the monetary policy stance risk entrenching current inflation
pressures, especially since tsunami reconstruction is expected to place considerable pressure
on wages and prices in the second half of the year. The authorities indicated that they would
continue to gradually tighten monetary policy, reflecting their desire for policy to remain
supportive of growth. In late May and June, the repo/reverse repo policy corridor was
increased by 25 basis points and 50 basis points, respectively, raising expectations of future
adjustments in coming months. The staff also stressed the importance of reducing fiscal
dominance, granting more autonomy to the CBSL to strengthen its credibility, and to
increase the transparency of monetary policy by, for example, publishing the minutes of the
meetings of the Monetary Board.
24.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to the flexible exchange rate
regime. Staff emphasized that interventions in the foreign exchange market should be limited
to moderating short-term fluctuations in the rate, or increasing reserves to targeted levels
when market conditions are conducive. The authorities maintained that interventions
undertaken in 2004 and 2005 were meant to stabilize and smooth the transition in the rate in
response to market pressures. While there has been some appreciation in the nominal and real
effective rates thus far in 2005, overall competitiveness was not an immediate concern as the
real effective exchange rate has depreciated slightly over the last three years. Staff agreed
with the authorities that, given possible differences in the timing of tsunami-related aid flows
and the corresponding import needs, exchange rate volatility could pick up, and the central
bank could intervene during the time of inflows to provide scope for selling foreign exchange
to the market later, if necessary, to finance imports that are the counterpart to tsunami-related
aid. However, a sustained drop in foreign reserves (as happened in 2004) below current low
levels should be avoided at a time of downward pressure on the rate. Staff also advised

- 16 -

against using protectionist trade policies or exchange control measures in an attempt to stem
downward pressures on the currency.
D. Priority Structural Reforms
25.
The financial performance of some large public enterprises has deteriorated to
the point where they could threaten economic and financial stability. Fuel price
adjustments will reduce government subsidies to the CPC, and once prices have been
adjusted to reflect prevailing international levels, reinstatement of the automatic pricing
formula would prevent the problem from recurring in the future. For CEB, there is a more
urgent need for fundamental restructuring. There appears to be no option but to move
forward as quickly as possible with the long-delayed unbundling of production, transmission,
and distribution being supported by the ADB and Japan Bank for International Cooperation
(JBIC), while securing the necessary investments to reduce the reliance on expensive sources
of power. More independent regulation of public utilities would also be important for
avoiding political interference. There are similar fiscal risks (but on a much smaller scale) in
the operations of railways, buses, and other utilities that need to be addressed. In addition to
adjusting fuel prices, the authorities stressed their commitment to bring in another foreign
investor to increase competition in the distribution of oil products, and to press forward with
CEB reforms. At the time this report is being issued, the government was still negotiating
with labor unions on CEB restructuring.
26.
There are several examples where the performance of enterprises has been
enhanced through privatization or improved management. These include Sri Lanka
Telecom, Air Lanka, the Ports Authority, Bank of Ceylon, and even People’s Bank (although
much more remains to be done). These examples show that strong management teams and
increased commercial autonomy can contribute to significant improvements in performance,
and staff noted that these positive experiences could be better leveraged to build public
consensus for reform.
27.
There have been improvements in the overall regulation and supervision of the
financial system. Commendable progress has been made since the completion of the FSAP
in 2002. NPAs have come down, provisioning increased, and capital positions improved
across the entire banking system (Table 6). Among other things, this should help reduce
banks spreads between deposit and lending rates which at about 4 percent are relatively
high.6 This progress has been largely due to changes in prudential regulations that reduced
the value of collateral consistent with more realistic recovery rates, enhanced supervisory
efforts, and improved procedures for collection and recovery of bad debts. However, by not
requiring provisioning against loans overdue between 3–6 months, capital remains somewhat
overstated. Staff is also concerned that the current rapid growth in lending—in a context of
6

Recent developments in Sri Lanka’s banking sector are discussed in Chapter III of the
selected issues paper.

- 17 -

negative real interest rates—could lead to a deterioration of asset quality in the future. In
response to the authorities’ plans to implement a system of mandatory deposit insurance,
staff noted the need to ensure that necessary preconditions are satisfied, including the need to
strengthen legal and financial institutions. The CBSL has addressed all of the
recommendations of the full Safeguards Assessment of June 2003, including through
revisions in the Central Bank Act that are expected to be approved in 2006.
28.
Significant improvements have also been made in the financial position and
operation of the two large state-owned banks. Bad loans have been written off and/or
recovered, provisioning increased, government interference declined, and better credit risk
practices were installed. People’s Bank, however, still has a long way to go before it could be
considered a financially sound entity. While progress has been made in disposing and
provisioning for the stock of NPAs on the books, it is too early to tell whether new lending
policies are significantly increasing the quality of the loan portfolio. To avoid repeating the
mistakes with previous recapitalizations, capital injections should be directly linked with
performance indicators as envisaged under the restructuring plan agreed with SEMA.
29.
Sri Lanka’s commitment to an open trade regime needs to be maintained to
benefit from strong global and regional growth. Recent ad hoc changes in import
surcharges and fees have complicated the system and send mixed signals to the private
sector. Staff argued that this system should be rationalized into the current tariff structure and
the remaining 10 percent surcharge on imports removed once revenue improvements have
been secured. The authorities responded that they remain fully committed to an open trade
regime. The various fees placed on a number of consumer imports (cesses) are specific

capture the benefits of regional trade integration, progress should also be made in moving to
a low uniform tariff structure to minimize distortions and inefficiencies than can result from
preferential agreements.
31.
Lack of capital market development threatens to constrain future growth
performance. While capitalization in the stock market has continued to grow, the corporate
bond market remains underdeveloped. The Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and National
Savings Bank (NSB), with assets amounting to about 30 percent of GDP, remain important
captive sources of government financing. While these institutions plan to seek alternative
investments in the future, very little movement in this direction has yet taken place. These
captive sources have enabled the

initiative to mandate specific
wage increases. Staff noted that
such interference in wage setting was unwarranted and could damage competitiveness of
some sectors. The authorities, however, felt that the strength of labor unions and the
protections provided to workers were a positive feature and stressed the need for strategic
partnerships between the government, the private sector, and unions.

E. PRGF and Extended Arrangements
33.
The authorities indicated their desire to resume discussions on a
Fund-supported program in the near future and requested that the Fund continue to
provide policy advice and focused technical assistance. The authorities recognized the
usefulness of a formal financial framework with the Fund in underpinning macroeconomic
discipline, providing a framework for donor coordination, and supporting domestic reform
efforts. However, they also stressed the importance of ownership for program success and
felt that more time was needed to generate domestic consensus for key reforms. Staff agreed

- 19 -

that establishing credibility of the reform program was essential, especially in view of the
slippages experienced in the implementation of the current program (Table 9). The
authorities expressed interest in further technical assistance from the Fund in key areas,
including deposit insurance, revenue administration, and debt management. A staff visit is
envisaged in September to review progress and discuss the framework for the 2006 budget.8
F. Tsunami Reconstruction
34.
Coordinating tsunami reconstruction and the use of aid resources will be a
considerable challenge for the government. Staff advised that spending priorities and final
decisions on distributing aid should be determined by the government who should coordinate
official assistance and oversee arrangements to manage and monitor private aid flows. While
all official aid should ideally be recorded in the budget, the government intends to have a
significant portion of reconstruction—especially for schools and hospitals—executed directly
by donors (outside of the central government’s budget). Given the extra burden these
additional projects would exert on the government’s administrative capacity, this approach
can be justified. Coordination mechanisms have been set up in the form of the Task Force for
Reconstruction of the Nation (TAFREN) to manage the relationship between the government
and donors, and memoranda of understanding (MOUs) have been signed to monitor and
coordinate implementation. An external auditor has also been hired and a database for
monitoring aid is being established. The government has indicated its commitment to
implement the reconstruction strategy with full transparency and accountability and improve
its communication and community participation to involve every stakeholder in the process.
Periodic comprehensive reports are expected to be prepared on these activities and provided
to the public and the donor community.
G. Economic Statistics
35.
Improvements in economic statistics have been made in a number of areas, but
weaknesses remain. While full adoption of the GFSM 2001 methodology will take
substantial time, there are several improvements in fiscal statistics that can be made a
priority, including reducing the lag in producing monthly expenditure details, improving
reporting on extra budgetary funds and provincial councils, and revising budgetary
classifications and the accounting structure. Staff also encouraged the authorities to address
the remaining issues needed to meet SDDS requirements, which include compiling and
disseminating prescribed data on general government operations, international reserves and
foreign currency liquidity, and the international investment position.

8

For illustrative purposes, the balance of payments scenario presented in Table 4 assumes a
one-year extension of the current PRGF/EFF arrangements until April 2007.

- 20 -

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
The Sri Lankan authorities, supported by the international community, have
provided the initial stages of tsunami relief relatively efficiently. However,
implementation of the more difficult reconstruction phase will affect economic performance
going forward. While near-term prospects for economic growth remain positive, inflation
pressures are likely to be sustained. Growth could suffer as a result of the impact of the
tsunami on fisheries, as well as the removal of global textile quotas. These factors, however,
will be compensated by the good performance of the agricultural sector, and the impact of
tsunami reconstruction activity. While some decline in agricultural prices is expected, fuel
price adjustments, and the high growth in monetary aggregates are expected to keep inflation
in double digits. As reconstruction efforts proceed, pressure on domestic wages and prices
are likely to perpetuate inflation pressures into 2006.
37.
To help support reconstruction efforts, the staff continues to emphasize the
importance of closely monitoring the disbursement and use of aid flows to ensure
accountability and transparency. The monitoring mechanisms for tsunami aid that have
been established are a good start, but need to be supplemented by frequent reports directly to
the public and the donor community on the use of aid flows, and specific audit procedures to
ensure adequate accountability in the use of aid should be established.
38.
The high level of public debt exerts a toll on sustainable growth and adversely
affects expectations of macroeconomic stability. Insufficient fiscal adjustment could very
well lead to adverse debt dynamics, undermine economic sustainability, and significantly
compromise the ability of the government to further reduce poverty and meet the MDGs.
Thus far, meaningful progress toward the path of fiscal consolidation envisaged under the
Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act has remained elusive, and government debt at
end-2004 remained above 105 percent of GDP. Improvements in overall debt management in
the context of a medium-term budget framework geared toward consolidation will be needed
to manage this situation.
39.
A recent improvement in revenue performance is welcomed, but much more
needs to be done. After declining for several years, tax revenue increased by one percentage
point of GDP in 2004, and a number of measures taken in the second half of 2004 helped
limit the increase in the central government deficit and set the stage for improved revenue
in 2005. However, despite this improvement, the 2005 budget targets for revenue are unlikely
to be achieved. Additional near-term policy measures should be considered to strengthen tax
collections, especially given the uncertain outlook for privatization receipts. Over the
medium term, extending the VAT to the wholesale and retail sectors, continued
improvements in tax and customs administration, and broadening the tax base would be
important priorities.
40.
Expenditure reforms will also be needed to support fiscal adjustment. In the short
term, there is no feasible alternative to price adjustments to end fuel subsidies for petrol and
diesel while reducing the subsidies for kerosene. Careful prioritization of locally-financed

- 21 -

investment projects will be needed to limit pressure on domestic resources while using
available foreign financing to advance tsunami reconstruction. Expenditure reforms will also
need to include improved administration and targeting of welfare benefits. Beyond tsunami
reconstruction, transportation infrastructure needs to be improved to enhance the
environment for private sector investment. Controlling the wage bill and promoting better
public services will require a comprehensive plan for civil service reform that takes into
account the objectives to increase average pay levels, decompress the wage structure, and
improve efficiency.
41.
In view of the prevailing high inflation, and continued high growth in monetary
and credit aggregates, monetary policy should be tightened further. The central bank is
to be commended for recent efforts to intensify open market operations, but stronger efforts
are needed to reduce the rate of reserve money growth, and interest rates will need to be free
to adjust as necessary to meet monetary targets. A further increase in the interest rate policy
corridor would signal the government’s determination to reduce inflation, and help reduce
inflationary expectations. More central bank autonomy is also needed to enhance the
credibility of monetary policy.
42.
The flexible exchange rate regime has an important role to play in economic
adjustment—especially in view of the external and domestic macroeconomic shocks
experienced in 2004–05. The loss of official reserves in 2004 underscores the risks of trying
to avoid an exchange rate depreciation through protracted intervention. Given the prospects
for large aid inflows and import needs in the coming months, exchange rate volatility could
pick up, and some intervention to smooth short-run adjustments is justified. However, a drop
in foreign exchange reserves below current levels should be avoided, and the exchange rate
allowed to depreciate if downward pressures on the rate were to emerge. Any attempts to use
protectionist trade policies or reverse long-standing liberal exchange policies in an attempt to
temporarily reduce pressures on the exchange rate would be counterproductive and should be
avoided. Over the medium term, international reserves should be increased to a more
comfortable level.
43.
The medium-term outlook hinges critically on Sri Lanka’s ability to move
toward fiscal consolidation, implement structural reforms, and revive the peace
process. Significant untapped growth potential remains in the North and East, and the
country has a good opportunity to take advantage of rapid growth in the subregion through
increased cooperation and trade. However, a complex tax system, labor market rigidities,
unreliable and expensive electricity, and poor infrastructure threaten to undermine growth
potential. Moreover, capital market development will also be necessary to support future
growth.
44.
Restructuring of public enterprises remains an important priority. The creation
of the Strategic Enterprise Management Agency (SEMA) is an important step in monitoring
the performance of those large enterprises expected to remain in the public sector. While
improvements have been made in the financial position of some enterprises, fiscal and
quasi-fiscal costs incurred by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and Ceylon Petroleum

- 22 -

Corporation (CPC) threaten to undermine economic performance and the need for reforms
has become increasingly urgent. Further tariff adjustments and restructuring are needed to
improve the financial position and reduce the fiscal burden of these enterprises. A more
comprehensive monitoring of fiscal risks posed by public enterprises should be a priority.
45.
Noticeable improvements have been made in the overall regulation and
supervision of the financial system since the completion of the FSAP in 2002.
Nonperforming loans have come down, provisioning increased, and capital positions
improved across the entire banking system, including in the two large state-owned banks.
While constrained by limited resources, the benefits of improved regulatory and supervisory
practices are clearly evident. Continued vigilance will be needed, however, as the recent
rapid growth in lending could lead to a deterioration of asset quality. It will be important to
closely monitor the large state banks to ensure that restructuring continues and that any
capital injections are directly linked with performance indicators. Reforms in the banking
system will also contribute to reduce interest rate spreads and improve the monetary
transmission mechanism. Improving the functioning of the government debt market,
including by liberalizing investment options for captive sources of government financing
(e.g., the EPF), will lead to more market-determined interest rates, improve returns to
pensioners, and, by reducing financial repression, contribute to the development of capital
markets and higher economic growth.
46.
Sri Lanka’s commitment to an open trade regime needs to be maintained to
benefit from strong global and regional growth. In conjunction with efforts to promote
regional trade, progress also should be made in moving to a low uniform tariff structure to
minimize distortions and inefficiencies than can result from preferential agreements.
47.
Staff urges the authorities to re-establish the credibility of their reform program
to provide a basis for the resumption of Fund program support. The authorities are also
encouraged to improve the quality and coverage of fiscal statistics and address the remaining
issues needed to meet SDDS requirements.
48.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Sri Lanka be held in
accordance with the provisions of Board Decision No. 12794-(02/76) approved on
July 15, 2002.

Sri Lanka—Social and Economic Impact of the Tsunami
1.
The immediate humanitarian impact of the tsunami disaster was huge. The
tsunami struck a relatively thin but long coastal area stretching over 625 miles, or two thirds
of the country’s coastline. Close to 40,000 people are dead or missing, 1,000 children are left
without parents, and about 1 million people have been affected (5 percent of the population).
The tidal waves hit some of the most vulnerable segments of society, including fishermen
and small enterprises, and the ADB estimates that an additional 250,000 people may fall into
poverty. Some 60 percent of the damage was sustained by the war-ravaged North-East.
2.
Reconstruction of the severely damaged physical capital stock is likely to
mitigate the tsunami’s negative effect on growth. The hardest hit sectors were fishing and
tourism, while other export sectors remained intact. The fishing industry which accounts for
about 2 percent of GDP and exports very little, has been devastated—thousands of fishermen
died, 65 percent of the boat fleet was either damaged or destroyed, and 11 fisheries harbors
sustained severe damage. Tourism and related services account for an estimated 2 percent of
GDP and more than 8 percent of exports of goods and services. However, the affected areas
account for only 25 percent of Sri Lanka’s hotel room capacity. The construction sector,
which accounts for 7 percent of GDP, is likely to offset most of the contraction in the fishing
and tourism sectors. Tsunami reconstruction and financing will have a significant impact on
the medium-term outlook leading to higher import and financing needs compared with the
previous baseline.
3.
The authorities’
currently estimate total
post-tsunami relief and
reconstruction costs to be
around $2.1 billion.1 The
government has moved
swiftly to mobilize the
domestic, official and
private resources required
to meet this financing
challenge. An additional
$250 million of debt
rescheduling/relief has
been secured in 2005 from
the Paris Club and other
bilateral creditors, which

expected external financing is shown in Table I.1.2
4.
A four-year recovery and reconstruction strategy is currently being finalized by
the government. Preliminary estimates suggest total expenditure under this plan will be
around $1.75 billion. Not all expenditure will be executed through the government budget.
The government intends, wherever possible, to delegate procurement and construction to
donors outside of normal budgetary procedures. It may be required to contribute up to
Rs. 17 billion ($170 million) of domestic financing to the plan. The expenditure profile of the
strategy, however, remains to be defined. Additional private donations will also contribute to
the reconstruction effort.
5.
The central government budget is expected to contribute about Rs. 32 billion
in 2005. Much of this expenditure has already been incurred through transfer schemes to
support affected households immediately following the disaster. Additional budgetary
expenditure is expected to be directed to the housing sector and the Susahana credit scheme.
Budget contributions will be financed by grants, loans, and domestic funds in broadly equal
proportions.

The amount of off-budget expenditure in 2005, and beyond, is uncertain.

As of end-May 2005, it is estimated that Sri Lanka has received $158 million in emergency
assistance from the IMF and about $200–250 million in other financial aid from official
donors, NGOs/private sources, and the year-to-date impact of the debt moratorium.

accumulation of net international reserves declines with the expiry of debt relief and the need
to repay the rescheduled debt.
8.
Effective and transparent management of tsunami-related expenditure requires
a comprehensive database of all expenditures and financing. This information will be
crucial in managing the fiscal and macroeconomic implications of the reconstruction effort.
Clear coordination structures, such as TAFREN, will assist in this task. When the authorities
seek necessary approvals for expenditure through the central government budget, they should
provide information to parliament on all planned expenditure under the recovery and
reconstruction plan.
9.
The government is making efforts to ensure the effective use of aid. It has hired an
international auditor, imposed information and registration requirements on NGOs, and is
establishing a database for monitoring aid. However, the government, donors, and the LTTE
have yet to agree on a framework for allocating aid across projects and regions. A
multi-donor-trust fund and the tracking matrix—currently under discussion with donors—
would also help prevent the duplication of aid as well as reduce the government’s transaction
costs in dealing with a huge number of donors.

ANNEX II

Sri Lanka—Debt Sustainability Analysis1
Central Government Debt Sustainability
The baseline fiscal scenario of sustained fiscal consolidation yields a favorable path for
Sri Lankan public debt. Under this scenario, central government debt falls linearly from
105 percent of GDP in 2004 to 78 percent of GDP in 2010 and 48 percent in 2025
(Table II.1). NPV indicators of debt and debt-to-revenue and the debt-service to revenue ratio
perform similarly. However, the debt service-to-revenue ratio will continue to exceed the
indicative threshold (40 percent) through 2010. The main driver of the relatively favorable
debt dynamics is a continued interest rate/growth differential. The real growth projection of
6 percent through the period (compared to an average of 4½ percent over the last 10 years)
exceeds the projected real interest rates on domestic and foreign debt.
There are substantial downside risks to this outlook. If growth and primary balances
continue at historic averages over the period (Table II.2, alternative scenario A1), the NPV of
the debt-to-GDP ratio would fall to only 78 percent of GDP in 2010 as compared to
62 percent in the baseline and would eventually begin to increase to a level of 104 percent of
GDP in 2025. The significance of growth is underlined by the fact that the most extreme
stress test is of continued lower-than-average growth.
An even greater risk exists if the authorities fail to engineer a turnaround in current
fiscal policies. This is illustrated in the alternative scenario A2, which assumes a
continuation of recent (2002–2004) economic policies throughout the period. This entails a
primary deficit of 1.2 percent of GDP, an average real interest rate of 2.6 percent, asset
changes and off-budget activities equal to 3.2 percent of GDP (similar to historic residuals),
and real growth of 5 percent. Under these relatively plausible assumptions, the NPV of debtto-GDP would increase from 87 percent in 2005 to 89 percent of GDP in 2010 and
113 percent of GDP in 2025.
External Debt Sustainability
The key assumption underlying the external debt sustainability analysis is that over the
medium term Sri Lanka will graduate from low-income country status. With GDP per
capita already above $1,000 in 2004, the country is assumed to continue to move towards
middle-income status over the next two decades. This process will be supported by less
concessional public financing and more international capital market financing. Private sector
external financing, at this stage still small, is also set to increase. Export growth is assumed
1

This DSA has been shared with the World Bank staff, and no differences of view have been
expressed. As the new procedures for DSAs were established by the Executive Board around
the time of the Article IV discussions, there was not sufficient time for this DSA to be
undertaken jointly with the World Bank.

- 38 -

ANNEX II

to continue at 6 percent per year, based on diversification of the export portfolio, and a
competitive tourism sector. In the long term, a higher standard of living is expected to
increase the demand for imported consumer goods.
Under the baseline, the medium term debt ratio is on a sustainable path. Sri Lanka’s
external debt declines from 63 percent of GDP in 2004 to just under 50 percent of GDP
in 2010 (Table II.3). In NPV terms the debt ratio declines from about 40 percent to
30 percent of GDP (Table II.4). This keeps Sri Lanka well below the debt thresholds for a
country classified as having a strong policy framework according to the World Bank’s
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index. The pace of medium-term debt
reduction is comparable to the baseline of the previous Article IV staff report, but the starting
point is less favorable. In 2004, external debt is about 10 percentage points above what was
expected at the time of the last Article IV consultation. This is due to a stronger reserve
buildup in 2003 as well as a higher current account deficit and a weaker rupee in 2004 than
initially projected. Over the medium term, the tsunami-induced increase in the current
account deficit combined with a slower reserve buildup, leads to comparable debt slopes
across the two baseline scenarios. As the country develops and external financing shifts from
concessional to commercial terms, the debt service ratio increases to about 12 percent for
public debt, and 17 percent for total external debt.
While none of the standard stress tests leads to an explosive trajectory for external
debt, they illustrate Sri Lanka’s vulnerability to exchange rate changes (see B3 and B6
in Table II.4). A one-time 30 percent depreciation would bring the NPV of external debt to
about 50 percent of GDP, and it would take about eight years to bring it back to its current
level.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments devided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

Safeguards Assessment:

Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the CBSL is subject to a full safeguards
assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement which was approved on April 18, 2003.
The assessment was completed on July 30, 2003 and concluded that the CBSL had made
commendable progress in strengthening its safeguards since the 2001 assessment. As a result,
the risk ratings have been upgraded in four of the five areas of the safeguards framework.
The report found a few remaining vulnerabilities that could be addressed through a series of
measures to further strengthen the CBSL’s operations. The authorities have already
implemented most of the proposed measures, including the full implementation of
International Accounting Standards, and committed to implementation of the outstanding
ones, including in the context of the new Central Banking Act.

ANNEX IV

Sri Lanka—Relations with the World Bank Group1
(As of June 20, 2005)
A. Partnership in Sri Lanka’s Development Strategy
In mid-2004, the coalition government that was formed after the April 2004 elections
released its economic policy framework, “Creating our Future, Building our Nation.” This
document placed strong emphasis on reducing poverty and laid out the Government’s broad
areas of focus—developing the rural economy, promoting SMEs, restructuring strategic
state-owned enterprises, reinvigorating the civil service and cutting the budget deficit. In the
second half of 2004, the Government was in the midst of translating the broad framework
into specific programs and action plans in the form of an update of the Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) when a powerful tsunami struck the country on December 26, 2004.
This catastrophe led to the loss of some 31,000 lives as well as damage to over
110,000 homes, the natural ecosystems and coastal infrastructure. Total asset loss is
estimated at around $1 billion (4.5 percent of GDP), but the cost of reconstruction is higher
due to the need for upgrades. The Government presented the much awaited draft of the PRSP
update at the Development Forum held in Sri Lanka on May 16–17, 2005. The draft is an
expansion of the 2004 economic policy framework, more specifically on the Government’s
“pro-poor pro-growth” stance. Consultations on the draft document with stakeholders are
expected to take place in the course of updating and finalizing the strategy.
B. IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
A summary of IMF-World Bank collaboration in Sri Lanka is provided in Table IV.1.
Areas in which the World Bank leads and there is no direct IMF involvement
The policy areas in which the Bank leads and which are not directly incorporated into the
IMF program/country dialogue include a range of social and environmental interventions as
well as legal and judicial reform. The Bank has long led the analytical work on the nature and
root causes of poverty in Sri Lanka. The Poverty Assessment with specific focus on lagging
regions and sectors (e.g., rural, estate, and North East) will be completed in FY06. The Bank
has been assisting the Department of Census and Statistics with the latter’s update of poverty
line data and helping to strengthen the country’s capacity for conducting poverty and social
impact analyses.
The Bank has also led the dialogue in the health sector. The ongoing National HIV/AIDS
Prevention project is assisting in curbing the spread of HIV infection by: (i) expanding
prevention programs for highly vulnerable groups and the general population; (ii) developing
1

- 48 -

ANNEX IV

programs to sustain political and societal commitment to HIV/AIDS prevention; and
(iii) strengthening multi-sectoral involvement and capacity. The Bank worked closely with
the authorities in developing a health sector strategy/program. This has resulted in the
financing of the Health Sector Development operation which supports the implementation of
the strategy to: (i) strengthen health programs delivered by district authorities; (ii) improve
the Ministry of Health’s capacity at central and provincial levels for policy-making and
supporting budget formulation process to reflect priority objectives; and (iii) strengthen
orientation of public health system towards outputs and results.

In the education sector, the Bank has been leading the dialogue, primarily through two
ongoing projects—Second General Education (GEP II) and Teachers Education and

- 49 -

ANNEX IV

Teachers Deployment (TETD). The objectives of GEP II are to: (i) improve quality, access,
management and financing of existing education programs; and (ii) increase education’s
responsiveness to economic needs and reduce poverty. To complement GEP II, TETD has
been supporting the strengthening of teacher training institutions and the upgrading of
teacher education programs. These two projects were restructured in November 2002 to
support key activities to address three immediate priorities—promoting English education;
enhancing the level of information technology in schools; and supporting activities in the
North East, including repair of war damaged schools. Furthermore, dialogue is ongoing with
regard to reform of the tertiary sector and Bank financial support is being provided through
the Improving the Relevance and Quality of Undergraduate Education project.
The Bank’s recent report, “Treasures of the Education System in Sri Lanka: Restoring
Performance, Expanding Opportunities and Enhancing Prospects,” provides a
comprehensive analysis of the education system and assisted the Government in developing
the sector strategy. Subsequently, preparation of the Education Sector Operation is
proceeding with a view to supporting the implementation of the strategy which comprises:
(i) strengthening basic and secondary education system through promotion of equitable
access to basic education; (ii) increasing learning levels and upgrading the curriculum;
(iii) enhancing the efficiency and equity of resource allocation and distribution; and
(iv) strengthening the quality of service delivery.
Given the large presence of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in environment, the World
Bank’s role has been minimal in the sector. The Bank’s involvement has primarily been
through the contributions of staff in the Colombo office who work closely with the ADB
team in supervising their projects.
Finally, the Bank has been taking the lead in legal and judicial reform with assistance in
making the existing legal and judicial framework more efficient, transparent and responsive
to the needs of the public at large and of the private sector in particular. The objectives of the
current Legal and Judicial Reform Project are to: (i) modernize the legislative framework;
(ii) improve the administrative, monitoring and regulatory functions of the Company
Registration Act; and (iii) build the capacity of the judiciary and other institutions providing
dispute resolution services.
Areas in which the World Bank leads and its analysis serves as input into the IMF
program
The Bank led the dialogue on structural reforms supported by the first Poverty Reduction
Support Credit (PRSC I) approved by the Board in June 2003. PRSC I aimed at enhancing
the effectiveness of the overall strategy of the 2003 PRSP by: (i) accelerating economic
growth and supporting private sector development; and (ii) strengthening governance in the
public sector and improving the welfare system. Complementing PRSC I, the Bank led the
dialogue with the public expenditure review, primarily to assist the Government in its efforts
for preparing a medium term budget framework (MTBF). The Bank’s FY05 report,
“Development Policy Review” (DPR), focused on the unusual pattern of development in

- 50 -

ANNEX IV

Sri Lanka—i.e., sustained economic growth accompanied by rising income disparities—and
partially attributed it to the country’s unfinished reform agenda.
With regard to reforms in the factor markets, the Bank has been supporting the development
of broad consensus, methods, framework and capacity for making sustainable and
comprehensive improvements in the land administration system through a Land Titling and
Related Services project. A number of other operations are supporting the implementation of
reforms in public administration and institutional dimensions of public expenditure
management, and they include: (i) the Economic Reform Technical Assistance credit
(discussed below); (ii) the Distance Learning Initiative that is helping to strengthen the
environment for policy reform and build capacity in the public and private sectors through
the transfer of the latest global knowledge with the establishment and operation of a Distance
Learning Center (DLC); and (iii) the e-Sri Lanka Development Project that aims to enhance
growth, employment and equity by promoting affordable access to and wide use of on-line
public information and services by citizens and businesses and private sector
competitiveness, particularly of knowledge industries and small and medium enterprises
(SMEs).
Recognizing the importance of a sound investment climate for generating growth and poverty
reduction, the Bank and ADB jointly conducted a comprehensive investment climate
assessment (ICA) of the urban formal sector and entrepreneurship in the rural areas. A key
finding of the report, “Sri Lanka: Improving the Rural and Urban Investment Climate,” is
that despite differences in the urban and rural investment climate, the poor quality of
infrastructure (especially energy and transport) and finance represent major obstacles to both
urban manufacturing and rural enterprises.
In taking the lead in the area of rural development, the Bank completed a major study,
“Sri Lanka: Promoting Agricultural and Rural Non-Farm Sector Growth” which identified
key constraints, including poor access to critical infrastructure and services, ineffective
public sector expenditure programs, poor flow of information on technology transfer and
dominance of public sector as a service provider and underutilization of private sector
initiatives. To support the focus on poverty reduction and reinvigoration of the rural
economy, the Bank is financing the Community Development and Livelihood “Gemi
Diriya” project by: (i) providing the rural poor with better access to basic infrastructure and
services; and (ii) developing policies, systems, procedures and institutional arrangements
allowing for the transfer of funds directly to communities to provide the latter with technical
and other support on a demand-driven basis.
In the area of peace and reconstruction of the North East (NE), the Bank has played a leading
role. Soon after the signing of the ceasefire agreement, approximately $15 million was made
available from four projects to provide urgently needed assistance to the reconstruction.
Another $31 million to support the reconstruction was subsequently identified through the
restructuring of three operations. A follow-on project, North East Irrigated Agriculture
Project II, continues to help conflict-affected communities in the NE and adjoining areas in
restoring livelihoods, enhancing agricultural and other production and incomes, and building

- 51 -

ANNEX IV

capacity for sustainable, social and economic reintegration. To address housing needs, the
North East Housing Reconstruction Project is providing the poorest conflict-affected
families in the NE (that meet accepted vulnerability criteria) with improved and affordable
housing units. Under the project, cash grants are being offered on an installment basis to
vulnerable families to help reconstruct their homes.
In infrastructure, the Bank is actively engaged in a dialogue with the authorities and
providing support—through the Economic Reform Technical Assistance (ERTA) Project—
to the implementation of reforms in priority sub-sectors: transport, telecommunications,
petroleum, power, port and airport services and urban water supply and sanitation services.
Through the Renewable Energy for Rural Economic Development (RERED) project, the
Bank is helping to improve the quality of rural life by utilizing off-grid renewable energy
technologies to bring electricity to remote communities and promote private sector power
generation from renewable energy resources from the main grid. In addition, through the
Second Community Water project, the Bank is supporting the implementation of
demand-responsive and sustainable rural water and sanitation services, including in the NE.
The Bank—in collaboration with ADB, Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC)—
conducted a preliminary damage and needs assessment and released a joint report in early
February 2005. The assessment forms the basis for a Tsunami Emergency Recovery Program
covering roads, rail, power, water, housing, health, education and livelihoods. To support the
first phase of the program, the Bank restructured its portfolio to release an immediate
$75 million for emergency reconstruction. In support of the second phase of the emergency
recovery program, the Bank has made available $75 million (of which $30 million is in grant
form) through an emergency credit/grant to support urgent recovery efforts over a two to
three year period. The objectives of this operation are to: (i) reduce the immediate suffering
resulting from the effects of the tsunami and restore livelihoods destroyed by the tsunami;
(ii) restore basic services to the population; and (iii) start the recovery and reconstruction
process. The areas of support include livelihood support, housing reconstruction, roads and
implementation support to The Authority for Rebuilding the Nation (TAFREN).
Areas of shared responsibility
As described above, although the Bank has taken the lead in certain structural areas, the IMF
has a strong interest from both a macroeconomic viewpoint and from the perspective of
supporting reforms. As such, there is close coordination on all aspects of support to ongoing
structural reforms.
As one example of an area of joint responsibility, the Bank and the IMF are working closely
together on financial sector issues. Through the Central Bank Strengthening project, the
Bank is supporting improvements in: (i) the efficiency and capacity of the Central Bank of
Sri Lanka (CBSL); and (ii) financial sector policy and regulatory framework to promote
financial sector development. The IMF has been providing technical advice to the CBSL in a
number of reform areas, including with regard to drafting/implementing key new legislation
and in conducting active open market operations.

- 52 -

ANNEX IV

Sri Lanka has long been known for its comprehensive social protection programs. The Bank
and the IMF have shared responsibility for discussing social protection programs with the
Government—including the various options under the 2002 Welfare Benefit Act—and
reforming the welfare system to better target the poor and improve efficiency. With regard to
pension reform, the Bank has long been conducting a dialogue on the topic and support is
being provided under ERTA and an Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant. The
implementation of these reforms will partly depend on continued close coordination between
the Bank and IMF.
Finally, given the importance of trade to achieving Sri Lanka’s growth and poverty reduction
objectives, the Bank and IMF have been sharing the responsibility, with each of the
institutions taking on a special role. The Bank carried out a trade policy analysis as part of
the recent DPR. Specifically, it identified areas of the existing external sector policies—
e.g., preferential trade arrangements as well as trade and tariff and foreign investment
policies—where there may be scope for improvement in order to contribute to Sri Lanka’s
development and ability to cope with a changing external economic environment, especially
the abolition of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA) in January 2005. The contribution of the
IMF will continue to be on supporting trade reforms focused on making further progress
toward a simplified and transparent two-band tariff system, including reducing agricultural
protection.
Areas in which the IMF leads and its analysis serves as input into the World Bank
program
As is the case in the majority of Bank/IMF countries, the IMF is taking the lead on the
dialogue with the Government with regard to maintaining overall sound and flexible
macroeconomic policies. Nevertheless, macroeconomic stability remains a foundation for the
successful implementation of the Bank program.
The IMF also leads the dialogue on fiscal matters, setting the overall envelope for public
expenditures and other fiscal targets. To achieve the needed consolidation, important
medium-term goals include broadening of the revenue base and reorienting expenditures
toward priority spending. The IMF is taking the lead on the revenue side and as mentioned
previously, the Bank is taking the lead on the expenditure side.
Areas in which the IMF leads and there is no direct World Bank involvement
The IMF is fully responsible for the dialogue on monetary policy, interest rates, the exchange
rate regime, the balance of payments, and related statistical and measurement issues.
C. World Bank Group Strategy and Lending Operations
Country Assistance Strategy. The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Sri Lanka was
considered by the Bank’s Board on April 1, 2003. The CAS was designed to support
the 2003 PRSP, which focused on three core themes: peace, growth and equity. The rationale

- 53 -

ANNEX IV

for these themes is: (i) without peace, there is no prospect for development; not only from the
difficulty of creating a framework for sustainable poverty reduction and growth in such a
situation, but also that the fiscal burden would be likely to become increasingly intolerable
and the most vulnerable poor in today’s society—the conflict-affected and displaced
populations—would not be reached; (ii) growth is the key to prosperity and to creating a
bigger cake for distribution; and (iii) equity concerns will remain high in Sri Lanka, not only
to permit the expected attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), but more
to ensure balance within the society.
At the present time, the Bank’s program continues to support the peace and equity themes of
the 2003 PRSP. More recently, the tsunami-related reconstruction and recovery program has
been added to the program of assistance. However, Bank support with respect to the growth
theme—possibly through budget support credits to follow PRSC I—awaits the development
of a reform agenda that is expected to emerge out of the PRSP update and consultations. The
CAS will be updated to reflect the revised agenda. The CAS also envisioned a key role for
the International Finance Corporation (IFC), especially in helping achieve the growth
objectives.
The Base Case Lending Program. The FY03–FY06 base case lending program presented in
the CAS consisted of about four projects per year for a total of $800 million in IDA
resources. In each year, the lending program was anchored in a budget support credit (such as
PRSC I) linked to the implementation of the PRSP and complemented by two to four
investment/sectoral operations per year to support key programs in the focus areas.
Bank Assistance Program in Sri Lanka. The Bank’s active portfolio as of June 20, 2005
comprises 20 IDA credits/grants and one Global Environmental Facility (GEF) grant for a
total commitment (net of cancellation) of $904 million (Table IV.2). During FY05, the
following projects were approved: (i) e-Sri Lanka Development project in September 2004;
(ii) North East Housing Reconstruction Project in December 2004; and (iii) Tsunami
Emergency Recovery Program, Phase II in February 2005.
Economic and Sector Work. The Bank’s leading economic report is the “Development
Policy Review” (DPR) (Report No. 29396-LK, December 8, 2004). Three important sector
reports/policy notes were completed in FY04 and FY05—“Treasures of the Education
System in Sri Lanka: Restoring Performance, Expanding Opportunities and Enhancing
Prospects,” “Sri Lanka: Improving the Rural and Urban Investment Climate” and the
“Post-Tsunami Recovery Program: Preliminary Damage and Needs Assessment.” Other
recent diagnostic work includes the Country Procurement Assessment Review, Country
Financial Accountability Assessment, ROSC Accounting and Auditing Assessment,
“Promoting Agricultural and Rural Non-Farm Sector Growth” (Report No. 25387-CE,
February 26, 2003), Health Sector Policy Note and Roads Policy Note. The following
economic and sector work will be completed shortly—MDG Assessment Report,
Decentralization and Delivery of Services Policy Note and Social Protection Policy Note.
The Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA) will be carried out on a continuous basis.
The Bank’s recent and ongoing analytical work helped shape its latest report, “Sri Lanka

- 54 -

ANNEX IV

Development Forum: The Economy, The Tsunami and Poverty Reduction (Report
No 32221-LK April 28, 2005) that aimed to contribute to the national debate on the primary
issues and to serve as an input to the update of the PRSP, the draft of which was presented at
the Forum.
IFC’s Activities in Sri Lanka. As of February 28, 2005, IFC’s held portfolio in Sri Lanka
consisted of investments in 10 companies, with a total committed exposure of $104 million.
The portfolio is spread over financial institutions, power, health care, manufacturing, ports
and telecommunications. In FY04, IFC approved an SME development program for
Sri Lanka and the Maldives. IFC would provide $2 million of the $10 million total funding
requirement for the five-year program along with other donors. The program’s focus will be
on financial services, and the business enabling environment, as well as specific sub-sectors,
such as, tourism, construction and agribusiness. In light of the tsunami, IFC plans to
accelerate the launch of this program to assist the rehabilitation and creation of sustainable
private enterprises. As part of IFC’s immediate response to the tsunami, it approved a
$2.5 million Matching Grant Program to match the costs incurred in relief work by selected
partner companies in the affected countries in order to enable such companies to step up their
participation in the relief effort. Total approved sub-projects under this program amount to
$319,000, as of April 2005, covering airport and port logistics, relief camps and emergency
telecommunications. In addition, IFC provided $150,000 to the Fishermen’s Relief Trust
Fund—established by the National Development Bank (NDB)—to help finance the repair or
replacement of fishing boats and equipment damaged by the tsunami.

Sri Lanka—Relations with the Asian Development Bank1
(As of May 31, 2005)
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) started its operation in Sri Lanka in 1969 and has
provided 128 public sector loans totaling about $3.4 billion and 213 technical assistance
projects totaling about $88.5 million.
In April 2005, ADB approved a $197 million grant and loan package for two projects that
will help rebuild tsunami- and conflict-affected areas of Sri Lanka. External funding for the
projects will total $256 million including grant cofinancing by the European Commission and
Sweden. A $150 million grant and a $7 million loan for the Tsunami-affected Areas
Rebuilding Project (TAARP) will help to rapidly improve the living conditions of people in
tsunami-affected areas by restoring basic social infrastructure, community and public
services, and livelihoods. The grant comes from ADB’s Asian Tsunami Fund, set up in
February with an initial ADB contribution of $600 million to deliver prompt emergency
grant funding to tsunami-affected countries. The loan comes from reallocated surplus loan
funds from other ADB projects in Sri Lanka. An additional $14 million grant and a
$26 million loan for the North East Community Restoration and Development Project II
(NECORD II) will continue the Government’s rehabilitation program in conflict-affected
areas of the Northern and Eastern provinces.
During 2004, ADB approved eight projects to Sri Lanka totaling $195 million and
$3.9 million in technical assistance grants, to support development and reforms in key areas
of the economy. The ADB assistance includes road sector development, wastewater
management, and assistance to Sri Lankan debt market and for psycho-social health in
conflict affected areas.
In 2004, the ADB’s Board of Directors endorsed the Country Strategy and Program Update
(CSPU) for 2005–2006, which envisages assistance of about $570 million over the next two
years. The CSPU 2005–2006 supports the government’s efforts in rehabilitating and
reconstructing the conflict-affected areas. ADB operations over this period will also be based
on the Tsunami Needs Assessment carried out in January 2005, which identifies and
emphasizes the importance of key guiding principles—such as conflict sensitivity,
subsidiarity, community empowerment, transparency, multi-hazard risk management, and
coordination between stakeholders—during the development of a comprehensive tsunami
recovery strategy.
ADB’s top priorities in Sri Lanka are supporting broad-based economic growth, advancing
social development and supporting improved governance. Emphasis will be placed on poorer
regions and those encountering particular hardship. Out of the total, $330 million will come
1

- 57 -

ANNEX V

from ADB’s Asian Development Fund (ADF), which supports the sustainable social and
economic development of poor countries in the Asian and Pacific region, and $240 million
will be from ordinary capital resources (OCR). The timing and magnitude of the assistance
program will be responsive to the developing peace process and the country performance.
Reflecting ADB’s country-wide focus, ADB’s support over the three–year duration of the
new program cycle will help the country provide quality education, increase access of the
poor to social services, develop basic economic infrastructure, rebuild conflict-torn areas and
reintegrate them into the national economy, enhance rural livelihoods, remove the barriers to
attracting investment, and improve governance.
The lending program will be supported by technical assistance operations of about
$13 million. The technical assistance program will support project preparation, institutional
development, and economic, thematic and sector work.
As of December 31, 2004, the sectoral distribution of the loan portfolio is agriculture and
natural resources, 21.8 percent; social infrastructure, 13.2 percent; energy, 8.4 percent;
education, 10.9 percent; finance and industry, 17.2 percent; transport and communications,
21.1 percent; and relief and rehabilitation, 7.4 percent.

ANNEX VI

Sri Lanka––Statistical Issues
Staff Assessment
Overall, the coverage and timeliness of available data in Sri Lanka are adequate for program
monitoring and surveillance purposes. The authorities supply key data to the Fund on a
timely basis, the Government regularly publishes economic information and data, and daily
information on stock, money, and foreign exchange market developments is readily available
through electronic media. However, as noted below, there are deficiencies in the statistical
base which, if rectified, would improve the ability to monitor developments and formulate
appropriate economic policies. Sri Lanka is a participant in the General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS) and metadata were posted on the Fund’s DSBB in July 2000. Quarterly
national accounts and monthly monetary and fiscal revenue data are published regularly. The
authorities have expressed their intention to subscribe to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS) and have appointed an SDDS coordinator in February 2003. However,
substantial work is still needed in terms of meeting all SDDS requirements and preparing the
necessary metadata before Sri Lanka is ready for subscription.
Most data ROSC recommendations have been implemented while others are expected to be
implemented in the near future. In particular, most data are now being disseminated in the
Census and Statistics and central bank websites; a census of industries is underway while a
Census of Agriculture (including the North and East) has been finalized; a labor force survey
is being conducted on a quarterly basis; the CBSL has issued an advance release calendar and
designated a contact person to assist data users.
Outstanding Statistical Issues
Real Sector
Sri Lanka produces several consumer price indices. The official price measure, the Colombo
Consumer Price Index (CCPI) produced by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS),
uses an outdated consumption basket and weighting system and has become increasingly
irrelevant as a measure of general inflation. The DCS also publishes a Greater Colombo Price
Index (GCPI), including Colombo city and the suburbs. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka
(CBSL) produces a Colombo District CPI (CDCPI) and a Wholesale cum-Producer Price
Index (WPI/PPI).
A technical assistance report by STA (October 1998) recommended that authorities should
produce a single, high quality official CPI, which should cover all households (rather than
just lower-income ones), and include a reliable price indicator for rent and owner-occupied
housing. In response, a new nationwide CPI, covering the second to eighth income deciles, is
being published. STA expects to publish this new index in IFS, following an assessment of
its quality.
A STA data ROSC mission in June 2001 noted that considerable progress has been made in
meeting most requirements for the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). However,
the mission identified a number of deficiencies. The national accounts suffer from lack of

- 59 -

ANNEX VI

sufficient data sources and undeveloped statistical techniques. Sri Lanka does not have
periodic comprehensive benchmarks and a system for conducting regular annual surveys of
establishments. A statistical business register, which would serve as the main basis for
conducting sample surveys, is not available. As a result, the few surveys that are conducted
do not have good sample frames. Most of the data used for regular compilation are obtained
on a timely basis. However, detailed data needed to measure both output and intermediate
consumption are mostly unavailable or not collected. As a result, the estimates of gross value
added are prepared directly relying on outdated fixed ratios established from the base
year 1996, often with outdated studies or ad hoc assumptions. Quarterly indicators are used
for compiling quarterly value added estimates. The methodology for deriving GDP at
constant prices is not satisfactory. Expenditures estimates are available only annually and
rely mostly on commodity flow techniques. Whenever possible, estimates are validated and
checked with other sources.
Fiscal Sector
A government finance statistics mission from STA in May 2003 followed up on the ROSC
recommendation to develop a migration path to compile data in accordance with the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). As part of that plan, the
authorities agreed to revise from end–2003 the budgetary classifications and the accounting
structure to eventually match the GFSM 2001 classifications of all stocks and flows and to
apply that chart of accounts to all general government units.
Data regularly provided for publication in the GFS Yearbook cover only the budgetary
accounts of central government. No data on the four extra-budgetary funds or the provincial
and local governments are provided. No sub-annual data are provided for publication in IFS.
The authorities are planning to reduce the lag in producing monthly expenditure details on
the budgetary central government operations to 45 days, and to revise the presentation of
these data to conform to framework of GFSM 2001. They have also begun a process to
compile current and historical data on the budgetary operations of Provincial Councils. Full
adoption of the GFSM 2001 system is expected to take a substantial period of time.
Monetary Sector
Foreign Currency Banking Units (FCBUs) are now classified as resident institutions in the
monetary survey (since 1998). To adjust for the proportion of nonresident foreign currency
deposits (NRFC), which are actually held by residents (mainly returning migrant workers),
50 percent of these deposits are reclassified from foreign liabilities to domestic deposits.
The authorities started reporting the adjusted monetary data to STA from January 1999.
A monetary statistics mission from STA in June 2003 followed up on issues raised during
the 2001 ROSC mission. In particular, the mission clarified the methodology in the treatment
of Fund accounts; recommended that repos be treated as collateralized loans (rather than on a
change of ownership basis); and resolved discrepancies between the monetary authorities’
data reported to STA and to APD, which reflected problems in the valuation of Fund
accounts and different methodological treatments.

- 60 -

ANNEX VI

External Sector
A STA mission visited Colombo in December 2004. The highest priority issues identified by
the mission included dealing with some shortcomings in the international transactions
reporting system (ITRS), which is the primary data source for the balance of payments. The
recommended improvements included addressing the large values of unclassified
transactions, inclusion of FCBUs in the data, and providing an instruction book to assist
ITRS reporters to apply classifications and coding more accurately. The mission advised the
authorities on the development of a comprehensive survey to implement their medium-term
plan to introduce international investment position statistics.
The CBSL provides gross and net official reserves and intervention data in U.S. dollar terms
on a weekly basis.

Sri Lanka—Common Indicators Required for Surveillance

- 62 -

ANNEX VII

Sri Lanka—Technical Assistance
Fiscal Sector
Consistent with the continued prominence given to improving revenue performance in
both the PRSP and in the surveillance and program context, recent FAD technical
assistance (TA) has focused on tax policy and administration. A report in 2001 proposed
a wide-ranging agenda for policy and administrative reform. It recommended in particular
the introduction of a single-rate VAT, the repeal of a number of ad hoc taxes, the limiting of
tax exemptions and incentives, and a number of measures to broaden the base of existing
taxes. Subsequent TA focused on improving administration with missions in 2002 and 2003
providing advice on the design of a revenue authority and strategies for modernizing revenue
departments. In early 2004, as the prospects for the establishment of a revenue authority
diminished, FAD focused on operational support to the Large Taxpayer Unit (LTU) through
a five-month assignment of a resident expert.
The implementation of FAD recommendations has, however, been patchy. In line with
the key recommendations of the 2001 report, many ad hoc taxes have been repealed, a VAT
has been established and the Economic Service Charge implemented. However, fundamental
aspects of these recommendations, such as the coverage and rate of the VAT and the limiting
of tax exemptions were not implemented with the possible result that policy reforms have not
achieved their potential. While there have been some successes, notably in the LTU, overall
progress in revenue administration has been disappointing particularly in key areas such as
establishing a single Taxpayer Identification Number and modernizing the structure and
processes of the Inland Revenue Department.
Monetary and Financial Sector
MFD and LEG have provided extensive TA on financial sector reform consistent with
Sri Lanka’s FSAP, PRSP, and the new government’s development strategy recently
presented to the Development Forum. The PRSP, issued in late 2002, identifies
insufficient access to finance and high financial intermediation costs as a prime impediment
to growth and poverty reduction. The poor intermediation is commonly attributed to a
combination of inefficient state banks, insufficient competition, and a week regulatory
framework. Accordingly, MFD TA has focused on state bank restructuring, bank
supervision, capital market development (to increase competition in the banking sector),
and—in cooperation with LEG—legal reform.
The implementation record of MFD/LEG recommendations has been affected by
political uncertainties related to the 2004 elections and, subsequently, the tsunami. On
the positive side, the performance of the two state-owned banks continues to improve,
provisioning requirements have been strengthened, actual provisioning increased across the
banking sector, and short selling of government securities has been permitted to enhance
capital markets. However, the new central bank law and banking law have been delayed, and
approval by Parliament is not expected before end-2006. The laws aim to strengthen the

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
July 15, 2005

This statement reports on recent developments since the issuance of the staff report.
The information presented does not materially change the economic outlook or the staff
appraisal.
The political situation remains difficult. Despite the government’s lack of majority in
parliament, the President has ruled out calling for parliamentary elections at this time.
Meanwhile, the main opposition party has stepped up its demand that a Presidential election
be held this year.
The Post-Tsunami Operations Management Structure (P-TOMS), which was discussed
in Parliament earlier this month, is taking shape. The P-TOMS will have representatives
from the government, the LTTE and the Muslim community, and will be in charge of
approving reconstruction projects for tsunami-affected areas in the North and East parts of
the country. Funding will be channeled through a Trust Fund for which the World Bank has
been asked to be the custodian and to which about $100 million has been pledged so far. Out
of total tsunami pledges, staff estimates that Sri Lanka has now received $300–350 million in
aid for reconstruction from official donors, NGOs/private sources, and the year-to-date
impact of the debt moratorium. This is in addition to $158 million in emergency assistance
from the IMF and about $65 million in humanitarian assistance by UN agencies.
Notwithstanding the political uncertainty, financial markets have remained stable. The
exchange rate has hovered around Rs. 100/US$ since end-May and, despite some central
bank intervention when the JVP quit the government, reserves remained at $2.1 billion
(about 2.4 months of imports) as of July 6. Equity prices remain at about the same level as in
May. The yields on the 3-month treasury bill have risen somewhat to about 9 percent, close
to 200 basis points above their level at end-2004, as a result of the increases in policy rates
and open market operations by the central bank.
GDP growth in the first quarter reached 4.8 percent (y/y), in line with expectations. The
tsunami contributed to a slowdown in services, especially trade- and tourism-related, and had
a devastating impact on fisheries, which contracted by 65 percent. Tourism, however,
contracted by less than expected in the first quarter (arrivals decreased by 5 percent y/y) and
arrivals in April-May were well above last year’s levels. A good paddy harvest and a rebound
in value added in the electricity sector (which was affected by a drought last year) helped
offset the negative impact of the tsunami on GDP. The apparel sector also performed
reasonably well and posted a growth rate of 7 percent.
Inflation moderated slightly in May, thanks to a decline in food prices, with the
Sri Lanka CPI falling to about 13 percent (y/y). Although inflation measured by the
Colombo CPI also fell in June, to below 10 percent, inflationary pressures remain a concern

-2-

for the second half of the year, when reconstruction activity will pick up and adjustments in
administered prices are expected to take place.
In accordance with the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act, the government
presented to Parliament the Mid-Year Fiscal Position Report. In it, the overall fiscal
deficit in the first four months of the year is estimated at about 3 percent of annual GDP. The
latest revenue figures (20 percent growth y/y through May) are broadly in line with the staff
revenue projections but high oil prices, which are currently above the assumptions used in
the staff report, represent a risk to expenditure projections. Staff estimates that at current oil
prices, additional subsidies of around ⅓ percent of GDP would be required unless fuel and
diesel prices are adjusted by more than envisaged in the staff report.
On monetary policy, the CBSL appears to have been successful at moderating
somewhat the pace of money creation. Thus, at end-June, reserve money growth stood at
about 19 percent (y/y), compared to 21 percent at end-2004. Further tightening, however,
will be necessary to rein in inflationary pressures. At its monthly meeting earlier this week,
the Monetary Board left interest rates unchanged.
As regards the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), negotiations between the authorities
and the unions have continued since the staff report was issued, but the main issues
remain unresolved. The sticking point continues to be the unbundling of CEB, which the
unions fear could facilitate privatization in the future. In the meantime, an increase in fixed
charges for electricity has been announced.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation
with Sri Lanka
On July 15, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Sri Lanka.1
Background
Since the last Article IV consultation, economic growth momentum has largely been sustained,
but accommodating monetary and fiscal policies have added to inflationary pressures. The Sri
Lankan authorities, supported by the international community, have provided the initial stages of
tsunami relief relatively efficiently. However, implementation of the more difficult reconstruction
phase will affect economic performance going forward.
Export performance was strong in 2004, aided by textiles and tourism arrivals, but rising oil
prices and a drought were a drag on growth. Real GDP increased by 5.4 percent, compared
with 6.0 percent in 2003. Growth was led by domestic demand, especially strong private
investment, which contributed to rapid growth in imports. Annual inflation reached 16.8 percent
(end-of-period), reflecting demand pressures as well as higher food and oil prices.
The fiscal deficit reached 8¼ percent of GDP in 2004, or 1½ percentage points higher than
budgeted. Revenues fell short of the budget target owing to the late enactment of income tax
amendments and lower than expected profit transfers from the central bank. Expenditure
overruns were due to higher subsidies (mostly for oil). The impact on net domestic financing,
which reached 6 percent of GDP, was exacerbated by lower privatization proceeds and

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2shortfalls in program financing. To help bridge this gap, the government issued $250 million
(1¼ percent of GDP) in dollar denominated bonds in the domestic market.
With the central bank purchasing large amounts of treasury bills, ample liquidity was available
for private credit, and money growth increased significantly. Broad money increased
by 20 percent, compared with 15 percent in 2003. With the increase in inflation, and despite a
modest increase in policy rates by 50 basis points in November, real interest rates remained
negative contributing to private credit growth of 22 percent. In contrast to the previous year,
monetary expansion in 2004 was accounted for by an expansion of private and public credit
rather than an increase in international reserves.
The balance of payments shifted to a deficit of $205 million in 2004, from a surplus of
$502 million in 2003. Despite robust export performance, the current account moved from near
balance to a deficit of 3 percent of GDP, reflecting the effects of both oil price increases and
strong demand for investment goods. Official external financing—especially program loans—
dried up significantly, with donors waiting for an articulation of the government’s policy agenda.
By end-2004, the rupee had lost 8 percent of its value against the dollar (y/y), despite central
bank intervention, and gross official reserves had fallen to $1.8 billion (equivalent to 2.1 months
of imports).
The 2005 budget, approved in December 2004, envisaged a reduction in the deficit to
7½ percent of GDP. The budget aimed to improve economic conditions for the rural poor,
increase spending on health and education, phase out numerous subsidies, including on petrol
and diesel, and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to meet the targets of the Fiscal
Management (Responsibility) Act, albeit on a delayed timetable. While the 2005 budget targets
represent a welcome step toward putting government debt on a declining path relative to GDP,
budget estimates appeared overly optimistic, particularly for revenue.
Progress has been made on some structural reforms, but problems remain, especially for some
key public enterprises. On revenue administration, the cabinet approved in June 2004 the listing
of various revenue departments under a revenue board. However, much remains to be done on
the concurrently approved restructuring of the Inland Revenue Department. In the financial
sector, the ADB approved a program loan in support of the restructuring of People’s Bank,
whose performance indicators have improved. In the energy sector, however, large fiscal and
quasi-fiscal costs arising from the operations of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and
the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) have taken place in 2004-05. Direct subsidies from the
budget amounting to 1 percent of GDP in 2004, and ½ percent of GDP so far in 2005, have
been paid to CPC to cover their losses. While electricity charges are among the highest in the
region, operational inefficiencies in CEB have led to significant losses and accumulated debt
(including arrears) amounts to about 4 percent of GDP. Deadlines for reforming CEB have been
postponed repeatedly.
While still vulnerable, the macroeconomic situation has stabilized somewhat since the tsunami.
The rupee ended its downward slide on the expectation of aid inflows and has appreciated
5 percent against the U.S. dollar through mid-July, and gross reserves increased by more than
$300 million reflecting the IMF’s emergency assistance and other donor disbursements.
However, monetary aggregates have continued to grow rapidly and inflation has remained high,
despite efforts by the central bank to absorb excess liquidity, and increases in policy interest
rates in May and June of 25 and 50 basis points, respectively. Fuel prices have been adjusted

-3twice so far in 2005, but fuel subsidies continue to be a drag on the budget. Stock prices, after a
dip in the immediate aftermath of the Tsunami disaster, have continued their rising trend
from 2004 and are up by about 25 percent so far this year.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Sri Lankan government for its prompt and effective
implementation of relief work to cope with the loss of life, suffering, and destruction caused by
the December 2004 tsunami. A key ongoing challenge will be to manage the reconstruction
activity in an efficient and transparent manner by mobilizing donor assistance effectively and
maintaining macroeconomic stability. The longer-term challenges facing Sri Lanka include
moving toward fiscal consolidation, implementing structural reforms that enhance the
investment climate, and reviving the peace process, in order to establish a solid foundation for
sustainable growth and reduction of poverty.
Directors observed that near-term prospects for economic growth remain positive, with
reconstruction activity and a strong performance of the agricultural sector expected to offset the
tsunami’s adverse impact on fisheries and tourism. They cautioned, however, that inflationary
pressures could be exacerbated if reconstruction faces bottlenecks. Accordingly, Directors
emphasized the importance of effective management of the reconstruction, with the government
continuing to coordinate official tsunami assistance and oversee arrangements to monitor
private aid flows. They welcomed the establishment of the Task Force for Reconstruction of the
Nation and the appointment of an external auditor, and called for periodic reports on the use of
aid directly to the public and the donor community, as well as implementation of audit
procedures to ensure transparency and accountability.
With the reconstruction plans in place, Directors considered that emphasis should now be
placed on Sri Lanka’s longer-term challenges. Positive factors behind the growth outlook include
the significant untapped potential in the North and East of the country, the country’s open trade
policies, and increased commercial links with its fast growing neighbors. At the same time,
Directors noted that a complex tax system, labor market rigidities, poor infrastructure, and an
underdeveloped capital market constrain private investment and impede growth.
Directors cautioned that the recent large fiscal deficits and the high level of public debt
constitute a potential source of macroeconomic instability. Noting that meaningful progress
toward the path of fiscal consolidation envisaged under the Fiscal Management (Responsibility)
Act has been elusive, Directors called for stronger efforts at fiscal consolidation. Improvements
in debt management, and curtailment of central bank financing of the budget in the context of a
medium-term budget framework, remain essential.
Directors welcomed the recent improvement in revenue performance, noting, in particular, that
several measures had helped increase tax revenue relative to GDP in 2004. However, the
authorities were encouraged to consider additional measures if needed to ensure that the
revised 2005 budget targets for revenue are achieved. In addition, Directors encouraged the
authorities to give priority to a comprehensive tax reform, including improvements in tax and
customs administration as well as broadening of the tax base.
Directors considered that fiscal adjustment will also need to focus on the expenditure side, with
the aim of shifting expenditure to priority infrastructure and poverty-related projects.

-4The authorities were urged to cut fuel subsidies, particularly for petrol and diesel, by raising
prices to cost-recovery levels. Directors also reiterated the need for civil service reform to
contain the wage bill and decompress the wage structure. To protect the poor from the effects of
these measures, Directors encouraged the authorities to proceed with earlier plans to improve
the targeting of welfare benefits.
Directors commended the central bank’s recent actions to tighten monetary policy and increase
transparency. Nevertheless, inflation remains high and monetary and credit aggregates
continue to grow rapidly. Accordingly, Directors recommended appropriately paced additional
monetary tightening in order to signal the central bank’s determination to curb inflation and
reduce inflationary expectations. Some Directors also felt that greater independence of the
central bank would contribute toward these objectives.
Directors reiterated their support for the flexible exchange rate regime, which has helped
cushion the external and domestic shocks of 2004–2005. They concurred that some smoothing
of the exchange rate path is appropriate, especially given the large aid inflows and import needs
over the coming months. However, Directors underscored the risks of trying to avoid an
exchange rate depreciation through protracted intervention. They also advised that reserves be
increased to more comfortable levels over the medium term. Directors urged the authorities to
maintain their long-standing commitment to an open trade regime, which will play an important
role in ensuring that Sri Lanka benefits from strong global and regional growth.
Directors encouraged the authorities to move forward with the restructuring of key public
enterprises. They welcomed the creation of the Strategic Enterprise Management Agency
(SEMA) to monitor those enterprises expected to remain in the public sector. Directors
expressed concern that the fiscal and quasi-fiscal costs incurred by the Ceylon Electricity Board
(CEB) and Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) threaten to undermine fiscal sustainability and
economic performance, and urged the authorities to make further tariff adjustments and proceed
with their restructuring. More broadly, Directors suggested a more comprehensive monitoring of
public enterprises’ fiscal risks.
Directors commended the authorities for the progress made in the regulation and supervision of
the financial system since the completion of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)
in 2002. As a result, financial indicators have improved across the entire banking system,
including in the two state-owned commercial banks. However, Directors warned that the recent
rapid growth in lending could lead to a deterioration of asset quality. They emphasized that the
planned recapitalization of People’s Bank should proceed on the basis of the achievement of
agreed performance targets. Looking ahead, Directors encouraged efforts to promote greater
competition in the banking system, and some called for the increased commercialization of the
state-owned banks.
Directors considered that Sri Lanka’s statistical information is adequate for surveillance
purposes and encouraged the authorities to improve the quality and coverage of fiscal statistics
and address the remaining issues needed to meet Special Data Dissemination Standard
(SDDS) requirements. They commended the authorities for successfully addressing the
recommendations of the Safeguards Assessment.
Directors expressed regret about the delays in completing the reviews under the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility and Extended Arrangements. They looked forward to continued

-5progress in the near future toward the development of a credible and sustainable economic
reform program based on a broad domestic consensus.
