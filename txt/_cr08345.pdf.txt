EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
Sound economic policies and a pragmatic approach to structural reforms continue to bear
fruit, as evidenced by strong growth and improved social indicators. However, important
challenges remain. Unemployment, particularly among the youth, is still relatively high and
an increasing number of university graduates are seeking jobs. The immediate challenge is to
limit the effect from rising international fuel and food prices, slower global growth, and
tighter international credit markets. Growth accelerated to 6.3 percent in 2007 and is likely to
remain above 5 percent this year. However, inflation picked up and total food and fuel
subsidies (direct and indirect) for 2008 are projected at 7.3 percent of GDP. Discussions
centered on controlling inflation, maintaining fiscal sustainability, and promoting growth.
Authorities’ Views
•

Despite a significant increase in fuel and food subsidies, the authorities intend to
maintain the overall fiscal deficit within the target of 3 percent of GDP owing to
strong revenue, notably from the hydrocarbon sector. The authorities remain
committed to fiscal consolidation, including the rationalization of subsidies over the
medium term. Social stability considerations will determine the speed of reform.

•

Monetary policy has turned restrictive since mid-2007 to curb inflation and additional
policy instruments are being developed to better control excess liquidity. However,
the Central Bank of Tunisia (BCT) has refrained from increasing its policy interest
rate for fear of weakening growth.

•

The quality of banks’ balance sheet continues to improve and the authorities
recognize that further strengthening of the banking sector remains a high priority.

Staff Recommendations
The staff broadly supports the authorities’ macroeconomic policy stance and urges them to
pursue the necessary reforms to preserve macroeconomic stability, enhance the economy’s
resilience, and promote growth and employment. In particular:
•

The current subsidy system needs to be replaced by a more targeted safety net over
the medium term in order to maintain fiscal sustainability, decrease the country’s
vulnerability to shocks, and create the necessary fiscal space for additional social and
infrastructure spending.

•

The BCT should stand ready to increase its policy interest rate if inflationary
pressures intensify given that macroeconomic stability is a prerequisite to strong and
sustained growth. There is no clear evidence of significant exchange rate
misalignment and the authorities’ policies are consistent with external stability.

•

The mission encourages the authorities to continue enhancing the banking sector’s
efficiency and resilience in view of the gradual opening of the capital account.

4
I. BACKGROUND
1.
Sound economic policies underpinned by an outward-oriented reform strategy
allowed Tunisia to achieve strong growth and improve its social indicators. Real GDP
growth averaged 5 percent a year during the past decade, real GDP per capita increased by
45 percent between 1997 and 2007, average inflation was at 3 percent, and the external and
fiscal positions have strengthened.
2.
However, important challenges lie ahead. The authorities’ major preoccupation that
has shaped their medium-term strategy is how to reduce the still relatively high
unemployment rate—14.1 percent for the active population in 2007 and significantly higher
among the youth—while creating enough jobs for the fast-growing number of university
graduates. The immediate challenge is to limit the macroeconomic impact from rising
international fuel and food prices and the global financial turmoil. Against this backdrop, the
2008 consultation discussions focused on potential risks to the short-term outlook and the
necessary policies to further reduce Tunisia’s vulnerabilities and ensure high and sustained
growth.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Tunisia has so far weathered relatively well the difficult international
environment:
Real GDP growth accelerated from 5.5 percent in 2006 to 6.3 percent in 2007,
underpinned by strong performance of agriculture, energy, manufacturing, and the
services sectors. On the demand side, vigorous exports and investment powered the
growth acceleration. Economic growth slowed to 5.8 percent in the first quarter of
2008 but still remained above trend. The slowdown is primarily due to the decline in
production of hydrocarbons on account of temporary technical difficulties, and the
economic slowdown in the European Union.

•

Inflation has picked up, due mainly to rising international fuel and food prices and,
to a lesser extent, growing liquidity in the

the first half of 2008. The nominal effective exchange rate depreciated by 2.8 percent
in 2007, contributing somewhat to the inflation acceleration.

•

The current account deficit widened from 2 percent of GDP in 2006 to
2.6 percent of GDP in 2007 due to declining terms of trade. This trend continued
in the first quarter of 2008 on account of rising international fuel and food prices and
buoyant imports of capital goods, and a drop in energy exports due to technical
difficulties. With the significant increase in FDI inflows, international reserves
amounted to over $8½ billion, largely sufficient to cover short-term liabilities.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
4.
Discussions centered on (a) risks to the outlook from the global slowdown and
record-high commodity prices; (b) the appropriate fiscal and monetary policy mix to contain
inflation and sustain growth, including an assessment of external stability, and (c) the
acceleration of structural reforms to consolidate Tunisia’s financial and macroeconomic
position and stimulate private investment.
A. Outlook
5.
The short-term outlook is encouraging despite the challenging international
environment. The global financial upheavals have thus far had only a limited impact on the
Tunisian economy but could still affect it, mainly through the trade channel (Box 1). In 2008,
real GDP growth is projected to decelerate moderately to 5.5 percent; inflation would remain
about 5 percent if international prices taper off and monetary policy continues to be
restrictive. High food prices and strong investments are expected to widen the current
account deficit to 3.5 percent of GDP. The fiscal

nonperforming loans have declined significantly over the past few years owing to strengthened regulatory and

a result of high energy prices and a positive supply response. The small energy trade surplus
is likely to last for the next five years since energy prices are projected to remain high over
the medium term but it would eventually turn negative in a not too distant future given
Tunisia’s limited hydrocarbon reserves and growing energy consumption.
7.
The main risks to the outlook are essentially related to the international
environment and developments in the hydrocarbon sector. On the downside, economic
activity could record a more pronounced slowdown if growth in the EU were to decelerate
further or if the technical problems that have hampered domestic hydrocarbon production in
the first quarter of 2008 are not rapidly resolved. Furthermore, rising energy and food prices
and the growing liquidity resulting from more sizeable capital inflows (particularly FDI)
could complicate monetary policy and fuel inflationary pressures. On the upside, the planned
FDI-financed large scale projects, mainly in real estate, could further boost growth, although
there is considerable uncertainty about the effective amount that would be invested since
these projects will be carried out in several phases and completion will depend on
profitability. Two such projects, originating from countries in the Gulf region, have already
begun and could attract up to $20 billion in investment over the next 20 years.
8.
The medium-term outlook remains favorable with growth projected at above
6 percent sustained by strong FDI. Prudent monetary and fiscal policies should bring
inflation back to its historic range of 2−3 percent and maintain debt-to-GDP ratios on a
downward trend.

B. Macroeconomic Policies
9.
Discussions centered on the policy mix that would support growth while keeping
inflation in check, preserving fiscal sustainability, and ensuring external stability in an
environment of rising international fuel and food prices and excess liquidity.

9
Fiscal policy
10.
The authorities intend to maintain the fiscal deficit within the 2008 budget target
of 3 percent of GDP, without reducing public investment. Despite the sizeable increase in
domestic prices of petroleum products (107.4 percent increase since 2003), rising
international energy and food prices have increased subsidies significantly⎯direct and
indirect fuel and food subsidies are estimated at 7.3 percent of GDP for 2008, with indirect
subsidies accounting for 4.1 percent of GDP (assuming an average price of oil of $116.5 a
barrel). The authorities expect that the latter will be offset by increases in both tax and nontax
revenues owing to three main factors: (a) higher hydrocarbon production; (b) sustained
economic activity; and (c) enhanced efficiency of the tax administration.
11.
The authorities have reiterated their intention to persevere with fiscal
consolidation and further reduce public debt. They are well aware that petroleum reserves
may prove insufficient to maintain the level of subsidies over the long term, particularly in
light of the need to free up fiscal space to address growing demographic pressures. The
government intends to rationalize further current spending, including by phasing out
subsidies for petroleum products by 2011 as envisaged in the XIth Plan. With respect to food
subsidies, the authorities have taken steps to ensure better control of expenditures and boost
agricultural production. They are also planning their restructuring over the medium term.
However, they underscored that social stability considerations will determine the speed of
reforms.
12.
Reforms aimed at strengthening the efficiency of the tax and customs
administration continue. Specifically, a new customs code was promulgated, a Large
Taxpayer Unit was established, and the modernization of the IT system for the tax
administration progresses with the development of e-filing.
Monetary and exchange rate policy
13.
The authorities are mindful of the importance of curbing inflation. The BCT has
so far contained inflation mainly through open market operations, liquidity auctions, and the
required reserves ratio. It is considering remunerating required reserves so as to mitigate the
cost imposed on banks. So far, the BCT has been reluctant to raise its key policy interest rate
for fear of weakening growth and employment.
14.
The BCT is developing additional monetary policy instruments to address
persistent excess liquidity. As a result of the BCT’s persistent liquidity mopping operations,
its stock of treasury securities has dwindled since mid-2006, thereby limiting its ability to
manage liquidity going forward. Indeed, since September 2007, the BCT relied mainly on

10
deposit auctions and required reserves ratio to
control liquidity. In view of increasing excess
liquidity, the BCT is considering expanding the
range of instruments for liquidity management,
including issuing BCT debt certificates and
implementing mechanisms for foreign exchange
swaps.

its human resources and developing its analytical
capacity. It relies increasingly on indirect monetary instruments within the current broad
money targeting framework and a de facto pegged exchange rate. While the latter limits the
effectiveness of monetary policy, the BCT retains largely control over monetary policy
because of the still relatively closed capital account. The BCT is gradually decreasing its
interventions in the foreign exchange market, consistent with its medium-term objective of a
floating exchange rate. Its interventions have declined by more than half, from 17.3 percent
of the total volume of transactions on the spot market in 2003 to 7 percent in the first five
months of 2008, and most of these interventions are for liquidity management purposes. The
BCT’s operations on the foreign exchange market are largely sterilized and essentially
represent its transactions on behalf of the government. The BCT also plans to eventually
eliminate its current practice of posting the exchange rate daily. Regarding the indexation of
banks’ balance sheet to the money market interest rate, the authorities concur that it hampers
the development of the money market, restrict the flexibility of monetary policy, and shift
interest rate risk to consumers and investors, who are least equipped to manage it.

16.
The exchange rate is broadly aligned with its fundamentals and the authorities’
policies are consistent with external stability. The depreciation in the real effective
exchange rate (REER) over the recent years has been driven by persistent negative terms of
trade shocks and greater trade openness, particularly in the context of the association
agreement with the EU (Box 2).
C. Financial Sector Issues
17.
A sound banking system is crucial for enhancing the economy’s resilience and
achieving high and sustained growth. Thus, the authorities place a high priority on further
strengthening the banking sector. Bank performance improved significantly in 2007: banking
activity and profitability increased; the ratio of nonperforming loans (NPLs) to total loans
declined, largely accounted for by the proactive management of such claims; and the
provisioning ratio improved.

11

1970–2007, 2000=100
factors, while the external sustainability
250
approach requires estimating the “appropriate”
200
net foreign asset position to be stabilized.
The CGER results above are complemented by
a more refined analysis based on a country
specific equilibrium REER relationship for
Tunisia. There is a cointegration relationship
between the REER, the labor productivity
differential with respect to trading partners
(prod), terms of trade (tt), and the trade
openness indicator (open):
reer = 7.55 + 1.13 prod + 0.46 tt – 1.15 open
(-15.2) (-5.8)
(-4.9) (7.8)
The estimated coefficients have the expected
sign and are significant (t-stats are in brackets).
The results suggest a very small gap
(0.5 percent) between the REER and its
equilibrium level. Therefore, the depreciation in
the REER over the past five years is an
equilibrium phenomenon, linked to persistent
negative terms of trade shocks and greater trade
openness.

Competitiveness indicators do not show evidence of any significant misalignment either. The ULC-based
REER has appreciated in the recent period, driven mostly by relatively high unit labor costs in Tunisia.
Moreover, the economy is characterized by declining market shares for exports, and structural trade and current
account deficits⎯respectively, 9.2 percent and 2.9 percent of GDP for the 2000–07 average.

1/ Preliminary.

18.
The still relatively high NPLs ratio hampers growth through higher financing
costs of investments and delays the full integration of the domestic financial system to
international financial markets. The authorities are confident that they will meet their dual
objectives for 2009 of reducing the NPLs ratio to 15 percent and raising the ratio of
provisions to NPLs to 70 percent. Regarding potential risks associated with large-scale
projects financed by foreign investors, the authorities indicated that the implementation of
these projects carry little risk for the banking system’s soundness since about 90 percent of
the financing will be from abroad. However, once built, these projects will be sold to
domestic and foreign investors who will likely need at least partial domestic financing. The
authorities will be monitoring closely developments in the banking sector and have already
tightened prudential regulation on the purchase of real estate. In particular, they noted that
long-term loans extended to the acquisition of real estate units associated with these projects
will need to be backed by assets of same duration.
19.
The reform of the banking sector is continuing with the recent privatization of
another bank⎯Banque Tuniso-Koweitienne⎯the improvement in quality of service, and the
preparations for Basel II. In addition, a number of steps have been taken to give banks greater
flexibility and broaden the scope of their activity. In particular, the requirement that banks
transfer their end-of-day foreign exchange balances to the BCT (nivellement) should be
abolished over the next few months. There are plans to delegate to banks the authority to
quote and execute transactions involving exchange rate and interest rate hedging instruments,
as well as to lengthen the maturity of such instruments. Listed credit institutions are no

13
longer limited by a cap on their foreign borrowing. However, the Tunisian banking sector—
with about twenty banks for a relatively small market—remains fragmented and the small
size of banks impedes the exploitation of important economies of scale.
D. Other Issues
20.
The Tunisian economy continues to deepen its global and regional integration.
Tunisia is pursuing trade liberalization, particularly in the context of the association
agreement with the EU that culminated in free trade in industrial products in 2008.
Negotiations focusing on agricultural goods and on services are in progress. Tunisia is also
further streamlining tariffs under the Most Favored Nation regime, having decreased the
average tariff rate from 28.8 percent in 2007 to 25.3 percent in 2008. Intra-regional trade—
although still relatively low—is benefiting from the Agadir Agreement, entered into force in
March 2007 to liberalize trade between member countries (Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, and
Tunisia). Tunisia is also actively engaged in regional integration; it organized the third
annual conference on this issue in November 2007, focusing on the role of the private sector
in regional integration.
21.
Capital account liberalization advances gradually. Recent measures include the
easing of constraints affecting investment outflows from Tunisia abroad and participations of
residents to capital of nonresident corporations based in Tunisia. Furthermore, nonresidents
investing in industrial and tourism zones no longer need an exchange authorization.
22.
Tunisia has recently made significant progress in improving the business
climate. The new law on economic initiative, promulgated in December 2007, is designed to
foster business creation by simplifying administrative procedures, facilitating financing, and
reducing the tax burden. In addition, customs formalities are being comprehensively
streamlined, with the total holding period for merchandise being reduced from nine days in
2006 to approximately six days. The goal is to reach three days in 2009. Finally, recent
advances in tax administration have improved the quality of services for taxpayers.
23.
The implementation of the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes
on Anti Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)
progresses. Tunisia is pursuing its efforts to strengthen its AML/CFT system according to
the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)’s report, with particular
attention given to training in the financial sector. A follow-up assessment will take place
during the Plenary Meeting of the Middle East & North Africa FATF in April 2009.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
24.
Tunisia’s economy continues to demonstrate remarkable resilience but
important challenges lie ahead. The growth acceleration in 2007 is impressive and, if
sustained, it could make a significant dent in the unemployment rate, which remains
relatively high, especially among young people. The outlook remains favorable. Buoyant FDI

14
should support growth but close monitoring of potential risks in the form of government
contingent liabilities or credit risk for banks is warranted. This is particularly relevant for
large real estate projects. However, near-term risks are mainly associated with the external
environment and the immediate challenge is to limit the impact of rising international fuel
and food prices in a way that does not erode Tunisia’s medium-term macroeconomic
position.
25.
Staff endorses the authorities’ decision to maintain the fiscal deficit within the
2008 budget target of 3 percent of GDP, which would likely entail additional adjustments
in domestic petroleum prices and tight control over current spending, including the wage bill.
Closer coordination with the central bank is advisable to allow a timely monetary policy
response, if needed.
26.
Medium-term fiscal sustainability will require reforming the subsidy system. The
level of subsidies is not sustainable given Tunisia’s limited hydrocarbon reserves and the
persistently high fuel and food prices. While staff encourages the authorities to continue their
policies for energy conservation and promotion of agricultural production, the current
subsidy system needs to be replaced by a more targeted safety net over the medium term in
order to maintain fiscal sustainability, decrease the country’s vulnerability to shocks, and
create the necessary fiscal space for additional social and infrastructure spending.
27.
The BCT’s restrictive monetary policy stance has so far been broadly
appropriate, with inflation starting to decline. However, if inflationary pressures were to
intensify, it would be necessary to raise the BCT’s key policy interest rate⎯an instrument
that has proven its effectiveness in the recent past⎯given that growth has still significant
momentum. The mission supports the BCT’s recent efforts to examine the various options for
managing the structural surplus liquidity in the Tunisian financial system, including the
option to issue central bank debt certificates.
28.
Staff encourages the authorities to continue putting in place the building blocks
for the planned inflation-targeting framework, including by deindexing banks’ balance
sheets to the money market interest rate, increasing exchange rate flexibility, deepening
money and foreign exchange markets, and ensuring that the banking sector is prepared to
manage greater exchange rate and interest rate risk. The BCT’s effort to refine its forecasting
tools so as to better anticipate inflationary pressures and take timely action should be
intensified.
29.
The exchange rate is broadly aligned with its fundamentals and the authorities’
policies are consistent with external stability. The exchange rate policy should remain
anchored by the authorities’ medium-term objective of a floating exchange rate. Considering
current global inflationary pressures, enhanced exchange rate flexibility could help reduce
imported inflation.

15
30.
The balance sheet of the banking sector continues to strengthen, owing to the
authorities’ proactive policies and strong economic performance. Attaining or even
surpassing the authorities’ dual objective⎯of reducing the NPLs ratio to 15 percent and
raising the ratio of provisions to NPLs to 70 percent—would further strengthen the banking
system’s resilience, particularly in light of the gradual opening of the capital account.
Regarding market structure, further consolidation could reduce cost and improve productivity
through economies of scale. Staff supports the authorities’ objective of implementing the
Basel II system by end-2009 and achieving full compliance with AML/CFT international
standards over the medium term.
31.
The current financial crisis in the developed countries offers useful lessons
regarding banking system consolidation. In particular, it is important to continuously adapt
the regulatory and supervisory frameworks to reflect financial sector developments, collect
timely data for adequate supervision, and ensure that contingency plans are in place in case
of a systemic failure of the financial system.
32.
Staff supports Tunisia’s pragmatic approach to trade and financial integration.
The achievement of zero tariffs on industrial goods with the EU this year is an important
milestone and Tunisia’s active participation in the regional integration effort sponsored by
the Fund is welcome. Further simplification and reduction of most-favored nation tariffs are
needed in order to prevent trade diversion and enhance geographic diversification of trade.
Staff supports the authorities’ gradual approach to full convertibility of the dinar.
33.
The business climate continues to improve. Further liberalization of the services
sector and the ongoing reform of the tax and customs administrations should further promote
domestic and foreign investment.
34.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12 month
cycle.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in
dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate, rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total
external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency
(e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both noninterest current account and nondebt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and nondebt inflows in percent of
GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

Exchange Rate Arrangement and Exchange System
Tunisia accepted the obligations of Article VIII Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 effective
January 6, 1993, and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on executing
payments and transfers on current international transactions, except that Tunisia maintains
(a) a multiple currency practice resulting from honoring exchange rate guarantees extended
prior to August 1988 to development banks, which will automatically expire after maturity of
existing commitments (total loans covered by these guarantees amount to about $20 million);
and (b) certain restrictions relating to Iraq and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and
Montenegro), pursuant to UN Security Council Resolutions, which are subject to notification
to the Fund in accordance with Decision 144 (52/51).
Since March 1, 1994, the market rates are determined in an interbank foreign exchange
market. On June 30, 2008, the interbank rate of the dinar vis-à-vis the dollar was
$1=TD 1.1620, equivalent to SDR 1= TD 1.8983.
Article IV Consultation

ANNEX II. FINANCIAL RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of July 1, 2008)
1.
The World Bank’s portfolio in Tunisia has a total of 16 active operations and
120 closed loans, of which 10 International Development Agency (IDA) credits amounting to
$75.2 million net of cancellations. Cumulative net commitments represent $5.3 billion. Of
this total, $4.1 billion has been repaid. Net commitments for the 16 current operations
amount to about $0.6 billion.
2.
The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was approved by the Board on June 3, 2004.
It proposes to assist the Government of Tunisia in addressing three key challenges:
(a) strengthen the business environment to support the development of a more competitive,
internationally integrated private sector and improve competitiveness of the Tunisian
economy; (b) enhance skills and employability of graduates and labor force in a knowledge
economy; and (c) improve the quality of social services through enhanced efficiency of
public expenditures. The CAS progress report was approved by the Board in August 2007. It
notes that, while the CAS is overall on track and remains fully relevant for Tunisia’s key
development challenges, the low level of private investment constitutes a major concern,
threatening growth and job creation. A new CAS will be prepared in FY09.
3.
Bank lending is a mix of long-term investments in infrastructure and social sector
financing, and development policy lending to support reforms at the sectoral and
macroeconomic reforms. Recent loan includes an additional financing of $6.0 million
approved on August 28, 2007 for the Export Development II project to help finance the
scaled-up activities associated with increased demand for the second export market access
fund. Projects under early stage of preparation are the following: a Water Sector
Investment II, an Energy Efficiency, a Community Based Integrated Rural Development
project, and an Integration and Competitiveness Development Policy Loan (following the
Economic Competitiveness Adjustment Loan IV).
4.
Despite the fact that the quality of the portfolio is satisfactory, cumbersome
procurement procedures and slow implementation pace are affecting the portfolio
performance. An internal portfolio review was undertaken in January 2008. This was
followed by a joint update of the 2005 Country Portfolio Performance Review action plan
designed to address the key constraints identified and is being implemented jointly by the
Bank and counterpart teams. Several procurement workshops are being conducted as part of
the action plan.
5.
Several Economic and Sector Work (ESW) and technical assistance (TA) outputs to
inform and support policy choices and reforms were produced over the last two years. The
recent ESW delivered includes a study on Tunisia’s Global Integration, identifying reforms
to boost growth in services and manufacturing through greater global integration; a report on
Employment, Skills Development, and Social Protection; a Small and Medium Enterprise
Study on technical centers and industrial land management; and a study on cost assessment
of water degradation. Ongoing work includes a Development Policy Review (DPR) that
assesses Tunisia’s key challenges and policy priorities in the years ahead. This DPR aims at

6
providing an analytical basis for the next Country Assistance Strategy (2009) and at
providing input to the 11th Plan (2007–11) mid-term review. The Bank is also currently
working on a Small and Medium Enterprise Finance Policy Note, a Review of Energy
Management Policy, a Water and Wastewater Strategy, and a regional study on the
constraints to cross border investment and trade in the Maghreb.
6.
Bank’s technical assistance activities include: the Tariff Reform and Trade Policy
Modeling, the Skill Development/Social Insurance, the Budget Management and
Performance Based Budgeting (a multi-year Programmatic Economic and Sector Work), the
Development of Logistics Services and Infrastructure, the Assessment of Hospital
Performance, the Use of Country Systems in Environment and in Safeguards.

ANNEX III. STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Economic and financial data are adequate for surveillance. Tunisia subscribed to the
SDDS in June 2001 and its metadata are posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin
Board (DSBB). A data ROSC was published in August 2006, following a mission that took
place in April 2005.
Real Sector Statistics
2.
Data on GDP by economic sector are disseminated at current and constant prices.
Work is well advanced toward the full adoption of the System of National Accounts 1993
(1993 SNA). Statistical techniques are adequate for the annual accounts but need some
refinement for the quarterly estimates. Source data for the quarterly national accounts could
be further diversified to improve coverage. Currently, an outdated base year (1990) is used
for the constant price series. A new series using 2000 as base year is expected to be released
in the near future.
3.
Data provided for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS) on real
sector developments is satisfactory and most data are reported in a timely manner, although
export and import price and volume indices are reported with a long lag. Data on
employment, unemployment, and wages should be collected and reported on a more frequent
basis.
Government Finance Statistics
4.
In addition to the information reported in the SDDS, government finance statistics
(GFS) are collected by the staff at the time of the Article IV consultation mission. Regarding
data for publication, the annual statement of budgetary central government and consolidated
central government operations on a cash basis through 2007 have been reported to STA and
are both published in the IFS and Government Finance Statistics Yearbook 2007 and
disseminated electronically. The consolidated central government covers budgetary central
government, a number of administrative, economic, and social government agencies, and
three social security funds. Tunisia does not report monthly or quarterly data for
dissemination in the IFS.
External Sector Statistics
5.
Statistics for balance of payments (BOP) and international investment position (IIP)
are compiled by the Central Bank of Tunisia (BCT), following the methodology of the fifth
edition of the Balance of Payments Manual, (BPM5). The BOP statistics are prepared on a
quarterly basis and the IIP on an annual basis, complying with SDDS requirements.
However, Tunisia does not report quarterly data for redissemination in IMF publications. The
BCT issues preliminary monthly statistics, mostly prepared on the basis of banks’ settlements
with nonresidents. BOP statistics are generally adequate for annual surveillance, although

9
greater detail on the financial account would be desirable. However, the 2005 data ROSC
mission noted that remittances of Tunisian workers abroad are classified as income instead of
current transfers in national publications (while they are correctly classified in data reported
to STA), and that reinvested earnings of foreign direct investments are not recorded in the
balance of payments. As an SDDS subscriber, Tunisia reports reserves data following the
International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity—Operational Guidelines (Reserves
Template) since June 2001.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
Monetary statistics compiled by the BCT are broadly based on the 1984 Guide to Money and
Banking Statistics in International Financial Statistics. Although monetary statistics meet
SDDS requirements, there is room for improvement. For example, according to the findings
of the data ROSC mission of April 2005, banks’ claims on the rest of domestic sector (other
than central government and financial corporations) are not fully sectorized and monetary
gold is not valued at the current market price. The BCT has initiated a plan to migrate to the
methodology recommended in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (2000). The
BCT reported to STA test data on the Standardized Report Form for central bank (Form 1SR)
for December 2004 and October 2005. To facilitate publication in the International Financial
Statistics-Supplement, the BCT needs to report to STA the Standardized Report Forms (at
least forms 1SR, 2SR, and 5SR) on a regular monthly basis.
Tunisia is one of the countries that participated in the pilot coordinated compilation exercise
for financial soundness indicators (FSIs) conducted by STA. Tunisia’s FSI data as of end2005 along with metadata are now available to the public through the Fund's website
(http://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/fsi/part.asp?iso=TUN).

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with Tunisia
On August 6, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Tunisia.1
Background
Tunisia’s sound economic policies and pragmatic approach to structural reforms continue to bear
fruit, as evidenced by strong growth and improved social indicators. Real GDP growth averaged
5 percent a year while the macroeconomic and financial position strengthened substantially during
the past decade.
Tunisia has so far weathered relatively well the difficult international environment. Real GDP growth
increased from 5.5 percent in 2006 to 6.3 percent in 2007⎯a record over the last
decade⎯underpinned by strong performance of agriculture, energy, manufacturing and the services
sectors. On the demand side, vigorous exports and investment powered the growth acceleration.
Inflation has picked up, due mainly to rising international fuel and food prices and, to a lesser extent,
growing liquidity in the banking system reflecting increasing foreign direct investment (FDI). Year-onyear inflation reached 6 percent in April 2008 before pulling back to 4.9 percent in June 2008. The
Central Bank of Tunisia (BCT) responded by tightening monetary policy starting in the second half
of 2007.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
The fiscal deficit was kept within the 2007 budget target of 3 percent of GDP. Revenue exceeded
expectations owing mainly to stronger oil revenue—notably from oil companies’ higher profits due to
surging oil prices and increased domestic production. The additional revenue offset expenditure
overruns mainly caused by rising direct food and fuel subsidies. Continued fiscal consolidation and
privatization receipts further reduced public debt-to-GDP ratio to about 51 percent at end-2007.
The current account deficit widened due to declining terms of trade, but the significant increase in
FDI inflows increased reserves to over $8½ billion, largely sufficient to cover short-term liabilities.
Bank performance improved significantly in 2007, including banking activity, profitability, and
prudential indicators. The ratio of nonperforming loans (NPLs) to total loans declined from
24 percent in 2003 to 17.3 percent in 2007, largely accounted for by the proactive management of
such claims, while the provisions-to-NPLs ratio increased from 43.1 percent to 53.8 percent.
The short-term outlook is encouraging despite the challenging international environment. In 2008,
real GDP growth is projected to decelerate moderately to 5.5 percent. Inflation would remain around
5 percent if international prices taper off and monetary policy continues to be restrictive. High fuel
and food prices are expected to widen the current account deficit to 3.5 percent of GDP. The fiscal
deficit is projected to remain at 3 percent of GDP, owing to buoyant revenue, notably from the
hydrocarbon sector. The medium-term outlook remains favorable with growth projected at above
6 percent sustained by strong FDI. Risks to the outlook are essentially related to the international
environment.

Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the authorities for the notable resilience and continued strong
performance of the Tunisian economy, which has been founded on prudent and forward-looking
economic policies and market-oriented structural reforms. The outlook remains favorable, with
buoyant FDI supporting growth, although there are downside risks related mostly to the global
economic turbulence. Directors considered that the key immediate challenge confronting the
authorities will be to address the pressures arising from the global food and fuel price increases
while maintaining macroeconomic sustainability. Over the medium term, employment creation
and income growth will be key to improving economic welfare in Tunisia.
Directors commended the authorities’ commitment to fiscal prudence, which will remain
essential for lowering the public debt. They endorsed the authorities’ decision to contain the
fiscal deficit within the 2008 budget target, which will require tight control over current spending
and likely additional adjustments to domestic petroleum prices. They noted that buoyant fiscal
revenues, particularly from the hydrocarbon sector, have accommodated the gradual passthrough of international oil and food price increases to domestic prices under the current
subsidy system. Directors noted, however, that the current subsidy system is not sustainable,
and suggested its replacement with a targeted safety net for the most vulnerable groups that
would better support medium-term fiscal sustainability, reduce the country’s vulnerability to
shocks, and create the fiscal space for additional social and infrastructure expenditures. In this
context, they welcomed the authorities’ intention in the XIth Plan to phase out subsidies for
petroleum products by 2011 and to ensure better control of expenditures for food subsidies.

3
Directors supported the restrictive monetary stance of the BCT. They recommended that the
authorities stand ready to increase the BCT’s key policy interest rate if inflationary pressures
intensify, given that growth still has significant momentum. They supported the BCT’s efforts to
manage persistent excess liquidity in the financial system, and to continue to build an inflationtargeting framework for monetary policy.
Directors considered that the exchange rate of the Tunisian dinar is broadly aligned with
fundamentals and that the authorities’ policies are consistent with external stability. Some
Directors saw merit in an accelerated transition toward the authorities’ commendable objectives
of a floating exchange rate and an inflation-targeting framework.
Directors welcomed the continued strengthening of the banking sector’s performance, with
greater profitability, a decline in nonperforming loans, and improved loan-loss provisioning.
Further strengthening of the banking sector should remain a high priority as the authorities
continue to gradually open up the capital account. They welcomed the potential growth and
employment benefits of the large FDI-financed projects, but counseled prudence with respect to
real estate projects in particular, which may create a credit risk for the banking sector and
contingent liabilities for the government. Directors supported the authorities’ objective of
implementing the Basel II system by end-2009 and achieving full compliance with international
AML/CFT standards over the medium term.
Directors welcomed the steps being taken by the authorities to deepen the global and regional
integration of the Tunisian economy. They praised the authorities for their pragmatic approach
to trade and financial integration, and noted the recent important milestone of achieving bilateral
free trade in industrial goods with the European Union. They looked forward to further
simplification and reduction of tariffs on a most-favored-nation basis.
Directors welcomed the steps aimed at further improving the business climate. They looked
forward to further progress in liberalizing the services sector and reforming the tax and customs
administration, in order to promote domestic and foreign investment.

Statement by Mohammad Mojarrad
Executive Director for Tunisia
August 6, 2008

We thank staff for their well-focused report and convey our Tunisian authorities’
appreciation for the continuous excellent cooperation with the Fund.
Directors may recall that last year’s consultation was centered on the authorities'
medium-term strategy for the period 2007-2011. Staff's main recommendations for the
success of this strategy, in the context of the ongoing integration into the world economy, are
to maintain fiscal consolidation, strengthen the monetary and exchange rate framework, and
to address the remaining weaknesses in the financial system to enhance the economy's
flexibility and resilience.
The 2008 Article IV consultation was appropriately focused on the immediate risks to
the short-term outlook from rising fuel and food prices. It would allow staff and,
hopefully, the Board after today's discussion to recognize the authorities' growing ability to
better manage emerging risks without deviating from their medium-term objectives of further
improving employment and living standards while safeguarding financial stability, and to
confirm the economy's resilience to shocks.
The authorities agree with staff conclusion that Tunisia has so far weathered relatively
well the difficult international environment. In 2007, GDP growth accelerated to
6.3 percent, the budget deficit was kept at 3 percent, and the debt and financial sector
indicators were further improved. However, Tunisia, like many other countries, observed a
pick-up in inflation due to the rise in international fuel and food prices.
In the area of fiscal policy, the authorities will continue to be guided by the objective of
converging public debt indicators to emerging market economies standard. Thus, in
spite of the sharp rise in commodities and fuel prices, the authorities intend to keep the fiscal
deficit within the 2008 budget target of 3 percent.
In the energy sector, the authorities have been implementing since 2006 a
comprehensive strategy centered on regular increase in domestic petroleum retail prices
(more than doubling since 2003), proactive substitution policy to encourage the use of
alternative and renewable energy, introduction of a mandatory energy audit in the industrial
sector to promote efficiency, and extensive public awareness campaigns focused on the
importance of energy conservation and the burden of energy subsidies on the budget. These
efforts, coupled with an increase in production, are paying off, with subsidies stabilizing

2
around 1 percent of GDP in the last three years and the energy trade balance moving to
surplus in 2007. Barring further deterioration in the international oil markets, the authorities
remain committed to phasing out petroleum subsidies by 2011.
With regard to food subsidies, the authorities made a deliberate decision to refrain
from implementing the annual price adjustments so as to facilitate public acceptance of
the successive adjustments of petroleum prices and preserve social stability. They agree with
staff that the level of subsidies is not sustainable and are working on a medium-term reform
program to better rationalize subsidies and reduce its burden on the budget. In this
connection, the authorities have already stepped up controls and targeting of subsidies and
implementation of policies to promote agricultural production. The authorities look forward
to Board consideration of the FAD paper on Government Subsidies—Agenda for Future
Reforms.
The Central Bank of Tunisia (BCT) is carefully following price developments and is
pursuing a tight monetary stance since mid-2007. The BCT considers that the two recent
increases in reserves requirements are producing their intended effect. After peaking at
6 percent in April 2008, year-on-year inflation has been on a declining trend in May and June
(5.3 and 4.9 percent, respectively). For 2008, staff project inflation to stabilize around 5
percent. The BCT will continue to adopt a tight bias in the conduct of monetary policy to
better control excess liquidity and to keep inflation under control; it does not exclude
increasing its policy rate, if circumstances warrant.
The BCT concurs with staff assessment that the exchange rate of the dinar is broadly
aligned with its fundamentals, and the authorities' policies are consistent with external
stability. In this connection, the authorities appreciate the workshop organized by staff on
the CGER methodologies to estimate equilibrium real exchange rate. Going forward, the
BCT will pursue its gradual move toward inflation targeting, floating exchange rate, and
capital account liberalization.
The authorities are confident that their strategy to improve soundness of the banking
sector is on track. The dual objectives for 2009 to reduce NPLs to 15 percent of total loans
and increase the ratio of provisions to NPLs to 70 percent, which is broadly in line with the
recommendations of the FSAP update, is within reach after the significant progress achieved
since 2003. The authorities agree with staff that the level of NPLs is still relatively high.
They are working with interested banks to set up restructuring plans to boost their capital
base and are happy to report that Société Générale has agreed to participate in a significant
restructuring of its subsidiary (Union Internationale de Banques) that will address the bank's
capital needs and allow it to be in conformity with all regulatory ratios.
