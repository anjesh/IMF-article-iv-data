STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. A mining boom is driving an economic recovery, as the terms of trade have
risen to historic highs. The recovery is uneven, however, with those sectors not directly
benefiting from high commodity prices coming under pressure from an elevated
exchange rate. Inflation has begun to rise as the output gap closes.
Focus. Discussions centered on the economic policy mix to manage near-term risks
and make the most of the mining boom over the medium term.
Near-term macroeconomic policy mix. While recent global financial market volatility
has increased uncertainty about the outlook, further increases in the policy interest rate
are likely to be needed to contain inflation if the recovery remains on track. An exit
from budget deficits is needed to increase fiscal space and support monetary policy.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ commitment to return to a budget surplus by 2012/13,
despite the negative impact of recent natural disasters.
Medium-term fiscal policy. The mining boom provides an opportunity to put
Commonwealth government finances in a stronger position to deal with future shocks
and long-term pressures from aging and rising health care costs. Therefore, staff
recommended targeting a budget surplus of more than 1 percent of GDP, on average,
for the period beyond 2013/14, while the mining boom continues to support growth.
Tax and structural reforms. Making the most of the mining boom will require reforms
to increase labor supply and productivity. The authorities have taken a number of tax
and other reform measures, but further steps are needed to remove inefficient taxes
and improve work and investment incentives.
Financial stability. Staff emphasized the importance of continued intensive bank
supervision to maintain financial stability. Staff also recommended considering the
merits of higher capital requirements for the systematically important domestic banks
and encouraging banks to reduce further their short-term external borrowing.

The good performance can also be attributed

160

to a healthy banking system, a flexible
exchange rate, and robust demand for
commodities from Asia, especially China.
2.

A recovery is now being driven by a

mining boom. Real GDP growth picked up to
2¾ percent in 2010 with private demand and
commodity exports beginning to take over
from public demand as the main drivers
(Table 1, Figure 1). Business profits have risen,
especially in mining, as demand for
commodities has pushed the terms of trade to
60 year highs (text figure).1 In the first quarter
of 2011, however, activity was disrupted by
cyclones and floods in Queensland and
Western Australia that reduced output,
especially exports of coal and iron ore (which
comprise about ⅓ of Australia’s exports)
(Figure 2). This contributed to a 0.9 percent fall
in real GDP in the first quarter (seasonally
adjusted, quarter-on-quarter). Real GDP

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT AUSTRALIA

Box 1. House Price Assessment
Real house prices rose by 130 percent in the last 20 years
in Australia—faster than most comparators. However, unlike
many comparators, Australia’s house price increase growth
has occurred in the context of strong growth in population
and household income and relatively subdued growth in
housing supply. As of June 2011, real house prices have fallen
by 5 percent (year-on-year) since the peak in mid-2010.
House prices appear overvalued by about 10–15 percent
as of June 2011, using a combination of simple metrics and
models:





The price-to-income ratio suggests an overvaluation of
about 15 percent compared to its long-term average (text
table and figure). This is based on the Australian Property
Monitors data which include all residential property
nationwide, including non-urban areas.1
The price-to-rent ratio also suggests an overvaluation of
about 15 percent. This is based on data from the Real
Estate Institute of Australia and RP Data Rismark, which
includes houses and apartments.

These simple ratios, however, have shortcomings in
assessing misalignments. The ratios ignore structural
changes such as the fall in nominal mortgage interest rates
since the 1990s and do not take account of strong population
growth or the increasing scarcity of land close to urban
centers. Moreover, the 20-year average used as a benchmark
is an imperfect proxy for the equilibrium house price.
Model-based estimates indicate that house prices are
overvalued by about 10 percent, from a medium-term
perspective.2 The model uses a nationwide series that covers
all residential properties (the RP Data Rismark) and takes into
account demographics, mortgage interest rates, and the terms
of trade as a proxy for future income, in line with Tumbarello
and Wang (IMF WP/10/291).3 The model suggests that a
10 percent fall in the terms of trade could result in an
8 percent fall in real house prices over the medium term.

The price-to-income and price-to-rent ratios, according to the OECD
database, suggest a much larger overvaluation of 25–35 percent
compared with the average for the past 20 years. However, these
measures are based on the Australia Bureau of Statistics (ABS) series
which has several shortcomings. The ABS house price series covers
only detached houses in capital cities, where prices have increased
faster than in non-urban areas, and excludes apartments and row
houses. The ABS price-to-rent ratio series includes only rents for
detached houses. A broader measure that includes apartments—
which are a growing share of the housing market—shows much
higher rental yields.

Box 2. Budgetary Institutions Supporting Fiscal Consolidation1
Australia’s strong budgetary institutions
have operated successfully both in times of
fiscal strength and stress. Australia is an
international pioneer in many areas of
budgetary reform including: the development
of three-year forward estimates, the
Expenditure Review Committee which reviews
expenditure proposals, the introduction of
accrual accounting and outcome frameworks,
and the publication of an Intergenerational
Report. This Box discusses some enhancements
to the quality of existing institutions that would
support fiscal consolidation.
Staff welcomes the proposal to create a
Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO).
Comparable institutions have been established
in Canada and the United Kingdom with the
objectives of improving fiscal transparency and
providing an independent view on the
government’s fiscal policy. The Australian PBO’s
proposed functions include costing political
parties’ election commitments and providing
independent analysis to parliament on fiscal
policy and the financial implications of policy
proposals. While most of the focus has been on
its role in costing election commitments, it is
equally important that the PBO develop its
capacity to provide independent fiscal analysis.
_____________________________

A significant portion of the Australian
Government budget is subject to a greater
degree of lock-in, making fiscal
consolidation potentially more difficult. Up
to 30 percent of expenditure is approved by the
parliament each year through the annual
budget process. The remainder is subject to
“special” or standing appropriations where
authority for expenditure continues beyond the
three-year estimates period until it is annulled
or amended by the parliament. This includes
most entitlements and benefits programs, such
as pensions, but also some other discretionary
spending. The balance between “special” and
“annual” appropriations should be reviewed,
with the aim of reducing the share of
expenditure under “special” appropriations.
Budget decisions should be focused on the
annual budget to uphold fiscal discipline.
The government has also taken decisions on
spending and saving proposals outside the
annual budget process. While this approach
provides flexibility and helps maintain
discipline, it does not improve the
government’s ability to make strategic
decisions, including on trade offs and
reallocations across departments. This is best
achieved when decisions are made in the
context of the annual budget.

AUSTRALIA 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 3. Carbon Pricing and the Emissions Trading Scheme
Australia plans to introduce a price on
carbon in July 2012. An Emissions Trading
Scheme (ETS) will be established to
progressively reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) and
other greenhouse gases to at least 5 percent
below year 2000 levels by 2020. Around 500
large emitting companies will be required to
purchase and surrender a permit for each
metric ton of emissions produced.
Initially the permit price will be fixed at
$A 23 per metric ton of CO2 equivalent, but
after July 2015 will be determined by market
trading. Permits will be allocated for free to
emissions-intensive and trade-exposed
industries and electricity generators to help
them transition to carbon pricing by assisting
them to meet part of their liability.
The ETS has a number of attractive features.
Pricing policies (emissions trading and
emissions taxes) are the most effective and
cost-effective policies for reducing emissions.
The ETS is comprehensive, covering major
industrial sources such as power generators
and gas producers. Emissions from fuel used in
light passenger-vehicles are not covered.
However, an effective carbon price will be
levied on fuel used in aviation, off-road, and by
some businesses through the fuel excise
system.

The majority of emissions allowances will be
auctioned. Estimates by the Australian Treasury
suggest that the sale of permits and application
of a carbon price will raise receipts of
$A 18.2 billion over the three years to 2014/15
(about 0.3 percent of annual GDP on average
for the three years). Treasury modeling shows
that the scheme would increase the level of the
Consumer Price Index by about 0.7 of a
percentage point in late 2012.
Low- and middle-income households will be
compensated through income tax cuts and
transfer payments. The tax free threshold will
be increased and welfare beneficiaries will be
assisted with the increase in the cost of living
associated with the scheme. Further assistance
will be given to businesses affected by the
scheme and to encourage investment in green
technology. Overall, the compensation exceeds
the revenue generated from the scheme. As a
result, an increase in the cash budget deficit of
about $A 4.1 billion is projected by the
Australian Treasury for the four years to
2014/15, which is less than about 0.1 percent of
annual GDP (on average for the four years).

Box 4. Australia’s Large Banks
Australia’s four large banks account for about
75 percent of total banking sector assets and more
than 80 percent of mortgage lending. Banking
concentration increased in the wake of the global financial
crisis, as the RMBS market became dislocated making it
harder for nonbank lenders to compete, two smaller banks
were taken over by two of the larger banks in 2008 (both
approved by Australia’s competition regulator), and several
foreign-owned banks exited the Australian markets.
The assets of the four large banks comprise about
180 percent of GDP, around the average for a selection
of advanced and emerging market economies (text
figure). Subsidiaries and branches of the four major banks
also control 90 percent of the assets of New Zealand’s
banking sector. Given their size, any distress among these
banks could have a sizable impact on the financial sector
and the real economy in both countries. Moreover, they
may be perceived by the markets as too big to fail, which
implies they could pose a potential fiscal liability.

Basel III will require banks to hold more and higherquality capital and introduces global liquidity and
funding standards. The Australian banks are making good
progress toward meeting these new requirements. Capital
adequacy has improved, and the quality of bank capital in
Australia is high, as it is mainly common equity. While the
headline ratio of common equity to risk-weighted assets is
lower than for other large banks, the risk-weighted assets
numbers are not directly comparable across countries (text
figure). APRA’s requirements for computing risk-weighted
assets likely imply that risk-weighted assets are higher than
for comparable banks in other countries. For example, staff
estimates suggest that if the Australian banks applied a
loss given default assumption for residential mortgages of
10 percent (the Basel II minimum), rather than the
20 percent minimum required by APRA, their common
equity to risk-weighted assets ratio would rise by almost
1 percentage point. APRA also makes other conservative
assumptions that increase risk-weighted assets.

Box 5. Australia’s Equilibrium Real Effective Exchange Rate
Staff estimates suggest an overvaluation of the
Australian real effective exchange rate by 10–
20 percent from a medium-term perspective. The
estimates, however, are subject to considerable
uncertainty, as shown by the wide range of the
confidence intervals (text figure). They are based on
the macroeconomic balance (MB) approach, the
equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach, and
the external sustainability (ES) approach. The value
of the currency has been boosted recently by cyclical
influences that are reflected in unusually wide
interest rate differentials between Australia and most
other advanced economies.1

The ERER estimates suggest an overvaluation
slightly higher than the MB approach. The model
estimates the equilibrium REER based on projections

suggests that in August 2011, the REER was
overvalued by 16 percent.

Tax and structural reforms are

required to make the most of the mining

economy that encourages labor force

include greater reliance on consumption and
land taxes, and a broadening of the proposed

including in the areas of education,
infrastructure, and business regulation would
enhance the economy’s capacity to adjust to
the structural changes taking place.
53.

While banks remain sound, the

authorities should continue to emphasize
intensive supervision, as banks may be
tempted to take on riskier strategies in an
environment of structurally lower credit
growth. We support APRA’s plans to undertake
stress tests incorporating disruptions to
funding markets. The authorities should also
consider the merits of higher capital
requirements in the context of discussions in
the Financial Stability Board and encourage

54.

The projected widening of the

current account deficit presents some risks.
Deficits, however, should be manageable as
they reflect, in large part, an increase in private
investment in the export sector. A projected
decline in national saving also contributes to
the widening of the deficit, which underlines
the need for fiscal consolidation.
55.

The exchange rate is overvalued by

10–20 percent, from a medium-term
perspective. However, part of the
overvaluation may dissipate over time with the
eventual tightening of policy rates by major
central banks.

Key Recommendations of the 2006 FSAP and Update on the Progress of Implementation1
Issue

Key
Recommendations

Progress of Implementation

Banking

Continue to ensure
strong risk
management
practices, including
through regular
stress testing.

 The Basel II framework has been implemented since January 2008,
with the four major banks (ANZ, Commonwealth Bank of Australia,
Westpac, and National Australia Bank) and Macquarie Bank approved to
adopt internal models for credit and operational risk. Stress testing is
regularly carried out by banks as part of their Internal Capital Adequacy
Assessment Process. As part of its supervisory activities, APRA thoroughly
assesses banks’ risk management practices and is proactive in integrating
these assessments into its supervisory stance. Credit quality in home and
commercial lending, and liquidity management, have been at the
forefront of supervision activity. APRA has placed emphasis on banks
having strong risk management practices in these areas. APRA has
conducted periodic stress tests of the major authorized deposit-taking
institutions (ADIs), with the most recent one being in 2010. These stress
tests were undertaken to assess the resilience of the banks to a severe
economic downturn and are part of an ongoing stress testing program.

Failure
Resolution
and Crisis
Management

Continue to develop
a formal process to
manage the failure of
individual institutions
and more widespread
crises.

 In October 2008, the government introduced a Financial Claims
Scheme (FCS), which provided protection for depositors of up to
$A 1 million in the event that an ADI failed. The cap will be reduced to
$A 250,000 per depositor, per institution, from February 2012 but will still
cover 99 percent of deposit accounts in full. The FCS also protects
policyholders of failed general insurers. The Council of Financial
Regulators signed an MoU on financial distress management in 2008,
formalizing what was already established in practice. It followed this with
the development of comprehensive guidance for the resolution of a
distressed ADI, covering a range of resolution options. This guidance is
routinely updated to take into account developments, such as, the lessons
the crisis management simulation exercise that was held in 2009 and the
passage of legislation in 2010 to enhance APRA’s crisis management
powers in relation to distressed banks and general insurers. In a crossborder resolution context, the Council agencies and the Reserve Bank of
New Zealand and the New Zealand Treasury have signed a Memorandum
of Cooperation and developed guidance on how the distress of a transTasman banking group may be managed.

Supervisory
Capacity

Ensure that the
supervisory agencies
have adequate
resources and
flexibility.

 In the 2007/08 Budget, APRA received additional funding over a fouryear period to improve its staff capabilities. In October 2008, to manage
issues associated with the global financial crisis, the government provided
additional funding to APRA of $A 45.5 million over four years. The
government continues to monitor APRA’s funding to ensure it remains
adequately resourced. The government has also enhanced APRA’s
independence by removing the requirement to obtain ministerial consent
before taking administrative actions. The Australian Securities and
Investments Commission (ASIC) received funding of $A 420.2 million in
2011–12 including additional funding of $A 28.8 million to support
ongoing GFC-related work and to support ASIC’s operations.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 43

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT AUSTRALIA

Key
Recommendations

Progress of Implementation

Cooperation
with New
Zealand
Regulators

Build on the progress
made within the
Trans-Tasman
Council on Banking
Supervision to
improve coordination
in crisis management.

 Legislative changes formalizing a requirement on regulators in the
two countries to be alert to each other’s interests in times of stress came
into force in both countries in December 2006. The work of the TransTasman Banking Council now focuses more on the practical aspects of
coordination in crisis management with a protocol being agreed with the
aim of establishing procedures to jointly deal with a regional banking
crisis.

Insurance

Push ahead with
Stage II reforms (e.g.,
capital management,
reinsurance
documentation,
corporate
government
standards, and
disclosure
requirements).



Issue

AML/CFT

Give high priority to
make the appropriate
legislative and
operational
arrangements in the
AML/CFT area.

The Stage II reforms have all been finalized and implemented.

 Subsequently, APRA has been consulting on a comprehensive update
of its capital standards for general insurance and life insurance, aimed at
making the standards more risk-sensitive and improving their alignment
across regulated industries. In addition, from July 1, 2008, all Direct
Offshore Foreign Insurers operating in Australia have had to be
authorized by APRA and subject to Australia’s prudential regime.

 The AML/CTF Act, enacted in December 2006, established a
regulatory regime to detect and deter money laundering and terrorism
financing. The AML/CTF Act represents the first tranche of reforms and
covers the activities of financial service providers, gambling services,
bullion dealers and remittance dealers. The authorities report that the
implementation is now complete. The second tranche of legislative and
regulatory reforms, intended to capture a range of non-financial
businesses and professionals is under consideration. Legislation has been
implemented facilitating information exchange between the Australian
Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) and APRA.
Information sharing arrangements at the executive and operational
levels are now in place.

AUSTRALIA 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Appendix II. Australia: Main Recommendations of the 2010 Article IV Consultation

Fund Recommendations

Policy Actions

Fiscal policy: Staff agreed with the pace of exit from
fiscal stimulus, assuming the recovery proceeded as
expected. The authorities’ plan for a return to surplus
by 2012/13 should put Australia in a strong position to
deal with future shocks. Staff noted that there was
ample scope to slow the pace of exit or loosen fiscal
policy in response to a downside scenario.

The authorities remain committed to returning to a
budget surplus by 2012/13. Beyond that, the
authorities plan to improve the fiscal position by
limiting real spending growth while the economy is
growing at or above trend to 2 percent a year, on
average, until surpluses are at least 1 percent of
GDP.

Staff emphasized that the automatic fiscal stabilizers
should be allowed to operate fully, given that the
growing dependence on mining may amplify the
business cycle. This implies saving revenue windfalls
and running larger budget surpluses during upswings
than in the past to help avoid potential overheating
and building a buffer against a sharp fall in commodity
prices. Staff suggested that preparing a downside
scenario for the budget in which commodity prices fall
sharply may help build political support for running
larger surpluses during the good times.

The government’s strategy of achieving budget
surpluses, on average, over the medium term and
improving the government’s net financial worth over
the medium term is broadly consistent with allowing
the automatic stabilizers to operate.

Monetary policy: Staff advised that if the recovery
remains on track and downside risks dissipate,
monetary policy will need to tighten further to contain
inflation pressures generated by the mining boom.
However, if the global recovery stalls or international
capital markets come under severe stress, the RBA has
ample scope to cut the policy rate and provide liquidity
support for banks.

The RBA raised the policy rate to 4¾ percent in
November 2010. Since then, the policy rate has been
on hold but the appreciation of the exchange rate
has tightened monetary conditions further.

Financial sector policy: The authorities should remain
vigilant as banks could adopt riskier strategies. Staff
welcomed APRA’s regular stress testing and
recommended explicitly including funding risk in
future scenarios, given banks’ sizable short-term
external debt

APRA plans to undertake more comprehensive
stress tests of banks than in 2009/10, including
stress tests incorporating a disruption to funding
markets. APRA has also made progress on
contingency planning for liquidity and solvency
problems at systemically important banks, including
for the New Zealand subsidiaries.

for key variables are also shown.
2/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and current account balance.
3/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent occurs at the end of 2011. This scenario assumes foreign exchange hedging
effectively covers 80 percent of foreign currency debt, consistent with the findings of the ABS survey, "Foreign Currency
Exposure, Australia, March Quarter 2009." The scenario ignores the offsetting impact of a depreciation on partially hedged
asset positions, and it does not incorporate any positive movement of the trade balance in response to the depreciation.

ANNEX II. AUSTRALIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. Australia
subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS) and its metadata are posted on the
Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(DSBB). In recent years, the Australian Bureau of
Statistics (ABS) has taken several initiatives to
further improve the quality of the data, such as
including the prices of financial services in the CPI
and developing new measures of labor
underutilization.

In September 2006, STA met with officials from the ABS,
the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, and the
Reserve Bank of Australia to encourage the reporting of
monetary data using the standardized report forms
(SRFs) introduced in October 2004. The SRFs provide
for accounting data to be broken down by instrument,

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Australia
On October 5, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Australia.1
Background
Australia’s performance since the onset of the global financial crisis has been enviable. It was
one of the few advanced economies to avoid a recession in recent years, reflecting its strong
position at the onset of the crisis and a supportive macro policy response. The good
performance can also be attributed to a healthy banking system, a flexible exchange rate, and
robust demand for commodities from Asia, especially China.
A recovery is now being driven by a mining boom. Real GDP growth picked up to 2¾ percent in
2010 with private demand and commodity exports beginning to take over from public demand
as the main drivers. In the first quarter of 2011, however, activity was disrupted by cyclones and
floods in Queensland and Western Australia that reduced output, especially exports of coal and
iron ore (which comprise about ⅓ of Australia’s exports). Real GDP growth rebounded in the
second quarter but coal export volumes have not fully recovered.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
The exceptionally large rise in the terms of trade since 2002 has increased national income and
improved the current account balance to about 2½ percent of GDP in the first half of 2011. The
improvement has contributed to an appreciation of the real effective exchange rate to near the
highest level since the dollar was floated in 1983. The appreciation has put pressure on sectors
not benefiting directly from higher commodity prices.
Macroeconomic stimulus is being withdrawn. The Reserve Bank of Australia began to raise its
policy rate in late 2009, but the rate has been held at 4¾ percent since November 2010,
because of uncertainty regarding the global outlook and the impact of natural disasters on
activity. The exit from fiscal stimulus began in 2010, as the recovery gained traction. However,
fiscal consolidation has been complicated by natural disasters that contributed to a wider-thanexpected budget deficit of 3½ percent of GDP in 2010/11.
The economic outlook remains favorable, but the risks to growth are tilted to the downside. Real
GDP growth is projected at almost 2 percent for the calendar year 2011 and 3⅓ percent for
2012, on the back of strong demand for commodities and a sharp rise in private investment in
mining. Key downside risks are that the global recovery stalls or Asian growth falters, impacting
demand for commodities. Funding markets could also be disrupted by concerns about
sovereign debt in advanced economies. On the upside, investment in the resource sector could
be larger than expected and households may become more confident as the boom progresses.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that although recent global market volatility has increased uncertainty
about the economic outlook and tilted risks downward, strong commodity demand from
emerging Asia underpins Australia’s favorable economic prospects.
Directors agreed that the macroeconomic stimulus is being appropriately removed. They
commended the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) for its well-paced monetary policy tightening,
which has helped anchor medium-term inflation expectations. However, Directors observed that
a further tightening of monetary policy could be warranted if the recovery remains on track, to
counter the inflationary pressures from the unprecedented increase in mining investment.
Directors welcomed the government’s commitment to return the Commonwealth budget to
surplus in 2012/13, as it would strengthen fiscal buffers and take some pressure off monetary
policy and the exchange rate.
Directors agreed that in the event of severe adverse developments in global financial markets or
world growth, macroeconomic policy is well positioned to respond. They noted that the freefloating exchange rate regime has cushioned external shocks, the RBA has ample scope to cut
policy interest rates, and there is ample space for countercyclical fiscal support, given the low
level of government net debt.

3
Directors stressed that, over the medium term, the government should grasp the opportunity
provided by the mining boom to strengthen fiscal buffers further, recommending that a budget
surplus of at least 1 percent of GDP be targeted for the period beyond 2013/14. In this regard,
they emphasized the importance of tax and structural reforms. Directors underscored that
inefficient taxes such as state stamp duties on house sales, that discourage worker mobility, be
eliminated and that the effective marginal income tax rates be further reduced. Business tax
reform would also encourage private investment. Options to raise revenue to fund these reforms
include greater reliance on consumption and land taxes, and a broadening of the proposed
minerals resource rent tax. More broadly, Directors considered that reforms in the areas of
education, infrastructure, and business regulation would enhance the economy’s capacity to
adjust to structural changes.
Directors concurred that, while banks remain sound, continued intensive supervision remains
critical. They welcomed the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority’s plans to undertake
stress tests incorporating disruptions to funding markets. Directors generally noted that higher
capital requirements and a further reduction of banks’ short-term external debt would reinforce
financial stability, although a few Directors thought that any steps in this direction should await
an international consensus on the appropriate norms.
Directors observed that the projected deterioration of the current account balance presents
some risks, although future deficits should remain manageable as they reflect, in large part, an
increase in private investment in the export sector. They pointed out that a projected decline in
national saving also contributes to the widening of the deficit, which underlines the need for
fiscal consolidation.
Directors took note of the staff’s assessment that the Australian dollar may be somewhat
stronger than the level implied by medium-term fundamentals. They noted, however, that the
overvaluation is partly cyclical and may dissipate with the eventual tightening of policy rates by
major central banks.

Statement by Mr. Christopher Y. Legg, Executive Director, and Ms. Susan Bultitude,
Advisor to Executive Director, on Australia
October 5, 2011
My authorities are monitoring closely the deteriorating external environment, very conscious of
the prospect for a sustained period of global weakness and the downside risks this poses for the
Australian economy. Heightened global financial volatility and uncertainty are compounding
domestic pressures associated with a two speed economy, weighing on confidence in nonmining sectors. A significant increase in household saving – in many ways a positive
development – is also constraining retail activity. Non-mining related growth is forecast to be
weak, and we have witnessed a small upturn in unemployment in August, to 5.3 percent.
My authorities remain committed to preserve, and optimize, the considerable policy room they
have available to respond to external instability. Recent improvements in both household and
banking sector balance sheets will also help to buttress the domestic economy. More generally, a
combination of factors continues to underpin the Australian economy’s resilience: a continuing
commitment to sound policy and regulatory frameworks; a proactive and cautious approach by
the prudential regulator; the adaptability supported and fostered over many years by structural
reform and exchange rate flexibility; as well as the advantages of close integration with a fast
growing Asian region. After widespread damage and disruption associated with devastating
floods and cyclones across wide areas of Australia earlier this year, GDP recovered strongly, by
1.2 percent, in the June quarter.
The benefits of proximity to emerging Asia are most obviously manifested in the unprecedented
mining boom now driving growth. Australia’s terms of trade are currently at 140 year highs.
Mining investment is expected to reach record highs as a share of GDP over the next two years,
rivaling that for the rest of the economy, notwithstanding the fact that mining production
accounts for only around 9 percent of GDP. These developments are posing significant
adjustment challenges for the Australian economy. However, the mining boom is a manifestation
of a broader, long-term phenomenon, namely the transformation of Asia, with profound
implications for the pattern of global production and consumption. The policy challenge in
Australia is to maintain the right policy settings – both macroeconomic and structural – to ensure
the economy benefits fully from the opportunities this transformation will bring.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 1

Fiscal Policy
My authorities remain committed to returning the budget to surplus in 2012–13 and beyond, to
re-build policy buffers and make room for the mining-related investment boom. The 2011-12
Budget projected that government net debt would peak at around 7 percent this year and decline
to zero by 2019–20.
This involves a commitment to a significant adjustment effort, of the order of 4 percent of GDP
in the space of 2 years. At the same time, revenue is likely to be less responsive to growth than
during the first phase of the mining boom, from 2004 through 2007, including as a result of the
impact of growing mining sector depreciation expenses as a proportion of mining sector profits
and the sector’s larger overall share of the economy. The Government’s planned Minerals
Resource Rent Tax will improve the sector’s contribution to the budget. A Temporary Flood and
Cyclone Reconstruction levy has also been imposed to help offset the costs of these natural
disasters. But a significant part of the burden of this consolidation will necessarily fall on
expenditures, and the 2011–12 Budget identified significant savings from reforms to a wide
range of family benefits, income support including reforms to encourage greater participation,
health, education, and defense programs. Real growth in spending is expected to average only
1 percent over the forward estimate period.
My authorities consider that the existing fiscal strategy – budget surpluses on average over the
medium term, taxation as a share of GDP kept below the level for 2007–08, and a commitment
to improve the government’s net financial worth over the medium term – continues to provide a
sound basis for sustainability. In operationalizing this strategy, the Government has committed
to keep real expenditure growth below 2 percent per annum, once the budget returns to surplus
and until the surpluses are at least 1 percent of GDP, while the economy is growing at or above
trend. My authorities acknowledge Staff’s recommendation regarding the desirability of
allowing automatic stabilizers to operate fully in both directions, and note the arguments in
favor of building larger fiscal buffers beyond the return to surplus. The need to manage the
implications for aggregate saving of demographic trends is well understood. However, the
benefits of greater insurance against cyclical risks in what may be a more volatile environment,
would need to be weighed against the costs of significantly larger surpluses.

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

We welcome Staff’s endorsement of Australia’s strong budgetary institutions, its support for
the establishment of a Parliamentary Budget Office, and the observations made regarding the
scope for further fine tuning.
Monetary Policy
The Reserve Bank of Australia continues to assess carefully the outlook for growth and
inflation. At its September meeting, the RBA Board judged that it was prudent to maintain the
current stance of monetary policy, with the cash rate having been unchanged at 4.75 percent
since November 2010. While the Board remained concerned about the medium-term outlook for
inflation, most financial indicators suggested that monetary policy had been exerting a degree of
restraint.
The headline consumer price index rose 3.6 percent through the year to the June quarter 2011, of
which food prices (mostly fruit and vegetables) accounted for 1.0 percent. Inflation is expected
to fall back below 3 percent in early 2012 as the effect of temporary weather-related events
reverse.
The Exchange Rate and External Stability
The flexibility of the Australian dollar continues to be key to managing the impact of the mining
boom alongside instability in global financial markets. The exchange rate has responded to
heightened external risks, depreciating by around 12 percent in recent weeks. This follows a
period of sustained appreciation through to July 2011, of around 24 percent since the last Article
IV consultations and by more than 70 percent since the low following the collapse of
Lehmans. Overall, the strength of the Australian dollar has helped to ease pressure on inflation
and monetary policy while facilitating the re-allocation of resources to the mining
sector. Nevertheless, recent adjustments in the exchange rate are relevant to the Staff’s finding
that the Australian dollar may have been overvalued, by the order of 10-20 percent, and market
expectations of a depreciation (of around 6 ½ percent over two years) referred to by staff.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 3

As the Staff Report notes, Australia’s current account deficit (CAD) is expected to widen on the
back of historic levels of investment associated with the mining boom. The authorities’
commitment to fiscal consolidation, alongside measures further to increase private saving to
address looming demographic pressures, such as the planned increase in the minimum
superannuation contribution from 9 percent to 12 percent of salaries, will bolster domestic
saving. Nonetheless, additional external resources will be required to take full advantage of the
higher demand for Australia’s commodities. The underlying policy imperative remains to
improve the flexibility and allocative efficiency of the economy, to ensure that resources are
being used productively.
Financial Sector and Household Balance Sheets
The Australian banking system continues to improve its financial position, with strong
encouragement from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA). As described in
the Staff Report, banks have shifted away from short-term borrowing towards longer-term
funding and deposits in recent years, and they hedge their foreign currency exposures.
APRA has a well-established stress testing program which it continues to develop. Upcoming
projects include testing across a wider range of funding shocks, and working closely with the
New Zealand authorities on trans-Tasman crisis management, under the auspices of the TransTasman Council on Banking Supervision. APRA will also be working closely with the
Monetary and Capital Markets Department over the coming year to conduct stress tests as part
of Australia’s FSAP.
APRA continues to adopt a conservative and robust approach to the application of Basel III in
Australia. It is within this context that APRA has taken the view that it remains premature to
increase the capital requirements for domestic systemically important financial institutions
ahead of an international consensus being reached. Australia’s experience has been that, at the
margin, effective supervision and risk management, rather than additional regulatory capital per
se, are the keys to maintaining a healthy financial system,

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

The financial position of Australia’s household sector is also improving, with the household
saving rate reaching 10½ percent of disposable income in June 2011 – a level on par with saving
rates seen in the mid 1980s. This has been accompanied by a reduced appetite for most types of
debt, an increase in debt repayments (including early repayments of scheduled debt) and an
easing of household credit growth. These shifts in saving behavior partly reflect a return to
more traditional patterns of saving and borrowing in recent years, after household spending had
grown more quickly than income for a decade or so as nominal interest rates declined and credit
became more widely available.
While the housing market remains in a position of undersupply, house prices have continued to
soften, unwinding some of the strong growth experienced in recent years. However, the
softening remains relatively modest, with house prices falling by around 2 to 2½ percent over
the year to the June quarter. Taken together, the solid income growth and softening in house
prices have contributed to an orderly decline in the ratio of prices to income, which is now
consistent with the average level of the past decade.
Structural Reform
The long-term adjustment pressures associated with the emergence of Asia, and domestic
demographic trends, underscore the importance of continuing efforts to lift workforce
participation and – crucially – to enhance productivity. My authorities recognize the need to
reverse the recent decline in multifactor productivity, and the 2011–12 Budget outlined a
strategic approach to this challenge, building on a commitment to continued macroeconomic
stability with a focus on enhancing flexibility and well targeted investments in skills and human
capital, public and private infrastructure, and innovation. Legislation to establish a price for
carbon, and transition towards an emissions trading scheme, has been introduced into
Parliament, aiming to ensure the least cost means of adjusting to climate change. The
compensation package for the introduction of a carbon price includes a number of significant tax
reforms, while the Tax Forum, scheduled for October 4–5 in Canberra, will be an opportunity to
build further momentum for significant tax reform, drawing on the broad ranging
recommendations in the 2009 Report on “Australia’s Future Tax System,” with the potential to
improve resource allocation and labor mobility. And, there is an ambitious agenda of
productivity reforms in the growing health and education sectors, in cooperation with the
States.
