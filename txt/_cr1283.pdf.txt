STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 24, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Background. Panama’s economy rebounded strongly from the 2009 slowdown, and is
now one of the fastest-growing in the region. Rapid growth and prudent fiscal policy
have lowered public debt to under 40 percent of GDP and rating agencies have placed
Panama’s sovereign debt one notch above investment grade. A recent Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) mission confirmed the strength and resilience of the
banking sector.
Near-term outlook and risks. Boosted by the Panama Canal expansion and other
large public infrastructure projects, output growth may reach 10 percent in 2011 and is
expected to moderate to 7–7½ percent in 2012. The neutral fiscal stance envisaged for
2012–13 is broadly appropriate, though a tighter stance would have been preferable to
rebuild buffers and contain inflation. Direct real and financial links with Europe are not
large, but the economy may be affected by knock-on effects on emerging Asia and
South America of a further deterioration in global conditions.
Medium-term challenges
Continue strengthening the fiscal framework. Effective implementation of the public
investment program will require further improvements in the budget framework,
spending efficiency and revenue management. The envisaged creation of a Sovereign
Wealth Fund (SWF) to save additional Canal resources is welcome; the SWF should be
incorporated in the budget framework.
Upgrading financial sector regulation, supervision, and infrastructure. Improvements in
risk-based and consolidated cross-border supervision, and strengthening the
Superintendency of Banks’ capacity to identify and monitor financial system risks
should be key priorities. Creating a fund to respond to possible bank liquidity
shortages would help strengthen the system’s resilience to shocks.
Further enhancing competitiveness and broadening growth prospects. Stepping up
ongoing efforts to improve the quality of education and availability of training would
be essential to address skilled labor shortages and improve key social indicators.

PANAMA

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Panama’s growth rates are
among the highest in the region, largely
owing to strong fundamentals and
prudent policies. Real GDP growth has
averaged 8 percent over the past five years
which, together with successful fiscal
consolidation, has resulted in a rapid
decline in debt ratios. Partly for this reason,
Panama’s sovereign debt is now rated one
notch above investment grade, on par with
Brazil and Mexico.1 The recent ratification
of a bilateral Free-Trade Agreement (FTA)
by the U.S. Congress will help sustain
private investment (Box 1). In July 2011,
Panama was taken off the OECD’s “grey
list” of tax heavens upon signing 12 double
taxation treaties, though it still has to
complete the peer review process.2

increase transfers to the budget. In the
social area, the government is expanding
safety nets. Implementation of the
economic reform agenda has not been
disrupted by the breakup of the two-party
ruling coalition in September 2011, as
President Martinelli’s party rapidly
regained majority in the National
Assembly. Nonetheless, recent legislative
initiatives have met unexpected resistance.3
3.
The authorities were appreciative
of staff’s advice in the context of
previous Article IV consultations and
technical assistance (TA) missions.
Countercyclical fiscal policy in 2009 helped
mitigate the impact of the crisis, but a
modest consolidation, as advised by staff,
would have been appropriate in 2010 in
light of the strong recovery. At the same
time, the authorities are seeking Fund
advice on the establishment of a Sovereign
Wealth Fund (SWF) to safeguard the
additional revenues from the expanded
Panama Canal, and are heeding longstanding Fund recommendations to
strengthen the financial safety net.

2.
The government’s economic
strategy for 2009–14 aims at positioning
Panama as a world-class financial and
logistics hub, while alleviating social
exclusion. Cumulative public investment in
physical and social infrastructure during
this administration is expected to reach
50 percent of 2010 GDP (US$13.6 billion,
excluding the US$5.3 billion Panama Canal
expansion) by 2014. Tax reforms enacted in
2009-10 are expected to increase tax
revenue by about 1.4 percent of GDP by
2013. The Panama Canal expansion will
double existing transit capacity and

Economic growth in 2010-11
continued to surprise on the upside. Real
GDP grew by 7.5 percent in 2010 and by

commerce and transportation sectors have
shown the most dynamism. Canal traffic

20 percent growth in toll revenue (JanuarySeptember, cumulative, compared to the
same period in 2010). West-East and
South-East traffic increased reflecting
buoyant growth in emerging Asia and
South America. GDP growth in 2011 is
projected to be around 10 percent, closing
the output gap created during the 2009
slowdown.

Inflation remained above
historical averages. Headline inflation
rose from 2.4 percent in 2009 to
6.3 percent at end-2011 (y/y), reflecting in
part high world food and fuel prices, the
increase in the VAT rate, and a large

prices is unclear. There is some evidence that
prices in Panama tend to be sticky downwards
as declines in international prices are not fully
passed on to consumers.

In October 2011, the U.S. Congress ratified a
long-pending FTA with Panama. The agreement,
which was signed in 2007, is expected to come into
effect in the second quarter of 2012.
Upon its implementation, the FTA will provide
for immediate duty-free access of the majority
of bilateral exports. Its immediate effect on
Panamanian exports is likely to be limited since
most already enter the U.S. tariff-free on account
of existing trade preference regimes (e.g.
Caribbean Basin Initiative). For some sensitive
products, mostly agricultural, the FTA provides for
a more gradual phasing out of existing tariffs over
a 15-year period.
In the short-term, Panama’s tariff revenues
(about 1.5 percent of GDP) are expected to
decline. Total U.S. exports to Panama in 2010
amounted to US$2½ billion, while Panama’s
exports to the U.S. were only US$211 million.
Over the medium-term, bilateral trade and
investment flows are expected to expand and,
for Panama, likely offset short-term costs.



Panama’s agricultural sector may need a
proactive strategy to shift production
toward non-traditional crops. Panama’s
agricultural output has been declining in
recent years. Lower domestic demand for less
competitive Panamanian produce and
difficulties in complying with phyto-sanitary
requirements for exports may compound the
woes of the sector. Moving towards higher
value-added crops would help mitigate these
effects, but would require investments in
seeds, fertilizers and training for farmers.



Panama’s services sector and, possibly light
manufacturing, are expected to benefit in
the medium-term. The FTA, boosted by
synergies from the development around the
Canal could make it profitable for
multinational firms to relocate in Panama, to
export pharmaceuticals, light manufacturing
goods, and logistics services to the U.S..

expected to help contain the deficit in the
last quarter of 2011. Nonetheless, the endyear outturn is likely to have remained
somewhat above the authorities’ target but
below the deficit ceiling allowed by the
SFRL.7 In cyclically-adjusted terms, the
deterioration of the primary balance is
projected to be about 2.2 percentage
points of GDP during 2010–11 (Table 2).

(19 percent) increase in the minimum wage
in 2010; core inflation reached 4.1 percent
in 2011 (Figure 1). During 2011, the
authorities took steps to alleviate the
impact of price increases on the population
by introducing a price threshold for the
most demanded grade of gasoline,
whereby taxes were adjusted downwards
when the market price increased.4 Further
increases in gasoline and electricity
subsidies were announced in November
2011.

7.
Panama’s financial system
showed resilience during the global
crisis, due in part to prudent policies
and good supervision. Financial
soundness indicators remained robust,
with a very low and stable NPL ratio (Figure
3). As of end-October 2011, bank credit
growth reached 17 percent, slightly above
nominal GDP, while deposit growth slowed
from 11 percent in 2010 to about
8 percent. Deposit interest rates have been
declining in line with global market
developments, but lending rates have
remained broadly stable (Figure 4).

6.
The fiscal stance remained
moderately expansionary. The deficit of
the non-financial public sector (NFPS) was
1.9 percent in 2010 and was targeted to
stay at about 2 percent in 2011.5
Nonetheless, owing to higher-thananticipated capital spending execution6
and somewhat disappointing tax collection,
the deficit of the NFPS rose to 3½ percent
of GDP at end-September 2011. Recordhigh Panama Canal dividend transfers
(US$1,043 billion or 3.3 percent of GDP)
and measures to restrain investment
spending and related operational costs are

8.
The external current account
deficit has widened, largely owing to the
rapid growth of imports related to the
Canal expansion. The current account
deficit rose to -10.7 percent of GDP in 2010
and is projected to peak at -13 percent in
2011 (Figure 5). The deficit is almost fully
financed by Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
flows, which grew by 17 percent (y/y) in
nominal terms by end-September 2011.

4

The budget recuperates the subsidy when the price
goes below the established threshold.
5

The Social and Fiscal Responsibility Law (SFRL),
approved in 2008, establishes a limit for the NFPS
deficit of 1 percent of GDP. The law contains escape
clauses that allow the deficit limit to increase to up to
3 percent of GDP, with a gradual adjustment path
back to the norm, in case of (i) a sharp drop in
Panama’s economic growth, (ii) a sharp decline in
growth of the global economy, or (iii) a national
emergency. Such clauses were invoked in 2009 and
2010, raising the deficit ceiling to 2.5 and 3 percent of
GDP in 2010 and 2011, respectively.
6

In previous years, the authorities anticipated
executing only about 70 percent of the budgeted
investment envelope, but this ratio has increased
significantly (to about 86 percent in 2011) thanks to
improved capacity.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
9.
Panama’s macroeconomic
outlook is favorable, with broadly
balanced risks. The Canal expansion and
the large public investment program, which
will peak in 2011–12, will continue to
sustain domestic demand (Chart 1). While
there are still some risks of overheating
related to the fast growth pace, these are
likely to be broadly offset by the easing of
pressures on world commodity prices and
by global risks to activity and financial
stability (Box 2).

knock-on effects on revenue, investment
spending, credit and real activity.8


Risks to inflation from both external and
domestic sources remain on the upside.
Imported inflation is expected to
decelerate as commodity prices stabilize,
but there is a high degree of uncertainty
surrounding international prices. Strong
domestic demand and a 17 percent
minimum wage increase which took effect
in January 2012 also may exert pressure on
core inflation, especially as spare capacity
and total unemployment (4.5 percent in
August 2011) are at historic lows.9



The 2012 budget envisages an NFPS deficit
of 2 percent of GDP by year-end, in line
with the gradual return to the ceiling of one
percent established in the SFRL. With
limited fiscal space, further increases in
untargeted subsidies would have to be
offset by adjustments in other spending
categories. Public debt vulnerabilities
would remain low, also thanks to prudent
liability management.



The external current account deficit as a
share of GDP is projected to start declining
in 2012 and to stabilize at about 8 percent
of GDP by 2017. FDI flows are expected to
remain buoyant and finance the bulk of
those deficits, although they may be
vulnerable to abrupt changes in sentiment
in originating countries (about 40 percent
of FDI flows come from the U.S. and
Spain). A sudden decline in FDI flows

Economic growth is projected to slow down
gradually starting in 2012 towards its
medium-term potential of about 5–6
percent. Real GDP growth is expected to
moderate to about 7–7½ percent in 2012
owing to lower external demand. Panama’s
growth would be vulnerable to a sharp
global slowdown insofar as it affects
demand in emerging Asia and the
Americas. Such a shock would affect
activity in the ports and the Colón Free
Zone (CFZ), as well as Canal traffic, with

banks would be vulnerable to short-term
liquidity pressures, and liquidity
concentration in a few international banks
may pose some risks (Box 3). Interbank
contagion analysis revealed only limited
risks for onshore banks stemming from
illiquidity or insolvency of offshore or
international banks.12 Nonetheless, as in
2008–09, the drying up of foreign credit
lines could affect domestic lending and
real activity. It could also push interest
rates up, which would squeeze bank
margins and increase credit risk, as most
loans carry floating rates and household
indebtedness is rising.

on domestic demand would be mitigated
by the works on the Canal expansion,
which are fully pre-financed.10

The banking system’s diversified ownership
structure, high reliance on deposit funding,
and low exposure to European banks are
expected to limit near-term spillover risks

capitalization would cushion heightened
credit risks arising from the impact of a

Principles and Insurance. The authorities have
committed to completing an AML/CFT assessment
as part of the FSAP process by end-2012.

well as setting concentration limits for interbank
deposits.



Strengthen cross-border supervision, including
through establishing a holding company capital
standard and consolidated regulatory reporting
at the holding company level, and expanding
the supervisory sphere by including securities,
insurance, and foreign exchange houses
supervisors. Together with other regional
supervisors, the Superintendency of Banks of
Panama (SBP) should also design more detailed
arrangements for the supervision of individual
groups specifying which regulator is in charge of
each entity in the group, and for making
decisions on groups where the SBP is not in a
position to assume supervision.



Develop an institutional framework for
macroprudential policy and instruments to
safeguard against systemic risks, in particular,
through improving off-site supervision, and
closing data gaps (e.g. housing prices,
household and corporate debt).



Establish a financial safety net for emergency
liquidity assistance, notably by pooling a fraction
of banks’ liquidity holdings (Box 4);



Improve sharing of information across agencies
and broaden the perimeter of financial oversight,
including by regulating and supervising more
closely cooperatives, and amending the draft
insurance law.

Overall, stress tests confirmed Panama’s banking
sector’s soundness.



Credit risks are relatively low. The main credit
risk scenario assumed the re-occurrence of the
2008-09 economic downturn. Reflecting high
levels of capitalization and robust profits, only
three small banks would have difficulties
meeting the minimum 8 percent of riskweighted assets to capital ratio in such
scenarios.



Market and sovereign risks are negligible,
reflecting banks’ low exposures to sovereign
debt and quick re-pricing of assets and
liabilities.



Banks are highly liquid. Nonetheless, systemic
liquidity has been declining and some banks,
accounting for about 15 percent of total
liquidity, are vulnerable to short-term deposit
withdrawals.



Interbank contagion and cross border risks,
including liquidity concentration, were tested by
analyzing linkages, exposures and risk of
default among onshore, offshore and
international banks. Overall, the tests showed
that contagion to onshore banks would be
limited to a few medium-sized banks, although
high liquidity concentration in certain
international banks is a concern.

Despite the authorities’ recent efforts, several
shortcomings were observed in the regulatory
sphere and market infrastructure. Key
recommendations include:

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Effective implementation of its ambitious agenda hinges on the government’s ability to
maintain macroeconomic stability while reducing growth bottlenecks. This poses
significant policy challenges, which were at the center of discussions with the authorities.
The near-term priority is keeping fiscal policy firmly anchored while building buffers and
strengthening crisis-prevention tools. Over the medium-term, efforts should focus on (i)
strengthening the fiscal framework to enhance efficiency of public spending, while
improving revenue management; (ii) upgrading financial supervision and infrastructure
in line with international best practices; and (iii) implementing structural policies to
improve competitiveness, and foster sustainable growth.

A. Near-Term Policies
10.
The pace of fiscal consolidation
envisaged in the authorities’ mediumterm budget framework is broadly
appropriate, but over-performing on
fiscal targets would allow to rebuild
buffers. The envisaged path for the NFPS
deficit would imply a broadly neutral fiscal
stance in 2012–13 (Chart 2). Nonetheless,
staff noted that, with output now at
capacity and a stronger-than-anticipated
fiscal impulse in 2011, demand driven by
the implementation of large public
infrastructure projects, together with the
forthcoming minimum wage increase,
would likely put further pressures on prices
and the external current account (Box 2). In
the absence of a monetary policy,
over-performing on fiscal objectives could
help dampen inflationary pressures while
creating additional fiscal space. The
authorities pointed out that a number of
factors were mitigating potential
overheating risks, including the fact that the
public investment program was expanding
productive capacity, and that flexible labor
markets would help alleviate skilled labor
shortages. They also cautioned that a faster
fiscal tightening could be contractionary,

which would not be appropriate given the
deteriorating global outlook.

Fiscal policy should remain firmly
anchored on a strengthened SFRL. While
recognizing that fiscal deficits of moderate
size would not compromise fiscal solvency,
staff expressed concern that continued
activation of the SFRL’s escape clauses risks
eroding its value as a fiscal anchor. The
authorities pointed out that the SFRL
waivers had been activated only twice in
strict application of the law in light of
unforeseen shocks, and that both times the
actual deficit closed well under the
admissible limit. Beyond 2014, the
authorities and staff agreed that the SFRL

near-term financial sector vulnerabilities are
low, the FSAP highlighted that the
supervisory authorities’ capacity to monitor
systemic risk is hampered by the current
institutional and policy framework and data
gaps. Staff encouraged the authorities to
implement enabling legislation that would
allow the newly-established council of
supervisors to effectively oversee the whole
financial system, and build up the capacity
of individual supervisory agencies. In the
near term, the SBP should continue to
strengthen its analysis of macro-financial
linkages.

Macro-prudential instruments can

While voluntary exposure limits have been

Plans to establish a fund to
respond to possible bank liquidity
shortages are welcome (Box 4). By not
having a central bank, Panama lacks both a
traditional lender of last resort and a
mechanism to mitigate systemic liquidity
shortages. The authorities emphasized that
these features had contributed to the
strength and resilience of the system, which
relies on banks holding high levels of
liquidity beyond the prudential requirement
of 30 percent of short-term deposits.14
Nonetheless, the authorities and staff
agreed that the current arrangement
entailed substantial opportunity costs and
could work to the detriment of Panamanian
banks, and that the absence of a lender of
last resort limits considerably the state’s
ability to preserve financial system stability.
The authorities also agreed that the
creation of a domestic liquidity fund would
help address those concerns. While
agreeing that limited public resources could
be used in the start-up phase of the fund,
staff stressed that pooling part of the liquid
reserves currently held by banks to address
idiosyncratic, temporary liquidity shortfalls,
would be both efficient and help reduce
moral hazard. Staff also suggested that
consideration should be given to

fraction of current reserve requirements (3 percent
of deposits). This fund would provide liquidity to
solvent banks facing liquidity pressures for up to 90
days, charge interest penalties, and be collateralized
with investment grade assets. A second facility, an
LOLR, would gradually provide coverage for up to
8 percent of total deposits (over the next four years)
and grant emergency liquidity for up to 90 days—
(renewable once) to banks that have accessed the
liquidity fund. The facility is expected to be funded
with contingent credit lines from abroad and
through the central bank’s holdings of tradable
government bonds.

As a fully dollarized economy, Panama does not
have a central bank or a Lender of Last Resort
(LOLR). Unlike in some other fully dollarized economies,
e.g. El Salvador, Panama’s financial system does not
have formal safety nets, such as reserve requirements or
deposit insurance. Because of this, Panamanian banks
hold relatively high levels of liquidity as self-insurance.
During the 2008-09 global financial crisis, a few
Panamanian banks experienced liquidity shortages,
due to the sudden freeze of external credit lines. In
response, the Superintendency of Banks set up a daily
bank-by-bank reporting system focusing on short-term
liquidity in October 2008, and enacted temporary
changes in regulations to reduce the impact of global
financial volatility on banks’ equity positions. In addition,
the state bank, the National Bank of Panama (BNP),
established a collateralized line of credit for US$400
million to replace some of the lost export financing. In
January 2009, the government set up a liquidity fund
(PEF) for a total of US$1.1 billion (5 percent of total
deposits) for on-lending for productive investment and
working capital needs. The fund pooled resources from
the Interamerican Development Bank (US$500 million)
and Andean Development Corporation (US$210 million)
as well as the BNP. However, high interest rates,
uncertainty about acceptable collateral, and a quick
resumption of access to private foreign credit lines
deterred demand; the PEF disbursed less than US$100
million before closing at end-2010.
El Salvador also created vehicles of liquidity support
during the crisis. The liquid asset requirement was
temporarily eliminated; and the IMF and IDB provided
precautionary external funding.
The 2008-09 episodes highlighted the desirability of
permanent liquidity facilities in fully dollarized
economies. The Salvadorian authorities are currently
working on setting up a liquidity fund and an LOLR as
part of a comprehensive liquidity management strategy.
The Panamanian authorities are receiving technical
assistance to establish a liquidity facility.

In Panama, the liquidity facility should provide
coverage only to on-shore general license banks
with temporary liquidity problems. Contrary to the
PEF, it should not require on-lending of resources.
International experience suggests that the facility
should have resources equivalent to about 10
percent of total on-shore deposits (approximately
US$3 billion). Although various options are still
under consideration, funding could include
contributions from the state as well as pooling part
of the banks’ existing assets, replicating centralized
reserve requirements. Based on the PEF’s
experience, this will also require standardization
and availability of more liquid collateral.

continue monitoring closely contingent
liabilities, and to incorporate them into the
public debt accounting framework.


The authorities’ efforts to improve the
targeting of subsidies and to further expand
the existing conditional cash transfer
program are cost-effective ways to enhance
the effectiveness of social spending.
Subsidies on fuel, water and electricity cost
more than 1 percent of GDP and are
largely regressive. The authorities indicated
that they plan to gradually reduce the
electricity subsidy provided to households
consuming less than 500 KWH,17 and to
introduce means-tested pre-paid gas
payment cards.



Staff encouraged the authorities to develop
a roadmap to strengthen public financial
management. Recent technical assistance
missions from the Fund have highlighted
the importance of strengthening mediumterm expenditure and budget frameworks,
establishing a Single Treasury Account, and
enhancing the quality and coverage of
government finance statistics in line with
the move to the 2001 GFSM classification.
Given limited institutional capacity, the
authorities agreed with staff’s advice to
develop a prioritized action plan to make
those improvements.

Adequate coverage in the fiscal accounts of
public enterprises and public-private

staff cautioned against the exclusion of a
growing number of public enterprises from

noted that the practice hindered a
comprehensive monitoring of public sector
activities and fiscal risks, especially if the
excluded entities borrowed from the

arrangements to execute public
infrastructure projects, with total
commitments amounting to about
US$2 billion as of mid-2011, raises similar

Three entities were excluded from the fiscal
accounts since 2010: the electricity transmission
company, the international airport and the newlycreated highway company. Two of the entities broadly
met the criteria of being profitable commercially run
enterprises, with relatively small debts of 1.5 percent of
GDP as of end-2010. The highway company plans to
borrow US$1.07 billion during 2011–12, but the debt
does not carry a state guarantee and would be fully
backed by future toll revenue.

Box 5. Panama’ Sovereign Wealth Fund: A Fiscal Perspective



6

Scenario 1 assumes that the overall fiscal
balance posts deficits of one percent of GDP
until 2025. With higher revenues from the Canal,
this policy implies an additional 5 percent
increase in nominal government spending
starting in 2015 relative to the baseline. This
sizable and steady increase in government
spending would crowd out private demand and
none of additional revenue would be saved.

0

Scenario 2 assumes a yearly increase in canal
dividends of 25 percent starting from 2015, and
the path for the fiscal balance as in the baseline
scenario. Expenditure in 2015 would be about
3 percent higher than in the baseline scenario
and also crowd out private demand.

The simulations suggest that the creation of a
SWF would require modifying the fiscal rule and
the SFRL. The estimates in the baseline scenario are
consistent with setting a target for the non-canal
fiscal balance at about -3 percent of GDP, which fits
the historical pattern (Chart 1). An alternative would
be to adopt an expenditure rule that sets the rate of

In staff’s baseline scenario, once canal revenue

to increase in line with nominal GDP growth.
This would result in gradually rising overall fiscal
surpluses.



The design of the SWF should conform to
international best practices. In particular, (i) the
fund’s main objective should be macroeconomic
stabilization and/or coverage of future pension
liabilities; (ii) it should invest the resources abroad;
(iii) it should operate as a financing fund and not
have the capacity to spend; and (iv) there should be
no earmarking of transfers.

As part of technical assistance on this matter,
staff constructed three long-term scenarios to
assess what fraction of incremental revenue
could be spent contemporaneously without
creating excessive domestic demand pressures.
All scenarios assumed the overall fiscal deficit

growth of total expenditure at the rate of nominal
GDP growth, supplemented with an overall balance
target, and with a cap on canal transfers. Under the
baseline scenario, accumulated resources of the SWF
would amount to about 8 percent of GDP by 2025
(Chart 2).

1999

Starting in 2015, permanent and relatively stable
higher transfers to the budget following the
Canal expansion create important challenges for
fiscal policy design and implementation in
Panama. Canal revenues (tolls, fees and dividends)
are not dependent on domestic economic activity
but may generate domestic spending pressures if
they are made available in full for public spending.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

C. Building a World-Class Financial Center
18.
Panama has established itself as
an important regional hub for banking
services but will need to upgrade
oversight and financial infrastructure to
compete globally. For the most part, banks
follow a fairly traditional business model,
while insurance, equity, and capital markets
are relatively small and/or underdeveloped.
However, to be competitive in a broader
range of investment and wealth
management services, Panama would have
to make improvements in several areas.
According to the FSAP these include:
(i) bringing financial system oversight more
closely in line with international best
practices; and (ii) upgrading all non-bank
segments of the financial system. The
authorities welcomed the FSAP
recommendations (Box 3), and the SBP is
currently preparing a reform action plan
based on them.
19.
Strengthening risk-based and
consolidated cross-border supervision,
and extending the perimeter of
supervision to large nonbank
deposit-taking institutions should be key
priorities. Panama’s legal framework is
strong and supportive of banking
supervision, and compliance with Basel
Core Principles is good. However,
risk-based supervision is in its initial stages
and it will take some time before new
regulations are fully phased in. The SBP also
agreed on the need to regulate operational
and market risks, and setting concentration
limits for interbank deposits. Panama is host
to several large regional financial groups
and cross-border supervision is broadly in
line with international best practices.
Nonetheless, the FSAP recommended

further improvements, notably: (i) adopting
capital adequacy standards at the holding
company level and setting related-party
exposure and concentration limits for
regional groups; and (ii) expanding the
supervisory sphere by including securities,
insurance, and foreign exchange houses
supervisors. The authorities noted that the
Ministry of Commerce was working on
measures to strengthen the supervision of
cooperatives.
20.
Recent and planned legal reforms
aimed at strengthening the insurance
sector and securities markets are timely,
but additional reforms are needed. The
FSAP found that both insurance and
securities market oversight fell short of
minimum international standards, which
could create reputational risks. Recent and
ongoing legislative efforts to increase the
autonomy and resources of sector
regulators would help improve compliance,
but staff also called for further
strengthening prudential regulation,
particularly with regard to the
determination of solvency margins and
regulating the investment of capital. The
capacity of insurance and capital market
supervisors should also be enhanced.
21.
Staff welcomed recent steps to
develop domestic capital markets. The
establishment of a market maker program,
including the re-launching of domestic debt
placements and the creation of custodian
arrangements to enhance connectivity with
international markets has already increased
the volume of secondary market
transactions. These advances would benefit
from further upgrades in payment systems
infrastructure.

D. Boosting Competitiveness and Sustaining Growth
23.
Panama’s competitiveness has
improved in recent years (Annex II). The
trend real effective exchange rate (REER)
has depreciated since 2009, although rising
domestic inflation has mitigated the fall.
Export growth has been strong, and
Panama remains an attractive destination
for FDI (Figure 5 and Annex II, Figure 1).
Econometric estimates based on the
standard CGER methodologies do not
suggest a significant exchange rate
misalignment, although competitiveness
could deteriorate if inflation remains
significantly above that of trading partners.
Survey-based competitiveness indicators
and rankings show that, overall, Panama’s
competitiveness position has been
improving in recent years, and compares
well with the largest economies in the
region. Those surveys highlight political
stability, infrastructure, and financial
development as Panama’s strengths.
24.
Going forward, the recentlyapproved FTA with the U.S. is expected
to boost Panama’s status as a regional
logistics hub (Box 1). Simplified procedures
and taxation regimes should attract further
investments in the services sector and light
manufacturing, building on the enhanced
interconnectedness provided by the
expansion of the Canal and ports facilities.
The authorities have established a logistics
secretariat tasked with removing remaining

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

bottlenecks to support the expansion of
these sectors. Promotion of non-traditional
exports would be necessary for the
agricultural sector to reap the benefits of
the FTA.
25.
At the same time, Panama needs
to make improvements in the areas of
human capital, access to basic services,
and institutions. Staff noted that some key
indicators of social progress and
educational achievement are low, both in
relation to Panama’s impressive
improvements in real per capita income and
compared with peers (Figure 6).19 The
authorities argued that the results of a
recent study showed that poverty and
inequality had declined significantly.20 They
noted that the government’s emphasis on
building comprehensive safety nets was
starting to show positive results, and
indicated that they are implementing
measures to improve security and reinforce
the legal and judicial framework.

high growth rates over the medium term.
The authorities noted that recent programs
such as cash transfers for all school children
were improving enrollment and reducing
drop-out rates, and pointed at joint efforts
with the private sector to increase
availability of vocational and on-the-job
training.

27.
Panamas’ economy has shown
impressive resilience to external
turbulence in recent years. Strong
fundamentals, including Panama’s strategic
position as a regional logistics and banking
hub, political stability, steady fiscal
consolidation and prudent liability
management, have contributed to some of
the highest growth rates in the region and
lowered public debt levels. 21
28.
Overall vulnerabilities are low and
the outlook is favorable, with broadlybalanced risks. The large-scale public
investment program and the Panama Canal
expansion are expected to continue to drive
demand and growth in 2012, and thus
mitigate the adverse impact of the weak
global outlook. Stress tests confirm
Panama’s banking sector’s soundness,
though some liquidity risks warrant
heightened vigilance. Panama’s current
account developments seem consistent

major external vulnerabilities Nonetheless, a
large external shock affecting global trade
and liquidity could cause serious
disruptions.
29.
In the near term, policies should
focus on building buffers and
strengthening crisis-prevention tools.
With output now at capacity, the neutral
fiscal stance envisaged for 2012 is broadly
appropriate, though a tighter fiscal stance
would be preferable to help rebuild buffers
and contain second-round inflation
pressures. Although there is no evidence of
asset price bubbles and conservative
lending practices by banks limit exposure to
fast-growing sectors, the capacity to
analyze macro-financial linkages and
monitor systemic risk should be
strengthened by improving the regulatory
framework and closing data gaps. Macroprudential tools could play a useful role in
managing rapid credit growth in some
sectors in the absence of monetary policy,
while establishing a fund to respond to
temporary liquidity shortages would bolster
financial system stability.

In the fiscal area, maintaining the
government’s ambitious investment
program within the limits of the SFRL calls
for continuing enhancements in the quality
and effectiveness of spending, including
through plans to better target subsidies,
and strengthening tax administration,
notably through the establishment of a
large taxpayer unit. The envisaged creation
of a Sovereign Wealth Fund to save part of
the additional revenue from the expanded
Panama Canal would be useful to contain
spending pressures and create buffers.
Financial sector oversight should be
brought in line with best international

recommendations. Enabling legislation to
allow the new council of supervisors to

banking supervision is strong and effective
overall, risk-based and consolidated
supervision should be further enhanced.
Potential reputational risks highlight the
need to continue with efforts to strengthen
oversight of non-bank financial
institutions. Ongoing initiatives to develop
capital markets, notably through the
market-makers initiative, are welcome.


Sustaining growth over the medium term
requires managing the public investment
program carefully to avoid supply
bottlenecks and obtain the best value for
money from new infrastructure. Once the
public investment program and the
Panama Canal expansion taper off, growth
will have to be driven by productivity
gains. In this regard, ongoing efforts to
improve the quality of education and to
remove skill mismatches through
vocational and on-the-job training would
be key.

ANNEX I. REAL ESTATE MARKET DEVELOPMENTS AND
MACROPRUDENTIAL POLICY
1.
Panama’s real estate market has
been highly dynamic in recent years, in
line with strong economic growth and
low unemployment.1 In spite of very rapid
construction growth in the years prior to
the global financial crisis, the sector
achieved a soft landing during the
economic slowdown of 2008–09 (Annex I,
Figure 1). Investment in luxury residential
properties was sustained by safe-haven
inflows from the region, which substituted
in part for lower demand from advanced
economies. Although the share of
construction and mortgage lending in bank
portfolios rose to 28.5 percent by
end-2008, banks managed their exposures
to the construction sector quite
conservatively, mainly through selfimposed lending limits. While 2009 saw a
sharp slowdown in housing activity and
overall credit growth, starting in 2010
construction activity rebounded strongly.
New constructions shifted to lower-value
housing for the domestic market, and,
increasingly, to commercial and industrial
real estate propelled by Panama’s
ambitious public investment program
(Annex II, Figure 1).
2.
Although there is no clear
evidence of a property market bubble
(partly due to data gaps), market
participants indicate that prices of prime
residential and industrial real estate are
rising rapidly. By contrast, signs of excess
1

supply in the commercial segment are
emerging, with prices of office space
declining by about 10 percent during
2010-11 and the share of pre-sold
commercial units to be finished in 2012
running at a low 50 percent. There is also
anecdotal evidence that developers have
started to rent unsold units to meet the
demand from middle and high-level
expatriate staff of multinational companies.
Going forward, softer economic activity
and lower safe-haven investments may
reduce demand and increase the
inventories of finished units.
3.
In the absence of monetary
policy tools, macroprudential policy can
play an important role in managing
demand and safeguarding sound credit
expansion. As banking practices become
more competitive in an environment of low
interest rates, macroprudential policy can
help prevent or reduce the severity of asset
price bubbles by limiting the leverage of
borrowers relative to market values or
income. Commonly-used instruments
include limits on the loan-to-value ratio as
well as on the relation between debt or
debt service to household income. Other
economies with hard pegs and a macrocritical housing sector (e.g. Hong Kong SAR
and Singapore) are actively and
successfully using those types of
instruments to influence market and price

Panama’s macroprudential policy
framework is at an incipient stage.
However, the current juncture consisting of
a dynamic domestic economy, low U.S.
interest rates, and a rapidly deteriorating
global outlook, should provide an impetus
for developing additional demand
management tools. Self-imposed
restrictions by banks on clients’ leverage
and general exposure limits cannot be
relied upon to deliver desirable aggregate
outcomes. Moreover, property market
developments are monitored through
periodic surveys of construction activity,
but information on market prices and other
property market indicators is not collected.
Similarly, data on household or corporate
indebtedness is not compiled for
prudential purposes. A key FSAP
recommendation is therefore to step up
data collection to allow the calculation of
price indices and other market indicators
on an ongoing basis. Information on the
credit burden of households should also be
made available. Beyond pure market
surveillance, the authorities should be
ready to enforce limits on loan to value or
debt (service) to income ratios, should
developments in certain market segments
warrant such actions. More generally, the
use of such countercyclical tools should be
embedded in an institutional framework
for macroprudential policy.

PANAMA

ANNEX II. EXTERNAL STABILITY AND
COMPETITIVENESS
1.
This annex analyzes Panama’s
external stability and competitiveness
using several methodologies to assess
the level of the real effective exchange
rate (REER) and non-price survey-based
indicators.1 Despite the large deficits as a
share of GDP, the analysis suggests that
Panama’s current account developments
are consistent with external stability, and
that there are no major external
vulnerabilities. Results from three
quantitative methodologies suggest that,
as of end-2010, the real effective exchange
rate was broadly in line with fundamentals.
Survey data analysis indicates that
Panama’s competitiveness is dampened by
structural factors related to institutions,
human capital development and skills’
allocation through the labor market (Annex
II, Figure 1).

External Stability
2.
Panama’s external current
account (CA) is projected to post deficits
in excess of 10 percent of GDP through
2014 before returning to its long-term
norm of 5–7 percent by 2016–17. The
external CA moved from near balance in
2009 to a projected deficit of 13 percent of
GDP in 2011, primarily owing to a surge in
capital goods imports related to the canal
expansion and the public investment
program. Although Foreign Direct
Investment (FDI) inflows are expected to
continue financing the bulk of the external
1

42

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

current account deficits in the coming
years, questions about the sustainability of
those deficits are pertinent.
3.
The composition of imports and
FDI do not suggest that Panama’s
external accounts are on an
unsustainable path, but downside risks
exist. Imports growth in 2011 has been
mostly driven by capital goods related to
the Panama Canal expansion and public
investment projects. Although FDI remains
strong, Panama could be vulnerable to a
sharp deterioration of economic conditions
in countries which are the main sources of
inward FDI such as the U.S. and Spain
(Figure 5), particularly as a large share of
FDI consists of reinvested earnings.
4.
An analysis of the composition of
external assets and liabilities does not
reveal major vulnerabilities, though
private external debt liabilities are
relatively high. The estimates of Panama’s
International Investment Position suggest
that private external debt liabilities have
been rising over time, reaching 127 percent
of GDP at end-2010. However, most of
these represent increased loan liabilities of
offshore banks rather than external debt
exposures of on-shore Panamanian
households or companies.

REER Assessment
5.
Panama’s Nominal Effective
Exchange Rate (NEER) and the CPI-based
Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) are
much lower than their end-2008 peak.
However, in 2011, reflecting the uncertain

PANAMA

required to close the gap between the
norm and the underlying current account
balance in 2016 is estimated to be 8.1
percent.3

global external environment, the NEER
appreciated in line with movements in the
dollar, while the REER rose also owing to
high domestic inflation (Annex II,
Figure 1). Panama’s inflation is projected
to remain somewhat above that of major
trading partners, particularly the U.S, in the
near future, which could dent
competitiveness.

8.
The external sustainability
approach estimates the current account
to GDP ratio needed to stabilize the net
foreign asset (NFA) position of the
country.4 In this case, it is assumed that
Panama’s NFA position in 2007, -87
percent of GDP, is close to its long-term
equilibrium level.5 The approach then
calculates the corresponding NFAstabilizing current account balance,
estimated here at -6.6 percent of GDP.
Using the elasticity estimate of 0.25, the
results suggest an exchange rate
misalignment of 7.8 percent.

6.
Results from the exchange rate
assessment as of end-2010, using three
standard methodologies, are somewhat
ambiguous but do not suggest
significant REER misalignment (Table 1).
While the macroeconomic balance
approach and the external sustainability
approach suggest overvaluation of 8.1 and
7.8 percent respectively, the equilibrium
Real Exchange Rate (RER) method suggests
an undervaluation of about -10.5 percent.
As is well known, these estimates are very
sensitive to key parameter assumptions
(such as the elasticity of the current
account balance to the REER) and to the
estimated current account norm.
7.
The macroeconomic balance
approach relies on an estimate of a
current account norm, based on
fundamental determinants of the
current account balance. The
determinants used in the calculations are
the fiscal balance, the old-age dependency
ratio, population growth, the oil balance,
relative GDP per capita growth and output
growth. Using coefficients from the pooled
estimation in Lee et al. (2008), the current
account norm is estimated at about
-4.7 percent of GDP. Given an estimated
elasticity of the current account balance to

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

9.
Under the equilibrium exchange
rate approach the degree of
misalignment is calculated as the
deviation of the actual REER from its
estimated value. To obtain the equilibrium
real exchange rate, the dynamic OLS
coefficient estimates are applied to Panama
2

The elasticity of 0.25 is the current account balance
elasticity obtained for Panama in Tokarick (Tokarick,
2010, “A method for Calculating Export Supply and
Import Demand Elasticities,” IMF Working Paper
10/180).

3

This coincides with the end of the WEO projection
period for the calculation of the underlying current
account balance.
4

The NFA position is obtained from Lane and MilesiFerretti (2009). This measure of the NFA is based on
adjusted FDI and reserve assets figures and differs
from the authorities’ estimates.
5

The choice of 2007 as the reference year allows to
focus on a level of NFA that is not affected by the
expansion of the Panama canal or the 2008-09
slowdown.

data.6 The fundamentals included are the
terms of trade, the public consumption to
GDP, and investment-to-GDP ratios, trade
openness, and the relative real GDP per
capita to proxy for the productivity
differential between Panama and its major
trading partners. Estimates suggest that as
of end-2010 Panama’s REER was some
10.5 percent below equilibrium.

11.
In the latest DB assessment (DB
2012),8 Panama ranked 61st out of 183
economies. This represents a marginal
improvement relative to the 2011
assessment when Panama was placed 63rd.
Panama scores well on trading across
borders, but is at a disadvantage against all
comparator countries (Latin America and
Caribbean average) with regards to
registering property, protecting investors,
paying taxes, and enforcing contracts.

(up from 53 in 2010–11). Table 2 provides
a comparison of the rankings of Panama
with Singapore (ranked second) and the
five largest Latin American economies.
Panama’s rankings on individual pillars
suggest that its relative strengths are its
financial development, infrastructure,
technological readiness, macroeconomic
environment and business sophistication.
At the same time, according to the survey,
Panama’s key weaknesses lie in human
capital development and labor markets. It
scores poorly with regards to the delivery
of health care and primary education,
provision of on-the-job training and the
allocation of labor resources.

Panama’s ranking in various
competitiveness surveys has improved in
recent years. Overall, competitiveness
surveys (based either on perceptions or
objective measures) highlight several areas
of strength, including financial
development, infrastructure,
macroeconomic and political stability, and
openness to trade. At the same time,
results indicate that Panama’s main
weaknesses relate to institutions, health
and education, and labor markets.7

except voice and accountability. The
World Governance Indicators, developed
by Kaufmann et al. (2010) provide
additional dimensions with which to assess
the external competitiveness of economies.
They assign scores to countries on 6
indicators of governance, notably: control
of corruption; government effectiveness;
political stability and absence of
violence/terrorism; regulatory quality; rule
of law and voice and accountability. Each
dimension is assigned a score from -2.5 to
2.5 (indicating better governance). Based
on the 2010 scores, shown in Figure 2, it
would appear that Panama falls behind
Singapore on all indicators except voice
and accountability. However, except for
Chile, Panama fares better than the large
emerging markets of Latin America on
most indicators of governance.

The authorities have identified
several key areas to promote Panama’s
competitiveness, and ongoing efforts
and initiatives aim at reducing
bottlenecks. A special secretariat has been
established to coordinate the development
strategy of logistics-related activities and
remove remaining bottlenecks to further
expansion. A new initiative by the Ministry
of Education seeks to involve private sector
enterprises in providing training to
students to better align supply and
demand for skills. Strengthening security;
reinforcing institutions (especially the
judiciary); and the introduction of a
bankruptcy law are other elements of the
government’s competitiveness strategy.

Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the National Bank of Panama (NBP) was
subject to the transitional procedures with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement, which
was approved on June 30, 2000, and expired on March 29, 2002. The transitional
procedures required a review of the NBP’s external audit mechanism only. The
assessment was completed on July 12, 2001 and concluded that NBP’s external audit
mechanism was at the time adequate.

Nonfinancial Relations
XI.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
Panama uses the U.S. dollar as the primary means of payment in the local economy. Its
national currency (balboa) is issued in the form of coins only and serves as a unit of
account. The exchange rate of the balboa is fixed at B 1 per U.S. dollar. Panama has
accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange
system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions.

XII.

Last Article IV Consultation:
The 2010 Article IV consultation was concluded on July 12, 2010. Panama is on the
standard 12-month consultation cycle. 2011 Consultation was delayed to align with the
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) process.

XIII.

FSAP: FSAP concluded in September 2011. It confirmed the banking sector’s strength
and resilience to potential shocks, noting nonetheless that there data gaps prevent a full
analysis of macro-financial linkages.

XIV.

Technical Assistance:
Panama is a large recipient of technical assistance (TA) directly through the Fund or
CAPTACDR. Latest assistance concentrated in the areas of the national accounts, both on
output compilation and improvement of registering financial services. Assistance in the
fiscal area included work on government financial statistics and steps necessary to
implement requirements under the GFSM2001 manual. In the financial area, TA
concentrated mostly on improving data compilation on a regional level, and of nonfinancial groups.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

PANAMA

ANNEX 4. STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Progress has been achieved in
improving the accuracy, timeliness, and
publication of economic statistics. Data
provided to the Fund are generally adequate
for surveillance. However, there is a need to
address methodological weaknesses in foreign
trade calculations and to improve the
consistency between the national accounts
and the external sector accounts. Panama has
participated in the Fund’s General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) since December
2000. However, the metadata and plans for
improving the statistical system that are
posted on the Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board (DSBB) need updating.
Following an SDDS assessment mission
conducted by the Statistics Department in
April 2011, the authorities agreed on a work
program aimed at meeting the requirements
for Panama’s subscription to the SDDS. The
work program envisages that Panama could
become an SDDS participant by 2013,
Real Sector
2.
National accounts data are released
with a lag of approximately three months. The
index of monthly economic activity is released
with a lag of up to two months. Although the
timeliness of real sector data provision has
improved, the data are often subject to sizable
revisions. The World Bank is supporting a
project for changing the base year of the
national accounts to 2007, which started in the
second half of 2010 and should be completed
in early 2012.
3.
A population census was conducted in
May 2010 and results were published in 2011.

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

4.
The IMF national accounts technical
assistance mission conducted in 2010-11
noted slow progress in expanding coverage of
financial activity as well as the overestimation
of the deflator used to calculate the financial
services output at constant prices.
5.
A new Household Income and
Expenditure Survey was conducted during
2007–08, and the National Institute of
Statistics and Census the base, basket, and
weights of the CPI.
Government Finances
6.
The Ministry of Finance compiles
budget execution data for the central
government and data on nonfinancial public
sector operations (central government, public
enterprises, and agencies) on a cash basis.
Monthly and quarterly data have been
reported up to November 2011 for the
budgetary central government operations
(www.mef.gob.pa).
7.
Further efforts are needed to improve
the quality of fiscal data. Apart from timeliness,
data consistency in terms of transfers between
public sector units should be improved; and
the coverage of the public enterprises should
be made universal. Since September 2004, the
operational balance of the Panama Canal
Authority (ACP) was excluded from the official
definition of the nonfinancial public sector
used for fiscal policy purposes. Information on
the ACP is only available in the Annual Report
posted in its website (www.pancanal.com) on a
fiscal year basis. There is a need to ensure a
consistent and timely flow of ACP statistics on

PANAMA

a calendar year basis. Moreover, in 2011, three
public enterprises have been excluded from
the NFPS accounts and public debt. It would
also be necessary to timely compile and
disseminate information on these entities. The
authorities are receiving technical assistance
from Statistics Department (STA)/Central
America Technical Assistance Center (CAPTAC)
to implement the government Finance
Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) and Fiscal
Affairs Department (FAD) conducted a mission
on observance of fiscal standards and codes
(ROSC) in October 2005. The authorities,
however, cannot elaborate fiscal statistics in
accordance with GFSM 2001 without a priori
reforming the public accounting and adopting
accrual accounting under International Public
Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). In 2011,
FAD assessed Panama’s progress in
implementing Single Treasury Account and
improving government accountability and
internal audit. While the authorities took
important steps in improving these areas,
further work would be needed to achieve
compliance with international best practices.
Monetary Accounts
8.
Panama has been publishing financial
sector data based on the new standardized
report forms (SRFs) for monetary statistics in
the International Financial Standards
Supplement since March 2007 and participates
in a regional project for harmonizing monetary
and financial statistics in Central America and
the Dominican Republic, supported by
CAPTAC. The aim is to facilitate cross-country
comparison and regional analysis. Provision of
monthly data by the two public financial
institutions, the National Bank of Panama and

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

the Savings Bank (Caja de Ahorros), is regular
and prompt. Monthly data on the operations
of the domestic and international commercial
and savings banks is prepared by the
Superintendency of Banks, and posted on its
website (www.superbancos.gob.pa) and
reported to STA with a lag of one to two
months. The state-owned development banks,
the Agricultural Development Bank, and the
Mortgage Bank are not regulated by the
Superintendency of Banks and no data are
reported to the Fund.
Balance of Payments
9.
Weaknesses in foreign trade flows
calculations, particularly in those involving the
Colon Free Zone, need to be addressed.
Substantial changes in the composition of
trade flows over the last decade render the
current methodology to estimate volume
indices obsolete. Quarterly data is available
with a delay of about one quarter, and is
subject to revisions thereafter. Revised
estimates in key trade and investment data
may result in substantial revisions of the
current account of the balance of payments.
These revisions may reflect improvements in
coverage, but they also suggest that there is
room for improvement in quality control
procedures. Data are not yet available on
nonfinancial private sector debt and
transactions involving financial derivatives,
resulting in large swings in errors and
omissions. Quarterly International Investment
Position (IIP) data have been compiled since
2002, and annual data are available since 1998.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Panama
On February 22, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Panama.1
Background
Panama’s economy rebounded quickly following the 2008–09 global crisis. Supported by strong
fundamentals, political stability, and prudent fiscal management, real GDP growth rates have
been among the highest in the region. Macroeconomic stability and policies to foster greater
social inclusion have reduced unemployment to historic lows and improved poverty indicators.
Following the 2009 slowdown, output grew by 7½ percent in 2010, and may grow by 10 percent
for the year in 2011. Construction, commerce and transportation have been the most dynamic
sectors, while canal traffic has been buoyed by strong demand from emerging Asia and South
America. High international commodity prices, combined with Value Added Tax (VAT) and
minimum wage increases, have pushed inflation above historical averages, with inflation in
2011 projected to be above 6 percent. The fiscal stance remained moderately expansionary in
2010–11, adding to domestic demand pressures. The widening of the external current account
deficit has continued to be driven by strong capital goods imports, related to the canal
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
expansion, but Foreign Direct Investment flows have also increased. Bank credit to the private
sector in 2010–11 grew at rates slightly above nominal GDP. A first-time Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) conducted in September 2011 confirmed that the financial system
is sound, and that it would remain adequately capitalized even under challenging external
conditions.
Panama’s macroeconomic outlook is favorable, with broadly balanced risks. The Panama Canal
expansion and the large public investment program are expected to sustain domestic demand.
Risks of overheating stemming from the strong domestic demand, tight labor markets and
inflation are expected to be offset by the easing uncertainties in world commodity markets. Key
medium-term challenges are to strengthen the fiscal framework, upgrade financial sector
supervision and infrastructure, and improve the quality of education and training to enhance
competitiveness and ensure sustained broad-based growth.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Panama’s remarkable resilience to external turbulence, on the
back of strong economic fundamentals and prudent policies. Robust economic growth and
steady fiscal consolidation have contributed to lowering the public debt ratio. The growth outlook
for 2012 is favorable, underpinned by large scale public investments, and overall vulnerabilities
are low. The priorities going forward are to build policy buffers, further increase financial sector
resilience, and foster sustained and more inclusive growth.
Directors considered that the envisaged neutral fiscal stance in 2012–13 is broadly appropriate,
although many saw merit in a somewhat tighter fiscal stance to rebuild buffers more rapidly and
help contain possible overheating pressures. With the implementation of the public investment
program, Directors underscored the importance of continuing to strengthen the fiscal framework
to enhance spending efficiency and improve public finance and liability management. Directors
welcomed the authorities’ efforts to strengthen revenue collection to provide room for social
spending and to enhance the effectiveness of such spending by better targeting subsidies. They
supported the plan to create a Sovereign Wealth Fund to save additional revenue from the
expanded Panama Canal, noting that the Social and Fiscal Responsibility Law will need to be
modified to anchor surpluses.
Directors welcomed the resilience of Panama’s financial system, while supporting continued
efforts to strengthen crisis prevention and the institutional and policy framework. They generally
saw merit in the authorities’ plans to establish a fund to respond to temporary liquidity shortages
in the financial system while aiming to avoid moral hazard. They also saw scope for
macroprudential tools in managing rapid credit growth in the absence of monetary policy.

3
Directors commended Panama’s success in establishing a strong banking center, which has
become an important regional hub. To compete globally and in a broader range of investment
and wealth management services, Panama will need to upgrade its financial sector supervision
and infrastructure. Risk based and consolidated banking supervision and oversight of non bank
segments will need to be enhanced. Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to
complete an AML/CFT assessment by end 2012.
Directors noted that Panama’s competitiveness has improved in recent years. The recently
approved Free Trade Agreement with the United States is expected to boost further Panama’s
status as a regional logistics hub. To continue to attract investment and promote employment,
Panama will need to further improve the business environment and the labor market. Directors
also stressed the importance of enhancing human capital and improving access to basic
services to foster inclusive growth.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Nogueira Batista, Exective Director for Panama
and Mr. Alfred Maciá, Advisor to the Executive Director
February 22, 2012
1. Our authorities welcome the constructive dialogue with staff in preparation of the Article
IV consultation and the FSAP. They also value the Fund’s technical assistance in the
drafting of the sovereign wealth fund and the public-private partnership legislation. Both
drafts of legislation should reach Congress by mid-2012.
2. Panama’s government remains engaged in mobilizing resources for its 5-year (2010–
2014) public investment strategy, key social programs for the most vulnerable, and the
conclusion of the Panama Canal expansion on target in 2014. Economic activity surged
by about 10.5 percent in 2011 compared to 7.5 percent in 2010. This rapid GDP growth
reflects the ongoing Canal expansion, other public investment programs, as well as strong
foreign direct investment (FDI). Output growth is projected to remain close to 7 percent
in 2012. The authorities expect that high growth will continue in the medium term despite
global uncertainties.
3. Panama’s investment performance has been outstanding. Data reported by IMF staff
indicate that public investment (including investment by the Panama Canal Authority)
increased by almost 40 percent at constant prices last year, after having expanded by
34 percent in 2010. Private investment contracted in 2009 and 2010, but recovered
markedly in 2011. As a result, the gross domestic rate of investment has reached 29
percent, one of the highest in the region.
4. Economic growth has remained broad-based. Commerce, transportation, construction,
communications, storage and mining have been the most dynamic sectors. Labor markets
have also improved. Open unemployment in 2011 fell to 2.9 percent compared to
4.7 percent in 2010, and 5.2 percent in 2009. Youth unemployment remains a concern,
affecting mainly women.
5. Average CPI inflation reached 5.9 percent compared to 3.5 percent in 2010. Strong
domestic demand, higher international prices in food, energy, and raw materials explain
most of the increase in inflation. CPI inflation is expected to moderate to about 5 percent
in 2012. The current account deficit is projected to exceed 12 percent of GDP in 2011
compared to 10.7 percent in 2010. Capital goods imports driven by the large public works
will continue to exert pressure on the balance of payment on current account. However,
most of the current account imbalance is covered by FDI. In the last two years, FDI has
averaged nearly 9 percent of GDP, as reported by staff.
6. In 2011, the fiscal stance came under pressure. Panama faced massive flooding nationwide at end-2010 with damaging effects to agriculture and infrastructure costing over
US$150 million. A national emergency was declared, condition that allowed, under the
Social and Fiscal Responsibility Law (SFRL), the fiscal deficit ceiling to be increased to
3 percent GDP in 2011. This freed resources to tackle flood-related public works.
Nevertheless, the final result is likely to have remained well below the revised SFRL

2
ceiling.
7. Revenues of the non financial public sector (NFPS) strengthened in 2011. Total revenues
increased by 13 percent relatively to 2010. Tax revenues increased 11.5 percent reflecting
the full impact of previous tax reforms and the VAT increase of 2 percent in mid-2010.
This revenue performance and prudent spending created the fiscal space for the public
investment program and poverty-related programs.
8. As indicated, public and private investment gained momentum in 2011. The rate of
project implementation exceeded 85 percent from 77 percent in 2009. Work on the new
Metro system began in 2011, and the Canal expansion is at its peak. The inner city
highway system and the construction of new airports and hospitals will accelerate in
2012. FDI has flowed mainly into the expansion of ports, tourism, electricity
transmission and energy infrastructure.
9. Panama was excluded from the OECD grey list as of last July 2011 after signing 11
double-taxation agreements (DTAs) and a tax information and exchange agreement
(TIEA) with the United States. Last October 2011, in Paris, our authorities personally
delivered to OECD’s Global Forum a report on the new laws to regulate the exchange of
information for tax purposes. In December 2011, France’s National Assembly approved
the DTA with Panama. The country will continue strengthening its legal framework on
tax information exchange and intends to sign DTA agreements with other nations.
10. On a separate note, in mid-2011, Fitch Ratings raised Panama credit rating to BBB from
BBB-. This was followed by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s placing the country in
“positive watch” for a possible upgrade in 2012. Also, last October, the United States
Congress ratified the Free Trade Agreement with Panama. These developments should
enhance the prospects for even larger FDI flows into Panama.
11. Our authorities welcomed the completion of the FSAP. The assessment reaffirms the
banking sector’s strong liquidity, profitability, and high capitalization. Credit risks are
low. Interbank contagion and cross-border risks to onshore banks are considered limited
though close monitoring is warranted. The authorities are giving priority to actions that
strengthen risk-based and consolidated cross-border supervision as well as non-bank
supervision. The Superintendence of Banks is also committed to strengthening bank
resolution and monitoring of systemic risks. The authorities concur that the pending
AML/CFT assessment should be implemented this year by IMF staff.
12. Lastly, President Martinelli’s administration continues to assign priority to targetedincome support programs. These programs aim at reducing poverty and improving
income distribution. In its latest survey, the Economic Commission for Latin America
and the Caribbean reports that poverty levels in Panama have fallen from 33.4 percent of
