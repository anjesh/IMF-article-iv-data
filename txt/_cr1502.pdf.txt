STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION AND
EIGHTH REVIEW UNDER THE POLICY SUPPORT INSTRUMENT

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Article IV issues. The government is committed to implementing the “Plan Sénégal Emergent”
(PSE), which contains valid diagnostics and policies to boost growth and accelerate poverty
reduction. GDP growth is projected to rise from less than 4 percent in recent years to 4.5
percent in 2014. Inflation remains low. Growth can potentially reach 7 percent by 2019 if PSErelated reforms are consistently and rapidly implemented. The authorities believe this growth
rate will be achieved two years earlier. The impact of Ebola on growth will be limited in 2014
but can become substantial in 2015 should the epidemic spread in the region.
Fiscal stance. The fiscal outlook has improved owing to stronger revenue performance and
expenditure control, and the overall deficit is expected to fall to about 5 percent of GDP in
2014. The 2015 budget targets a further reduction in the deficit to 4.7 percent of GDP, less
ambitious than the 4.0 percent of GDP recommended by staff. However, the authorities expect
to limit the deficit close to the level recommended by staff by holding back appropriations for
new public investment projects until feasibility studies are ready. Staff and authorities agreed
that Ebola-related shocks could add 0.3 percent of GDP to the deficit in 2015. The authorities
remain committed to bringing the fiscal deficit in line with the WAEMU target of 3 percent of
GDP in the medium term.
Structural reforms. The PSE offers an achievable development strategy, including the right
mix of private investment to be crowded in by public investment in both human capital and
infrastructure. However, unlocking private investment, including FDI, requires speeding up
reforms to the business climate and improving public sector governance. Frontloading public
investment without implementing the necessary structural reforms may jeopardize fiscal
targets and debt sustainability while failing to raise growth from its sub-par trend.
Program implementation. Performance under the PSI-supported program has been
satisfactory with end-June 2014 program targets met except for a minor breach of the nonconcessional borrowing ceiling due to weak debt management. This borrowing does not
materially affect debt sustainability, and debt management weaknesses are being addressed.
Staff recommends completion of the eighth PSI review and proposes a waiver of
nonobservance of the assessment criterion on non-concessional borrowing.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK AND RISKS
1.
Senegal’s political situation remains stable. The new government, formed after the recent
local elections, is committed to speed up implementation of the Plan Sénégal Emergent (PSE), the
authorities’ new development strategy. The PSE responds to chronic underperformance which is
reflected in the growing popular impatience at the slow pace of reforms, low growth, widespread
poverty, and high unemployment. The next presidential elections are expected to take place in 2017,
and there is a sense of urgency to deliver on long-overdue reforms and electoral promises.
2.
Challenges facing the new government remain substantial to push the economy to
realize its potential. The 2013 real GDP growth is estimated at 3.5 percent and may turn even
lower once the final data are published. For 2014, growth is expected to reach 4.5 percent, 0.4
percentage points below earlier estimates, reflecting an expected softening in the tourism sector
because of the Ebola epidemic compounded by the late start of the rainy season. Inflation remains
low. The current account deficit is expected to decline but would stay at about 10 percent of GDP
because of depressed exports and high import volumes, mainly of oil. If the projected oil price
decline continues, the current account will improve by about one percentage point in 2015 and the
medium term relative to the baseline. It is financed by a combination of non-concessional and
concessional borrowing.
3.
Successful PSE reforms could lift growth to 7 percent in the medium term driven by
FDI generated exports. FDI would be crowded in by reforms and investment in human capital and
public infrastructure. Economic activity would benefit from an expansion of globally competitive
production including investment in new sectors and substantial recovery in the mining and tourism
sectors. Growth would be anchored by increased electricity generation at lower cost, an improved
business climate, better governance, and public financial management.
4.
Risks to the PSE scenario are significant. The main risks are domestic and, therefore, under
the control of the authorities. They relate mainly to weak or slow implementation of the reforms
envisaged by the PSE, revenue shortfalls that would not allow sufficient mobilization of resources in
support of the PSE, failure to curb unproductive public consumption, and delays in raising
expenditure efficiency, in particular of domestically financed capital expenditure. The decline in oil
prices may lead to lower fiscal revenue, which will be largely offset by lower electricity subsidies if
corresponding policy actions are taken, with a marginal impact on the overall balance. Possible
exogenous shocks include spillovers from regional crises, including Ebola and the security situation
in neighboring countries and climatic shocks that would affect agriculture. External risks include
increases in the cost of public borrowing, should investors lose confidence in Senegal’s debt
servicing capacity, and the global effects of the unwinding of unconventional monetary policies.
Finally, potential spillovers from slower growth in advanced and/or emerging partners may affect
Senegal’s exports.
5.
The risks from Ebola are real and on the downside. A single imported case was
successfully treated and contained in September 2014. However, apprehensions about the epidemic
4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SENEGAL

are likely to affect the tourism sector during the peak period of November to April. In addition, the
closing of the border with Guinea will marginally affect exports. Staff agrees with the authorities’
estimate that the impact of Ebola will be relatively small, at about half a percent of GDP provided
the epidemic does not spread.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
6.
Discussions centered on policies to underpin the authorities’ development strategy
outlined in the PSE. Accordingly, policy discussions focused on (i) the authorities’ strategy to boost
growth, inclusiveness, and poverty reduction under the PSE; (ii) fiscal policies through the medium
term; (iii) public financial management reforms; (iv) external stability; (v) financial sector
development and stability; and (vi) business climate and private sector development.

A. Plan Senegal Emergent: Growth, Inclusiveness, Poverty Reduction
7.
Senegal’s growth in recent years has been sluggish, which has hampered inclusive
growth and poverty reduction. A period of relatively strong, although still under-par, growth in
1995–2005 of 4.5 percent led to a substantial decline in poverty from 68 to 48 percent. However, in
2006–2013 growth decelerated to an average of 3.4 percent, reflecting insufficiently broad and rapid
reforms to deal with a poor business climate, persistent problems in the energy sector, poor
infrastructure, low efficiency of public investment and significant unproductive public consumption
spending on subsidies, transfers and administrative overhead. In addition, Senegal was hit by a
series of exogenous shocks, such as the spikes in food and fuel prices, the global financial crisis,
regional droughts and floods, and more recently, the spillovers from Ebola. As a result, poverty has
declined only slightly in recent years and stands at about 47 percent. At the same time, debt ratios
have increased with total public debt projected to reach 49 percent of GDP in 2014. The fiscal deficit,
which was below 4 percent of GDP in 2007, steadily widened to 6.7 percent of GDP in 2011 before
undergoing renewed fiscal consolidation with the deficit falling by 1.6 percentage points over the
last three years to reach 5.2 percent of GDP in 2014.
8.
To exit the trap of low growth and high poverty, the government has developed an
ambitious program (“Plan Sénégal Emergent”, PSE). The PSE intends to make Senegal a hub for
West Africa by achieving high rates of equitably shared growth. It is articulated around three pillars:
(i) higher and sustainable growth through structural transformation; (ii) human development and
social protection; and (iii) improved governance, peace, and security. The PSE envisages structural
reforms to attract FDI and increase private investment. It also calls for constraining public
consumption and increasing public savings to generate fiscal space for higher public investment in
human capital and public infrastructure.
9.
International experience suggests that PSE growth targets are achievable in the long
run if appropriate policies are put in place. Since 1990, many countries have achieved the high
and sustained growth envisaged in the PSE by putting in place policy and institutional reforms. In
contrast, some countries that tried to grow based largely on increased government spending,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

SENEGAL

including Senegal in the recent past, ended up with more debt, and on average, worse growth. For
the PSE to succeed, the authorities will need to identify and distill the experience of comparator
countries to put in place the package of reforms required to attract FDI, increase the role of private
investment, and expand exports. The authorities are following up on staff recommendations to
identify a few comparator countries to develop an active peer learning effort accelerate the rollout
of reforms required for PSE to succeed.
10.
The authorities agree with staff that PSE success rests on accelerating reforms to boost
FDI and exports. The PSE offers good diagnostics and a sensible development strategy, including
the right mix of private investment (two thirds) that should be crowded in by more public
investment in both human capital and infrastructure. However, the risk is that required reforms are
neglected whilst public spending is increased. The staff encourages broad and speedy regulatory
reforms required to attract investors who currently hesitate to invest in Senegal.
11.
Growth unlocked by PSE-related reforms should be inclusive and job-rich. This will
require continued efforts to expand opportunities and job creation in emerging sectors based on
expanded FDI and in agriculture by raising productivity. The authorities are broadly receptive to staff
advice to (i) accelerate implementation of business climate reforms; (ii) improve governance to
provide certainty to investors; (iii) improve women’s access to resources and to property
rights;(iv)reform the state to more effectively deliver public services; (v) improve the impact of public
spending through PFM reforms including better public investment management; (vi) freeze public
consumption in real terms to create space for investment in human capital and public infrastructure;
and(vii) strengthen social safety nets based
on World Bank advice.

13.
Staff agrees that the PSE, if fully implemented, would unlock high growth. However,
opinions differed with respect to how fast it can be achieved. If the authorities can tackle difficult
outstanding structural reforms, they may be able to achieve their targeted growth path in the long
run. However, this would require accelerating, broadening and deepening reforms that would
mobilize FDI for globally competitive production more rapidly than currently planned. Interest
groups that favor the status quo remain entrenched and reforms may be implemented at a slower
pace than envisaged amid pressure to ramp up public investment. Consequently, the staff considers
that in 2015 growth will not exceed 4.6 percent and could reach 7 percent by 2019 if PSE-related
reforms are started immediately and implemented consistently. These staff projections are reflected
in the baseline.
14.
To mitigate the risks, reforms to improve public investment management should be
accelerated. The authorities are receptive to staff advice to (i) work with the World Bank, AfDB and
other development partners to ensure that only high quality projects are being accommodated; (ii)
base the 2015 budget on conservative growth assumptions, rather than on rapid growth dividends;
(iii) postpone public investment projects with low rates of return; (iv) include projects in the budget
only after rigorous vetting, and (v) launch a PFM reform project with Fund support and EU financing.

B. Fiscal Policy: Preserving Stability and Boosting Development Spending
Fiscal policy for the remainder of 2014
15.
For 2014, the authorities agreed with staff that achieving the fiscal deficit target of 5.2
percent of the revised GDP will send a positive signal. Donors and markets will welcome
adherence to the PSE principle that fiscal sustainability will not be compromised. This target is within
reach owing to a good revenue performance, in line with projections. The shortfall in tax revenue at
end-September was marginal and should be reabsorbed by end-December. However, upward
pressures persist on current spending, including from higher compensation to the national
electricity company (SENELEC). These deviations are offset by a lower wage bill, as the hiring of
contractual employees was reduced, and savings in consumption of other goods and services.
16.
The authorities intend to continue implementing tax policy and revenue
administration measures. They plan to reduce tax arrears and VAT credits. In addition, the revised
budget approved in October 2014 envisages an increase in the income and telecommunications
taxes effective January 1, 2015. Studies have been launched to assess new financial and
environmental taxes.
17.
Financing for the rest of the year has been secured. The budget will be financed mainly
by external concessional loans and borrowing on the regional market. In addition, for debt
management purposes, in July, the authorities issued a 10-year US$500 million Eurobond at 6.25
percent and a CFAF 100 billion Sukuk, its first Islamic bond. The proceeds will substitute for shorter
maturity domestic financing and reimburse part of the more expensive syndicated loan issued last
year.

18.
The Ebola outbreak requires immediate attention. In the wake of the single imported
case of Ebola, the authorities provided additional resources to the Ministry of Health in addition to
support received from development partners (WHO, UNDP). To mitigate macro-risks related to
Ebola, the authorities are also undertaking contingency planning. A team coordinated by the
Ministry of Finance (MoF) is preparing requests for additional and exceptional budget support from
development partners. Additional support should provide temporary assistance for programs that
can be worked out in advance with key operators in each sector in case Ebola has regional spillovers
or the impact from perceptions in the rest of the world adversely affects tourism and land, maritime
and air transport.

Fiscal policy for 2015 and the medium term
19.
The authorities submitted their draft 2015 budget to the National Assembly with a
fiscal deficit of 4.7 percent of GDP, reflecting fiscal consolidation of 0.5 percent of GDP. This
is slightly less ambitious than originally planned, as the authorities plan to quickly scale up
investment on PSE-related projects. On the revenue side, the budget assumes that stronger GDP
growth would expand the taxable base, which would allow raising additional revenue. Also, the
implementation of the new Tax Code is expected to bear full fruit. In addition, the authorities intend
to recover substantial amounts of unpaid taxes from previous years, strengthen tax and customs
administration, and rationalize taxation of the financial sector and telecommunication. On the
expenditure side, the budget incorporates spending equivalent to 2.1 percent of GDP for 27 key
PSE-related projects. To finance PSE-related investment, the authorities are taking policy measures
amounting to 1.5 percent of GDP and plan to borrow an additional 0.6 percent of GDP, if needed. To
create additional space for PSE-related investment, they also decided to keep public consumption
constant in real terms, including freezing the wage bill for all non front-line staff, and reorient lower
priority investment toward PSE-related projects.
20.
While fully sharing PSE priorities, staff recommended a less ambitious scaling up of
public investment in 2015, which would allow reducing the deficit to 4 percent of GDP
(Chart 2). Staff urged the authorities to

21.
The authorities responded that
they would take a cautious approach to the scaling up of public investment and introduce a
Precautionary Reserve Envelope (PRE). For 2015, the PRE involves freezing expenditure allocations
8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SENEGAL

for projects without feasibility studies. In the draft 2015 budget, the authorities included 10 PSErelated investment projects in the amount of CFAF 52 bn (0.7 percent of GDP) that would be put in
the reserve. The Ministry of Finance would release funding for these projects only after line
ministries complete acceptable feasibility studies. In the authorities’ view, this measure would
provide a valuable safeguard against a too-rapid increase in public investment spending. A more
comprehensive version of the PRE would be introduced starting from the 2016 budget.
22.
The authorities expressed concerns regarding possible revenue shortfalls related to
the Ebola epidemic in the region. They estimated the overall impact from the epidemic on the
fiscal deficit in 2015 could reach about 0.3 percent of GDP, mainly in the form of lost revenue related
to tourism. The impact may be larger if the epidemic is not contained, with an impact on public
spending. The authorities intend to reflect the impact of Ebola on the public finances in a
supplementary budget later in 2015 once they have more clarity. Staff agreed that a fiscal shock
stemming from Ebola should be accommodated.
23.
In view of the risks to the 2015 fiscal outlook, staff encouraged the authorities to
consider additional fiscals measures (Box 1). For the medium term, the authorities intend to
maintain the envisaged fiscal consolidation path. By 2019, the authorities plan to bring the fiscal
deficit to the WAEMU target of 3 percent of GDP.

24.
To maintain long-run fiscal sustainability, the authorities are considering to anchor
fiscal policy on a debt path consistent with debt sustainability. In particular, staff welcomes the
authorities’ decision to keep the debt-to-GDP ratio below 52 percent, lower than the WAEMU
convergence criterion (70 percent). This level is consistent with the authorities declared intention in
the PSE that new investments should be accommodated with corresponding cuts in public
consumption or additional revenues, without any recourse to additional debt. Staff recommends
that this debt path be announced in the budget with a commitment that in case of a deviation, the
following budget would include a list of actions aimed at putting the debt back on the original path
within four years. The Minister of Finance would also be required to explain to the National
Assembly the reasons for the initial deviation. In the course of 2015 these provisions could be
enshrined into law. The authorities have broadly agreed with these recommendations.
25.
To improve traction for key PSE-related reforms, staff suggests that the authorities
map each critical reform to the personal responsibility of an official. For this purpose, a team
could be set up within the Ministry of Finance with the mandate to lead the reform effort. The team
could consist of public officials who in addition to their normal duties would take on specific tasks to
monitor the implementation of reforms. The team would develop timelines with key milestones for
each reform, and in case of slippages recommend corrective action. The team could also be asked to
identify comparator countries with which to develop an active collaboration program. Practitioners
with experience in the reforms would share their experience and provide advice on how Senegal
might approach the reforms. These proposals would then be passed on to the Minister of Finance
who would seek approval from government. The authorities are beginning to move in this direction
as part of the reflection on how best to mobilize support from the Fund and other development
partners for the PSE.
26.
Finally, the authorities intend to continue improving fiscal transparency. Quarterly
budget appropriations and their execution will be published on the website of the Ministry of
Finance in a form accessible to the public and the finance commission of the National Assembly.

C. Public Financial Management Structural Reforms
27.
Implementation of the PSE would benefit from efforts on budget institutions. Staff
welcomes the authorities’ interest to reform their institutional framework and strengthen
transparency and fiscal discipline. The reallocation of resources required by the PSE entails stronger
budget institutions with regard to fiscal policy design, public investment management, and budget
implementation.
28.
Fiscal policy design should be anchored in a medium-term budget framework (MTBF).
Senegal has been working on an MTBF for the past year in compliance with the 2011 PFM law. The
publication of a first MTBF could be targeted during the course of 2015. This document should
present the aforementioned debt path and explain the macro-fiscal policy strategy over the next
three years consistent with it. In particular, the MTBF should discuss the sustainability of the wage
bill and large public investment projects. Subsequent versions of the MTBF should clearly explain

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SENEGAL

deviations from the previous document and, if necessary, state corrective measures to meet the
macro-fiscal targets. To support these efforts, spending reviews could be conducted in specific
sectors. The authorities are working towards introducing MTBF, including with technical assistance
from development partners.
29.
Public investment management (PIM) needs further improvement. Senegal has already
implemented several good practices in PIM even if some arrangements, such as feasibility studies
and socio-economic assessments, need significant improvement. Staff welcomes recent efforts to
reclassify non-capital spending from the investment to the recurrent budget and encourages the
authorities to finalize this initiative. Next steps could focus on improving information on both
financial and physical execution of investment with respect to coverage, timeliness, and accuracy.
This should cover internally and externally funded projects, as well as those implemented by
agencies and would require IT management improvements. The public investment plan could be
strengthened and anchored to the MTBF, to ensure availability of resources for the life of each
project. Ex-ante and ex-post assessments of projects should also be developed, with a focus on
large or risky projects. The authorities are aware of the problems related to PIM and plan to address
them as part of the ongoing PFM reforms.
30.
Budget execution management needs to progress alongside other reforms. PSE success
depends on re-composition of the budget, for which strong budget institutions are critical (Chart 3).
In turn, PFM reforms should improve both budget preparation and execution. In Senegal, public
agencies represent a significant challenge to fiscal discipline and sustainability as their decision can
have medium to long term impact on public finances (payroll, multi-year commitments). The
execution process should provide sufficient room to face contingencies including an adverse
macroeconomic environment. A mid-year review of budget execution, including projections for the
remainder of the year, could help manage strategic execution. The authorities agreed with staff
recommendations and requested technical assistance from the Fund on fiscal policy design, efficient
public investment management, and fiscal discipline in budget execution.

31.
In particular, the staff welcomes first steps for the introduction of a “Precautionary
Reserve Envelope” (PRE) process in 2015, which should be developed further in the medium
term. The fully-fledged PRE would be a strengthened version of the regulations already put in place
by the Ministry of Finance to face in-year contingencies (5% of current and capital expenditure). To
be credible, the PRE must identify specific measures subject to a freeze. For instance, the PRE could
cover all net creation of positions, excluding front line staff in health and education (nurses, doctors
and teachers) and in the security services, as well as budget lines for equipment. The staff advises on
a minimum envelope of some 0.5 percent of GDP to be included in the PRE process in 2015 and
beyond, to cover potential adverse macroeconomic developments. Funds from the reserves should
be released taking into consideration positive cost-benefit calculations, environmental factors,
access to concessional financing, overall revenue performance, or other relevant factors.

The agency reform plan should be consistently implemented with regular updates
presented to the National Assembly. In line with earlier commitments, the authorities are strongly
encouraged to close, as rapidly as possible, the 16 agencies identified in the reform plan and merge
eight other agencies into three agencies. Pending dissolution of agencies identified for closure, only
the wage bill should be financed for such entities. Reports on the monitoring of budget execution
by the agencies should be produced and published on the website of the Ministry of Finance. The
2015 budget law includes an annex with the complete list of agencies and funds and an update on
the implementation of the agency reform plan. The authorities are encouraged to prepare
performance contracts for all agencies and monitor closely their reform process. New agencies
should not be created without a prior cost-benefit analysis of their feasibility. The authorities are
working on the implementation of the agency reform plan.
33.
The efforts to implement the single treasury account have been insufficient and
should be pursued with determination. To help accelerate movement to a single treasury account,
the staff encourages the authorities to introduce a procedure whereby the appropriations to any
department or agency will be released only at the level of spending in 2014 until they have closed
their accounts and integrated them into the single Treasury account system. The authorities took
note of these recommendations.

D. External Stability Assessment
34.
The external stability assessment suggests that the main external risk is the large
current account deficit. Although Senegal’s exchange rate shows no significant signs of
misalignment, Senegal’s current account deficit remains high, at about 10 percent of GDP but may
improve by about one percentage point if the projected oil price decline continues (Table 3).1
Improvements registered since 2012 are likely to be wiped out in 2014 by the impact of Ebola, as
well as the tardy onset of the rainy season. The positive impacts of the PSE including fiscal
consolidation should reduce the deficit in the long-term. However, it will remain above 8 percent in
the medium term. Until recently, current account deficits were financed mainly by grants and
concessional borrowing. However, the country is increasingly exposed to shifting market sentiment
as a result of increased non-concessional borrowing, including Eurobonds.
35.
Senegal is showing signs of eroding competitiveness, with lagging export and FDI
growth compared to peers. Senegal’s global market share has barely increased over the past
decade, and the contribution of exports to GDP has remained around 25 percent. The country also
lags behind its peers in attracting FDI, whilst remittances, at 11 percent of GDP, have remained an
important and stable source of foreign exchange. For the last few years, Senegal has received about
2 percent of GDP in FDI, compared to an average of over 7 percent for other lower middle-income

Senegal, a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), accepted the obligations under
Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3 and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, and maintains an exchange system free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. The WAEMU’s exchange
regime is a conventional peg to the euro.

SSA countries. Other weak areas include access to credit, enforcement of contract and property
rights. Irrespective of recent improvement, the overall ranking of Senegal on competitiveness
remains low (Chart 4).

While Senegal’s export base is relatively well diversified, high-quality exports bear a
comparatively low weight. Senegal faces difficulties in quality upgrading compared to three
benchmark countries. Sectors for which the quality of exported products is comparatively low, such
as food and live animals, constitute a large share of exported products (Chart 5). With Senegal’s
labor force concentrated in agriculture, policies fostering agricultural product quality may be useful
to supplement FDI driven export diversification.

37.
The probability of debt distress remains low in the baseline scenario. In this scenario, all
the debt burden indicators remain below their policy-dependent indicative thresholds, and debt
ratios in present value (PV) terms are lower than in the previous debt sustainability analysis (Figure
6). These improvements reflect institutional reforms that have raised Senegal’s CPIA rating. The
external PPG debt ratios remain below their respective thresholds in the baseline scenarios. Two
spikes in debt service reflect the assumption of the repayment of the Eurobonds at maturity, which
would lead to two small and temporary breaches under the most extreme stress test (a 30 percent
depreciation of the currency).
38.
Under an alternative scenario with higher spending and higher debt accumulation,
there is some deterioration in debt burden indicators 2 (Figure 7). The indicators remain below
their policy-dependent thresholds, but the PV of debt to GDP ratio and the PV of debt-to-exports
ratio deteriorate somewhat, even assuming faster growth than in the baseline. This suggests that
with higher capital spending and debt accumulation, Senegal could be at risk of losing its “low risk”
rating, if growth dividends do not materialize,
39.
Measures to unlock FDI-driven exports, fiscal restraint and prudent debt management
will be critical to averting external stability risks. The external position will be helped by
achieving the PSE targets for export diversification driven by FDI and continued efforts in fiscal
consolidation, supported by the proposed PSE debt anchor. However, the authorities will need to
continue exercising caution in resorting to non-concessional borrowing. The authorities reiterated
their commitment to vigilant debt management, noting that they are monitoring closely not only
2

This scenario assumes that higher capital spending boosts the fiscal deficit by about 0.7 percentage point of GDP in
2015-19, growth is assumed to increase by 1 percentage point over the same period.

debt sustainability risks, but also rollover risks. Staff and the authorities agreed on the need to
intensify efforts to boost Senegal’s competitiveness, drawing on the experience of peers.

E. Financial Sector Development and Stability
40.
Senegal’s banking sector shares the vulnerabilities identified at the WAEMU level and
financial depth remains limited (Chart 6). The financial system is relatively well capitalized. Apart
from concentration risks, there do not seem to be significant risks to financial stability at this point.
Senegal’s financial sector remains dominated by a few banks (four of them international), with a
rapidly rising microfinance sector. As in the rest of WAEMU, asset quality is an issue, underscored by
relatively high nonperforming loans, as well as high concentration risks. Staff encourages the
authorities to liaise with the banking commission and WAEMU authorities in case potential stability
risks occur. The authorities plan to take steps in this direction.

The financial sector is broadly sound but the high level of non-performing loans needs
to be kept under review in close coordination with the BCEAO and WAEMU Banking
Commission. The relatively high level of NPLs (20 percent) is attributable to a few enterprises, one
of which in the chemical sector has been recently recapitalized, with the new owner promising to
repay its debt. The main risks in the financial sector could come from a failure to implement the
reforms that would raise growth to levels envisaged in the PSE and achieved by comparator
countries. The authorities have welcomed staff suggestions that they pick four to five of the
comparator countries which could provide useful insight for Senegal and review the institutional

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SENEGAL

arrangements and policy actions they have taken to safeguard their financial sector. Based on this
review, which should be completed during the course of 2015, actions which require collective
decisions at the WAEMU level could be identified.
42.
The authorities are implementing a strategy to improve access to financing. In 2013,
three financial institutions were established: the Fonds de Garantie des Investissements Prioritaires
(FONGIP) aimed at lowering lending rates for small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) by
providing a system of mutual guarantee, the Fonds Souverain d’Investissements Stratégiques
(FONSIS) for direct assistance to SMEs through the provision of funding and the Banque Nationale
pour le Développement Economique (BNDE). All three institutions only have few months of activity as
they are still establishing themselves in the financial system and seeking additional funding
preferably at concessional terms.
43.
The authorities are also working to strengthen the banking system resilience,
including the issue of NPLs. More specifically, the authorities are working on: (i) a strategy to
improve financial information through the development of credit bureaus; (ii) increasing the role of
collateral and reducing informational asymmetries; (iii) improving banking crisis resolution
mechanisms in line with IMF recommendations at the WAEMU level, as potential costs coming from
bank resolutions could translate into fiscal costs for Senegal. Staff welcomes this course of action
and encourages the authorities to accelerate these reforms and work with regional authorities to
strengthen banking system resilience.

F. Business Climate and Private Sector Development
44.
For the PSE to succeed, Senegal will need to improve its business climate. Senegal has
few legal impediments to trade and investment, but it continues to rank among the lowest in the
World Bank ease of doing business survey. In the 2015 Doing Business report, Senegal ranks 161th,
up from 171th in 2014. Senegal is among the top 10 countries that have made significant progress
in improving their business environment. However much remains to be done to put in place a sound
business environment and promote private investment, as Senegal still ranks behind its peers in the
regions, such as Mali, Côte d'Ivoire, Togo and Benin. The efforts to improve the business climate
would need to be accelerated along the lines, inter alia, of Rwanda and Mauritius, which experienced
rapid improvements. Staff welcomes reforms to improve access to credit, streamline regulations, and
strengthen investor protection and property rights. Additional measures to improve the business
environment are still needed (Box 2). The authorities plan to follow up on these recommendations in
cooperation with the World Bank.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

SENEGAL

Box 2. Measures to Improve the Business Climate


Reduce the minimum capital requirement to make it easier to start a business.



Reduce the time for obtaining construction permits.


Replace the requirement for authorization from the tax authority with a notification requirement,
and create a single step for the property transfer at the land registry.

Introduce WAEMU regulations on licensing and operation of credit bureaus to improve the credit
information system.

Strengthen minority investor protections by introducing greater requirements for disclosure of
related-party transactions to the board of directors; making it possible to inspect the documents on relatedparty transactions and appoint auditors to conduct inspections and for shareholder plaintiffs to request
documents relevant to the subject of the claim during the trial.


Abolish the vehicle tax.



Make it possible to download the declaration forms for VAT online to simplify tax payments.

45.
Senegal should also continue promoting the removal of barriers to the movement of
trade and factors in the context of regional agreements. The free flow of labor and capital is
critical to complement the free flow of goods and services. It is particularly important to open the
labor market for productive employment in Senegal and to ensure that the skills required to sustain
growth are readily available to investors. Skill mismatches that may exclude some Senegalese
workers should be addressed directly by retraining rather than by restricting the hiring of needed
skills from elsewhere in the region. The authorities were receptive to these recommendations and
plan to work with other WAEMU members on their implementation.
46.
Reforms in the energy sector are underway but recurrent delays hamper private sector
development and add pressures on the budget. The authorities’ estimate in their 2015 budget
that the direct costs (tariff compensation to SENELEC, investment, etc.) and indirect costs (mainly
customs and tax arrears by SENELEC) may amount to CFAF 230 billion (2.8 percent of GDP) (Chart 7).
These subsidies tend to benefit the suppliers of inputs to SENELEC and the better-off who consume
the bulk of electricity. At the same time, the expansion of power generation lags dismally behind
and unreliable electricity provision hampers economic and social development. The 2015 level of
subsidies to SENELEC may be substantially lower if the projected drop in oil prices materializes.

Chart 7. Total Support to the Energy Sector
(in CFAF billion / Percent of GDP)
The energy sector weighs heavily on public financing with the total annual support exceeding 2.8 percent of GDP

See SIP, chapter 5 for details.

47.
The authorities are implementing a comprehensive electricity sector reform program
with support from development partners. The authorities’ strategy is to invest in lower-cost
electricity generation, which would lower electricity prices and eliminate subsidies whilst increasing
production to a level commensurate with Senegal’s development needs. But repeated revisions of
the investment plan have delayed the introduction of lower-cost generation capacity, and budgetary
subsidies remain high. Staff encourages the authorities to accelerate reforms in the energy sector
and to continue to improve transparency. The World Bank and the African Development Bank will
have the lead on this issue. Staff reiterates the importance of contingency planning at the
investment plan and budget level to avoid unexpected fiscal costs from delays. Further action on
lowering electricity costs is critical as the decline in oil prices, even if sustained, would not eliminate
subsidies.
48.
Reforms should ensure
that new jobs are created and
the social safety nets are
effective with benefits shared
equitably. The overall spending
on social safety nets in Senegal is
substantially below many other
SSA countries. Action is
particularly important in Senegal
as most people are vulnerable to
shocks (Chart 8). Some of the
growth dividends of the PSE
would need to be invested to
gradually expand the social

safety net whilst promoting empowerment and emphasizing conditional cash transfers. To promote
social welfare and ensure that the benefits of growth are fairly shared, the staff urges the authorities
to create space for expanding the private formal sector through simplified regulations, especially for
start-ups and SMEs, and through a labor market reform that would protect workers rather than jobs.
This would require making it relatively easy, inexpensive and fast for firms to lay off staff (together
with some provisions for legal action by Government in the case of unfair dismissals). However, to
protect workers, Government would need to provide support during a reasonable period of job
search and may need to subsidize on the job training where skills may need to be improved.

PROGRAM ISSUES
49.
Program performance has been satisfactory except for a minor breach in nonconcessional borrowing due to debt management weaknesses. The authorities have met the
end-June quantitative criteria and indicative targets. The end-June fiscal deficit amounted to 170
billion, much lower than programmed 198 billion. Revenue was slightly above the indicative target,
reflecting measures to reinforce tax administration. Expenditure execution, particularly investment
spending, was slower than programmed because of continuous weak planning and implementation
capacity, The ceiling on non-concessional borrowing, a continuous AC under the PSI program, was
breached at end-September 2014 by $65 million (0.4 percent of GDP) due to a failure to properly
classify as non-concessional a Turkish Ex-Im Bank loan with 11 percent concessionality. Initially the
loan was expected to be semi-concessional thanks to an expected grant that failed to materialize.
The ceiling was breached in September 2014 after the $500 million euro bond was issued in July.
The breach is not material for debt sustainability. All structural benchmarks were met (Text Table 1).
Program performance remained in line with projections through September but, based on
preliminary information, the indicative revenue target may have been missed by a small amount
(0.1 percent of GDP).

51.
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance and program monitoring, although
problems remain. There are still weaknesses in data on national accounts, social indicators and
government financial statistics. The authorities are reforming the national statistical agency to
improve the quality of data, partially relying on technical assistance from the Fund, other
international organizations, and donors. As part of these reforms, the authorities intend to formulate
a roadmap towards adhering to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).

STAFF APPRAISAL
52.
Continued prudent policies have helped preserve macroeconomic stability but slow
implementation of structural reforms continues to weigh down growth. Growth remains too
low to make a dent in the high poverty and unemployment levels. Efforts to increase revenue
collection and rationalize public expenditure have helped to control budget deficits and debt
accumulation. However, structural reforms, in particular in the macro-critical energy sector have
been slow, with distortive energy subsidies weighing heavily on the budget and electricity blackouts
hampering growth. In view of these challenges, the authorities have developed a new growth
strategy, the Plan Senegal Emergent (PSE).
53.
The PSE presents a unique opportunity to unlock a broad-based and inclusive growth
that will make Senegal a regional hub and an emerging economy. Economic policies and
structural reforms included in the PSE should allow Senegal to achieve and sustain high and
inclusive growth. Staff agrees with the authorities that economic and social emergence requires the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

SENEGAL

maintenance of a sound economic framework and the acceleration of reforms to enhance
productivity and improve the business environment. The goal of a 7 to 8 percent annual growth is
feasible in the medium term but would require a broadening, deepening, and speeding up of
structural reforms, as well as constraining public consumption to create the fiscal space for
implementation of PSE-related projects. Growth acceleration can be achieved only gradually as it
would require substantial improvements in the regulatory framework and governance, as well as in
the quality and efficiency of public investment together with actions to rein in public consumption.
Staff encourages the authorities to instill realism in their growth projections, which will improve
credibility and strengthen support for their plans.
54.
Fiscal reforms should continue to preserve fiscal and debt sustainability. Staff would
have preferred a more cautious scaling up of public investment in 2015, maintaining the original
fiscal consolidation path. Staff welcomes the initiative to establish a precautionary reserve envelope
and the commitment to release funding only for projects with proper feasibility studies. If wellimplemented, this should raise the efficiency of public investment. Staff agreed that the impact of
Ebola on public finances should be accommodated.
55.
Additional fiscal space for PSE-related and social spending should be secured through
increasing revenue—particularly collecting tax arrears, freezing public consumption in real
terms, and improving the composition of spending. The authorities are encouraged to reallocate
spending from low priority items, such as electricity subsidies, untargeted tertiary education
scholarships, and administrative overhead (including the wage bill), to investment in human capital
and public infrastructure. In particular, staff urges the authorities to change the accountability
framework to ensure implementation of their energy sector investment plan to expand low cost
production and reduce subsidies to the electricity company. Staff also encourages the authorities to
work closely with development partners to strengthen project design, preparation and execution
while ensuring the overall quality and efficiency of public investment.
56.
Staff encourages the authorities to anchor their fiscal policy on long-term debt
sustainability within a medium-term budget framework. The sustainable debt path should be
announced in the budget with a commitment that in case of a deviation, the next budget would
include a list of actions aimed at putting the debt back on the original path within four years.
Medium-term fiscal consolidation remains critical to ensure that Senegal’s public debt burden is
sustainable and the risk of debt distress remains low. Staff urges the authorities to reach the
WAEMU convergence criteria on the fiscal deficit of 3 percent of GDP by 2019.
57.
Continued efforts will be needed to improve further public financial management,
budget institutions, and economic governance. Reform efforts should focus on key areas that can
support the implementation of the PSE. These areas include macro-fiscal policy design leading to a
gradual development of a medium-term expenditure framework, better focus of PFM reforms on
reporting and the assessment of the socio-economic impact of investment, and improved fiscal
discipline in budget execution including policies implemented by public agencies.

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SENEGAL

58.
Strong resolve is needed to move ahead with macro-critical structural reforms, which
are essential for the success of the PSE. Staff commends the authorities for recent progress in
improving the business environment and promoting private sector development, as well as
courageous steps in reforming university scholarships. Staff welcomes broadening and speeding
efforts to alleviate the burden of doing business and identify regulatory changes required to attract
private investors. Staff also urges the authorities to accelerate the reform of the energy sector to
boost electricity generation while achieving a lower cost. Reform implementation could be
facilitated by peer learning arrangements with successful comparator countries.
59.
The outlook for the Senegalese economy is positive, but risks are significant although
manageable. PSE success depends on defining and rapidly implementing a critical mass of reforms,
some of which rest in the public area but most aim at unlocking the potential of the private sector
through investment and export. Risks are mainly domestic and regional, and relate to weak
implementation of the reforms envisaged by the PSE, possible revenue shortfalls, and the impact of
the regional Ebola epidemic. External risks include possible increases in the cost of public borrowing,
global effects of the unwinding of unconventional monetary policies. Finally, potential spillovers
from a protracted period of slower growth in partner countries may hurt growth.
60.
Staff proposes a waiver for nonobservance of the assessment criterion and
recommends completion of the eighth PSI review. All quantitative assessment criteria and
indicative targets for end-June 2014 were met, with the exception of the ceiling on nonconcessional
borrowing missed at end-September.
61.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place within 24–months
subject to the decision on consultation cycles for program countries.

Table 1. Senegal: External Sector Vulnerabilities
Overall assessment: Senegal’s
external position remains weak,
primarily owing to its twin
deficits. External stability risks are
manageable provided fiscal policy
remains prudent.

Current account: high as a
percent of GDP and coupled with
high fiscal deficit

Background. Low savings relative to investment needs have led to substantial
current account deficits, of about 10 percent of GDP.
Potential policy responses. Fiscal consolidation and prudent borrowing should
help in managing external vulnerabilities in the medium term. The real exchange
rate is broadly in line with fundamentals, but structural reforms are needed to
boost growth, increase competitiveness, and reduce external vulnerabilities.
Background. The domestic savings rate is low, while investment needs are high.
Despite large remittances, this generates high current account deficits of about 10
percent of GDP, which are covered partly by capital grants but increasingly nonconcessional financing. The current account deficit reflects high fiscal deficits, as
well as exogenous factors (e.g., oil prices, drought).
Assessment. The current account deficit needs to decrease in the next few years
to remain financeable and avoid dependency on grants and non-concessional
borrowing. Fiscal consolidation will also be critical.
Background. Senegal is part of the WAEMU, whose CFA franc is pegged to the
euro.

Real exchange rate: no
significant misalignment

Capital and financial account:
dependency on donor inflows
and market sentiment

FX reserves: adequate level

Assessment. The three CGER methods do not suggest a significant misalignment
(with results based on end-2013 data ranging from -8 to +4 percent). These
findings are in line with those for the WAEMU. Competitiveness could be
strengthened through structural reforms to improve the business environment.
Background. Official flows (both program and project) have accounted for a
significant share of financing in recent years. FDI and portfolio investment are less
significant. The overall balance recorded a deficit in 2013, but is expected to
record a small surplus in 2014.
Assessment. The sustainability of capital account flows rests mainly on donor and
market sentiment toward Senegal’s government, which depends on forceful fiscal
consolidation and implementation of strong structural reforms to boost growth.
Background. WAEMU reserves currently amount to 4.7 months of prospective
imports, 50 percent of broad money, and about 91 percent of short-term
liabilities. These common reserves can be used to finance the needs of individual
WAEMU countries.
Assessment. The level of foreign exchange reserves of the WAEMU is adequate,
although at the low end of the optimal reserves range.

Foreign assets and liabilities
position: fiscal consolidation
required to balance a negative IIP
position

Background. Gross external debt is at 32 percent of GDP and has increased
substantially in the past few years. It consists mainly of concessional loans from
official creditors, but commercial debt is increasing.
Assessment. The net IIP position at -30 percent of GDP in 2013 currently presents
limited risk. The DSA shows that fiscal consolidation is required to stabilize it.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view
of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to
indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The
RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually
exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Table 3. Senegal: Authorities’ Response to the 2012 Article IV Policy Recommendations
Article IV Recommendations

Authorities’ Response
Fiscal policies to reduce vulnerabilities and foster inclusiveness

1. Preserve fiscal sustainability
and reconstitute fiscal buffers.
Lower the deficit to below 5
percent of GDP in 2013 and 4
percent by 2015.
2. Should adverse exogenous
shocks materialize, fiscal
consolidation efforts could be
reduced to accommodate their
impact.
3. Pursue forcefully
expenditure control and
rationalization, with more
attention to distributional
issues.
4. Implement the ambitious
reform of the tax code.
5. Strengthen debt
management and borrow
safely.
6. Strike a balance between
ambition and realism for
growth objectives, and be
mindful of the tradeoffs
between public investment,
growth, and debt sustainability.
7. Pay attention to
inclusiveness.

1. Broadly positive response. Fiscal sustainability has been preserved albeit with slower
consolidation than initially anticipated. The 2013 deficit was 5.5 percent of GDP.

2. Mixed response. While deviation from the fiscal consolidation path in 2013 was partially
motivated by floods and security needs due to conflicts in Mali, some deviations could not be
explained by exogenous factors and were policy driven.

3. Partially positive response. The authorities have started implementing the recommendations
TA from the Fund on expenditure rationalization and started implementing its recommendation.
Action is being initiated to target scholarships for tertiary education and the actual wage bill has
been better identified. However, major corrective action is yet to be taken. Although attention to
distributional issues increased, including in the Plan Sénégal Emergent (PSE), very few specific
policy actions have been taken to address them.
4. Positive response. The new Tax Code has been developed and implemented, and authorities
are dealing with transitional difficulties in its practical application.
5. Positive response. A new debt management strategy has been developed and a debt
management office has been established, although some coordination challenges remain.
Policies to rekindle growth
6. Mixed response. There has been a systematic bias in overestimating growth and structural
reform implementation has lagged. The PSE represents a welcome step towards unlocking higher
growth through far-reaching reforms, but the short-term growth impact is likely to be
overestimated.

7. Mixed response. The authorities achieved modest progress in poverty reduction with the
benefits of growth progressively distributed, conducted a comprehensive household survey and
made inclusiveness a strategic pillar of the PSE. However, more forceful policy initiatives may be
required to make more decisive progress.
8. Poor response. Senegal fell back in rank in the 2013 and 2014 Doing Business surveys and has

Appendix. Letter of Intent
Dakar, December 2, 2014
Madame Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C., 20431
USA

Madame Managing Director,
1.

The government of Senegal requests completion of the eighth and final review under the

Policy Support Instrument (PSI) of its macroeconomic program. The focus of the PSI is on increasing
growth and reducing vulnerabilities and poverty in particular by maintaining macroeconomic
stability and improving the business environment.
2.

Macroeconomic performance has been satisfactory in the first half of the year. The quarterly

indicators show economic activity strengthening further while inflation remains relatively low.
Revenue performance improved markedly, amounting to CFAF 746 billion at end-June compared to
an original objective of CFAF 730 billion. This increase coupled with a relative under-execution of
spending has resulted in a budget deficit of CFAF 170 billion compared to a target of CFAF 198
billion.
3.

Program implementation has remained satisfactory. All quantitative criteria and indicative

targets under the program at end-June 2014 were met. However, the continuous criterion on the
level of nonconcessional borrowing has not been observed since September, following the issuance
of Eurobonds amounting to US$500 million. Total nonconcessional borrowing now amounts to CFAF
281billion, compared to CFAF 250 billion adopted under the program. There are two main factors
underlying this overrun. First, a loan of CFAF 31.8 billion (34 million Euros) contracted with EXIM
Bank of Turkey could not be classified as a semi-concessional loan because, contrary to our
expectations, the total grant subsidy resources only amounted to a grant element of 11 percent thus
falling short of the required 15 percent threshold under the definition on semi-concessional loans.
Second, in spite of this, we had to proceed with the Eurobond issuance of 500 million dollars as this
is the minimum required to obtain favorable terms on international markets. However, despite the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

41

SENEGAL

deviation observed, our debt level remains viable and we remain committed to pursuing a prudent
debt management policy.
4.

Significant progress has also been made in implementing reforms. In the fiscal area, the

measures implemented have focused mainly on improving tax revenue collection and the
transparency and efficiency of public resources, although the implementation of various measures
has taken somewhat longer than expected. Performance contracts have been signed with the five
largest public agencies. Further, the 2015 draft budget law includes an annex with a complete list of
agencies and funds as well as an update on the implementation of the plan to restructure the
agencies and another annex containing an estimate and analysis of direct and indirect budget
support for energy prices. It should also be underscored that no new agencies have been
established since the last review. Cost-benefit analyses have been carried out on five large
investment projects. Summaries of these reports have been submitted to the National Assembly at
the same time as the 2015 draft budget law. Regarding structural reforms, progress has also been
made in several sectors, notably steps to encourage private sector development, reform the energy
sector, and foster financial deepening.
5.

The macroeconomic outlook for 2014 and for the medium-term remains positive. In 2014,

taking into account the impact of the Ebola epidemic and the late start of the rainy season, the
growth rate is likely to reach 4.5 percent (compared to the initial target of 4.9 percent). The
secondary sector recovered faster than expected reflecting the favorable performance of
construction and public works, cement, and sugar and leather production sectors. Continued efforts
to mobilize resources and streamline spending should make it possible to achieve the budget deficit
target of 5.2 percent of GDP, following 5.5 percent in 2013.
6.

Nevertheless, Senegal’s economy continues to be characterized by low growth, owing

essentially to a business environment that is not very attractive because of inadequate productivity
levels, limited infrastructure, and difficulty accessing factors of production. This sluggish economic
growth is also attributable to delays in implementing reforms, particularly in the energy sector, as
well as to problems with the efficiency of public spending and the resistance to change of some
economic players.
7.

In that context, Senegal has devised a new development strategy to spur its progress

towards emergence. This strategy, known as the Plan Sénégal Émergent (PSE), provides a framework
for the implementation of economic and social policy over the medium to long term. It emphasizes
(i) structural transformation of the economy by consolidating the existing drivers of growth and
developing new sectors with strong potential for enhancing wealth- and job-creation as well as

42

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SENEGAL

social inclusion; (ii) improving the well-being of the population as a whole by protecting vulnerable
groups and ensuring access to basic social services; and (iii) strengthening governance, promoting
peace and security, and consolidating the rule of law.
8.

Effective implementation of the PSE is expected to make it possible to achieve a growth rate

of 5.4 percent in 2015. Growth is set to be driven by stronger agricultural performance and ongoing
recovery in the secondary sector. In the agricultural sector, the government is continuing with the
repair, rehabilitation, and building of hydro-agricultural schemes and works. In 2015, the attendant
plans for the valley include the: implementation and rehabilitation of hydro-agricultural schemes,
4,024 ha and 1,950 ha, respectively, strengthening of agricultural equipment, increased production
of certified seeds (14,400 metric tons), and fertilizer purchases, as well as the development of
storage infrastructure (50 warehouses with a unit storage capacity of 300 metric tons). In turn,
buoyancy in the extractive and chemical industries—boosted mainly by the opening up of the
capital of Industries Chimiques du Sénégal to Indonesian private investors—as well as in the BTP and
cement sectors is expected to spur the recovery in the secondary sector. The pace of growth is
expected to pick up from year to year with rates climbing to 7.0 percent in 2017 and 7.2 percent in
2018.
9.

The government intends to launch the implementation of the PSE while pursuing its efforts

to reduce the fiscal deficit. Indeed, the success of the PSE is dependent on a strong increase in both
the level and efficiency of public investment. To maintain the stability of the macroeconomic
framework, a substantial effort is needed to mobilize revenue, strengthen investment efficiency, and
continue to streamline public consumption. Thus, efforts will continue to be made to curb the
government's rate of expenditure while the increase in the wage bill will be contained by a freeze on
hiring, except for staff replacements, and overtime work will be significantly reduced. However, to
strengthen security in a relatively unstable sub-region, the government intends to recruit some
3,000 agents for the defense and security forces and around 1,000 personnel in the health sector.
The additional cost is estimated at CFAF 10 billion. We intend to explore, with World Bank support,
the implementation of a performance management system that could link allowances or benefits to
the objectives of the program budget that is currently being developed. Further, the restructuring of
agencies needs to be pursued. Generally speaking, we intend to maintain spending on public
consumption in real terms to create space to finance investment spending on both human capital
and infrastructure. In that context, the fiscal deficit is expected to continue trending downwards,
declining from 5.2 percent in 2014 to 4.7 percent in 2015. The fall in the deficit for 2015 is lower
than originally expected under the PSI, owing principally to PSE-related spending on public
investment. The deficit will continue on a downward path, falling under 4 percent in 2018, with the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

43

SENEGAL

acceleration of growth, and the streamlining of public expenditure. Continued implementation of
prudent fiscal policy would make make it possible to preserve fiscal sustainability and keep debt
levels below the ceiling of 52 percent of GDP.
10.

In that regard, tax measures have been taken and modernization of the tax administration is

continuing. The main tax measures introduced in the 2014 supplementary budget relate to the: (i)
introduction of a one percent withholding on the turnover of telecommunications companies; (ii)
increase in the ceiling for the minimum tax rate (fixed lump-sum tax); (iii) increase in the rate of the
additional levy on alcohol; (iv) setting a higher and uniform rate for the special tax on cigarettes; (v)
ongoing efforts to streamline tax expenditures; and (vi) the adoption of various measures amending
the General Tax Code for greater clarification and proper implementation of tax provisions to
significantly increase fiscal revenue. The current review of matters related to the comprehensive
taxation of the financial and telecommunications sectors as well as issues related to the
environment, mining, the business license tax on enterprises and electronic commerce is expected
to be completed and culminate in a draft proposal for an appropriate framework to be implemented
in 2015. The modernization objectives, in turn, focus on reduction of the timeframes for processing
tax disputes, the introduction of paperless processing, the timely production legal and regulatory
texts, and closer monitoring of the largest taxpayers and VAT creditors as well as the increased
efficiency of tax audits. The government also continues to strengthen its public financial
management by modernizing the public administration, implementing the WAEMU directives on
public financial management, and improving accounting, fiscal, and financial information.
11.

We are convinced that the effective implementation of the PSE will enable Senegal achieve

its objective of high, sustainable, and inclusive growth. In this regard, we are counting on the
support of the international community, including the Fund, for assistance in implementing reforms
critical to attaining the objectives outlined in the PSE. The government authorizes the IMF to publish
this letter and the related staff report.
Very truly yours.

Attachment. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
1.

This technical memorandum of understanding (TMU) defines the quantitative assessment

criteria, indicative targets, and structural benchmarks on the basis of which the implementation of
the Fund-supported program under the Policy Support Instrument (PSI) is monitored in 2011-2014.
The TMU also establishes the terms and time frame for transmitting the data that will enable Fund
staff to monitor program implementation.

PROGRAM CONDITIONALITY
2.

The assessment criteria for end-June 2014, and the indicative targets for end-March and

end-September 2014, are shown in Table 1. The structural benchmarks established under the
program are presented in Table 2.

DEFINITIONS, ADJUSTERS, AND DATA REPORTING
A.

The Government

3.

Unless otherwise indicated, “government” means the central administration of the Republic

of Senegal and does not include any local administration, the central bank, or any other public or
government-owned entity with autonomous legal personality not included in the government flowof-funds table (TOFE).

B.

Overall Fiscal Balance (Program Definition)

Definition
4.

The overall fiscal balance including grants (program definition) is the difference between the

government’s total revenue (revenue and grants) and total expenditure and net lending. The
operations of the Energy Sector Support Fund (FSE) are integrated in the government flow-of-funds
table (TOFE). The revenues exclude privatization receipts and sales of mobile phone licenses or of
any other state-owned assets. Government expenditure is defined on the basis of payment orders
accepted by the Treasury (dépenses ordonnancées prises en charge par le Trésor) and expenditures
executed with external resources. This assessment criterion is set as a floor on the overall fiscal
balance including grants as of the beginning of the year.

48

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SENEGAL

Example
5.

The floor on the overall fiscal balance including grants (program definition) as of December

31, 2012, is minus CFAF 420 billion. It is calculated as the difference between total government
revenue (CFAF 1,670 billion) and total expenditure and net lending (CFAF 2,090 billion).

Adjustment
6.

The overall fiscal balance including grants is adjusted downward by the amount that budget

grants fall short of program projections up to a maximum of CFAF 15 billion at current exchange
rates (see LOI Tables 1and 2).
7.

The overall fiscal balance including grants is adjusted downward/upward by the amount that

concessional loans exceed/fall short of their programmed amount, up to a maximum of CFAF
50 billion at current exchange rates. For the purposes of this assessment criterion, concessional
loans denominated in CFAF and in foreign currency are taken into account.

Reporting requirements
8.

During the program period, the authorities will report provisional data on the overall fiscal

balance (program definition) and its components monthly to Fund staff with a lag of no more than
30 days. Data on revenues and expenditure that are included in the calculation of the overall fiscal
balance, and on expenditure financed with HIPC- and MDRI- related resources, will be drawn from
preliminary Treasury account balances. Final data will be provided as soon as the final balances of
the Treasury accounts are available, but not later than two months after the reporting of the
provisional data.

C.

Social Expenditure

Definition
9.

Social spending is defined as spending on health, education, the environment, the judicial

system, social safety nets, sanitation, and rural water supply. This criterion is set as a floor in percent
relative to total spending (including the FSE) excluding capital expenditure related to the extension
of the highway and the investment projects of the power sector reform plan.

Reporting requirements
10.

The authorities will report semiannual data to Fund staff within two months following the

end of each period.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SENEGAL

D.

Budgetary Float

Definition
11.

The budgetary float (instances de paiement) is defined as the outstanding stock of

government expenditure for which bills have been received and validated but not yet paid by the
Treasury (the difference between dépenses liquidées and dépenses payées). The assessment
criterion is set as a ceiling on the budgetary float, monitored at the end of the quarter.

Reporting requirements
12.

The authorities will transmit to Fund staff on a weekly basis (i.e., at the end of each week),

and at the end of each month, a table from the expenditure tracking system (SIGFIP) showing all
committed expenditures (dépenses engagées), all certified expenditures that have not yet been
cleared for payment (dépenses liquidées non encore ordonnancées), all payment orders (dépenses
ordonnancées), all payment orders accepted by the Treasury (dépenses prises en charge par le
Trésor), and all payments made by the Treasury (dépenses payées). The SIGFIP table will exclude
delegations for regions and embassies. The SIGFIP table will also list any payments that do not have
a cash impact on the Treasury accounts.

E.

Spending Undertaken Outside Simplified and Normal Procedures

13.

This assessment criterion is applied on a continuous basis to any procedure other than the

normal and simplified procedures to execute spending. It excludes only spending undertaken on the
basis of a supplemental appropriation order (décret d’avance) in cases of absolute urgency and
need in the national interest, in application of Article 12 of the Organic Budget Law. Such spending
requires the signatures of the President of the Republic and Prime Minister.
14.

The authorities will report any such procedure, together with the SIGFIP table defined in

paragraph 12, to Fund staff on a monthly basis with a maximum delay of 30 days.

F.

Government External Payments Arrears

Definition
15.

External payments arrears are defined as the sum of payments owed and not paid on the

external debt contracted or guaranteed by the government. The definition of external debt given in
paragraphs 17 and 20 is applicable here. The assessment criterion on external payments arrears will
be monitored on a continuous basis.

50

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SENEGAL

Reporting requirements
16.

The authorities will promptly report any accumulation of external payments arrears to Fund

staff.

G.

Contracting or Guaranteeing of New Nonconcessional External Debt

by the Government
17.

Definition of debt. For the purposes of the relevant assessment criteria, the definition of

debt is set out in Executive Board Decision No.6230-(79/140), Point 9, as revised on August 31, 2009
(Decision No. 14416-(09/91)).
a)

The term “debt” will be understood to mean a direct, i.e., non-contingent, liability created
under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets
(including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more
payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, according to a given
repayment schedule; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities
incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as
follows:
i.

loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an
undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits,
bonds, debentures, commercial loans and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of
assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required
to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the
buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements);

ii.

suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments
until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided;
and

iii. leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the
right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the
total expected service life of the property, while the lessor retains the title to the
property. For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception
of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the
agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair or maintenance of
the property.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

51

SENEGAL

b)

Under the definition of debt above, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages
arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes
debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt under
this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.

18.

Debt guarantees. For the purposes of the relevant assessment criteria, the guarantee of a

debt arises from any explicit legal obligation of the government to service a debt in the event of
nonpayment by the debtor (involving payments in cash or in kind).
19.

Debt concessionality. For the purposes of the relevant assessment criteria, a debt is

considered concessional if it includes a grant element of at least 35 percent; 13the grant element is
the difference between the present value (PV) of debt and its nominal value, expressed as a
percentage of the nominal value of the debt. The PV of debt at the time of its contracting is
calculated by discounting the future stream of payments of debt service due on this debt.24The
discount rate used for this purpose is 5 percent.
20.

External debt. For the purposes of the relevant assessment criteria, external debt is defined

as debt borrowed or serviced in a currency other than the CFA franc. This definition also applies to
debt among WAEMU countries.
21.

Debt-related assessment criteria. The relevant assessment criteria apply to the contracting

and guaranteeing of new nonconcessional external debt by the government, local governments,
SENELEC, the Energy Sector Support Fund (FSE), and any other public or government-owned entity.
The criteria apply to debt and commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not yet
been received. The criteria also apply to private debt for which official guarantees have been
extended and which, therefore, constitute a contingent liability of the government. The assessment
criteria are measured on a cumulative basis from the time of approval of the PSI by the Executive
Board. ACs will be monitored on a continuous basis. No adjuster will be applied to these criteria.
22.

Special provisions:
a)

The assessment criteria do not apply to: (i) debt rescheduling transactions of debt

existing at the time of the approval of the PSI; (ii) debt contracted by the airport project

period, payment schedule, upfront commissions, and management fees.

company (AIBD) to finance construction of the new Dakar Airport; and (iii) short-term
external debt (maturity of less than one year) contracted by SENELEC and the FSE to finance
the purchase of petroleum products.
b)

A total ceiling of US$1006 million applies over the period 2011–14 for

nonconcessional external debt financing to be used for investment projects, including in
road infrastructure, the energy sector, and urban water and sanitation, and to reduce the
recourse to regional market financing.
c)

A separate ceiling equivalent to CFAF 224 billion in 2011–14 applies for

nonconcessional debt financing with a grant element of at least 15 percent. Projects
financed in this way would be expected to meet the same economic and social profitability
criteria as other capital spending. The government will inform Fund staff in a timely manner
before contracting any debt of this type and will provide sufficient information ahead of
time to verify the degree of concessionality. It will also provide a brief summary of the
projects to be financed and their profitability, including an evaluation by the lender or the
government. The government will report the use of funds and project implementation in
subsequent MEFPs.

Reporting requirements
23.

The government will report any new external borrowing and its terms to Fund staff as soon

as external debt is contracted or guaranteed by the government, but no later than within two weeks
of such external debt being contracted or guaranteed.

H.

Public Sector Contracts Signed by Single Tender

Definition
24.

Public sector contracts are administrative contracts, drawn up and entered into by the

government or any entity subject to the procurement code, for the procurement of supplies,
delivery of services, or execution of work. Public sector contracts are considered “single-tender”
contracts when the contracting agent signs the contract with the chosen contractor without
competitive tender. The quarterly indicative target will apply to total public sector contracts entered
into by the government or any entity subject to the procurement code. The ceiling on contracts
executed by single tender will exclude fuel purchases by SENELEC for electricity production. This

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

53

SENEGAL

exclusion reflects new regulation, which requires SENELEC to buy fuel directly from SAR based on
the existing price structure.

Reporting requirements
25.

The government will report quarterly to Fund staff, with a lag of no more than one month

from the end of the observation period, the total value of public sector contracts and the total value
of all single-tender public sector contracts.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR PROGRAM MONITORING
26.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION AND EIGHTH REVIEW UNDER THE
POLICY SUPPORT INSTRUMENT—DEBT
SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By
Roger Nord and Peter Allum
(IMF), and John Panzer (IDA)

Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary
Fund and the International Development Association

Senegal remains at a low risk of debt distress. Under the baseline scenario, which is
consistent with higher program ceilings for non-concessional and semi-concessional
borrowing, all the debt burden indicators remain below their policy-dependent indicative
thresholds, and debt ratios in present value terms are lower than in the previous debt
sustainability analysis (DSA). Policy-dependent thresholds were increased as Senegal was
reclassified to ‘strong’ performer based on higher average CPIA score in 2011-2013. 1 The
probability approach also shows a more favorable outlook. The stress tests result in two
spikes in debt service to revenue ratio, corresponding to the repayment of two Eurobonds,
which lead to a small and temporary breach of the threshold. The DSA, however, suggests
that there is not much space for higher fiscal deficits, if the low risk rating is to be
preserved. It also indicates a need for caution in the recourse to non-concessional
borrowing.2

1

Senegal’s CPIA score was 3.825 in 2013, and on average 3.81 over 2011–13. Under the debt sustainability
framework rules, this corresponds to a “strong” performance.

The DSA presented in this document is based on the LIC DSF Guidance Note (2013).

BORROWING PLAN AND UNDERLYING
ASSUMPTIONS
1.
The authorities have continued to strengthen their capacity to manage debt and assess
project loans. Senegal recently recorded improvement in its sub-score on debt management under the
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA). A new public debt directorate has been created,
combining units that previously managed domestic debt and external debt separately. In addition,
Senegal’s first medium-term debt strategy was completed in the fall of 2012. The strategy essentially
aims at reducing rollover risks by extending the maturity of debt issued on the regional market—which
has a very short average maturity—as well as at giving priority to concessional financing to keep
borrowing costs low. An updated medium-term second debt management strategy is being finalized
along the same lines. Progress is underway to improve project appraisal and selection, in particular by
developing capacity to conduct cost-benefit analysis. In light of these favorable developments, Senegal
was upgraded to the “strong capacity” category during the 2013 assessment of macroeconomic and
public financial management capacity (see Classification of Low-Income Countries for the Purpose of
Debt Limits in Fund-Supported Programs).

Senegal has also now been reclassified as a strong performer in the CPIA index. This
reclassification has led to an increase of indicative thresholds for each debt burden indicators, which has
improved Senegal’s debt outlook. The present value of the external debt-to-GDP ratio has been raised
to 50 percent from 40 percent in the previous DSA (without remittances), while the ratios for external
debt-to-exports and for external debt-to- revenue are 200 and 300 respectively, up from 150 and 250 in
the previous DSA. The ratio for PPG external debt service in relation to exports is now 25 percent and
22 percent in relation to revenue compared to 20 percent thresholds for both indicators in the previous
DSA (Table 2).

3.
This DSA is consistent with the macroeconomic framework outlined in the staff report. As
in the April 2014 DSA, the baseline scenario assumes the implementation of sound macroeconomic and
structural policies, leading to an increase in economic growth and a narrowing of fiscal deficits over the
long term. Other notable features include:


Real GDP growth is expected to increase to above 5 percent only in 2016 and to accelerate
and 7.3 percent on average in 2020-34, from a high base of 7 percent in the medium-term,
compared to 6.2 percent medium-term growth in the previous DSA. This assumes efficiency
gains from reform implementation under the authorities Plan Senegal Emergent (PSE),3 which
would kick start total factor productivity (TFP) growth. Successful PSE reforms are expected
to lift growth to 7 percent in the medium term driven by FDI generated exports.



Fiscal deficit. The overall fiscal deficit projections are somewhat higher in the medium term,
but in the long term they are in line with the authorities’ commitment to meet the key
WAEMU convergence criterion on the fiscal deficit (see paragraph 10 below)



Current account deficit: The current account deficit is projected to narrow gradually from
10.3 percent of GDP in 2014 to just above 7.4 percent in 2019 and further down in the long
term. This would be driven by projected fiscal consolidation and stronger dynamism in
exports (mining in particular). Remittances are projected to remain significant as a share of
GDP.

Financing: The financing assumptions under this DSA are broadly similar to those under the
most recent DSA (July 2014). As noted in the previous DSA, the authorities are increasingly
relying on external nonconcessional or semi-concessional borrowing to finance infrastructure
projects, and this trend is expected to continue. At the time of the previous DSA, the
authorities had postponed a planned Eurobond issuance from 2013 to 2014 following a
sharp tightening of financial conditions on international markets in the course of 2013. The
authorities have since issued the US$500 million Eurobond in July 2014. Conditions have
been relatively favorable in international markets in the past few months, and the authorities
got a rate of 6.25 percent compared to the 6 percent yield on the 2011 Eurobond. This
interest rate is higher than expected at the time of the previous DSA, partly owing to market
concerns about the slow pace of reform. However, part of the proceeds would be used to
repay the euro tranche of the syndicated loan contracted in 2013, which has a shorter
maturity and higher rate (6.5 percent). The projections assume a repayment of the 2011 and
2014 bonds at maturity, as well as a moderate annual amount of non-concessional
borrowing in the medium and long term. The authorities intend to continue relying on semiconcessional project financing (i.e. with a grant element above 15 percent) for infrastructure.
As a result, the average grant element of new external borrowing is projected to decrease
from about 20 percent to just above 10 percent over the projection period, as Senegal
gradually moves away from concessional borrowing toward non-concessional borrowing.



Discount rate: A discount rate of 5 percent has been used for this DSA.



Alternative Scenarios. In addition to the baseline, scenario, the DSA considers alternative
scenarios using the authorities’ PSE projections (with higher debt accumulation in the early
years.The probability approach is also applied.

EXTERNAL DSA
4.
The use of remittances in the base case is justified for Senegal, since remittances are both
stable and high as a percentage of GDP and exports.4 Since 2000, remittances have grown every
year with the exception of 2009, when they fell 6 percent. Over the period 2010–2013, remittances in
Senegal averaged 52 percent of exports of goods and services and 13 percent of GDP. They have
become an important and reliable source of foreign exchange in Senegal, a pattern that is expected to
continue.5
5.
Under the baseline scenario (Figure 1), and taking remittances into account, debt burden
indicators remain well below their thresholds The external PPG debt ratios remain below their
respective thresholds even under the most extreme stress tests, with one exception. Two spikes in debt
service reflect the assumption of the repayment of the Eurobonds at maturity, and lead to one breach
under the most extreme stress test (a 30 percent depreciation of the currency). Given that the largest
breach falls within a 10-percent band of the threshold, the probability approach was also applied.
6.
Alternatively, a more rapid scaling up of spending would imply larger fiscal deficits,
higher debt accumulation, and some deterioration in debt burden indicators6. Although the
indicators remain below their policy-dependent thresholds, the PV of debt to GDP ratio and the PV of
debt to exports ratio come closer to the thresholds (Figure 2), despite higher assumed growth than in
the baseline. This suggests that, in a scenario where the spending is scaled up quickly, but expected
growth dividends do not materialize, Senegal could be at risk of losing its “low risk” rating. It also
indicates a need for caution in the recourse to non-concessional borrowing.
7.
The probability of debt distress also appears to be low (Figure 3). Under the probability
approach, which focuses on the evolution of the probability of debt distress over time based on a
country’s individual CPIA score and average GDP growth rate, all the indicators for Senegal remain
below the thresholds in all scenarios, supporting the case for a low risk of debt distress.

4

In line with the Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability
Framework for Low-Income Countries, remittances must be presented as the base case in the DSA if they are
both greater than 10 percent of GDP and greater than 20 percent of exports of goods and services.

5

Both ratios are measured on a backward-looking, three-year average basis.

6

This scenario assumes that higher capital spending boosts the fiscal deficit by about 0.7 percentage point of
GDP in 2015-19, growth is assumed to increase by 1 percentage point over the same period.

8.
Under the PSI baseline scenario, indicators of overall public debt (external plus domestic)
do not show significant vulnerabilities. The PV of total public debt to GDP and the PV of total public
debt to revenue gradually decrease over the projection period. The PV of public debt to GDP remains
well below the benchmark level of 74 percent associated with public debt vulnerabilities for strong
performers. Similar to the thresholds for PPG external debt, the benchmarks for total public debt vary
depending on a country’s CPIA score and designate levels above which the risk of public debt distress is
heightened. The benchmarks are in PV terms. Benchmarks for total public debt differ from thresholds for
PPG external debt in that they serve as reference points for triggering a deeper discussion of public
domestic debt. Thresholds for PPG external play a fundamental role in the determination of the external
risk rating. The public debt benchmark for Senegal is higher than in the previous DSA of June 2014,
owing to Senegal’s CPIA reclassification as a strong performer. The authorities’ effort to increase
maturities (from slightly over one year at the time of the previous DSA) should reduce exposure to
rollover and interest rate risks in the context of financing from the regional market.
9.
The public debt outlook would be much less favorable in the absence of fiscal
consolidation (Table 2b). In a scenario that assumes an unchanged primary deficit (as a percent of
GDP) over the entire projection period, the PV of public debt to GDP grows but does not breach the 74
percent benchmark level. The benchmark level is breached in the “historical” scenario (holding real GDP
growth and the primary deficit constant at their historical levels). While overall the risks remain low,
these stress tests highlight the importance of continuing the fiscal effort and raising growth.

CONCLUSION
10.
In staff’s view, Senegal continues to face a low risk of debt distress. This assessment,
however, hinges critically on a continued reduction of the fiscal deficit and prudence in the shift towards
less concessional financing. Fiscal reforms should continue and additional fiscal space for PSE-related
and social spending should be secured through efforts to increase revenue—particularly collecting tax
arrears, freezing public consumption in real terms, and improving the composition of spending. The
authorities also need to focus spending on productive areas, working closely with development
partners to strengthen project design, preparation and execution while ensuring the overall quality and
efficiency of public investment.
11.
A cautious approach to non-concessional borrowing will similarly be essential for
safeguarding debt sustainability. Preserving debt sustainability under the PSE as originally envisaged
would depend on achieving a high growth dividend and implementing a comprehensive and ambitious
reform of the state (to make room for investment and improve the efficiency of spending).
12.
The conclusion also hinges on achieving projected growth, although there are some
downside risks. The authorities are strongly committed to achieving successful PSE reforms. These could
lift growth to 7 percent in the medium term, driven by FDI generated exports. The PSE offers an achievable
development strategy, including the right mix of private investment to be crowded in by public investment

in both human capital and infrastructure. However, unlocking private investment, including FDI, requires
speeding up reforms to the business climate and improving public sector governance. Frontloading public
investment without implementing the necessary structural reforms may jeopardize fiscal targets and debt
sustainability while failing to raise growth from its sub-par trend. The main risks relate mainly to weak or
slow implementation of the reforms, revenue shortfalls that would not allow sufficient mobilization of
resources in support of the plan, failure to curb unproductive public consumption, and delays in raising
expenditure efficiency, in particular of domestically financed capital expenditure.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the
baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after
the shock (implicitly assumingan offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

that remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief.

Safeguards Assessments:
The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is a common central bank of the countries of the
West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). The latest assessment of the BCEAO was
completed on December 13, 2013. The assessment found that the bank continued to have a strong
control environment and has, with the implementation of the 2010 Institutional Reform of the
WAEMU, enhanced its governance framework. Specifically, an audit committee was established to
oversee the audit and financial reporting processes, transparency has increased with more timely
publication of the audited financial statements, and the BCEAO is committed to IFRS

implementation by end-2014. The assessment also identified some limitations in the external audit
process and recommended that steps be taken to ensure the adequacy of the mechanism through
selection of a second experienced audit firm to conduct joint audits.
Exchange System:
Senegal, a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), accepted the
obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3 and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, and
maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions. The WAEMU’s exchange regime is a conventional peg to the
euro.
The union's common currency, the CFA franc, had been pegged to the French franc at the rate of
CFAF 1 = F 0.02. Effective January 12, 1994, the CFA franc was devalued and the new parity set at
CFAF 1 = F 0.01. Effective December 31, 1998, the parity was switched to the euro at a rate of
CFAF 655.96 = €1.
The authorities confirmed that Senegal had not imposed measures that could give rise to exchange
restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction. They will inform the Fund, if any such measure is
introduced.
Aspects of the exchange system were also discussed in the report “WAEMU: Common Policies for
Member Countries” (Country Report No. 14/84).
Article IV Consultations:
The latest Article IV consultation was completed by the Executive Board on December 10, 2012
(Country Report No. 12/337). In concluding the 2012 Article IV consultation, Executive Directors
commended Senegal’s satisfactory program implementation despite the challenging internal and
external environments. They stressed that although a moderate pickup in growth is expected in the
near term, the economy remains exposed to substantial risks.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ continued commitment to their program to ensure
macroeconomic stability, strengthen the economy’s resilience to shocks, foster higher and
sustainable growth, and reduce poverty. Directors noted that, while Senegal still faces a low risk of
debt distress, high fiscal deficits and rising debt ratios need to be addressed. They welcomed the
authorities’ commitment to keep the deficit under 6 percent in 2012 and their determination to
reduce the deficit further in the medium term to levels that are consistent with fiscal and debt
sustainability. Directors also highlighted the importance of stronger debt management. They
welcomed the recently finalized medium-term debt strategy, and encouraged the authorities to rely
primarily on concessional financing.
Directors underscored the need to improve public financial management and government
spending efficiency and transparency. They commended ongoing efforts to reduce the cost of
running government, streamline public agencies, and rationalize expenditure in key sectors.

Directors stressed that phasing out the costly and poorly targeted energy price subsidies while
strengthening social safety nets is a priority. Sustained progress in all these areas will be necessary
to meet the country’s fiscal objectives and make room for critical social and development needs.
Directors noted that the financial sector is generally robust. However, the rising level of NPLs and
concentration of lending need to be closely monitored. To move Senegal to a path of higher,
sustainable, and inclusive growth, Directors stressed the need to address infrastructure gaps,
remove inefficiencies in government operations, and improve the business climate. They welcomed
the tax and customs reforms that are underway and called for timely implementation of the new
energy investments and restructuring of SENELEC, the national power utility. Directors also
encouraged the authorities to deepen and strengthen the financial system to support their growth
strategy.
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and Report on the Observance of Standards and
Codes (ROSC) Participation:
A joint team of the World Bank and the IMF conducted a mission under the FSAP program in 2000
and 2001. The Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) was issued in 2001 (IMF Country Report
No. 01/189). An FSAP update was undertaken in 2004, focusing on development issues (in
particular nationwide supply of basic financial services and access of SMEs to credit, in line with the
priorities defined in the PRSP (IMF Country Report No. 05/126). A regional FSAP for the WAEMU
was undertaken in 2007 and the FSSA was issued in May 2008 (SM/08/139). A ROSC on the data
module was published in 2002. An FAD mission conducted a ROSC on the fiscal transparency
module in 2005.

Anti Money Laundering / Combating the Financing of Terrorism

The onsite visit for Senegal's AML/CFT evaluation took place in July/August 2007 in the context of
ECOWAS’s Inter-Governmental Action Group Against Money Laundering in West Africa (GIABA).
The report was adopted in early May 2008 by the GIABA Plenary held in Accra, Ghana. The report
highlighted several areas of weaknesses in the AML/CFT system, confirmed by a score of 12 noncompliant and 16 partially compliant ratings out of the 40+9 FATF AML/CFT recommendations. In
May 2009 Senegal joined the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs). The FIU publishes
on its website statistics on suspicious transaction reports received, the number of cases transmitted
to the judiciary, and the number of convictions. Senegal’s sixth follow-up report was discussed at
GIABA’s May 2014 Plenary. It acknowledged the progress achieved, including the efforts to revise
the AML/CFT legal framework in line with the 2012 FATF standard, and encouraged Senegal to
continue making improvements. At the same time, it was agreed that Senegal would submit its
seventh follow-up report to the GIABA Plenary in May 2015.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Senegal – Statistical Issues Appendix
As of October 2014
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance and program
monitoring. There are weaknesses in data on national accounts, production, and social indicators. The
authorities are committed to improving the quality and availability of economic, financial, and social
indicators, partially relying on technical assistance from the Fund and other international organizations
and donors.
National accounts: The compilation of the national accounts generally follows the System of National
Accounts, 1993. Despite staff’s professionalism, the lack of adequate financial resources has
constrained efforts to collect and process data. Data sources are deficient in some areas, particularly
the informal sector. Because of financial constraints, surveys of business and households are not
conducted regularly. However, efforts continue to be made to improve data collection procedures,
strengthen the coordination among statistical agencies, and reduce delays in data dissemination. The
Regional Technical Assistance Center for West Africa (West AFRITAC) has been assisting Senegal with
the improvement of their real sector statistics, in particular annual and quarterly national accounts
(QNA). Senegal started releasing the QNA in 2012 and integrated economic accounts (IEA) in 2014.
Government finance statistics (GFS): GFS are compiled by the Ministry of Economy and Finance
from customs, tax, and treasury directorate sources, and quarterly disseminated as government
financial operations tables (TOFE) in the ministry's publications. Following Fund’s TA, TOFE
presentations were improved and aligned with the extended WAEMU TOFE. Remaining step is to
implement the recent WAEMU fiscal directives. A regional advisor in GFS has been conducting
technical assistance missions aimed at improving the consistency of fiscal reporting and migrating to
the methodologies of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001. The regional advisor also
supported efforts to resume reporting of annual and higher frequency data for publication in
International Financial Statistics (IFS) and electronic dissemination of the GFS Yearbook.
Monetary and financial statistics: Preliminary monetary data are compiled by the national agency of
the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) and officially released (including to the IMF) by
BCEAO headquarters. The authorities report monetary data to STA on a regular basis, with a lag of
about three months. There has been an improvement in the timeliness of reporting interest rate and
main depository corporation data (central bank and commercial). An area-wide page for the WAEMU
zone was introduced in the January 2003 issue of IFS. As part of the continuing efforts to help the
authorities implement the statistical methodology recommended in the Monetary and Financial
Statistics Manual, a STA TA mission visited Dakar in 2011 to assist the BCEAO National agency in the
migration of MFS to the standardized report form (SRF) framework. The mission was undertaken as a
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

SENEGAL

pilot within the context of a multi-annual project for improving the relevance and timeliness of MFS
compiled by the BCEAO.
External sector statistics: Balance of payments statistics are compiled by the Senegalese national
agency of the BCEAO. With STA support, several steps have been taken to address certain
shortcomings, including: (i) implementation of the Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition;
(ii) modification and simplification of related surveys for companies and banks; (iii) improvement in the
computerization of procedures; and (iv) significant strengthening of training. Nevertheless, further
steps could be taken to enhance the quality and coverage of the balance of payments statistics.
Although definitive balance of payments statistics can now be provided with a delay of less than one
year, there are significant delays in reporting the data to STA.
II. Data Standards and Quality
The country has begun the process of regional harmonization of statistical methodologies within the
framework of the WAEMU. It participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), and its
metadata were posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board in 2001. In 2006, the
authorities expressed their commitment to work toward subscription to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and appointed a national SDDS coordinator. The 2008 SDDS
assessment mission evaluated dissemination practices against SDDS requirements for coverage,
periodicity and timeliness and, in cooperation with the authorities, developed an action plan to
address identified gaps. A Data ROSC was published on the IMF website in 2002.

IMF Executive Board Completes Eight PSI Review for Senegal
and Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the eighth
review of Senegal’s economic performance under the program supported by the Policy
Support Instrument (PSI) and also concluded the 2014 Article IV consultation1.
The PSI was approved by the Executive Board on December 3, 2010 (see Press Release No.
10/469). The IMF's framework for PSIs is designed for low-income countries that may not
need, or want, IMF financial assistance, but still seek IMF advice, monitoring and
endorsement of their policies. PSIs are voluntary and demand driven (see Public Information
Notice No. 05/145). In completing the review, the Board approved a waiver for
nonobservance of the assessment criterion on non-concessional borrowing.
Following the Board discussion, Mr. Min Zhu, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair,
made the following statement:
“The authorities should be commended for successfully maintaining macroeconomic
stability, advancing with fiscal consolidation and completing the PSI. However, slow
implementation of structural reforms has resulted in below par and sluggish growth. This has
hampered poverty reduction. In 2014, exogenous shocks, including the spillovers from the
Ebola epidemic, have also weighed down growth.
“To exit the trap of low growth and high poverty, the government has developed an
ambitious program “Plan Sénégal Emergent” (PSE). The PSE presents a unique opportunity
to unlock a broad-based and inclusive growth that will make Senegal an emerging economy.
The goal of a 7 to 8 percent annual growth is feasible in the medium term but would require a

broadening, deepening and acceleration of structural reforms. Public consumption should be
constrained to create fiscal space for implementation of PSE-related social spending and
projects. Substantial improvements are required in the regulatory framework and governance,
as well as in the quality and efficiency of public investment.
“The 2015 budget targets a further reduction in the deficit to 4.7 percent of GDP, less
ambitious than the 4.0 percent of GDP projected earlier. However, the authorities are taking
action to improve the quality of public spending by holding back appropriations for new
public investment projects until feasibility studies are ready. This may mean that in practice
the deficit is closer to the initial projections. Ebola-related shocks could add 0.3 percent of
GDP to the deficit in 2015. The authorities remain committed to bringing the fiscal deficit in
line with the WAEMU target of 3 percent of GDP in the medium term.”
The Executive Board also completed the 2014 Article IV Consultation with Senegal.
Senegal’s macroeconomic situation is stable. Inflation remains low. The fiscal outlook has
improved owing to stronger revenue performance and expenditure control measures and
overall deficit is expected to fall to 5.2 percent of GDP in 2014 from 5.5 percent of GDP in
2013. The current account deficit is expected to decline but would stay at about 10 percent of
GDP because of depressed exports.
Slow implementation of structural reforms and exogenous shocks continued to weigh down
growth. While progress has been made, particularly in the area of governance and business
climate, some delays have accrued in the introduction of the single treasury account,
expenditure rationalization, investment expenditure execution, and energy sector reforms,
with distortive energy subsidies weighing heavily on the budget. For 2014, growth is
expected to reach 4.5 percent (from 3.5 percent in 2013), 0.4 percentage points below earlier
estimates, reflecting an expected softening in the tourism sector because of the Ebola
epidemic compounded by the late start of the rainy season.
The outlook for the Senegalese economy is positive. The authorities’ new development
strategy, Plan Sénégal Emergent (PSE), presents a unique opportunity to unlock a broadbased and inclusive growth that will make Senegal an emerging economy. Risks are mainly
domestic and regional, and relate to continued slow implementation of structural reforms,
including in the energy sector, and the impact of the regional Ebola epidemic. External risks
include possible increases in the cost of public borrowing, global effects of the unwinding of
unconventional monetary policies, and potential spillovers from a protracted period of slower
growth in partner countries and falling oil prices, which may affect fiscal revenue.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They noted that satisfactory
program implementation has helped Senegal preserve macroeconomic stability. However,
due to internal and external factors, the economy has continued to underperform and
unemployment and poverty remain high. The large current account deficit and increasing
exposure of the external position to shifting market sentiment pose additional risks to the
outlook. Directors stressed that prudent policies and ambitious structural reforms are critical
to boosting growth and reducing poverty. In this regard, they welcomed the authorities’ new
development strategy as outlined in “Plan Sénégal Emergent” (PSE) and looked forward to
its steadfast and timely implementation.
Directors emphasized that accelerating the pace of structural reforms will be key to achieving
the PSE objectives. They agreed that reform efforts should be aimed at improving
governance and the business climate in order to promote private sector development and to
attract foreign direct investment. Priority should also be given to making delivery of public
services more efficient, improving the impact of public spending through PFM reforms,
containing public consumption to generate the fiscal space for investment in human capital
and public infrastructure, and strengthening social safety nets. A comprehensive restructuring
of the energy sector and increasing export competitiveness will also be important. Directors
welcomed the authorities’ plans to engage with a few comparator countries to develop an
active peer learning effort to roll out the required reforms.
Directors encouraged the authorities to anchor fiscal policy on long-term debt sustainability
within a medium-term budget framework and reach the WAEMU convergence criteria on the
fiscal deficit of 3 percent of GDP by 2019. They noted that attaining this goal will require
further strengthening of tax and expenditure policy measures. While supporting the PSE
priorities, Directors emphasized that all related investment should be consistent with the
authorities’ earlier fiscal consolidation plans and Senegal’s absorptive capacity. In addition,
decisions to contract nonconcessional financing should be carefully weighed.
Directors welcomed the initiative to improve the quality of public investment by establishing
a precautionary reserve envelope from which funding would only be released for projects
with proper feasibility studies. Directors encouraged the authorities to extend this in the 2016
budget.
Directors stressed that continued efforts will be needed to improve public financial
management, budget institutions, and economic governance. They underscored that reforms

should focus on key areas such as macro-fiscal policy design, development of a medium-term
expenditure framework and improved fiscal discipline in budget execution.
Directors highlighted the importance of addressing financial sector vulnerabilities, especially
the quality of bank assets. They encouraged continued vigilance of the high level of
non-performing loans in close cooperation with the BCEAO and WAEMU Banking
Commission. Directors supported the strategy to improve access to financial services.

Statement by Ngueto Tiraina Yambaye, Executive Director for Senegal
and Daouda Sembene, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
December 15, 2014
Senegal’s current economic program supported by the Policy Support Instrument
(PSI) was adopted in December 2010, with the aim of increasing growth and reducing
vulnerabilities and poverty. Reflecting their commitment to the program, the country
authorities have since put an increasing focus on implementing sustainable fiscal policy,
enhancing fiscal governance and transparency, and promoting private sector development
within a well-functioning financial sector.
Four years later, significant progress has been made towards key program
objectives, notably strengthening macroeconomic stability, enhancing revenue
mobilization, improving public financial management. However, implementation of
structural reforms helped to secure only modest improvements in the business climate
until recently, while failing to curtail the acute fiscal risks emanating from the energy
sector. In addition, there is still scope for improving the efficiency of public expenditure.
As a result, growth acceleration and significant poverty reduction have remained elusive
in recent years, as illustrated in the comprehensive staff report and informative Selected
Issues paper.
Introducing a New Policy Framework
To raise living standards and make inroads into poverty, the authorities
acknowledge the importance of maintaining a strong reform momentum and tapping new
drivers of growth, while consolidating existing ones. In this context, the Plan Senegal
Emergent (PSE), the country’s new growth strategy, was validated earlier this year to
realize the government’s vision for making Senegal an emerging economy by 2035. This
new policy framework has since occupied center stage in the country’ policy and reform
agenda and is expected to remain so over the medium term. The PSE features a number
of transformative investment projects and critical reform actions that are expected to
facilitate a durable growth takeoff, starting from 2015.
Exercising fiscal prudence
The authorities are fully aware of the potential risks to fiscal and debt
sustainability that could be triggered by a sustained buildup of debt to finance
unproductive public investment. To mitigate such risks, they have signaled their strong
resolve to anchor the implementation of the PSE on a concomitant reduction of the fiscal
deficit. Fiscal consolidation efforts were successful in keeping the deficit on a downward
trend in recent years. In 2014, prudent fiscal management has contributed to the lowerthan-projected deficit achieved in the first half of 2014. For 2015, the fiscal deficit is
expected to be kept half a percentage point of GDP below its 2014 level.

2
In light of the authorities’ strong commitment to fiscal sustainability, the gradual
pace of fiscal consolidation is expected to be sustained amid the implementation of the
PSE—albeit at a pace slower than initially anticipated under the PSI. Deficit reduction is
expected to be achieved through adherence to a number of critical reform measures. First,
tax measures introduced as part of this year’s supplementary budget will support fiscal
consolidation through their revenue-enhancing effect; so will the ongoing steps taken to
modernize tax administration and review tax policy for a number of specific sectors,
including the telecommunication and financial sectors, the environment, mining industry,
and e-commerce.
Moreover, improved fiscal positions will result from the authorities’ efforts to
contain public consumption, improve the efficiency of public investment, reallocate nonpriority infrastructure spending, and pursue the agency reform strategy. In this endeavor,
it is also the authorities’ intention to consolidate on recent progress made in public
financial management under the PSI, notably by implementing regional guidelines in this
area.
While being appropriately adamant on the scaling up of public investment, the
authorities agreed with the staff on the need to exercise caution by introducing a
Precautionary Reserve Envelope (PRE). This will entail unfreezing budgetary allocations
for some PSE-related investment projects only once their feasibility studies are finalized.
Finally, it is noteworthy that the achievement of fiscal objectives will be served
by the ongoing reorganization of the Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Planning, based
on a set of recommendations made by an international development consulting firm.
Upon its completion, this reorganization is expected to help improve the work of the
ministry, with positive spillovers on the quality of fiscal policy and administration.
Sustaining good program performance
Overall, program implementation has continued to proceed satisfactorily. On the
structural front, reform efforts helped to secure progress toward improving the quality of
public expenditure and fiscal transparency, leading to the observance of all structural
benchmarks set forth in the program. More specifically, a number of documents were
submitted to the Parliament along with the 2015 draft budget law, including cost-benefit
analyses of the 5 largest investment projects, estimates of energy subsidies, the complete
list of agencies and funds, an update on the implementation of the agency reform
strategy. In parallel, performance contracts were signed with the five largest agencies and
no new agency was set up in recent months.
Moreover, all end-June 2014 quantitative assessment criteria were met. However,
the continuous criterion on the level of nonconcessional borrowing was breached since
September. This unexpected outcome arose following the issuance of a $500 million
Eurobond in international bond markets and the determination that the grant element of a
loan contracted with a creditor fell short of the minimum threshold to be considered as
semi-concessional, as initially anticipated. Notwithstanding this breach, the country

3
remains assessed at a low risk of debt distress. The authorities reiterated their continued
attachment to prudent debt management. Nonconcessional borrowing decisions have
largely obeyed so far to a deliberate refinancing strategy aimed at lengthening the
maturities of public debt and lowering debt service payments. It is also expected that
prudent fiscal policy will help to maintain the level of public debt below 52 percent of
GDP.
In light of the above, we would appreciate Directors’ support for the completion
of the eighth review under the PSI and staff’s proposal for a waiver of nonobservance of
the assessment criterion on non-concessional borrowing.
Improving the growth outlook
The staff report provides a useful account of the risks to the PSE scenario,
including spillovers risks stemming from a growth slowdown in advanced and emerging
economies, oil price developments, and global bond markets as well as domestic and
regional risks arising from the Ebola outbreak and potential delays in fiscal and energy
sector reforms. The authorities’ continued adherence to prudent fiscal management
should help reduce these vulnerabilities along with successful implementation of the PSE
and the comprehensive restructuring plan for the energy sector.
In addition, the authorities will continue to work closely with development
partners, with a view to helping to contain the epidemic in neighboring countries,
preventing new cases within the country, and coping with adverse spillovers. Preventive
measures taken by the health ministry have contributed to keeping Senegal Ebola-free,
except for one imported case that was successfully treated in a local hospital last
September. Yet, the Senegalese economy has been affected, albeit slightly, by the adverse
spillovers of the outbreak of the epidemic in neighboring countries, notably with fears of
the disease spread led to reduced business opportunities in the hotel industry.
That said the authorities remain more optimistic than staff about growth
prospects, as their projections take into account the effective implementation of the PSE
as well as the potential use of the Precautionary Reserve Envelope. It is their expectation
that the significant budgetary allocations for PSE-related projects and the improved
quality of investment spending embodied in the recently approved 2015 budget will
contribute to raising growth above 5 percent from next year on. Given the strong
domestic ownership of the PSE, a more rapid pace of reform implementation is
anticipated, which bodes well for growth acceleration. In this context, a number of
commendable steps have already been taken to reform the business environment and
university scholarships, as indicated in the staff report. As a result, Senegal features in the
Doing Business’s latest list of the world’s top 10 business reformers. Still, the authorities
are fully aware that ample scope exists for further improving the country’s business
environment and will continue to take necessary steps to that effect.

4
Learning from the experience of comparator countries
In line with staff advice, the authorities have already identified a few comparator
countries and begun engaging with them with a view to reflecting on the reform and
policy initiatives underpinning their success. As part of this peer learning initiative which
is proceeding in close collaboration with Fund staff, a team of Senegalese officials is
scheduled to meet in the Fund’s premises with their counterparts from these countries, as
the Board meets up to conclude this eighth and final PSI review. We would like to
convey to staff the authorities’ appreciation of the excellent quality of the policy dialogue
as well as their valuable contribution to their productive peer learning experience. Our
authorities are hopeful that Management and staff will continue to support this initiative
in order to assist them in their efforts to make headway toward economic emergence.
More generally, the authorities continue to place a high premium on the Fund’s
policy advice in support of their policy and reform agenda under the PSE. They have
expressed their strong interest in maintaining a close relationship with the Fund in
whatever forms that will best serve their ambition to put the Senegalese economy on the
shortest path to emergence in line with the PSE. They look forward to addressing these
issues with Management and staff in the context of their upcoming policy dialogue.
