STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND FOURTH REVIEW UNDER THE EXTENDED
ARRANGEMENT UNDER THE EXTENDED FUND FACILITY AND
REQUEST FOR MODIFICATION OF PERFORMANCE CRITERIA

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Addressing imbalances. For decades, Jamaica has been stuck in a negative spiral of low
growth, high unemployment, high debt, and precarious fiscal finances. In an attempt to
break with the past, in 2013 the authorities embarked on an ambitious reform program,
supported by the Fund through the Extended Fund Facility.

A fragile recovery is underway. Growth is slowly picking up, there has been a sizeable
contraction of the current account deficit, and inflation is falling (although remains in the
high single digits). The 2014/15 budget targets an ambitious 7½ percent of GDP primary
surplus.
The reform agenda remains complex and challenging. A large fiscal adjustment has been
put in place, important tax reforms and a fiscal rule have been introduced, and the exchange
rate has been allowed to adjust in an effort to restore competitiveness. However, investor
confidence remains tentative and tangible signs of a growth and job creation dividend from
the painful reform efforts are urgently needed. Future policy priorities include improving tax
collection, creating a smaller and more efficient public sector, and removing red tape to
boost growth. Vulnerabilities within the financial system need to be proactively addressed,
including through an overhaul of the securities dealers industry.
The program is on track. Jamaica’s four-year, SDR 615.38 million (225 percent of quota)
Extended Arrangement under the EFF was approved by the IMF Executive Board on May 1,
2013, and the first three reviews under the program were completed on schedule. All endMarch 2014 quantitative performance criteria were met. The structural benchmarks for endMarch and April were also met, except that the Banking Services Bill required fine-tuning
after it had been tabled in March. Based on the strong performance to date and the
authorities’ updated policy intentions and commitments, staff recommends completion of
the fourth review under the extended arrangement.
But risks continue to be high. A delayed growth recovery could undermine social
support for the reform efforts, financial sector vulnerabilities could become more pressing,
or risks to external financing (including from PetroCaribe) could crystallize.

CONTEXT: A STRATEGY FOR SUSTAINED AND
EQUITABLE GROWTH
1.
For decades, Jamaica has been stuck in a negative spiral of low growth, high
unemployment, and precarious fiscal finances. Since the mid-1990s, annual economic growth has
averaged less than 1 percent and unemployment has been high (especially for the young). Weak
fiscal discipline, the materialization of contingent fiscal risks, and low growth have kept public debt
above 100 percent of GDP since the early 2000s, depressing investor sentiment and crowding out
private sector investment.
2.
Jamaica was hit hard by the global recession of 2008–10. Negative growth and its
consequences for labor markets caused poverty rates to nearly double (from 9.9 percent in 2007 to
17.6 percent by 2010). Declining receipts from exports, tourism, and remittances caused the current
account deficit to surge, triggering a sharp depreciation of the exchange rate and a spike in
inflation. A reform program, supported by the Fund, was put in place in 2010, predicated on a
gradual fiscal adjustment, an upfront debt exchange, and front-loaded financial support from the
international community. However, fiscal slippages and delays in structural reforms caused the
program to go off track within the first year. As a consequence, Jamaica’s external position eroded
further, debt rose to almost 150 percent of GDP, and international reserves were rapidly depleted.
3.
In 2013 the Jamaican authorities decided to redouble their reform efforts, narrowly
avoiding a full-blown balance of payments, banking and fiscal crisis. The authorities’ program,
which has been supported by the Fund since May 2013 through an extended arrangement under
the EFF, tackles head-on the challenges of low growth and high debt. The reform effort has
significant political support from the current government (which holds a two-thirds majority in
parliament) and has performed well despite the complexity and difficulty of the reform agenda.
4.
The authorities’ program tackles key shortcomings that were repeatedly highlighted
by Fund surveillance. The strategy comprises several, mutually reinforcing areas:


Boosting private sector-led growth.



Protecting social spending and fortifying the safety net.



Putting the public debt on a sustainable downward trajectory.



Restoring competitiveness through productivity improvements and allowing the exchange rate
to adjust as a means to reduce the reliance on imports and create jobs.



Securing funding for private investment through strengthening the financial system and
lessening the crowding out from government borrowing.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA

Critical reforms were frontloaded during the first year of the program, including a comprehensive
public sector wage agreement, a debt exchange, a sweeping tax reform, and a difficult fiscal
adjustment (Box 1).
Box 1. Achievements in the First Program Year
During the first year of implementation of the Fund-supported program, important policy
adjustments and structural reforms were implemented:


To help restore debt sustainability, as prior actions, the Debt Law was adopted, and future debt
service was reduced through a February 2013 debt exchange for domestic government debt.



The primary surplus of the central government was increased to 7.5 percent of GDP in 2013/14,
with near balance for the overall public sector. A draft 2014/15 budget, consistent with the
program, and a comprehensive public sector investment program have been tabled.



A fiscal rule was adopted in March 2014, putting limits on the annual overall public sector
balance, anchored on a reduction in public debt to 60 percent of GDP by 2025/26. This
legislation also established a new permanent budget calendar, under which the budget is to be
adopted before the start of the fiscal year.



Fiscal consolidation was supported by a multi-year wage agreement, as a prior action.



Wide-ranging tax reform has been implemented, including a Charities Act, the replacement of
discretionary tax waivers and many sectoral tax incentives by transparent and standardized
incentives, and import duty reform to reduce tariff dispersion. The elimination of the zero
rating of government purchases under the General Consumption Tax has been delayed to June
2014 (MEFP ¶12).



Tax administration was strengthened by increasing staffing of the Large Taxpayers Office, and
legislation to increase the powers of the tax administration.



Reform of the securities dealers sector was started, making less risky business models
(collective investments schemes) available to securities dealers, and preparing a legal and
regulatory framework to mitigate risks posed by the retail repo business model (MEFP ¶28 and
¶29).



Legislation was adopted or tabled in parliament to address unlawful financial operations and
strengthen financial sector supervision.



Reforms to improve the business climate included streamlining of the business registration
process, and progress in reducing the backlog in construction permits. A new Bankruptcy Act
has been tabled in parliament.

capacity building to support the program.

AN EMERGING RECOVERY AMID SHRINKING FISCAL
AND EXTERNAL IMBALANCES
6.
Recent data suggest a gradual economic recovery is underway. The economy is estimated
to have grown by 1.6 percent (y/y) in the first quarter of 2014, and by 0.9 percent over 2013/14 as a
whole, with improving performance in mining, agriculture, and tourism. Recorded unemployment
remains high, but is declining (from 16.0 percent to 13.5 percent in seasonally adjusted terms between
April 2013 and January 2014). Domestic demand has been very weak due to both fiscal consolidation
and real income losses from the growth slowdown. Despite this, the ongoing depreciation has lead to
rising import prices which has fed through to CPI inflation which was 7.6 percent at end-April.
7.
The central government primary fiscal surplus was 7½ percent of GDP in 2013/14. This
adjustment—from 5¼ percent of GDP in 2012/13, and 3½ percent in 2011/12—was borne largely by
expenditure compression as tax revenues fell short (by about 1 percent of GDP), reflecting lower
imports and weak employment. This was even with a tax package that was introduced with the
2013/14 budget. The overall balance of the public bodies has neared zero, but performance has
remained uneven, with continued shortfalls for the oil company Petrojam and Clarendon Alumina
Production (CAP). The overall balance of the combined public sector has overperformed relative to the
projections made at the start of the program owing to lower interest costs.
8.
The current account deficit remains substantial but has improved sharply. The ongoing
fiscal consolidation, weak domestic demand, and an 8 percent adjustment in the real exchange rate
(since mid-2012) have all contributed to the external adjustment. The current account deficit was
9.5 percent of GDP in 2013/14 (a reduction of 2 percentage points relative to the previous year) and
gross international reserves have started to recover (standing at US$1.8 billion at end-May),

covering about 3 months of next year’s imports of goods and services. There has, however, been a
switch towards borrowed reserves since late 2013, as Jamaican banks have invested in longer-term
FX deposits at the central bank.1
9.
Financial market conditions have tightened, slowing credit growth. Reserve money
growth has fallen below program projections. The liquidity of the financial system has also been
tighter than expected, mainly due to liquidity sterilization by the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) and ongoing
inactivity of the secondary markets in government bonds since the February 2013 debt exchange.
This lack of trading likely stems from a higher risk premium on these instruments after the second
debt exchange in three years, a lingering apprehension about the sustainability of the reform effort,
and market participants’ reluctance to restart trading at overly discounted prices. The BOJ has
responded since late 2013 by stepping up open market operations and providing liquidity through
an overnight window, two-week repos and, in early 2014, six month repos. Through these actions,
most of the earlier liquidity contraction had effectively been reversed by the end of the fiscal year.
Despite these efforts, interbank rates for overnight funds have risen (peaking at 14–16 percent by
mid-February) and credit to the private sector has decelerated to 7 percent (y/y) in March 2014.
Moreover, new credit is increasingly concentrated in retail credit with banks reluctant to extend
credit at longer maturities to fund corporate investment.
10.
Standard indicators of the soundness of the financial system remain broadly positive,
but may not fully reflect underlying vulnerabilities. Commercial banks’ capital adequacy ratios
remained stable, at 14 percent at end-December, while non-performing loans (NPLs) declined to
5.2 percent of total loans from 5.8 percent at end-September, with almost full provisioning. Stress
test results for end-March 2014 from the BoJ confirmed that while loan delinquency is expected to
stay high under various macroeconomic stresses, banks’ capital positions largely remained in
compliance with capital requirements under a range of hypothetical shocks—including a
simultaneous impact of increases in interest rates, currency depreciation, credit quality deterioration
and deposit outflow. Securities dealers also meet the applicable capital and leverage requirements
at 10 percent of risk weighted assets and 6 percent of total assets, respectively. However, the
financial system remains heavily exposed to government debt holdings, and a decline in the market
value of government bonds could have a sizeable negative impact on financial institutions’ capital.

AN IMPROVING OUTLOOK
11.
The steadfast implementation of planned policies will support a gradual economic
recovery. The broad macroeconomic framework that underpinned the authorities’ program request
one year ago still seems realistic.


Growth. As the negative fiscal impulse comes to an end, the backlog in construction permits is
reduced (MEFP ¶35), and the U.S. economy strengthens, growth is projected to exceed one

percent in 2014/15. This trend is confirmed by recent surveys pointing to rising business
confidence (see Annex V). Going forward, production is expected to benefit from improved
competitiveness, and construction of the first of the authorities’ strategic investments projects
(see below). The gradual impact of various supply side efforts and rising confidence is expected
to raise growth to more than two percent over the medium term, which is well above the
average of 0.6 percent over the past two decades.




Inflation. For FY2014/15 inflation has been revised
down to 8 percent, and a gradual further reduction
is projected over the program period and beyond,
with changes in the monetary regime (see below).
The pass through of the currency depreciation has
been smaller than in previous episodes of
exchange rate adjustment, probably as a result of
the weakness of domestic demand, caused in part
by the relatively tight liquidity conditions.

years, increased domestic production is expected to reduce reliance on imports, and the current
account deficit should continue to adjust downwards. The identified pipeline of foreign direct
investment inflows, attracted by improving confidence and competitiveness, will help finance the
current account over the medium term.

BUT WITH SALIENT DOWNSIDE RISKS
12.
Risks remain high (Annex I). Investor confidence is frail as doubts remain about the
efficacy of the various adjustment efforts, financing constraints, and possible reform fatigue. The
slow recovery of economic confidence risks also delaying the return of liquidity to the debt market.
On the fiscal side, weak revenues, a deteriorating performance by the public bodies, or a disruption
in external financing (including PetroCaribe financing by Venezuela), all represent risks that could
strain public finances and derail debt reduction. The debt outlook could also worsen as a result of
less favorable financing terms. Finally, Jamaica remains vulnerable to natural disasters, lower
partner-country growth, and oil price shocks, as well as the economic drag of pervasive crime.
13.
Failure of Jamaica’s reform effort could have serious adverse regional repercussions,
including through financial linkages. The main economic channels would be through financial
sector entities that are also located in other Caribbean islands, and through holdings of Jamaican
government bonds. Trade linkages are limited. Failure of Jamaica’s program could also undermine
traction within the region of fundamental economic reform.

investments are implemented and transform the economy. At the same time, and notwitstanding
their unwavering comittment to implementing the program, officials were concerned about the
society’s capacity to absorb ongoing painful reforms, including exchange rate depreciation, without
tangible benefits becoming manifest in the form of jobs and income growth. They also highlighted
the administrative and legislative capacity constraints to reform, which had already resulted in minor
delays. Finally, they stressed the difficult trade-offs between the pace of fiscal and external
adjustment and the space for supporting domestic demand, particularly through delaying needed
public investment.

THE GOALS OF THE REFORM AGENDA
A.

A Path Toward Sustained Growth and Competitiveness

15.
A comprehensive growth strategy (MEFP ¶35–41). Reinforcing the credibility of the
macroeconomic reforms is key to support investment and growth. Key supply side impediments to
overcome are:

Barbados

Governance. In mid-March, the authorities tabled the Integrity Commission Act to establish a
single anti-corruption agency.

Jamaica



Belize

Bureaucratic red tape. A tracking system for the approval of construction permits—which has
been a source of extensive investment delays—is being implemented during 2014, in
collaboration with the World Bank. Further reforms to enhance the business climate aim to
extend land titling (with Inter-American Development Bank (IaDB) support) and create an on-line
process for business registration (delayed from June 2014 to early 2015). In addition, the
authorities plan to streamline cumbersome import-export requirements through a Port
Community System that would build on the ASYCUDA system for automating customs
procedures (to be introduced gradually from end-2014).

developed with World Bank assistance, should
strengthen governance in the sector and facilitate access to the grid by new power producers.
United States



INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA



Labor market impediments. The authorities plan to enhance the job training component of the
social protection programs. Recently tabled legislation will introduce flexible work arrangements,
allowing more continuous use of machinery and more varied opening hours. There is also a
need to enhance labor market flexibility (including by tackling high separation costs) to facilitate
the needed adjustment of labor from nontradeable to tradeable sectors.



Limited access to credit. The authorities noted the BOJ’s efforts to address this important
bottleneck by addressing liquidity constraints and highlighted their current campaign to
encourage the use of recent legislation on the use of movable property as collateral. Further
actions will be aided by a developmental FSAP undertaken by the World Bank.



Tax compliance costs. Ongoing efforts to improve the ease of paying taxes include steps to
promote e-filing and e-payments. The authorities also pointed to plans to support business
taxation simplification and transparency, particularly for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs),
and legal and administrative changes for handling business tax appeals.



Crime. Violence in Jamaica has deterred investment, affected capital formation, and discouraged
business development. Corporate surveys consistently identify crime as a key constraint to doing
business in Jamaica. Recent government initiatives to reduce crime include the development of
the National Crime Prevention and Community Safety Strategy (NCPCSS), and a Community
Renewal Program (CRP).



Infrastructure shortcomings. The government is pursuing strategic investments, in particular to
finalize a network of critical highways and establish Jamaica as a logistics hub. The latter
initiative comprises the privatization of the Kingston Terminal Port (before end-2014) and the
Norman-Manley Airport, and the establishment of a transshipment port. The recent creation of
Agroparks (sponsored by the IaDB and the European Union), in which land is prepared for
farming and then leased to private entrepreneurs, has started to increase agricultural
production.

16.
The authorities were encouraged by the progress to-date on policies to enhance
growth and job creation. They emphasized that a very large number of legislative measures had
been adopted during the past year including the fiscal incentives regime, which had lowered the
effective tax rate for business operators. They pointed also to initiatives that were underway to
promote delivery of government services to support investment, including through more
expeditious provision of services such as water and electricity.
17.
The real depreciation of the exchange rate since mid-2012 opens up an essential but
contentious path to restoring Jamaican competitiveness. The depreciation of the exchange rate
has been highly unpopular domestically and there has been little apparent recognition of the jobcreating benefits of currency adjustment. This is in part fueled by the slow responsiveness of exports
(other than tourism) to the weaker currency and the clear near-term costs through imported
inflation. It is also a product of historical experience whereby past depreciations led to bursts of
inflation with little benefit for the real economy. However, there are now promising signs that
domestic production is beginning to replace imports for some agricultural goods and the impact on
net exports (in particular in agriculture and agro-processing) should continue to grow.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA

18.
Following the substantial adjustment that has taken place, the remaining
overvaluation of the Jamaican dollar appears modest. Staff judge this overvaluation to be
around 3–15 percent relative to medium-term fundamentals and planned policies. This is less than
the 8–22 percent assessed in April 2013 (see Annex III) but ongoing depreciation of the nominal
exchange rate will be needed, particularly given the sizable inflation differential with Jamaica’s main
trading partners. Policies to raise productivity and remove obstacles to investment and trade will be
essential to complement exchange rate adjustment in restoring external competitiveness and lower
the current account deficit toward its longer-term equilibrium (of around 5 percent of GDP).
19.
The authorities agreed on the merits of exchange rate flexibility, and noted the
emerging shift to domestic production in response to the recent depreciation. At the same
time, they pointed to the economic uncertainty and adverse social implications generated by rapid
exchange rate depreciation. Accordingly, they emphasized the case for limiting the need for nominal
exchange rate changes through supply-side measures to improve external competitiveness and
through a further reduction in inflation to more moderate levels.

B.

Creating Jobs and Addressing Social Inequalities

20.
Targeted actions are needed to leverage the impact of the growth strategy on
employment prospects, especially for young people, the low skilled, and women. Skills
development will be critical to address Jamaica’s very high unemployment among youth (which
stood at 33.3 percent in January 2014). In 2013, approximately 1,400 people received training for
entering the workforce through the HEART (Human Employment And Resource Training Trust)
workforce colleges. To help address chronic unemployment, especially among low-skilled labor and
persons with special needs, about 40,000 Jamaicans were employed under the Jamaica Emergency
Employment Program (JEEP) by end-2013. Women have been hit particularly hard by the downturn
since 2008, as female unemployment has increased by 3.6 percentage points, to 17.4 percent (male
unemployment rose by 2.8 percentage points, to 10.1 percent). Programs should address the risk of
marginalization and lack of opportunities including through access to basic health and education
services for young children from poor households. Education systems need to be reoriented to the
changing economic demands, with more emphasis on technical and ICT skills.
21.
The government has put significant weight on strengthening social protection
programs (MEFP ¶41,42). In the past, the fiscal room for social programs has been crowded out by
Jamaica’s high interest costs. Despite the significant fiscal adjustment that has taken place, the
government has underscored the importance of reversing this erosion and is committed to, as a
minimum, maintaining the real value of social spending over the next 3 years. The existing
conditional cash transfer program (PATH), a vital component of that social safety net, is being
strengthened with repeated increases in the transfer amounts (well beyond inflation), and with
World Bank and IaDB assistance. A recertification exercise has been initiated to ensure it remains
well targeted. There is also some scope to expand support for the training of program participants
and addressing areas of duplication and overlap with programs outside of PATH.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA

C.

Entrenching Fiscal and Debt Sustainability

22.
Upfront and sustained adjustment of the primary balance is at the heart of the
authorities’ fiscal strategy. Experience across smaller countries offers support for the proposition
that important debt reduction can be implemented through sustained increases in the primary
balance as long as the emphasis is on structurally reducing the wage bill and boosting tax revenues
(Box 2). Given the high debt and its effect on confidence and activity, Jamaica will unfortunately
need to sustain its high primary surplus for many years and will, as a result, not be in a position to
smooth economic volatility through countercyclical policies.2 Such an effort will require a significant
social and political commitment over the course of several years. The authorities confirmed their
determination to maintain the primary surplus of the central government at 7½ percent of GDP, and
the balance of the combined public bodies at zero, during the program period (MEFP ¶26).
23.
The 2014/15 budget remains aligned with program targets. The ongoing reduction in
the government wage bill owing to the multiyear wage agreement allows for the maintenance of
capital spending, despite a return of nontax revenues to previous (lower) levels. Given a lack of
buoyancy in tax revenues, new tax policy measures were needed to maintain the tax revenue ratio
(MEFP ¶9), and the room for new spending initiatives remains constrained.3 In addition, recent
history suggests a possibility of revenues continuing to fall short which underscores the imperative
of efforts to strengthen revenue collection (see below) and puts a premium on identifying spending
contingencies early on which can be deployed if needed to safeguard achievement of the overall
fiscal target without a further contraction in critical capital expenditures.
24.
Accelerating improvements in revenue collection will be key to the success of the
government’s fiscal strategy. The recent elimination of discretionary tax waivers and the
replacement of sector-specific tax incentives with a more standardized approach should reduce rent
seeking and create a broader and more reliable revenue base (MEFP ¶11–14). However, the objective
of broadening the revenue base to create room for lower tax rates has been only partly achieved
and more could be done (e.g. by including electricity consumption in the Generalized Consumption
Tax above a consumption threshold to protect the poor). The IaDB is providing technical assistance
to help gauge the scope for such further efforts. On the administration side, taxpayer registration is
relatively low and high compliance costs discourage filing and payment. Furthermore, the audit
program pursues relatively few cases to completion. Under a new action plan, developed with
FAD/IaDB TA, the government is prioritizing: (i) establishing a tax administration modernization
program with a dedicated manager and staff; (ii) developing a set of productivity indicators to judge
performance; (iii) implementing new IT systems for both tax and customs administration;
2

Even so, an exceptionally large adverse shock could necessitate a temporary deviation from the debt reduction
path, and for this purpose an escape clause was built into the fiscal rule.
3

Tax revenue as a share of GDP is expected to effectively increase by 0.1 percent of GDP from 2013/14. The larger
increase shown in the tables reflects the extension of the General Consumption Tax to government purchases which
will raise recorded revenues and expenditures by the same amount. Other new tax measures include broadening the
base of the excise and consumption taxes, along with raising taxes on financial entities’ assets.

(iv) strengthening the Large Taxpayer Office (LTO), with increased audit coverage, and mandatory
electronic filing and electronic payment; and (v) introducing new enforcement powers (e.g., to seize
and sell property) through additional legislation (MEFP ¶15, 16).
25.
Getting greater control over the financial performance of the public bodies is critical.
Repeated slippages in the balance of the many public bodies have highlighted the vulnerability of
the government’s goals for the overall balance of the public sector. Lessening this vulnerability
would involve strict government oversight to control the finances of public bodies, adjusting
regulated prices on a timely basis to promote cost-recovery, and addressing overdue payments to
public utility companies, including by local governments. The authorities broadly agreed with these
measures but also argued for excluding large commercial entities, in particular, Petrojam, from the
overall public sector balance, given that its operations were determined by commercial
considerations and were outside the direct control of government.
26.

A range of reforms are underway to strengthen fiscal institutions:

determination to

discipline anchored on an ambitious target for debt reduction. While no particular definition of
public debt is unequivocally superior, the shift that is foreseen under the fiscal rule (after the
program period) to a more broad measure of public debt—beyond that defined in the Fundsupported program—is warranted (see text figure). In this regard, work is ongoing to define
which public entities are considered to be commercially-oriented, and to entrench the rule into
public expectations so that future governments are held accountable for deviations from the
rule (MEFP ¶17, 18).



Contingent Liabilities. Much of the past build up of debt occurred as fiscal risks materialized.
Preventing a repeat requires much stronger controls over guarantees and other contingent
liabilities. To address this, the government is planning to incorporate a comprehensive fiscal
risks statement in the annual budget and has put a cap on the cumulative value of loans for
PPPs, at 3 percent of GDP for the next three years. In addition, the government is committed to

13

refrain from any further government financial support for the state-owned Clarendon Aluminum
Production (CAP) company.


Public Financial Management. The authorities’ have an extensive agenda for PFM reform,
supported by the World Bank and IaDB (MEFP ¶19, 20). Several actions are worth highlighting
that will support the effectiveness of the fiscal rule. These include developing early and accurate
budget envelopes and priorities; increasing the reliability of revenue projections; fully
implementing the central treasury management system; enhancing the capacity to assess and
report fiscal risks and contingencies associated with PPPs; and implementing the newly created
Public Investment Management System to improve investment planning.

27.
A sustained reduction in the wage bill depends critically on accelerating reforms to
modernize the public sector (MEFP ¶24). The multi-year agreement that limits public sector wages,
and aims to help reduce the wage bill to 9 percent of GDP, has been vital to achieving the near-term
fiscal adjustment. However, such a compression in real wages is not sustainable over a longer
horizon and will need to be replaced by deeper reforms that:



Address duplication and inefficiencies in public employment;
Close, streamline and divest public entities;
Align remuneration with job requirements;
Automate the systems for remuneration and human resource management;
Strengthen control systems and accountability (including in auditing, and procurement).

While some of these steps have started, the pace of reform needs to be accelerated and given a
higher priority, with an ambitious action plan and strict timelines. This would allow the government
to have ready a more comprehensive approach to personnel management and control of the wage
bill once the wage agreement expires (in early 2015).

Box 2. Episodes of Large Debt Reduction in Smaller States—Benchmarking the Ongoing
Debt Reduction in Jamaica
Experience from successful debt reduction episodes underscores the importance of adhering to strong primary fiscal surplus
objectives to achieve lasting gains in debt reduction. .Jamaica’s public debt reduction goal (50 pp of GDP from 2012/13 to
2019/20) would place it near the top of smaller countries which successfully reduced their debt through a large fiscal
consolidation.1 Out of 35 cases in which countries started to improve their primary fiscal balance, 14 successfully reduced their
debt ratio 4 years out and 11 of these cases featured a cumulative improvement in the primary balance over the 5-year period.

one percentage point of GDP or more and last as long as the primary fiscal balance does not deteriorate from the previous year. Fiscal consolidation is
deemed successful if a country’s debt to GDP ratio remains lower four years following the year preceding the fiscal consolidation episode. The analysis
focuses on the 30 percent largest episodes of fiscal consolidation, abstracting from resource exporters. The focus is on countries no larger than
Jamaica, as smaller economies tend to be more open and with smaller fiscal multipliers (Amo-Yartey and Turner-Jones (2014)), which would lessen the
output cost of adjustment.

28.
Significant unfunded liabilities make public sector pension reform a priority. Spending
on pensions has risen from 2 percent of GDP to 3 percent over the past decade. The authorities have
tabled a White Paper on public sector pension reform that proposes parametric changes, including a
gradual increase in the normal retirement age from 60 to 65 years (MEFP ¶25). The reforms were
expected to be implemented by 2016 and would limit the rise in pension fund deficits to about
0.5 percent of GDP over the coming decade. However, the general public pension system remains
financially unsustainable and steps will be needed to assess and close the emerging gap.
29.
Under the program, Jamaica’s public debt has been put onto a sustainable path. Over
the past year, significant progress has been made in identifying and implementing policies to ensure
the government’s goal—of public debt at 96 percent of GDP by March 2020—becomes a reality.
At end-March 2014 estimated debt stood at 140 percent of GDP and it is expected to fall by
5–8 percentage points per year into the medium term. While there are significant uncertainties
surrounding any debt forecast, under currently identified policies the debt level is expected at
99 percent of GDP by March 2020. However, the authorities continue working to identifying
additional debt-asset swaps, asset sales and the withdrawal of existing guarantees so as to achieve
the 96 percent of GDP goal by March 2020 (MEFP ¶22).
30.
Nevertheless, Jamaica’s public debt trajectory remains vulnerable to a range of
macroeconomic, fiscal and contingent liability shocks (Annex II). There was general recognition
of these vulnerabilities and there is an ongoing effort to mitigate them through the range of fiscal
reforms discussed above and efforts to strengthen debt management and improve debt recording
and monitoring. The authorities are in the process of preparing an enhanced debt management
strategy, as well as a plan for Jamaica’s return to international markets.

D.

Fortifying the Framework for Monetary Policy

31.
Since late 2012, monetary policy has been successfully geared toward rebuilding
reserves and containing inflation. The BOJ has pursued a tight monetary policy to contain
inflation, weaken the pass through from the currency depreciation into domestic prices, avoid the
entrenchment of inflation expectations, and support some accumulation of international reserves.
The results of these efforts are becoming more visible with both declining inflation and a steady
build-up of reserves. Going forward further reserve accumulation is still warranted (Annex IV) and
efforts should be made to shift the composition of reserves away from the recent reliance on
borrowed reserves. The authorities explained that to avoid possible refinancing pressures, an early
rollover and a gradual return to owned reserves would be sought.
32.
Implementation of monetary policy has been challenging, aimed at shielding credit to
the economy despite the tight overall policy stance. With the continued lack of activity on the
secondary market in government bonds, the resulting loss of market liquidity, and the coincident
decline in interbank market activity and in credit to the private sector, the BOJ has been forced to
help banks’ manage their liquidity through intensified open market operations (including, at times,
simultaneously injecting and withdrawing liquidity at different maturities). This increased role for the
BOJ in compensating for the lack of market functioning has increased the urgency of improving the

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA

BOJ’s instruments to achieve its targets for inflation and reserves. Specifically, the BOJ should move
from a policy of managing quantities to an increased reliance on interest rates through the creation
of a corridor for short-term market interest rates. This would help both to provide clearer signals of
the monetary policy stance and to improve the pricing of short-term liquidity. Consistency between
policy interest rates and the monetary stance should also help limit the dollarization pressures that
currently complicate attainment of the BOJ’s reserves targets. Furthermore, the provision of liquidity
to banks on a more predictable and consistent basis could help address undue risk aversion on the
side of banks in providing credit. The authorities broadly concurred with a cautious reorientation
along these lines and were planning an initial step of making the overnight stand-by liquidity
window available to banks with more certainty and at a price consistent with its policy goals
(MEFP ¶33).
33.
Although the targets for NIR and NDA (combined with a flexible exchange rate)
provide appropriate intermediate monetary anchors at the current juncture, over the medium
term the BOJ plans to put in place the operational tools for an inflation targeting framework
(MEFP ¶34). For many years now Jamaica has struggled with both substantial inflation and
reluctance to allow for needed exchange rate flexibility. This has led over time to a chronic problem
of currency overvaluation, suppressing growth and raising vulnerabilities. A commitment to a
managed floating regime will be a critical buffer for an economy with little diversification that is
subject to significant external shocks. The monetary anchor would then need to be squarely based
on price stability through an inflation targeting framework. While such a shift is some years away,
the building blocks for an eventual move should be steadily put in place by improving the
functioning of the foreign exchange market, upgrading statistics, building technical (modeling and
forecasting) capacity within the BOJ, and amending the BOJ law to strengthen its independence. A
well-functioning credit channel and active money markets are also important building blocks for
inflation targeting.

E.

Institutionalizing Sound Financial Intermediation

34.
For sustained long-term growth, a sound financial system that is squarely focused on
intermediating savings to productive private sector uses will be essential. Over the past
decades, the financial system has focused too much on diverting resources to the public sector. This
has come at the cost of crowding out financing for productive, growth enhancing investment as
illustrated by a stock of credit to the private sector that is low, at 22 percent of GDP, and well below
regional comparators (Figure 3). Beyond the planned fiscal consolidation, the recent establishment
of two credit bureaus and the creation of a central collateral registry should help develop the credit
market over the medium term.
35.
The draft Banking Services legislation marks an important step forward in creating a
safer banking system (MEFP ¶27). 4 The bill harmonizes prudential standards across deposit-taking

institutions, facilitates the consolidated supervision of financial conglomerates, strengthens the
corrective action and sanctioning regime, and promotes the BOJ’s operational independence in its
supervision function. However, further steps are still needed, to put in place a comprehensive crisis
management and resolution framework for banks (and other financial firms) as well as create full
operational independence of the supervisors.

and securities dealers that create
channels for contagion. The drying up of secondary markets in government paper and the
tightening of financial market liquidity more generally, have heightened systemic liquidity risks. At
the same time, once the bond market re-liquefies, there is a good chance that the sovereign yield
curve will shift upwards and lead to capital losses for a range of financial companies.
37.
Careful sequencing will, therefore, be needed to unfreeze the secondary bond market.
Beyond the impact on financial sector risks, the lack of liquidity has added to the government’s cash
management and overall financing constraints, undermined effective monetary transmission, and
reduced the provision of credit to the private sector. The market may restart naturally as confidence
in the success of the program deepens. However, in the absence of a market-driven unfreezing of
the secondary bond market, options for restarting the bond market through policy actions should
still be considered. The BOJ could, for example, start to offer to purchase securities via open market
operations through variable rate auctions (with a minimum bid price) that would begin with shorter
maturity bonds and then gradually moving further out the curve. This would help with price
discovery and perhaps catalyze activity between financial institutions in the secondary market.
38.
Reform of the securities dealers is essential for financial stability. Securities dealers, with
total assets of about 40 percent of GDP, finance long-term government bonds with short-term,
deposit-like investments (“retail repos”). This model entails significant interest rate, liquidity, and
concentration risks, which are not matched by either capital or liquidity buffers. To mitigate these
risks and provide better protection to retail investors, a multi-step reform process has commenced
(MEFP ¶28–31). First, at end-2013, collective investment schemes (CIS) were made available, in which

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA

valuation risks are borne by the investor. Second, by end-2014 the government intends to introduce
a new legal and regulatory framework to better protect clients’ interests through standardized and
more transparent retail repo instruments. This new framework will be implemented over time. The
final phase of this reform will involve a gradual tightening of prudential requirements to reflect
underlying risks and incentivize a market-based shift to alternative, better regulated, and legally
sound investment products. Implementing this reform will need to be done carefully and will need
to be preconditioned on: (i) the introduction of credible exceptional financial backstops, at the
discretion of the BOJ, to bolster financial sector stability and (ii) a detailed assessments of securities
dealers’ readiness to move to a new framework; while also taking into account the liquidity
conditions of the secondary government bond market.

Several new and revised structural benchmarks are proposed as well as modified

Revisions to the existing performance criteria on the cumulative changes in net international
reserves and net domestic assets are proposed, to reflect the direct impact of Fund budget support
(see below) on the monetary targets. On the structural side, new benchmarks are proposed to:

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

JAMAICA



Ensure adherence to the cumulative ceiling on the value of new PPPs (of 3 percent of GDP)
consistent with the fiscal rule law (a continuous structural benchmark).



Implement pilot projects for the new information systems at the customs and tax
administration (by end-December 2014, and February 2015, respectively), and set targets for
strengthening the Large Taxpayers Office (March 2015).



Finalize an update of the e-Census database for all government employees (September
2014), and prepare an action plan for public sector transformation (September 2014).



Table in parliament the revised legislation on public sector pensions (June 2015).

The structural benchmark on putting in place the legal and regulatory framework for the securities
dealers sector is proposed to be moved from end-June to end-December 2014, given that the
complexity of the reform, which is designed with extensive technical assistance, demands further
preparation.
41.
The program remains fully financed and staff’s assessment of Jamaica’s capacity to
repay the Fund remains broadly unchanged from the last review (Table 10). Jamaica’s capacity
to repay the Fund will continue to depend on the timely and strong implementation of the
ambitious program. External financing has remained broadly in line with earlier program
assumptions, with IFI disbursements expected to be relatively backloaded in the current fiscal year.
However, the shift in the outlook for cash flows will create a timing problem for the budget in the
first half of the fiscal year (with cash flow deficits expected until October—including with a
US$200 million Eurobond payment due in October—and cash surpluses expected thereafter). At the
same time, the ability to smooth out the financing need is severely limited by the constraints on
domestic borrowing imposed by illiquidity in the government bond market (alongside the inactive
secondary market). To handle this temporary near-term cash-flow need, staff propose that the
scheduled June and September 2014 purchases under the extended arrangement should now be
provided in the form of direct budget support.5 Such budget support would help avoid or limit the
need to borrow at expensive rates on international markets or defer budget spending, and help
prevent the unwelcome precedent of the central bank offering direct credit to the government (the
absence of which has been a critical feature in the BOJ’s operational independence). Debt service to
the Fund and the purchase profile remain unchanged in the absence of significant revisions to the
macroeconomic outlook.

STATISTICS
42.
Notwitstanding important and ongoing improvements in statistics, shortcomings
remain to be addressed. The development of data on the components of GDP on the demand side
has started and the first data have recently been released. As a next step, STATIN is preparing these
indicators on a quarterly basis. The assessment of competitiveness could be enhanced through the

preparation of unit labor cost data to supplement existing wage data. STATIN considered updating
the—10 year old––CPI weights a priority, and was in discussion with the IaDB on a study of the
informal sector to improve GDP estimates.

STAFF APPRAISAL
43. Jamaica’s economic transformation program offers a path from decades of stagnation
to a future of sustained and vibrant growth. Emerging from the engrained trap of low-growth
and high debt requires a fundamental reorientation of policies. This will not happen overnight but
will take several years of concerted economic restructuring. This is a marathon effort and there are
no shortcuts. The government’s program is appropriately centered on a sustained fiscal
consolidation supported by wide-ranging supply side reforms to kick-start growth. Reducing debt to
a sustainable level is expected to take a decade of fiscal restraint and multiple years of productivityenhancing policies.
44. There has been significant progress in implementing the needed reforms. A large fiscal
adjustment has been put in place, achieving a primary surplus that is exceptional by international
standards. Important steps to sustain that adjustment have been made in the areas of tax reform
and in institutionalizing an effective fiscal rule. The framework for financial system oversight has
been fortified, monetary policy has been restrained, and the exchange rate has helped restore a
good deal of Jamaica’s lost competitiveness.
45. But the economic and social costs of this effort has been substantial. It is impossible to
ignore the near-term costs of the adjustment effort in terms of lost growth, weak job creation, and
socioeconomic pain. However, the alternative of continuing on Jamaica’s previous course was simply
untenable and would have inevitably ended in a fiscal and balance-of-payments crisis.
46. With a significant downpayment on the adjustment effort already made, there are
emerging signs of the dividends from reform. Investor confidence remains tentative and signs of
a revival in growth, job creation, and improving social welfare are still too limited and too tentative.
Nevertheless, crisis risks are receding, net exports are unambiguously stronger, inflation has been
wrestled under control, and reserves are starting to recover. With continued commitment to the
government’s economic strategy, the substantial economic and social benefits to these efforts
should become increasingly evident in the coming year.
47. However, the risks ahead are considerable. First and foremost, there is a risk that the social
cost from the wide-ranging changes that have been made over the past year could start to
undermine societal support for the reform effort and derail the gains that have been already made.
In this context, an ongoing emphasis on safeguarding social spending and increasing the social
safety net is critical. Second, there are important risks to the fiscal position. The weakness of
domestic demand has undermined revenue collection and growth-enhancing public investment
spending has been squeezed. A failure to stem the recent revenue decline will inevitably add to
fiscal risks. Third, potential financing shortfalls, including withdrawal of PetroCaribe inflows, would
create important downsides to both the fiscal and balance-of-payments positions. Fourth, a lack of

liquidity of the government bond market and the necessary reform of the securities’ dealers
business model entail risks to financial stability. However, it is important to emphasize that there are
important mitigants to these risks including from the ambitious upfront policy effort that has
already been undertaken, the visible support for the government’s strategy from domestic
stakeholders and international partners, and the demonstrated and unwavering commitment to the
program at the highest levels of government. As the program has strained Jamaica’s administrative
and legislative capacity, careful sequencing of the ongoing reform agenda will be important to
ensure its feasibility and allow for careful policy design.
48. A reorientation of fiscal policy remains at the core of the adjustment effort. The
immediate weakness of fiscal revenues calls for the prompt and steadfast implementation of the
action plan to improve tax collection. Public sector reform needs to be stepped up without delay; a
lasting fiscal consolidation, that supports rather than hinders private sector growth, will require a
smaller and more efficient public sector. The growth impact of scarce public investment spending
needs to be maximized through structured investment planning, prioritization and budgeting.
Finally, fiscal risks need to be carefully managed through tackling public sector waste, lessening
unfunded pension obligations, commercializing loss-making public enterprises, and putting in place
well-structured public-private partnerships.
49. Removing red tape and boosting competitiveness will bolster growth and job creation.
The return to a flexible exchange-rate has resulted in important improvements in price
competitiveness, and should be maintained. Reducing the price of electricity and training focused
on critical skills will also be key to competitiveness. Confidence in the coherence of policies will be
critical for boosting investor sentiment but private investment will only return if efforts are also
focused on removing pervasive red tape and bureaucracy.
50. While the overall stance of monetary policy has been broadly appropriate, policy should
shift toward a greater reliance on interest rate channels. Containing inflationary pressures in face
of exchange rate depreciation, and restoring an adequate level of reserves, necessitate a cautious
monetary policy stance. This, however, needs to be weighed against the risk of excessively tight
liquidity conditions undermining investment and creating risks in the financial system. To help
balance these competing demands a greater focus on interest rate control would be beneficial, by
providing more assured access to liquidity but at interest rates that are consistent with the need to
rebuild reserves. The recent creation of a standing liquidity window and the expansion of repo
instruments are welcome steps, but their design should be improved.
51. Vulnerabilities within the financial system need to be proactively addressed. The business
model of the securities dealers needs to be reoriented. Timely completion of this reform is
important, and the next steps of the reform of the “retail repo” model should be implemented as
soon as adequate safeguards have been put in place, including an adequate understanding of the
preparedness of the sector and creating a temporary backstop, on a discretionary basis, for possible
exceptional financing needs. Following the adoption of new legislation on bank supervision,
supervisors should move towards consolidated supervision, and the resolution framework remains
to be strengthened.

52.
While risks are high, continued strong implementation of the government’s economic
strategy, combined with the full support of the international community, are expected to
enable a return to growth, job creation, and a decline in poverty. At the same time, such
policies would deliver the ambitious adjustment in public debt that is targeted under the program
and ensure that the government is able to honor in full its debt obligations. The staff, therefore,
supports the authorities’ request for completion of the fourth review under the arrangement under
the Extended Fund Facility, and the proposed establishment and modification of performance
criteria.
53.
The next Article IV Consultation is expected to be held on a 24-month cycle in
accordance with the Decision on Article IV Consultation Cycles (Decision No. 14747-(10/96)
(9/28/2010)).

Main Threats
Capacity constraints to the
implementation of the reform agenda.

A continued lack of confidence that the
reforms will be maintained.

Continued inactivity of the secondary
market in government bonds.

Acute fiscal and/or external financing
pressures.

A decline in tourism and exports related
to a protracted period of slower growth
in advanced economies, and in particular
in the U.S.
Other risks, including weather-related
natural disasters and a possible increase
in crime.

Likelihood of Realization of the Threat

Expected Impact if Threat is Realized

Medium
The recent reforms, in particular those involving
legislation, have already tested capacity limits.
However, risks are being addressed through
intensive TA, resident advisors, and ongoing finetuning of the pace and sequencing of reforms.
Medium-Low
The authorities have demonstrated their
commitment to the reform program. However,
against a history of reform failure, many investors,
both in financial markets and in companies will need
a longer track record to be convinced.
Medium
The lack of secondary market activity reflects the
above-mentioned confidence gap as well as the
perception (after the second debt exchange) that a
debt restructuring could be repeated. Both concerns
should diminish over time as the program is
implemented.
Medium-High
Domestic demand for government paper is minimal.
External financing includes PetroCaribe inflows.
Financing from development partners is contingent
on program implementation.
Medium
The U.S. is Jamaica’s main market, and weaker U.S.
growth would affect Jamaica largely through tourism
flows.

Medium
For many reforms, a modest delay could be accommodated
without serious repercussions. Others, in particular those
related to budget implementation, are both critical and highly
time sensitive.

Medium
Weather related disasters are prevalent in Jamaica.
Crime is high.

Medium
Strong storms can cause serious damage and entail important
fiscal costs. Crime already poses high social costs, disincentives
to invest, and costs to business.

High
The return of confidence is imperative for investment and
growth. Furthermore, it is critical for restoring a liquid
government bond market (see below). Policy slippage would
have severe repercussions as the strategy hinges on sustained
fiscal consolidation.
High
Restoring secondary bond market activity is important given
the associated risks to the financial sector, and for the
provision of credit to firms. Moreover, it implies a lack of access
to market financing by the government.

High
While the impact is limited by the absence of net financing
needs, refinancing needs are expected to rise over the coming
years. A rise in financing pressures would compress the scope
for fiscal spending or lead to monetization of the deficit.
High
A decline in tourism demand would lead to reserve losses, and
pressure on the current account.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of
risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and
30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the
authorities. Non mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Annex I. Jamaica––Risk Assessment Matrix1

JAMAICA

Annex II. Jamaica––Debt Sustainability Analysis1
The debt sustainability analysis (DSA), based on the program’s medium-term macroeconomic
framework, indicates that Jamaica’s high public debt, though on a sustainable path, remains
vulnerable to macro-fiscal and contingent liability shocks.
Public DSA2
Jamaica’s public debt is now estimated to have fallen to 140 percent of GDP at the end of
2013/14. This mainly reflects ongoing fiscal consolidation efforts under the authorities’ Fundsupported program as well as gains from the debt exchange in February 2013.
The underlying macro assumptions have not changed materially from last assessment during
the second review (Figure 2). Jamaica’s forecast track record remains comparable with other Fundsupported program countries, without any systematic projection bias.
Under the program, debt is on a downward trajectory but remains vulnerable to key macrofiscal and contingent liability shocks. This is in line with the assessment made during the second
review of the Fund-supported program. With continued fiscal consolidation and modest growth
recovery, the public debt to GDP ratio is estimated to fall to 99.3 percent by 2019/20.
The baseline debt path remains highly vulnerable to slippages in the fiscal consolidation
program. The three-year average underlying cyclically adjusted primary balance, taking 2012/13 as
the starting point, is estimated to be above 8 percent of GDP, with an implied adjustment of about
5 percent of GDP (Figure 2). This adjustment is estimated to have been realized in the 2013/14 fiscal
year with a primary balance outturn of about 7.5 percent of GDP. This implied fiscal adjustment
appears exceptional relative to the distribution of other Fund-supported program countries. 3 This
underscores the extreme dependence of the debt reduction path on a successful sustained fiscal
consolidation program, and the importance of the frontloaded structural reforms under the program
that aim to strengthen fiscal policy.
Risks remain high (Figure 1). One year into the Fund-supported program, Jamaica’s debt burden,
though declining, continues to remain higher than in comparable emerging market economies. The
baseline debt remains vulnerable to macrofiscal and contingent liability shocks. The debt profile also
remains subject to high risks from external financing requirements (excluding PetroCaribe debt) and

This assessment is an update of the full DSA during the second EFF review which was approved by the Board in
December 2013. See staff assessment in the staff report of the second review under the Fund-supported EFF
arrangement (Jamaica: Second Review Under the Extended Arrangement Under the Extended Fund Facility and
Request for Modification of Performance Criteria).

potential large bond spreads should Jamaica return to the capital market. Indeed, after maturities
were extended through the debt exchange, both domestic and foreign refinancing needs are
expected to rise over the coming years, and meeting these will require that the ability to access both
domestic and foreign markets is restored. Medium-term financing needs are expected to be met
through a fairly balanced mix of domestic and external sources. There is also a moderate elevation
in real interest rate risks (this was not identified as a source of concern in the last assessment) as
interest rates have not adjusted downwards with declining inflation. As was the case in the last
assessment, risks to the debt outlook remain on the upside as indicated by both the symmetric and
asymmetric (allowing for zero maximum positive primary balance and real appreciation shocks) fan
charts.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government and includes public guarantees .
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over U.S. bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes changes in the stock of guarantees, asset changes, and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.
10/ Primary deficit in the DSA for Jamaica is lower compared to fiscall tables since the DSA excludes interest revenues.

External DSA
Jamaica’s external public debt is expected to remain stable over the medium term, but
some vulnerability remains (Table 1). The current uncertainty about the continuity of the
PetroCaribe arrangement has elevated the risks to the external debt due to Jamaica’s
dependence on financing from PetroCaribe. Aside from the elevated risks from the sustainability
of the PetroCaribe financing, the external debt outlook also remains vulnerable to sharp
movements in the exchange rate and current account shocks (Figure 6). The total external debt is
now projected to drop to about 57 percent of GDP by 2018/19 compared to a projection of
61 percent in the last assessment, mainly as a result of a shift to PetroCaribe financing which is
currently considered as domestic financing.4

________________________________
4

While all the liabilities under the PetroCaribe arrangement are from a foreign source (Venezuela) and accounted
for in Jamaica’s public debt, the convention under the EFF program is to record PetroCaribe financing of the
central government under domestic debt, partly because the operation occurs among two domestic parties,
including the sovereign (the central government and the PetroCaribe Development Fund (PDF), a Jamaica-based
public body). As a consequence, only PetroCaribe debt that flows to entities outside the central government is
recorded as external debt. These entities, though also domestic, borrow from Petro Caribe mostly on the strength
of their own balance sheets—such liabilities are considered part of domestic debt only when they are explicitly
guaranteed by the central government.

Annex III. Jamaica’s External Stability, Exchange Rate, and
Competitiveness Assessment1
Jamaica’s external position has begun to improve. The government’s policies under the Fundsupported program have started to yield results. Imports have compressed sharply as a result of the
ongoing fiscal consolidation and exchange rate depreciation, resulting in sharp improvements in the
current account. The Bank of Jamaica has begun rebuilding international reserves even though net
international reserves have not yet returned to pre-crisis levels. Jamaica’s net indebtedness to the
rest of the world has improve marginally, reflecting the initial gains from the government’s policy
reforms in the last year, but still remains high compared to peers in the region. The program
includes measures that are projected to restore competitiveness and reduce external imbalances.

Jamaica’s current account balance is improving and projected to return to sustainable levels
over the medium term. The large negative contribution of the trade balance is beginning to
reduce, largely due to import compression (as firms, mostly agro-based industries, continue to look
for local alternatives to some imported inputs) as a result of the ongoing fiscal consolidation and the
depreciation of the currency. However, the expected recovery of exports has delayed. The current
account balance continues to be financed mainly through official financing (driving net other
investments) and some recovery in foreign direct investment.

External vulnerabilities remain as Jamaica
continues to accumulate large negative net
international investment position (IIP). The main
sources, as at the end of 2012, are negative foreign
direct investment (mainly investment in mining and
construction), other investments (mainly general
government loans) and to some extent, portfolio
investments. Preliminary data as at December 2013
indicate slowdown in direct and portfolio
investment, and reserve assets are projected to
increase over the medium-term based on the
government’s planned policies. These should help to
improve the medium-term net IIP projection even
though it will continue to remain high.

Following the substantial adjustment that has already taken place, the remaining
overvaluation of the Jamaican dollar appears modest.2 In May 2013, the exchange rate was
assessed to be overvalued by 9–22 percent, but the current assessment, consistent with mediumterm fundamentals and planned policies, indicates overvaluation of 3–15 percent.

In the 2013 AREAER, the exchange rate was classified as a de facto craw-like regime. Since mid-2012, there has
been significant progress toward exchange rate flexibility. The authorities are concerned about the economic
uncertainty and adverse social implications generated by rapid exchange rate depreciation (see paragraphs 17–19).

The macroeconomic balance (MB) approach which compares the underlying current account
balance (i.e., the actual medium-term balance stripped off cyclical influences) with a norm derived
from fundamentals (such as oil balance, demographic/income status, fiscal position, net external
position, remittances, and aid inflows) and suggests an overvaluation of 3 percent (lower than the
8 percent overvaluation found in the 2011 Article IV consultation). The current account balance
norm is estimated at a deficit of 5.0 percent of GDP against an underlying current account deficit of
5.5 percent of GDP.
The external sustainability (ES) approach which is anchored on a norm for the current account
balance that would stabilize the net international investment position (IIP) of 90 percent of GDP (and
applying the same underlying current account balance as was in the MB approach), also indicates a
reduction in overvaluation to 3 percent (lower than the 10 percent found in the 2011 Article IV
consultation). This assessment is quite sensitive to the assumption of what would be the stabilizing
IIP (see text table below). The choice of a stabilizing IIP of 90 percent of GDP is consistent with the
2013 assessment and with trends prior to the crisis but still above the standard assessment of
between 60 and 70 percent of GDP.

The equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER)
approach, which looks at the fundamentals affecting
the equilibrium RER, in this case adjusting for the
impact of tourism, also suggests a correction in the
overvaluation from 22 percent in May 2013 to about
15 percent now. It is important to note, however, that
this approach is purely backward looking and does not
incorporate the programmed policy adjustments over
the medium-term.

Annex IV. Assessing Reserve Adequacy
A tighter monetary policy (higher interest rates) and targeted operations have boosted the
pace of accumulation of international reserves. The international reserves position, though
improving (estimated at US$1.8 billion at the end of May 2014), is not back to pre-crisis levels. The
non risk-weighted measures of international reserves adequacy suggest reserves were about equal
to the standard measure of three months of import cover, and a new risk-weighted metric5, that
assesses adequacy by looking at balance of payments pressure, also indicates that reserves
adequacy thresholds were barely met. Though, current reserves levels are not comfortably above the
standard metrics, Jamaica has made significant progress in building reserves and is well positioned
to withstand various external shocks.

A forward looking assessment shows some prospects for the build-up of a reserves margin

rise to levels somewhat above both traditional and new measures of adequacy.

Annex V. Constructing a High-Frequency Economic Growth
Indicator for Jamaica1
An assessment of the current state of the business cycle is of crucial importance to policy
makers. Jamaica publishes quarterly GDP with about a quarter lag. Accordingly, towards the end of
a quarter the latest GDP data-point is about half a year old. This annex presents a simple
econometric model that closely approximates GDP over the last decade. Model estimates are used
for constructing a monthly indicator of economic activity for Jamaica. The indicator provides
information about the pace of economic activity close to real time, typically with a two month lag.
Data constraints complicate the construction of a timely indicator of economic activity. Data
inputs for the indicator need to be available on a monthly basis with a sufficiently long time series,
released on a timely basis, and have a close relation to GDP. In addition, structural breaks in
Jamaica’s macroeconomic environment, for example related to Fund programs, decrease the value
of using very long time series. More than 35 variables have been used in the analysis.
A parsimonious model including credit, import duties, aluminum prices, and U.S.
unemployment describes real GDP growth since 2003 well. The model explains about 76 percent
of the variation in real GDP (adjusted R-squared). The explanatory variables are significant at the
1 percent level and have the expected sign. The model specification is:

where
is real GDP growth,
is real valuation adjusted credit growth,
is
growth in import duties in U.S. dollar terms,
are changes in the world market price of
aluminum, and
is growth in U.S. unemployment. All variables are in year-on-year terms.
The model is estimated through OLS.
The impact of variables in the model is in line with intuition. Credit growth affects GDP through
the financing of consumption and investment. We find that real valuation adjusted credit growth is
indeed positively related to economic growth in Jamaica. Import duties are a good proxy for imports
and duties are available with a shorter time lag than imports themselves.2 In the regression import
duties enter with a negative sign. Higher imports mean a lower contribution of the external sector to
growth (outweighing the impact of imports as a proxy for domestic demand). The price of aluminum
has a positive relation with economic growth over the last decade. This is surprising given that the
mining sector directly contributes little more than 2 percent to GDP. Possible explanations are

reduce the significance of the aluminum price in the regression. Finally, U.S. unemployment is
negatively related to growth in Jamaica. U.S. unemployment reflects the overall health of the U.S.
economy to which Jamaica is connected through various channels including trade, remittances, and
tourism.

is very little variation in visitor arrival growth rates. As a result the variable contributes little to

unemployment, which is significantly negatively related to growth in Jamaica, may capture some of
the contribution of tourism through the amount spent per visitor.
To obtain the monthly economic activity indicator, the coefficients from equation (1) are
applied to monthly y-o-y credit, import duties, aluminum prices, and U.S. unemployment. The
use of y-o-y variables as opposed to higher frequency has the advantage of smoothing out some
variability. It also allows some lagged effects to be captured.

The BoJ’s business conditions survey provides a
good indicator of GDP growth. The BoJ compiles
indices of future and present business conditions.
Survey participants are asked whether
future/present business conditions are expected to
be 'better', 'about the same', 'worse', or 'don’t
know.' The indices alone explain about 60 percent of
the variation in GDP, but do not add additional
explanatory power to the model in equation (1).
Before 2008 the indices were compiled irregularly,
which reduces their usefulness in the model
estimation. In addition, the indices are only available
with a greater time lag than the variables used in
equation (1).

An overall assessment of growth in Jamaica should rely on a range of indicators. Both the
economic growth indicator and the BoJ’s business conditions survey are valuable in this context.
The economic activity indicator can be further refined as longer time series and new data on activity
measures become available.

Appendix I. Letter of Intent
Kingston, Jamaica
June 5, 2014
Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, DC 20431

Dear Ms. Lagarde,
Jamaica has made a strong start in implementing its Fund-supported economic reform programme
aimed at overcoming the long-standing problems of low growth and high debt. All quantitative
fiscal and monetary performance criteria at end-June, September and December 2013 and at endMarch 2014 were met, as were the associated indicative targets, with the exception of the endMarch 2014 indicative target on tax collection, that remained out of reach as a result of the weak
economy. The government has also implemented all of the structural benchmarks that were
included in the programme, albeit with some minor delays. While economic growth remains weak
and unemployment much too high, we are confident that the benefits of our strategy will become
increasingly evident over time, as a more stable macroeconomic environment, a credible return to
debt sustainability and an improved business climate will attract new investments and result in
durable job creation and increased prosperity.
The Government remains fully committed to meeting the objectives of the programme, as well as
the specific targets set out in the April 2013 Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
(MEFP), and its September 2013, December 2013, and March 2014 supplements. In the fiscal area,
the government will press ahead with implementing comprehensive tax reform and the enhanced
fiscal rule, and adopt a range of measures to strengthen public financial management. In the
financial sector, the government is moving forward with reforms to facilitate the transition by
securities dealers towards a more robust business model.
Attachment I to this letter is a new comprehensive MEFP, presenting performance under the
programme, and updating some specific policies to meet the programme’s ultimate objectives,
including the associated quantitative targets and structural benchmarks. Attachment II is the
updated Technical Memorandum of Understanding.
On the basis of our performance under the programme thus far, as well as our sincere commitment
to the continued implementation of the programme, including its proposed revisions, the
government requests that the Executive Board of the IMF complete the fourth review of the
extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility, approve the proposed modifications of
performance criteria as well as new performance criteria for March 2015, and approve the fifth

60

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA

purchase under the arrangement of SDR 45.95 million. In this context, we request that this purchase
be used to help meet the government’s financing needs directly.
The government believes that the policies described in the attached MEFP are adequate to achieve
the programme’s objectives. However, if necessary, the government stands ready to take any
additional measures that may be required. The government will consult with the Fund on the
adoption of these measures and in advance of revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP, in
accordance with the Fund’s policies on such consultation.
The government will also provide the Fund staff with all the relevant information required to
complete programme reviews and monitor performance on a timely basis. The government will
observe the standard performance criteria against imposing or intensifying exchange restrictions,
introducing or modifying multiple currency practices, concluding bilateral payment agreements that
are inconsistent with Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement and imposing or intensifying
import restrictions for balance of payments reasons.
As part of our communication policy, we intend to publish this letter on the websites of the Ministry
of Finance and Planning and the Bank of Jamaica to keep domestic and international agents
informed about our policy actions and intentions. In that regard, we authorize the Fund to publish
this letter and its attachments, as well as the associated staff report.
Very truly yours,

/s/

Attachment I. Memorandum of Economic and Financial
Policies
PROGRAMME OBJECTIVES AND GROWTH STRATEGY
1.
The Jamaican government has embarked on a comprehensive reform programme
aimed at raising economic growth. The programme is underpinned by the understanding that
fiscal and debt sustainability are necessary conditions for macroeconomic stability and economic
growth. A sharp reduction in the debt burden will be conducive to higher private sector-led growth
as the government frees more of the available domestic resources and as economic confidence is
bolstered. In addition, in this environment, government spending can be directed toward the
catalytic development of infrastructure to support growth. The programme also includes key
measures to improve the business climate and is supported by major strategic investments, such as
the North-South highway, which will link the northern and southern sides of the island, new power
plants, and logistics infrastructure. The programme aims at raising GDP growth to more than
2 percent by FY 2016/17.
2.
To help soften any negative impact on the poor, the programme includes important
measures to strengthen the social safety net. The programme has been designed to ensure that
the adjustment burden is effectively shared across society and economic agents. Safeguards have
been included to ensure that the social safety net is not only preserved but broadened, with special
attention to enhancing those social programmes that are well targeted and far-reaching.
3.
Broad agreement on the need to reform the economy is critical for the success of the
programme. The programme continues to benefit from the support of the Partnership for Jamaica
Agreement, and from the active involvement of private stakeholders such as through the Economic
Programme Oversight Committee (EPOC).
4.
While significant progress has been made in the first year of the programme, much
remains to be done. Importantly, debt has now firmly been put on a downward trajectory: debt-toGDP declined from 147 percent of GDP in March 2013 to 140 percent of GDP by March 2014. Key
reforms that were adopted in the first year of the programme include the December 2013 tax
incentive legislation, and the adoption of a fiscal rule in March 2014. Major reforms to be taken
forward in the second year of the programme include public sector transformation, public pension
reform, reform of the securities dealers sector, and streamlining of the process for construction
permits, while also maintaining a prudent fiscal stance.
5.
On May 1, 2013 the Fund’s Executive Board approved a four-year extended
arrangement under the EFF in support of Jamaica’s economic reform programme. The First
Review of the program was completed on September 30, 2013, the Second Review on December 18,
2013, and the Third Review on March 19, 2014. Program reviews will continue to be conducted on a
quarterly basis.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
6.
Economic performance during the first year of the programme has been mixed,
reflecting a challenging economic environment.


Economic Growth. Real GDP is estimated to have increased by 0.9 percent in FY2013/14, with
growth in the January to March quarter estimated at 1.6 percent, supported by growth in
tourism, mining and agriculture.



Inflation. Consumer price inflation decreased to 7.6 percent (year-on-year) in April 2014,
reflecting increased administered prices and the pass-through of nominal depreciation into
domestic prices.



Balance of Payments. The current account deficit is now estimated at 9.5 percent of GDP in
2013/14, down from 11.5 percent in 2012/13, supported by nominal exchange rate depreciation
and fiscal consolidation. Net international reserves (NIR) increased to US$1,309.75 million (at
programme exchange rates) by end-March 2014, in compliance with the programme’s NIR
target. As of end-May, reserves amounted to US$1,166.79 million.



Public Finances. Fiscal performance in FY 2013/14 was broadly satisfactory. Tax revenues were
weaker than budgeted by about 4.8 percent due to lower international trade taxes and PAYE
receipts. However, higher than budgeted grant receipts and non-tax revenues mitigated the
impact of the lower tax collection, reducing the overall revenue shortfall relative to the budget
to 2.5 percent. Total expenditures were about 5 percent below the amount budgeted, with
capital expenditure and savings on the interest bill contributing most of the containment in
spending. The primary balance was slightly over the target while the central government fiscal
balance recorded a surplus of J$1 billion instead of the budgeted deficit of J$8 billion due to
lower interest payments. The overall balance of the public sector exceeded target, on account of
a stronger performance of public bodies as a group, despite uneven performance across the
sub-group of “Selected Public Bodies”.

PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAMME
7.
Overall policy implementation under the programme remains strong and structural
reforms are progressing. All quantitative performance targets and indicative targets for end-March
were met, with the exception of the end-March 2014 indicative target for tax collection (Table 1).
Structural benchmarks due in the first quarter of calendar year 2014 were also met, albeit that the
Banking Services Bill1, tabled in March, required subsequent and still ongoing fine-tuning in
collaboration with Fund staff.. In addition, the elimination of the zero-rating under the GCT for
government purchases will commence in July 2014 rather than in April.

POLICIES FOR 2014/15 AND BEYOND
8.
The government remains fully committed to the reform strategy and the supporting
policies outlined in the April 2013 MEFP and its supplements. This new MEFP builds on these
and provides a comprehensive overview of our reform programme. The quantitative targets that
serve as performance criteria and indicative targets under the programme have been updated and
extended through March 2015. These updated targets are presented in Table 1. The structural
conditionality under the programme, incorporating several modifications discussed below, is
presented in Table 2.
9.
A budget for 2014/15 that is consistent with and supports our economic programme
was tabled, discussed and approved in April 2014 (structural benchmark) and adopted by
parliament in May 2014. It envisages a reduction of the wage bill by 0.6 percentage point of GDP
supported by the wage freeze and through attrition and redeployment of tasks, along with an
increase in programme outlays reflecting a reclassification of items previously in the capital budget,
such as maintenance, along with an allocation to cover the GCT to be levied on government
purchases. Additional tax measures include broadening the base for excise duties on alcohol,
extending the GCT to the import of services, and additional levies on financial sector entities and
services. Furthermore, the threshold of the Personal Income Tax has been raised and customs duties
on certain vehicles were reduced to alleviate the tax burden. The budget also provides for speedier
tax refunds. After adjusting for the reclassification (0.5 percent of GDP), capital expenditure is
projected to remain about constant in percent of GDP. The budget also provides for higher interest
payments than in the last four years to settle accrued interest obligations. The primary balance will
be maintained at its target of 7.5 percent of GDP and the budget deficit is projected to be
0.4 percent of GDP.
Tax Reforms
10.
A blueprint of the key elements of the reform that have been defined thus far was
tabled and approved by a sub-committee of parliament in February 2014.
11.

Major elements of the reformed tax system are now in effect:



The Fiscal Incentives Legislative Instruments adopted by Parliament in December 2013 have
put in place a rule-based regime for limited tax incentives to replace the existing (mostly
sectoral) schemes, as described in the December 2013 MEFP supplement.



The Minimum Business Tax initially announced in FY2012/13 was implemented by way of a
provisional order starting April 2014. Permanent legislation will be passed by September 2014.



Under the new Charities Act, the government has ceased the granting of waivers to charities
other than under the new Act and, effective December 1, 2013, all new applications
(organizations/individuals) must be registered under the new regime, in order to be eligible for
exemptions granted under the Act. A transitional period of six months has been provided under

64

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA

the new Charities Act to existing charities to facilitate registration at the end of which, if not
registered as per the new regime, these entities would no longer qualify to benefit from
requisite exemptions. This transition period ends on June 24, 2014.


An amendment to the Customs Act adopted by parliament in December 2013 simplified the
tariff structure and reduced opportunities for misclassification. To reduce tariff dispersion, high
rates were substantially reduced, generally converging to a standard maximum rate of
20 percent and subject to CARICOM requirements (while the tariff levied on a number of goods
was increased from zero to 5 percent). In addition, while maintaining compliance with the
CARICOM tariff regime, import duties on essential inputs for domestic producers are subject to a
zero rate. The process to minimize abuse is being strengthened, in consultation with the IDB,
through revised and newly established lists of eligible inputs, strong administrative controls and
appropriate penalties. The lists presenting such inputs will be subject to parliamentary review.
The Government also intends to continue reforming the tariff structure and to promote
amendments to the CARICOM regime with the objective of reducing tariff dispersion further.



A first phase in the amalgamation of statutory payroll deductions was completed by
finalizing and gazetting the SO3 form in March 2014. Annual return of the SO4 form is to be
completed by end-December 2014.

12.
Amendments to the GCT Act are to be tabled by June 2014 (structural benchmark). The
main objectives of the reform of the General Consumption Tax (GCT) are to broaden the tax base
and improve its administration. Key elements, that will be effective as of July 1, 2014, are:


Broadening the application of GCT and SCT on motor vehicles, including by curtailing the
availability of a reduced rate of SCT on selected motor vehicle imports by limiting the CIF value
to US$35,000 afforded to pickup trucks used for agricultural activity.



Elimination of the exempt status of electricity for independent private power producers.



Startup companies will be allowed to claim GCT refunds for excess credit immediately.



The zero-rating of government purchases will be eliminated.



The tax base was broadened as of April 1 2014 by allowing for the payment of GCT on vehicles
up to 10 years old, by Provisional Order and the extension of the GCT to imported services other
than electricity, business processing, tourist accommodations and imports by the
bauxite/alumina subsector. This reform will be made permanent via the amendments to the GCT
Act.

13.
Important follow-up actions will still be needed as part of the tax reform. In the context
of the new tax incentives legislation, an expeditious transition by entities with grandfathered
incentives to the new regime will be important for achieving the expected decline in tax
expenditures. In this context, the Government will conduct an entity by entity review of all entities
with grandfathered incentives and of their regime by end-FY2014/15 (structural benchmark for

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

65

JAMAICA

January 2015), to serve as a basis for discussion to facilitate transition to the new regime by mutual
agreement between authorities and entities. Technical assistance for this review has been requested
from the IDB. A study on the scope for imposing GCT on petroleum products versus the existing
SCT, within the context of no net increase in petroleum taxation has now been completed; its
conclusions will inform decisions regarding any adjustment to the existing petroleum tax structure in
FY2015/16. Looking ahead, we will assess the need for a further reduction in tax expenditures in the
context of the 2015/16 budget on the basis of revenue needs and an assessment of the degree to
which the recent reforms will result in a progressive decline in tax expenditures over time, as
grandfathered incentives come to an end. Over the medium term, a convergence of personal and
corporate income tax rates to a uniform standard headline rate is also envisaged, subject to
available fiscal space and the attainment of revenue targets.
14.
Property tax reform is envisaged to be ready for implementation by the start of
FY2015/16. This will include amendments to the Property Tax Act and the Land Valuation Act to
provide for, among other things, the publication of names, valuation numbers, addresses and
amounts outstanding of delinquent property owners in the public media, subject to court
proceedings, as well as provisions to allow utilization of a wide array of media for the posting of
Assessment Notices. Amendments to the Land Valuation Act will also provide for the interim
adjustment of land values in periods of no more than two years, to take account of changes in
economic conditions and/or change in the use of properties.
15.
Reforms to strengthen tax and customs administration are proceeding. Steps to
improve tax and customs administration will be guided by the revenue administration action plan
prepared in collaboration with the IMF and IDB. In particular, we have recently:


Initiated discussions with banks to seek reduction in excessive charges for processing tax and
customs revenue receipts. More generally, an improved payment regime is expected to be
implemented before end-2014.



Continued to improve JCA and TAJ accounting and financial systems, through the introduction
of ACCPAC (Accrual Accounting System) in March 2014 for the JCA. Introduction of this system
is expected for June 2014 for the TAJ, in compliance with the Executive Agency Regulatory
Framework.



Started to use RTGS as an alternative channel for payment of duties and taxes on commercial
imports. Phase I was implemented January 2013, for travel tax and passenger levy payments.
Phase II, to include duties and other taxes, commenced in March 2014. The system is now
operational for two banks, and others are expected to be added.



Established concrete steps to increase electronic filing, based on the amendment to the RAA. In
particular, in March 2014, e-filing became mandatory for LTO clients with respect to the GCT and
CIT (structural benchmark) and with respect to payroll taxes for employers with more than
20 employees.

66

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA

16.

Next steps to strengthen tax and customs administration include:



Setting up a modernization programme office in the TAJ before end-September 2014.



Improving large taxpayer administration through: (i) increasing the number of staff by a further
50 auditors (from March 2014 to March 2015); (ii) increasing the number of (full plus issue)
audits completed in the large taxpayers office (LTO) by 100 percent (from FY 2013/14 to
FY 2014/15); (iii) achieving 95 percent take up rate of e-filing and e-payment in the LTO (March
2015) (new structural benchmark, March 2015). We also aim to write off debts that have been
subjected to risk-rated stress tests and consequently categorised as uncollectible in accordance
with the Regulations by end-March 2015.



Enacting additional legislative reforms in tax and customs. Specifically:





(i) revise and enact the Revenue Administration Act and the Tax Collection Act to strengthen
the powers of Tax Administration Jamaica (TAJ) and Jamaica Customs Agency (JCA) to collect
outstanding arrears (including powers to seize and sell taxpayers’ property, harmonized
penalties and fines where appropriate and mandatory income tax filing for every business),
in line with IMF (FAD) TA (July 2014).



(ii) enact amendments to the Customs Act to facilitate implementation of ASYCUDA World
and trade facilitation (September 2014).

Automating tax and customs operations by implementing:


(i) ASYCUDA World for the Kingston Port as a pilot site (new structural benchmark for
December 2014),



(ii) Phase 1 (Registration, GCT, SCT, GART, Telephone) of the GENTAX integrated tax software
package (new structural benchmark for February 2015),



(iii) ASYCUDA-World integrated customs software package for the entire country (March
2016), and



(iv) GENTAX integrated tax software package for all taxes (April 2016).



Preparing an estimate of the revenue compliance gap for the GCT by February 2015, to provide
a basis for measuring the impact of administrative reforms.



Establishing the Revenue Appeals Department as a separate, independent entity, with IFC
support (October 2014).

A Fiscal Rule
17.
A new fiscal rule to enhance fiscal transparency and lock in the gains of fiscal
consolidation was adopted by Parliament in March 2014. The relevant existing legislation (in the
Financial Administration and Audit (FAA) Act and the Public Bodies Management and Accountability
(PBMA) Act was amended to implement the rule. The new fiscal policy framework limits the annual
budgeted overall fiscal balance of the public sector excluding the BoJ and commercially-oriented
public bodies, to achieve a reduction in public debt to no more than 60 percent of GDP by the end
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

67

JAMAICA

of FY 2025/26. The March 2014 MEFP supplement described the new rule in detail, including its
coverage, automatic correction mechanism, escape clause, and compliance regime. The
amendments also put into place a binding permanent budget calendar envisaging budget approval
prior to the fiscal year, starting with the budget for FY2015/16.
18.

Next steps to ensure effective implementation of the fiscal rule include:



The government will continue its broad public information campaign on the objectives and
features of a new fiscal rule.



As experience is gained under the rules-based framework, consultations with public stakeholders
will continue on possible steps for further strengthening the legal foundations of the fiscal rule.



The classification rules for determining which entities could be deemed commercial and, on that
basis, could be excluded from the coverage of the fiscal rule, will be developed in consultation
with Fund staff by July 2014.



The government will develop mechanisms to closely monitor possible fiscal costs and
contingencies associated with possible PPPs. In particular, the Ministry of Finance and Planning
will develop the capacity to: (i) analyze PPP contracts, which includes the proper identification of
direct fiscal impacts and valuation of contingent obligations to ensure consistency with the fiscal
rule; (ii) disclose fiscal risks (both explicit and implicit); and (iii) conduct value-for-money
analyses.



Furthermore, the total loan value of all new user-funded PPPs will be capped at 3 percent of
GDP on a cumulative basis over the program period (new continuous structural benchmark). In
case the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) has established that a PPP involves only minimal
fiscal contingent liabilities (including the absence of debt guarantees, demand or price
guarantees or termination clauses that could imply a transfer of liabilities to the government)
the project could be exempted from the PPP ceiling.



The capacity of the (OAG) will be augmented to allow it to provide an independent assessment
of the macroeconomic and budget forecasts underpinning the budget, as well as the quality of
adjustment measures and the proper treatment of PPPs. Additional resources will be provided to
the OAG so that it can recruit additional experts in public finance and macroeconomics.
Relatedly, the OAG’s statutory autonomy, including financial autonomy, will be strengthened.



The government will also consider legal options for strengthening the sanctions regime to
enhance the credibility of the fiscal rules. Possible avenues include clarifying the legal possibility
of the non-renewal or dismissal of public officials for non-compliance; strengthening the
oversight role of Parliament in reviewing Ministerial actions on recommendations by the
Attorney General and the Auditor General; reviewing the low cap on money penalties; and
aligning the sanctions process for government departments and public bodies for a more
equitable (and streamlined) process (by July 2015).



The government will develop an improved annual risk statement. The government will ensure
that, starting with the 2015/16 budget, a comprehensive and clear fiscal risk statement is

68

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA

presented, covering all significant contingent liabilities including those related to commercial
public sector entities and PPPs. Technical assistance has been requested from the IDB/IMF to
support this effort.

Reforms to Public Financial Management and the Budget Process
19.
The government is implementing its updated action plan for public financial
management reform, in collaboration with its development partners. In this context:


The central treasury management system (CTMS), which has been established ahead of schedule
(end-March 2014 structural benchmark), will be strengthened by including modules for the
tracking of expenditures that will be effective by June 2014.



The Accountant General’s Department (AGD) is the Treasurer of the single treasury account and
the process for transitioning of the AGD into a modern treasury department by March 2016
commenced in April 2013 with a consultancy to develop a strategy to guide the transition.



The adjusted Chart of Accounts was first prepared in April 2014 and is undergoing further
revisions with a view of its implementation by November 2014.



The GOJ will strengthen the efficiency and quality of the GOJ procurement process, thereby
improving the ease of doing business and reducing costs. The GOJ began publishing a Public
Procurement Page in the print media starting in December 2013. Next steps include:


A contract for implementing the Electronic Tendering System was awarded in May
2014 and will be implemented in five pilot entities during the financial year 2014/15.



The Procurement Act will be tabled by July 2014, with a view to its passing and
effectiveness by September 2014.



A new procurement manual will be prepared by December 2014, with IDB assistance.

20.
In addition, the government has prioritized reforms that are needed to underpin the
fiscal rule:


In line with the improved Public Investment Management System (PIMS), designed with World
Bank support, a comprehensive Public Sector Investment Programme (PSIP) was tabled in
parliament in April 2014 (structural benchmark), as a rolling five-year plan, comprised of Cabinetapproved, prioritized investment projects, to be reviewed on a regular basis. The improved PIMS
will be supported by a high-level Public Investment Management Committee that will be in
place by August 2014 and the creation of a web-based public investment management
information system, Phase 1 of which will become operational in July 2014. A PSIP policy paper
will be before Cabinet by the end of September 2014.



Key elements of a government work plan to strengthen budget preparation include: (i) a budget
call for early and accurate budget envelopes and priorities that will be issued by September
2014, and (ii) strengthening the policy to limit the use of virements (authorizing the transfer of
funds within the budget) and of ex-post regularization of unbudgeted spending through

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

69

JAMAICA

supplementary budgets, to be completed and approved by July 2014. A further priority will be to
strengthen the development of realistic budget apportionment plans.


The government has also prepared a workplan to strengthen procedures for budget execution
and cash management. In order to improve the Commitment Planning and Control system in
central government, an automated Purchase Order Module was added to the FinMan PFM
system. In addition the Commitment Planning and Control Module were activated. The
Upgraded Commitment Control System and the Purchase Order Module has now been
developed and tested and was piloted in the Ministry of Finance and Planning in January 2014.
Effective April 1, 2104, the new system was implemented in all MDAs.



An IFMIS will be introduced during 2016/17, and replace the FinMan PFM system.



Improving the revenue forecasting to avoid continuous deficit bias will be a policy priority. For
this purpose, we have requested technical assistance, with funding from CIDA.



Improving cash management is a priority and technical assistance will support reforms in these
areas through: a) improving cash flow forecasting techniques to develop reliable forecasts of
cash flows and more timely monitoring through the Treasury Single Account (TSA) system; and
b) enhancing the TSA in terms of coverage and procedures.

Debt Reduction
21.
The government is committed to sharply reducing public debt, which is projected to
decline to 96 percent of GDP by March 2020. This is expected to be achieved by sustained fiscal
efforts, policies to bolster growth, as well as additional measures such as debt–asset swaps and asset
sales. For the purpose of the IMF-supported reform programme, reporting on public debt includes
government guaranteed debt and PetroCaribe debt (net of its financing to the central government
and its holdings of guaranteed debt).
22.
The scheduled reduction, in public debt through debt-asset swaps and asset sales and
a reduction in guarantees, has progressed in line with the programme. The government has
established the legal and administrative processes involved, as well as a workplan for their
expeditious completion, to reduce guaranteed debt and other public debt by at least 1.0 percent of
GDP by early 2015. In designing these transactions, the government will seek to ensure sound public
sector governance. Furthermore, the government remains committed to ensuring that any new debt
guarantees will be consistent with the applicable limits under the Public Debt Management Act.
23.
The government will further strengthen its debt management strategy. The efficiency
of the Debt Management Branch will be further strengthened through increased staffing of the
middle office, skills training and effecting improvements to securities operations.

Public Sector Reform
24.
The government is committed to improving the efficiency, quality and cost
effectiveness of the public sector. A reduction in bureaucracy through public sector

70

JAMAICA

transformation is expected to increase the efficiency of government operations, boost the pace of
commerce and provide upside potential to growth prospects. We will develop an action plan for
public sector transformation by end-September 2014 (new structural benchmark), in close
cooperation with our development partners, to cover the following areas: (1) the introduction of
shared corporate services, (2) the reallocation, merger, abolition and divestment/privatization of
departments and agencies, (3) outsourcing of services, (4) strengthening control systems and
accountability (including in auditing and procurement); and (5) aligning remuneration with job
requirements. The Fiscal Responsibility Framework and this programme have set a target for
reducing the size of the wage bill to 9.0 percent of GDP for FY2015/16.


Wages and salaries. In March 2013, the government signed a wage restraint agreement for
the 2012/13-2014/15 period with the major unions, representing 85 percent of public
servants. In particular, the agreement entailed foregoing wage increases over the three year
period of 2012/13 through 2014/15 except where increases arise from promotions,
increments and reclassification exercises agreed prior to the current agreement. This helped
to reduce the wage bill from 11.0 percent of GDP in 2012/13 to 10.6 percent of GDP in
2013/14. During the programme period, there will be no new reclassification exercises that
may result in additional wage or salary costs or impact an entire occupational grouping. The
government may however, within the context of the public sector transformation or other
streamlining operations, undertake reorganisations as necessary, in consultation with Fund
staff, to support efficient and effective performance of core activities. Any such
reorganisation will be limited in scope and undertaken within the framework of achieving
the 2015/16 legislated wage/GDP target of 9.0 percent.



Civil Service Positions. The GOJ will reduce the size of the public sector over 2013–15
through the elimination of some posts and an attrition programme. Following the
permanent removal of 3,000 posts from the Civil Service in September 2012 and the
elimination of an additional 3,000 posts in the wider public sector in early 2013, an
additional 1,000 positions that became vacant due to natural attrition by end-2013 have not
been filled. There will be no net hiring of workers by the government in any year during the
programme period. More generally, in order to ensure that the GOJ’s overall wage ceiling of
9.0 percent of GDP by 2015/16 is met, the filling of vacant positions will be constrained as
needed.



The review of public sector employment and remuneration to guide the modernization
of the modalities and terms of employment has now been completed (March 2014 structural
benchmark). As fiscal space allows, and while adhering to the 9 percent of GDP wage bill
ceiling, it proposed strategies to retain high quality staff in the public sector through
competitive compensation and enhancing responsibility, accountability and the working
environment.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

71

JAMAICA



To support the management of public sector employment, we are improving the public
service databases in e-Census and will ensure that it is up to date by September 10, 2014
and covers all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) (new structural benchmark).



The procurement of the human resources software system (the HCMES system; including
Payroll) is progressing and the vendor is expected to be contracted by early November 2014.
To ensure a timely start to implementation of the system for the wider public sector, with
IDB support, a dedicated project management team will be in place by September 2014 and
a project plan will be prepared by December 2014. The start of the implementation of the
HCMES/Payroll system for the first entity, eGov Jamaica Ltd, is expected to commence in
January 2015. Implementation for the remaining five entities (including TAJ and JCA) in
Phase one of the project is expected to commence in February 2015.

25.
A White Paper on public pension reform was tabled in parliament in December 2013.
The reform has been developed with World Bank support and is aimed at ensuring that the system
is sustainable in the long run, with more efficient management of public pensions and improved
monitoring arrangements. The policy enunciated in the White Paper will require legislative changes
in order for it to become effective. As a consequence the legislative process has been initiated. This
will be accompanied by an education programme to sensitize the public sector workers of the
proposed changes. There will be a parametric reform with the retention of a Defined Benefits (DB)
system with the following changes:


All workers will contribute 5 percent of their salary towards their pension;



The accrual rate at which employee’s benefits will accumulate in the DB scheme is proposed as
follows: (1) all past service will be preserved at a 2.2 percent accrual rate; (2) existing workers
55 years and older will continue to see their pension benefit build up at a rate of 2.2 percent;
(3) workers 54 and younger will receive an accrual rate of 2.0 percent; and (4) new employees as
of the date of implementation of the reform will have their pension calculated at an accrual rate
of 1.8 percent;



Pension benefits will be computed using an average of the final five years of salary;



The normal retirement age will be increased from 60 to 65 years, by one year each year starting
in April 2016.

Software is being developed to move from the current paper-based system to electronic submission
of data on the career history of an employee and the provisions of the revised pension system will
be incorporated into a single piece of legislation. The new public sector pension system is expected
to be implemented by April 2016 (the start of FY2016/17). The requisite changes in legislation are
expected to be tabled by June 2015 (new structural benchmark).
26.
In the area of public bodies, further improvement is to be achieved. The sector’s overall
balance is projected to be in balance for the remaining programme years. To enhance transparency,
the annual reports (including audited statements) for public bodies will be completed within six
months of the end of the fiscal year; this is to be achieved by end-2014 for self-financing public
72

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA

bodies and by September 2015 for all other public bodies. Monitoring of public bodies will be
strengthened by (1) enforcing a time limit for submission of public bodies’ financial statements to
the Auditor General; and (2) bolstering capacity within the Auditor General’s office for more indepth and frequent reviews of these statements.

FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORMS
27.
We are taking steps to complete work to mitigate the risks inherent in Jamaica’s
highly interconnected financial system. To allow for more effective supervision of the financial
sector, the government has tabled a Banking Services Bill that harmonizes the prudential standards
across deposit takers, facilitates consolidated supervision of financial conglomerates, strengthens
the corrective, sanctioning and resolution regime and ensures that the Bank of Jamaica has
operational independence for supervision (structural benchmark, March 2014). Passage of the law is
envisaged by end-June 2014. Going forward, we will seek Fund technical assistance to develop plans
for a comprehensive crisis management and resolution framework for banks and other financial
firms, and we will make any necessary amendments to the legislation accordingly by end-December
2014. In addition, the government will amend the Financial Services Commission Act in order to
strengthen the Financial Services Commission’s enforcement powers, and the BOJ Act in order to
vest the BOJ with overall responsibility for financial stability.
28.
In December 2013, steps were taken to make less risky business models available to
securities dealers. In this context, a timetable was published for raising the cap for CIS on
investments in foreign assets from 5 percent of assets to at least 25 percent by end-2015, with a first
step to be effective as of July 1, 2014. This cap will be removed altogether by end-2016 unless
extraordinary circumstances require a reassessment. Furthermore, during the first half of 2014, the
Bank of Jamaica intends to enter into consultations with representatives of regulated entities in the
insurance and pensions sectors and the FSC with the aim of establishing the scope and extent to
which current limits on permissible investments in foreign assets can be lifted over time. The
remaining tax obstacles to CIS, in particular those arising from the stamp duty and the transaction
tax, will be removed by end-June 2014.
29.
We are implementing measures to protect the interest of retail repo clients. In
consultation with Fund staff, we will establish a distinct treatment for retail repo client interests in
the legal and regulatory framework in order to protect their interests prior to and in the event of the
insolvency of a securities dealer. This will entail establishing a Trust to hold the underlying securities
on their behalf during the term of the repo. The legal and regulatory framework will comprise (1) the
standardized legal documentation for the retail repo transactions, including a master retail
repurchase agreement and trust deed; (2) reporting and other regulatory requirements for the
securities dealers who are parties to retail repurchase agreements; (3) reporting and other regulatory
requirements for the Jamaica Stock Exchange entities that will serve as custodian and trustee with
respect to the trust arrangement; and (4) definitive legal treatment for the retail repo client interests
in the event of a dealer's insolvency. The Trust arrangement is intended to ensure that funds and
securities flow in accordance with the terms of the retail repo agreement, and the Trust will be
responsible for the custody of the securities underlying retail repo transactions. It will also facilitate
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

73

JAMAICA

the taking of appropriate actions in the event of a transaction failure or default. A key function of
the Trust arrangement will be to ensure that the interests of each retail repo client in the underlying
securities are clearly and uniquely identified for the increased protection of the clients, and also to
ensure that such securities would be held apart from the dealer’s estate in the event of its
insolvency. We submitted the legal and regulatory framework to the industry for consultation at
end-March 2014 (structural benchmark). The legal and regulatory framework will be in place by endDecember 2014 (revised structural benchmark).
30.
We are also strengthening the securities dealer sector more broadly. We will take steps
to ensure the financial and operational readiness of the securities dealers to move to a trust-based
operational framework, supported by focused stress testing by the FSC and BOJ that will conclude at
end-August 2014. By end-September, we will set up backstop facilities for exceptional financial
support for the securities dealers. We will also continue to work on contingency planning to
maintain broader financial stability. The transition of retail repos to the new operational framework
will be implemented taking into account evolving market conditions and ensuring financial stability.
31.
Over the medium term, a gradual tightening of prudential standards in line with best
international practice will facilitate fundamental reform of the securities dealers sector. As the
first step, the FSC will establish by end-September a minimum transaction size for retail repos.
Additional measures could include (i) a gradual tightening of capital adequacy ratios; (ii) a tapering
of the intermediation ratio, and (iii) operational and/or regulatory measures that will help to
discourage investors from closing down their retail repo positions prior to the contractual maturity.
The FSC will also continue to enhance its monitoring and reporting methods for the securities
dealers.

MONETARY AND EXCHANGE RATE POLICY
32.
Monetary policy remains aimed at achieving single digit inflation within a flexible
exchange rate regime. For FY2014/15, the BOJ’s forecast for inflation is in the range of 7 percent to
9 percent. Over the medium term, we envisage inflation to come down to a range of 6 percent to
8 percent, while over the longer term, the objective is to achieve a gradual reduction of inflation to a
rate that is consistent with that of our main trading partners.
33.
The BOJ will continue to respond to liquidity pressures in the financial system.
Following the National Debt Exchange (NDX), the implementation of CTMS and the BOJ’s open
market policies, the financial system faced tighter liquidity. To counter these developments, starting
mid-September 2013, the BOJ has been conducting repo operations to inject liquidity into the
financial system. Further, in December 2013, the Bank established a Standing Liquidity Facility (SLF)
under which deposit taking institutions have automatic access to overnight liquidity from the BOJ.
Access to the SLF is by overnight repurchase agreement. In addition, in February 2014, the BOJ
introduced Six-Month Repurchase Operations (SMRO) to further alleviate liquidity constraints. Over
the course of FY 2014/15, the BOJ will continue to refine its monetary policy operations, including
modification to the SLF, in order to provide liquidity with more certainty and at a price consistent
with its policy goals.

74

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA

34.
The BOJ is committed to initiating preparations to allow a move towards full-fledged
inflation targeting (FFIT) over the medium term. The adoption of FFIT requires strengthened
fiscal and external positions and greater financial market development. Consistent with the
objectives of the Fund-supported programme, Jamaica is expected to substantially improve its fiscal
and external position and reduce its debt from a very high level. In this regard, the BOJ has
developed a timetable for establishing the basic requirements for implementing FFIT. This agenda
was finalized in January 2014 and key actions include: (i) initiating a communication and education
strategy; (ii) strengthening the monetary policy implementation framework; (iii) designing and
implementing a strategy for market deepening, particularly the foreign exchange market; and
(iv) commencing annual assessments of the necessary pre-conditions for FFIT (such as fiscal and
external stability) by March 2015, and (v) improving the governance structure of the BOJ. In this
context, amendments to the Bank of Jamaica Act to strengthen the governance and the autonomy
of the Bank are currently being considered and a Cabinet decision on the way forward is envisaged
by June 2014. This will strengthen the institutional framework for monetary policy.

Growth Enhancing Reforms
35.
Actions for improving the business climate are critical and additional steps have been
prioritized in light of the imperative of promoting growth :


The Government has examined the existing process for construction permit approval with a view
to reducing the time for issuing construction permits to 90 days. Since the start of the year,
considerable success was achieved to clear outstanding requests for permits and to reduce the
approval time to within 90 days. The implementation of the AMANDA system will improve the
monitoring and approval of construction permits when fully functional.



The Application Management and Data Automation system (AMANDA) will allow the government
to track approval of construction permits across all parish councils in Jamaica and is expected to
be implemented with support from the World Bank. Implementation of the system has started in
nine parishes, as well as in four agencies (National Works Agency, Mines and Geology Division,
Agricultural Land Management Division, and the Environmental Health Unit Kingston), and the
system is expected to be implemented in all parish councils by December 2014 (structural
benchmark) after which the Government will focus on implementing the system in the
commenting agencies to make it fully operational. A Concept Paper has been developed to
revise and standardize the fee structure for application fees.



With IDB support, land titling is being expanded under the Land Administration and
Management Programme (LAMP). Under this programme, around 3,000 new titles were issued
between 2011 and 2013. LAMP is expected to issue another 1,000 new titles during 2014/2015.
LAMP will be extending its services to clients in St. Ann, Westmoreland, St. James, Trelawny and
Hanover.



Legislation to create a Secured Interest in Personal Property (SIPP) was passed in parliament in
December, 2013. This paved the way for meeting the end-December benchmark on establishing

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

75

JAMAICA

a central collateral registry. Training of financial sector stakeholders has begun and a public
relations and education campaign will support its use.


Actions toward parliamentary passage of an Insolvency Act are proceeding as planned, with the
legislation tabled in parliament in December 2013. The Act is expected to be passed before endJuly 2014 and enabling regulations are being prepared by end-July 2014. Training and PR will be
supported by the World Bank.



A multi-purpose registration instrument to streamline the business registration process has been
introduced. Furthermore, an on-line system for business registration will be in place by endFebruary 2015, with IDB support.



Urgent actions will be taken to reduce the time needed for entrepreneurs to get an electricity
connection. These actions will shorten both the time needed for an inspection by the
Government Electricity Inspectorate (GEI) and the time for installation by the power company.
The government conducted a business process review and will commence implementation of its
recommendations. These include the automation of the work processes within the GEI and the
acquisition of ICT to streamline procedures for scheduling, inspecting, approving and certifying
electrical installations. The contract signature for the acquisition of the application is expected
by end-March 2015, with IDB support. In the very near-term, action will be undertaken to
increase the availability of inspectors and improve scheduling in order to generate initial
improvements.



Plans to establish a Port Community System (PCS) to electronically integrate and streamline
export and import procedures are underway. Bids were received from pre-qualified bidders and
have been evaluated. The evaluation process was completed in April 2014 and both bidders
were found to be technically and financially responsive. However, the associated transaction fees
were prohibitive and would make Jamaica globally uncompetitive; hence approval has been
received from the National Contracts Commission for a limited retender utilizing a refined RFP
with the two (2) pre-qualified bidders to facilitate more effective alignment of the system
capabilities and the competitive needs of the country at this point in time. With the Jamaica
Customs acquisition of ASYCUDA World Customs Management System, an independent
assessment of both the PCS and ASYCUDA World systems is currently being undertaken and will
inform the next critical steps.



A Special Economic Zone Act is expected to be passed by June 2015 that will ensure
compatibility with WTO requirements and based on a Green Paper forthcoming by September
2014, and a White Paper by end-2014.

36.
Strategic investments to establish Jamaica as a logistics hub are well underway. The
expansion of the Panama Canal which is now expected to be completed in 2016 provides a
reordering of maritime traffic in East West trade between the Far East, Europe and the
Americas. Jamaica is desirous of taking advantage of this opportunity and is seeking to establish
Jamaica as a Logistics Hub. A number of projects to support this initiative are well underway. Work is
proceeding on the privatization of both Norman Manley International Airport (NMIA) and the
Kingston Container Terminal. The Transaction Structure to guide the privatization process has been

76

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA

developed for NMIA and has been approved by Cabinet. A rate review, which must be completed
before bids are made, is expected to be completed by August 2014. In the case of the Kingston
Container Terminal, the Request for Proposal (RfP) has been issued to the pre-qualified bidders and
is expected to be returned in July 2014, with a provisional preferred bidder expected to be selected
in September 2014. Regarding the development of a transhipment port and industrial and
commercial zones in the Portland Bight area by China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC), a
Non-Binding Framework Agreement has been signed. CHEC has obtained approval from the
National Environment and Planning Agency (NEPA) to commence the technical feasibility study. This
is a prerequisite for determining the construction methodology and for obtaining the terms of
reference from NEPA. The project will be executed in phases with the first phase projected to be
completed in the last quarter of 2016.
37.
Reducing the cost of electricity is critical to improve competitiveness. Several projects
and initiatives to achieve fuel-source diversification, facilitate energy conservation, liberalize the
electricity market and reduce the cost of energy are moving ahead. Electricity costs are targeted to
be reduced by at least one-third by 2017. Construction of a new 381 Megawatt Plant is slated to
start this fiscal year; completion of this facility in 2016 is expected to reduce the cost of electricity
and thereby address a major obstacle to growth. In addition, with World Bank support, we have
prepared updates to the Electricity Act that clarify and codify the roles and responsibilities of the
main actors in the sector, including the government, the regulator, the utilities and the independent
power producers. These are expected to be submitted to parliament by end-September 2014
(structural benchmark), and become effective by end-2014.
38.
An increase in financing to and support for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises
(MSMEs) will also support growth. The roll-out of the mobile money initiative, aimed at providing
greater access to financial services to underserved entities including MSMEs is expected to be
completed by December 2014. In addition, two credit bureaus have commenced operations. The
Development Bank of Jamaica is rapidly expanding its credit to MSMEs and the Jamaica Business
Development Corporation is increasing its business development support in various ways, including
training and incubator services.
39.
The new Agro Parks are contributing to an increase in agricultural production. Seven of
these are now in operation, with the remaining two expected to start production during FY2014/15.
Establishing better links between the agricultural sector and the tourism industry is an important
priority and is actively supported by the Agriculture-Tourism technical working group, which is in
the process of establishing concrete targets for linkages.
40.
Labour market reforms are progressing. Based on a White Paper that was tabled in
September 2013, legislation supporting flexible work arrangements has now been tabled in
parliament in March 2014. Based on drafting instructions issued to the Chief Parliamentary Council
(CPC), the necessary amendments to legislation will be enacted by September 2014 to remove
impediments to the implementation of flexible work arrangements. A public education campaign is
planned to promote the use of these arrangements. In the context of the recently launched
Comprehensive Labour Market Reform Agenda, a Labour Market Reform Commission will review
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

77

JAMAICA

existing policies and practices in the areas of education and training; productivity, technology and
innovation; labour policies and legislation; social protection; and industrial relations. Options to
reduce the impact of high separation costs will be considered, and be informed by a recently
completed consultant report on payment options for unemployment insurance for Jamaica.

Reform of Social Spending
41.
The programme includes a floor on social spending (indicative target) that signifies
the priority attached to it, and that will help safeguard this spending category. For this
purpose, the floor on social spending is defined as a minimum annual expenditure on specified
social protection initiatives and programmes.2 These programmes are funded by GOJ resources only
and comprise: conditional cash transfers to children 0–18 years and the elderly; youth employment
programme;3 the poor relief programme for both indoor and outdoor poor; the school feeding
programme and the basic school subsidy; basic education including early childhood, primary and
secondary education; provision of assistance for persons with disabilities; and targeted components
of primary health care. The floor will be quantified at a level that is the equivalent of the FY 2012/13
budget allocations, in real terms.
42.
Efforts to strengthen the social protection framework are progressing. In May 2014
Cabinet adopted a graduation strategy for PATH households. This strategy also covers the
strengthening of agency networks and broad institutional strengthening to support the Steps-toWork programme which is an integral part of the graduation strategy. The field work for the
recertification exercise was conducted on 34,000 PATH households, and the analysis was completed
in March 2014. Within the context of Effective Social Protection articulated in Vision 2030 Jamaica–
National Development Plan, progress continued towards the development of a comprehensive
Social Protection Strategy. The draft of this strategy was completed and approved by Cabinet in
March 2014.

The social spending floor covers only a subset of the GOJ’s social protection framework.

Youth Employment programmes defined to include: On the job training; Summer Employment; and Employment
Internship programmes under the Citizens Security & Justice Programme (CSJP). Programme

Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) sets out the understandings between
the Jamaican authorities and the IMF regarding the definitions of quantitative performance
criteria and indicative targets for the programme supported by the extended arrangement
under the EFF. It also describes the methods to be used in assessing the programme performance
and the information requirements to ensure adequate monitoring of the targets. In addition, the
TMU specifies the requirements under the continuous structural benchmark concerning
discretionary tax waivers.
For programme purposes, all foreign currency-related assets, liabilities and flows will be
evaluated at “programme exchange rates” as defined below, with the exception of items
affecting government fiscal balances, which will be measured at current exchange rates. The
updated programme exchange rates are those that prevailed on December 31, 2013. Accordingly,
the exchange rates for the purposes of the programme are show in Table 1.

QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA: DEFINITION OF VARIABLES
Definitions: The central government for the purposes of the programme consists of the set of
institutions currently covered under the state budget. The central government includes public
bodies that are financed through the Consolidated Fund.
The fiscal year starts on April 1 in each calendar year and ends on March 31 of the following
year.

A.

Cumulative Floor of the Central Government Primary Balance

5.
Definitions: The primary balance of the central government is defined as total revenues
minus primary expenditure and covers non-interest government activities as specified in the budget.
6.
Revenues are recorded when the funds are transferred to a government revenue
account. Revenues will also include grants. Capital revenues will not include any revenues from
asset sales proceeding from divestment operations. Central government primary expenditure is
recorded on a cash basis and includes compensation payments, other recurrent expenditures and
capital spending. Primary expenditure also includes transfers to other public bodies which are not
self-financed. Costs associated with divestment operations or liquidation of public entities, such as

82

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA

cancellation of existing contracts or severance payments to workers will be allocated to current and
capital expenditures, accordingly.
7.
All primary expenditures directly settled with bonds or any other form of non-cash
liability will be recorded as spending above-the-line, financed with debt issuance and will
therefore affect the primary balance.
8.
Reporting: Data will be provided to the Fund with a lag of no more than four weeks after
the test date.

B.

Cumulative Floor on Overall Balance of the Public Sector

9.
Definitions: The public sector consists of the central government and public bodies. Public
bodies are institutional units that are themselves government units or are controlled, directly or
indirectly, by one or more government units. Whether an institution belongs to the public or private
sector is determined according to who controls the unit, as specified in the government Financial
Statistics (GFS) Manual 2001––Coverage and Sectorization of the Public Sector. For the purposes of
the programme, the assessment of whether an entity belongs to the public or the private sector will
be based on the guidance provided by the GFS criteria.
10.
Public bodies consist of all self-financed public bodies, including the 17 “Selected
Public Bodies” and “Other Public Bodies”. The 18 “Selected Public Bodies” include: Airport
Authority of Jamaica (AAJ); Human Employment and Resource Training Trust (HEART); Jamaica
Mortgage Bank (JMB); Housing Agency of Jamaica (HAJ); National Housing Trust (NHT); National
Insurance Fund (NIF); Development Bank of Jamaica (DBJ); National Water Commission (NWC);
Petrojam; Petroleum Corporation of Jamaica (PCJ); Ports Authority of Jamaica (PAJ); Urban
Development Corporation (UDC); Jamaica Urban Transit Company Ltd. (JUTC); Caymanas Track Ltd.
(CTL); National Road Operating and Constructing Company Ltd. (NROCC); Petro-Ethanol; Clarendon
Aluminum Production (CAP);. “Other Public Bodies” include: Road Maintenance Fund; Jamaica
Bauxite Mining Ltd.; Jamaica Bauxite Institute; Petroleum Company of Jamaica Ltd. (Petcom); Wigton
Windfarm Ltd.; Broadcasting Commission of Jamaica; The Office of Utilities Regulation; The Office of
the Registrar of Companies, Runaway Bay Water Company, Jamaica National Agency for
Accreditation, Spectrum Management Authority; Sports Development Foundation; Bureau of
Standards Jamaica; Factories Corporation of Jamaica Ltd.; Kingston Freezone Company Ltd.; Micro
Investment Development Agency Ltd.; Montego Bay Freezone Company Ltd.; Postal Corporation of
Jamaica Ltd.; Self Start Fund; Betting Gaming and Lotteries Commission; Culture, Health, Arts, Sports
and Education Fund; Financial Services Commission; Jamaica Deposit Insurance Corporation, Jamaica
Racing Commission, National Export-Import Bank of Jamaica Ltd.; PetroCaribe Development Fund;
Tourism Enhancement Fund, The Public Accountancy Board; Students’ Loan Bureau; National Health
Fund; Cocoa Industry Board; Coffee Industry Board; Sugar Industry Authority; Overseas Examination
Commission; Aeronautical Telecommunications Ltd.; Jamaica Civil Aviation Authority; Jamaica
Ultimate Tire Company Ltd.; Jamaica Railway Corporation Ltd.; The Firearm Licensing Authority; Ports
Management Security Corps Ltd.; Transport Authority.

11.
The overall balance of public bodies will be calculated from the Statement A’s
provided by the Public Enterprises Division of the Ministry of Finance and the Planning
(MoFP) for each of the selected public bodies and the group of the other public bodies as
defined above. The definition of overall balance used is operational balance, plus capital account
net of revenues (investment returns, minus capital expenditure, plus change in inventories), minus
dividends and corporate taxes transferred to government, plus net other transfers from government.
For the particular case of the National Housing Trust and the House Agency of Jamaica, capital
account revenues will not be netted out since they do not refer to flows arising from assets sales but
rather to contribution revenue and therefore will be included among recurrent revenue such as is
done for pension funds. The definitions of “Selected Public Bodies” and “Other Public Bodies” will be
adjusted as the process of public bodies’ rationalization, including divestments and mergers,
advances. However, this process will not affect the performance criterion unless specifically stated.
All newly created entities, including from the merging of existing entities, will be incorporated in
either of these two groups.
12.
The overall balance of the public sector is calculated as the sum of central government
overall balance and the overall balance of the public bodies.
13.
Reporting: Data will be provided to the Fund with a lag of no more than 6 weeks after the
test date.
14.
Adjuster: The floor for the overall public sector balance (cumulative since the beginning of
the fiscal year) will be adjusted downward (upward) by an amount equivalent to the shortfall (excess)
of PetroJam’s overall balance (relative to baseline projections in Table 2), with the value of the
adjustment at the end of any quarter capped at J$3.5 billion.

Ceiling on the Stock of Central Government Direct Debt

15.
Definitions: Central government direct debt includes all domestic and external bonds and
any other form of central government debt, such as supplier loans. It excludes IMF debt. It includes
loan disbursements from the PetroCaribe Development Fund to finance central government
operations. The target will be set in Jamaican dollars with foreign currency debt converted using the
programme exchange rate. The change in the stock of debt will be measured “below the line” as all
debt issuance minus repayments on all central government debt.

84

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA

16.
For the purposes of computing the debt target, debt inflows are to be recorded at the
moment the funds are credited to any central government account.
17.
Reporting: Data will be provided to the Fund with a lag of no more than four weeks after
the test date.
18.
Adjusters: The target will be adjusted upwards if explicit government guarantees (defined as
the stock of existing guarantees as of end March 2012 plus new guarantees allowed to be issued
under the programme) are called. The target will be adjusted downwards if net divestment revenues
(i.e. net of divestment expenses) take place. The debt target will be adjusted for cross-currency
parity changes; and pre-financing, as reflected by the increase in central government deposits.
19.
The target will be adjusted downward by: 20 percent of the value of the bonds
converted through the February 2013 debt exchange into “Fixed Rate Accreting Bonds”
(FRAN), The target will be adjusted upward by any interest penalties, up to J$1,7 billion, associated
with a possible liability management operation under which existing debt obligations are retired
early with the objective of reducing the eventual debt burden.

D.

Ceiling on Net Increase in Central Government Guaranteed Debt

20.
Definitions: Net increase in central government guaranteed debt is calculated as issuance
minus repayments of central government guaranteed debt, in billions of Jamaican dollars, including
domestic and external bonds, loans and all other types of debt. Foreign currency debt will be
converted to Jamaican dollars at the programme exchange rate. Central government guaranteed
debt does not cover loans to public entities from the PetroCaribe Development Fund. The
cumulative targets are computed as the difference between the stock of government guaranteed
debt as of end-March of each year and the stock of government guaranteed debt as of the target
date.
21.
The cumulative net increase in central government guaranteed debt will be monitored
on a continuous basis.
22.
Reporting: Data will be provided to the Fund with a lag of no more than four weeks after
the test date.
23.
Adjuster: In the case where the central government debt guarantees are called, the stock of
central government guaranteed debt will be adjusted downwards to preserve the performance
criteria.

E.

Ceiling on Central Government Accumulation of Domestic Arrears

24.
Definition: Domestic arrears are defined as payments to residents determined by
contractual obligations that remain unpaid 90 days after the due date. Under this definition, the due
date refers to the date in which domestic debt payments are due according to the relevant

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

85

JAMAICA

contractual agreement, taking into account any contractual grace periods. Central government
domestic arrears include arrears on domestic central government direct debt, including to suppliers
and all recurrent and capital expenditure commitments. This accumulation is measured as the
change in the stock of domestic arrears relative to the stock at end-March 2013, which stood at
J$21.6 billion.
25.
The ceiling on central government accumulation of domestic arrears will be monitored
on a continuous basis.
26.
Reporting: Data will be provided to the Fund with a lag of no more than four weeks after
the test date.

F.

Non-Accumulation of External Debt Payments Arrears

27.
Definitions: Consolidated government includes the central government and the public
bodies, as defined in sections A and B, respectively.
28.

Definitions: external debt is determined according to the residency criterion.

29.
Definitions: The term “debt” 1 will be understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent,
liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of
assets (including currency) or services and which requires the obligor to make one or more
payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future point(s) in time; these
payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts
can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows:
i.

Loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an
undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds,
debentures, commercial loans and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that
are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the
funds and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future
(such as repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements);

ii.

Suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments
until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and

iii. Leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the right to
use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total
expected service life of the property. For the purpose of the programme, the debt is the
present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made

during the period of the agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation,
repair or maintenance of the property.
30.
Definitions: under the definition of debt set out above, arrears, penalties and judicially
awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual obligation
that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered
debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.
31.
Definitions: Under this definition of debt set out above, external payments arrears consist of
arrears of external debt obligations (principal and interest) falling due after March 29, 2013 that
have not been paid at the time due, taking into account the grace periods specified in contractual
agreements. Arrears resulting from nonpayment of debt service for which a clearance framework has
been agreed or rescheduling agreement is being sought are excluded from this definition.
32.
The consolidated government and the BOJ will accumulate no external debt payment
arrears during the programme period. For the purpose of this performance criterion, an external
debt payment arrear will be defined as a payment by the consolidated government and the BOJ,
which has not been made within seven days after falling due.
33.
The stock of external arrears of the consolidated government and the BOJ will be
calculated based on the schedule of external payments obligations reported by the MoFP.
Data on external arrears will be reconciled with the relevant creditors and any necessary adjustments
will be incorporated in these targets as they occur.
34.

This performance criterion does not cover arrears on trade credits.

35.

The performance criterion will apply on a continuous basis.

36.
Reporting: The MoFP will provide the final data on the stock of external arrears of the
consolidated government and the BOJ to the Fund, with a lag of not more than two weeks after the
test date.

G.

Ceiling on Central Government Accumulation of Tax Refund Arrears

37. Definition: Tax refund arrears are defined as obligations on tax refunds in accordance with tax
legislation that remain unpaid 90 days after the due date. This accumulation is measured as the
change in the stock of tax refund arrears relative to the stock at end-March 2013, which stood at
J$24.6 billion.
38. The central government accumulation of tax refund arrears will be monitored on a
continuous basis.
39. Reporting: Data will be provided to the Fund with a lag of no more than four weeks after the
test date.

Floor on the Cumulative Change in Net International Reserves

40.
Definitions: Net international reserves (NIR) of the BOJ are defined as the U.S. dollar
value of gross foreign assets of the BOJ minus gross foreign liabilities with maturity of less
than one year. Non-U.S. dollar denominated foreign assets and liabilities will be converted into U.S.
dollar at the programme exchange rates. Gross foreign assets are defined consistently with the Sixth
Edition of the Balance of Payments Manual and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6) as
readily available claims on nonresidents denominated in foreign convertible currencies. They include
the BOJ’s holdings of monetary gold, SDR holdings, foreign currency cash, foreign currency
securities, liquid balances abroad and the country’s reserve position at the Fund. Excluded from
reserve assets are any assets that are pledged, collateralized or otherwise encumbered, claims on
residents, claims in foreign exchange arising from derivatives in foreign currency vis-à-vis domestic
currency (such as futures, forwards, swaps and options), precious metals other than gold, assets in
nonconvertible currencies and illiquid assets.
41.
Gross foreign liabilities of the BOJ are defined consistently with the definition of NIR for
programme purposes and include all foreign exchange liabilities to nonresidents, including
commitments to sell foreign exchange arising from derivatives (such as futures, forwards, swaps and
options) and all credit outstanding from the Fund (including credit used for financing of the FSSF,
but excluding credit transferred by the Fund into a Treasury account to meet the government’s
financing needs directly. In deriving NIR, credit outstanding from the Fund is subtracted from
foreign assets of the BOJ regardless of its maturity.
42.
Reporting: Data will be provided by the BOJ to the Fund with a lag of no more than five
days past the test date.
43.
Adjusters: NIR targets will be adjusted upward (downward) by the surplus (shortfall) in
programme loan disbursements from multilateral institutions (the IBRD, IDB and CDB) relative to the
baseline projection reported in Table 3. Programme loan disbursements are defined as external loan
disbursements from official creditors that are usable for the financing of the consolidated
government. NIR targets will be adjusted upward (downward) by the surplus (shortfall) in
disbursements of budget support grants relative to the baseline projection reported in Table 3. NIR
targets will also be adjusted upward (downward) by the surplus (shortfall) in IMF budget support
purchases relative to the baseline projection reported in Table 3.

CONDITIONALITY ON TAX WAIVER REFORM
52.
Under the continuous structural benchmark regarding the application of discretionary
tax waivers, the granting of new discretionary waivers is subject to a de minimis cap’ of
J$10 million in any month.
53.
For the purpose of this condition, discretionary waivers are defined as: any reduction
in tax or customs duty payable, effected through the direct exercise by the Minister of
Finance of his powers under the various tax statutes; in circumstances where there is no express
provision for exemption in any statute.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

91

JAMAICA

54.
The amounts covered under the cap would exclude tax measures related to
international treaties not yet ratified and provisions for CARICOM suspensions which are
binding international legal obligations.

CONDITIONALITY ON USER-FUNDED PPPS
55.
Under the continuous structural benchmark regarding the total loan value of all new
user-funded PPPs, the total value of all such loans contracted after May 1, 2013 will be
capped at 3 percent of GDP on a cumulative basis over the program period. At end-June 2014,
the total loan value of existing user-funded PPPs contracted after May 1, 2013 was zero.
56.
For the purpose of this condition, the loan value of a PPP may be excluded if the
Office of the Auditor General has established that the PPP involves only minimal contingent
liabilities (by demonstrating that the project has no debt guarantee, demand or price
guarantees or termination clauses that could imply a transfer of liabilities to the government).
57.
For the purpose of this condition, the applicable GDP is the projected nominal GDP for
the fiscal year published in the Fiscal Policy Paper tabled in parliament ahead of the adoption

Exchange Rate Arrangements:
Jamaica’s de facto exchange rate regime is classified as “crawl-like”, based on a standardized
classification methodology, and de jure as floating. The external value of the Jamaican dollar has
been determined in an interbank market operated by commercial banks beginning
September 17, 1990. The Jamaican dollar has depreciated significantly since that time. At May 16,
2014 it was trading at around J$111.02 to the U.S. dollar. Jamaica has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making
of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Last Article IV Consultation and Program Relations:
Jamaica four-year, SDR 615 million (225 percent of quota) Extended Arrangement under the EFF was
approved by the IMF Executive Board on May 1 2013, and the first three reviews under the program
were completed on schedule. The last Article IV consultation was completed by the Executive Board
on May 30, 2012.
A safeguards assessment of the Bank of Jamaica (BoJ) was completed in August 2013, with respect
to Jamaica's EFF. The assessment found that the bank has relatively strong safeguards in place,
particularly in the financial reporting and audit mechanisms. Annual financial statements continue to
be prepared and audited in accordance with international standards and improved Audit Committee
oversight is reflected in the development of the internal audit function. While oversight of the bank
was bolstered by the filling of Board vacancies during 2012, the assessment found a need to further
strengthen governance arrangements at the BoJ including through amendments to certain legal
provisions in the BoJ Act. Amendments to the BoJ Act are pending. Consistent with the safeguards
assessment recommendations, in December 2013 the government and the BoJ finalized a

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of May 13, 2014)
The World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Jamaica was discussed by the World
Bank’s Board of Executive Directors on April 29, 2014, following extensive consultations with
stakeholders. The overarching goal of the CPS is to support Jamaica in creating the conditions for
sustainable and inclusive growth over the period 2014-2017. The strategy is fully aligned with the
government‘s National Development Plan ‘Vision 2030 Jamaica’ and aims to provide selective
solution oriented support in three strategic thematic areas: (i) public sector modernization;
(ii) enabling environment for private sector growth; and (iii) social and climate resilience. The last
strategy focused mostly on attending to the needs of the most vulnerable population including
support for the Program of Advancement through Health and Education (PATH) and projects in
inner-city communities and laying the foundations for longer term sustainable growth. The Bank
considers it important to continue to build on successes in social protection, education, urban
security and climate resilience, while sharpening its focus on private sector-led growth and increased
competitiveness with the view to unlock Jamaica’s growth potential. The IFC will work with the
private sector and collaborate with the Bank on the regulatory and private-public partnership issues
to strengthen Bank Group synergies in Jamaica and will place special emphasis on PPPs in
infrastructure and education. The program will also benefit from strong coordination with other
development partners.

A. Projects
The Jamaica Social Protection Project (SPP) was approved in May 2008 for US$40 million, with an
additional financing of US$40 million approved in January 2014. Recognizing the government’s
budget constraints the additional financing will continue to provide support to the most vulnerable
under a well performing project. The Jamaica Social Protection Project will: (i) further improve the
effectiveness of the Program of Advancement through Health and Education (PATH) in order to
foster investment by poor families in human capital accumulation; (ii) develop a structured system for
assisting working-age members of PATH eligible households seek and retain employment; (iii) enable
the formulation of a reform program for the public sector pension schemes; and (iv) develop a
holistic social protection strategy. The first component, improving effectiveness of the PATH,
supports the PATH through: (a) co-financing for conditional cash transfers to children 0 to 19 yearsold (child grants); and (b) technical improvements to the program. The second component, building
capacity for the Steps-to-Work (StW) program, supports capacity building within the Ministry of
Labor and Social Security (MLSS) to implement a new initiative. The StW program targets working
age members of PATH eligible households for referral to the relevant support services to enable
them to seek and retain employment. The third component, improving the public sector pension
system administration and building capacity for reform, supports two core sets of activities focused
on the schemes for public sector workers: (i) preparation of a reform program; and (ii) improving
administration and information systems. The final component is the development of a holistic social
protection strategy. This component supports the Government in developing a holistic social

JAMAICA

protection strategy to inform decision-making on the appropriate policies and programs to address
social risks and vulnerabilities within the population.
The Jamaica Rural Education Transformation Development Initiative (REDI) was approved in
September 2009 for US$15 million. The objective of REDI is to improve market access for rural micro
and small-scale producers of agriculture and tourism products, as well as, other service providers.
There are three components to the project. The first component, which is support for rural
subprojects in agriculture and tourism, will see the Bank financing two types of subprojects: type A
will support revenue generating activities in agriculture and tourism, and type B will support
provision of critical infrastructure, marketing, and management in the agriculture and tourism
sectors. The second component of the project gives support through national technical assistance
and capacity building. The main goal of this component is to strengthen relevant national
organizations to enhance their capacity to continue assisting the rural enterprises and other project
partners and ensure the sustainability of the rural enterprises. Hence, the component will finance
technical assistance and capacity building for key organizations and agencies that deliver support
services in agriculture and rural tourism at the local level. The third component of the project is
project management. This component will finance project management, technical expertise (tourism
and agricultural specialists, monitoring and evaluation) staff training, the annual audit, vehicles,
office equipment, and other operating costs. This component will also ensure that effective fiduciary
arrangements are in place during implementation.
The Jamaica Early Childhood Development Project (ECD) was approved in May 2008 for
US$15 million with additional financing of US$12million approved in February 2014. The additional
financing will help to scale up activities under the ECD project while endorsing the objectives of the
ECD National Strategic Plan and enhancing the impact of a well performing project. The revised
development objectives are to: (i) improve parenting education and support programs; (ii) improve
monitoring of children’s development, the screening of household level risks, and the risk mitigation
and early intervention systems, (iii) enhance the quality of early childhood schools and care facilities;
and (iv) strengthen early childhood organizations and institutions. The first component is cofinancing the implementation of activities under the seven action areas of the National Strategic
Plan (NSP) through a Sector-Wide Approach. The second component finances selected consultant
services critical to achieve the development objectives of the NSP. It will finance development of
sub-strategies for parenting of children aged of 0–3 and 4–6 years, including the mapping of
existing parenting education and support programs and awareness and advocacy strategies for
parenting support programs. It will finance the development of service delivery models for
nutritional programs targeted at different age groups as well as the development and
implementation of the child health passport to be used in well-child clinics.
The Jamaica Education Transformation Capacity Building project was approved in November
2009 for US$15 million. The objective of the Education Transformation Capacity Building Project for
Jamaica is to build the capacity of the emerging key agencies (National Education Inspectorate (NEI),
Jamaica Teaching Council (JTC), Regional Education Authorities (REA), and National Education Trust
6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA

(NET) that are being established to support the national Education System Transformation Program
(ESTP). There are three components to the project. The first component is the Enhanced
Performance and Accountability, which is contributing to the implementation of the government’s
ESTP by making operational the key agencies to form a coherent system to monitor progress and
improve accountability and quality. The NEI and JTC are staffed and operational. The second
component will develop mechanisms to mobilize resources to the NET. The NET will be the vehicle
through which the Ministry of Education (MoE) will secure a consistent and reliable source of funds
to support capital programs in education with a particular focus on, but not limited to,
infrastructure. Mechanisms will be established to attract funding from the Diaspora, the private
sector, and other sources. Finally, the third component is the communications, project management,
and monitoring and evaluation. This component is supporting the implementation of a strategic
communications strategy; provision of staffing, training, purchase of necessary equipment and
materials, and operating costs for the MoE change management unit, responsible for overseeing
implementation of the ESTP; and support to carry out evaluations of the ESTP, and annual external
audits of project financing.
The Energy Security and Efficiency Enhancement Project was approved in March 2011 for
US$15 million. The government has requested the World Bank Group support to implement its new
Energy Policy and Strategy, in particular to: (a) develop and implement renewable energy and
energy efficiency programs to displace imported fossil fuels and reduce fuel imports; (b) develop the
use of natural gas (LNG), a lower-cost and cleaner fuel alternative; and (c) accelerate the
replacement of old plants through strengthening the capacity for regulation, planning and
development/oversight of Public/Private Partnerships (PPPs) of (i) the Ministry of Energy and
Mining; (ii) the Office of the Utility Regulator (OUR), and (iii) the institutions responsible for
implementing the Energy Efficiency (EE) and Renewable Energy (RE) policy such as the Center of
Excellence, a division within the Petroleum Corporation of Jamaica (PCJ). The Project’s overarching
objective is to support the implementation of the Government Energy Policy, particularly the goals
of enhancing Jamaica’s energy security and efficiency by: (i) reducing energy costs; and (ii) reducing
the country’s high dependence on imported petroleum products. The project is expected to assist in
improving Jamaica’s competitiveness.
The Jamaica Integrated Community Development Project was approved in March 2014 for
US$42 million. The development objective is to enhance access to basic urban infrastructure and
services, and contribute towards increased community safety in selected economically vulnerable
and socially volatile inner city communities of Jamaica. The project will finance four components
over six years. This includes: Component 1: Basic Infrastructure and Access to Services, which will
develop infrastructure investments across project communities according to identified community
priorities. Component 2: Public Safety Enhancement and Alternative Livelihoods, which will focus on
supporting the development and roll-out of programs that focus on key safety concerns and high
risk groups. Component 3: Institutional Strengthening for Urban Management and Public Safety,
which will support institutional strengthening activities related to urban management. Component 4:
Project Administration which will support program management.

The Economic Stabilization and Foundations for Growth Development Policy Loan was approved on
December 12, 2013, in the amount of US$130 million to assist the Government of Jamaica in
implementing a set of policy actions and institutional reforms to increase competitiveness and
improve fiscal management. This operation is the first of three planned budget support operations
under the CPS and supports policy actions in the following areas: (i) improving investment climate and
increasing competitiveness by undertaking reforms to mitigate constraints faced by the private sector
and (ii) improving public financial management to sustain the government’s fiscal consolidation
efforts.
The Bank is currently working with the government to prepare four investment projects totaling
US$145 million which are scheduled for Board approval in FY15. The projects will cover: public sector
transformation, youth employment in digital and creative industries, competiveness and growth and
disaster vulnerability reduction.
IFC supported investments has a current portfolio of US$262 million with a focus on infrastructure,
access to finance, growth sectors and education. The introduction of local currency instruments of
an authorized amount of up to US$500 million will further leverage IFC resource mobilization
capacity.

B. Advisory Services and Trust Funds
In addition to the aforementioned projects, the Bank also provides technical assistance and grant
funding to Jamaica. Currently, grants and trust funds under implementation approximate
US$12.2 million. Technical assistance initiatives include, among others, support to debt management
and budget reforms, support to entrepreneurship, strengthening PPP capacity, tackling youth
unemployment through creative industries and support to gender and poverty initiatives.
IFC advisory services have been increasing and are focused on access to finance, investment climate,
PPPs and value chain support in the food sector. IFC is now advising on the privatization of selected
Government assets; institutional strengthening of a microfinance institution and increasing its
operational efficiency; and Credit Bureau legislation as part of a regional harmonization plan.
Support to the microfinance institutions is expected to lead these institutions to better adapt loan
products to the local market and increase average loan size by 45 percent and IFC is pursuing other
such opportunities. MIGA currently has a net exposure of US$56.5 million and provides guarantee
for an infrastructure project. MIGA will continue to encourage private sector development and
facilitate inward foreign direct investment.

C. Economic and Sector Work
Between FY2012–FY14, the following knowledge products have been delivered to the Government of
Jamaica and have formed the analytical underpinnings of Bank operations:


Managing Nurse Migration II, which reviewed relevant obligations under existing
international legal agreements which led to identifying a non-legally binding Memorandum of
Understanding as the instrument that could provide the supporting framework for regional
action in all of the priority policy areas.



Non-Communicable Disease, which provided detailed recommendations to improve NCD
and Human Resources for Health (HRH) policies. The Bank and the Government jointly
organized a regional workshop on the NCDs prior to the UN High Level Meeting on NCDs,
which helped Jamaica and other Caribbean countries to further form their positions on NCDs.



Employment Growth Effects of Investment, which studied the employment multiplier
effects of investment decisions.



Impact of Economic Crisis on Health Spending, which assessed the effects of the economic
contraction in Jamaica due to the global economic crisis on health expenditure.



A Framework to Assess the Fiscal Risk of Public Bodies, which outlines a framework for
assessing the macroeconomic significance of fiscal risks on the operation of selected public
bodies (PBs) in Jamaica.

Jamaica joined the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in 1969. Since then, the IDB has
approved 116 loans to Jamaica amounting to almost US$3 billion and 220 technical cooperation
operations totaling US$88.2 million. IDB financial assistance has supported a wide range of
infrastructural, environmental and social sector projects with a view to enhancing Jamaica’s human
resource and absorptive capacity and strengthening the foundation for private sector-led growth. In
addition, the IDB has supported reforms aimed at strengthening the institutional and regulatory
environment.
The IDB is the leading lender to Jamaica among multilateral development partners. As of March
2014, Jamaica’s outstanding debt to the IDB stood at US$1.43 billion, of which US$53.4 million were
loans to the private sector. The total represents 17% of public external debt and 41% of multilateral
debt (including the IMF).
Starting in 2004 there was a drastic reduction in the fiscal space needed to disburse existing Bank
loans. As a result part of the portfolio was cancelled and no new loans were approved between 2004
and 2008. The new administration that took office in 2007 intensified Jamaica's reform program and
emphasized a policy of expanding IFI financing for its development program.
This ushered in a new generation of Bank lending to Jamaica. The IDB approved eight new loans for a
total of US$405 million for Jamaica in 2008, including a US$200 million loan to increase private bank
lending to the real sector; a US$60 million policy based loan for improving public financial
management; US$50 million for road rehabilitation; US$30 million for education reform; a
US$30 million policy based loan for competitiveness; US$14 million for primary schools; US$11 million
for youth at risk; and US$10 million for rebuilding infrastructure damaged by floods.
This upward trend continued in January 2009 when the Bank approved two more loan operations: a
US$300 million liquidity program to protect the real sector from lost credit lines; and a
US$15 million social safety net program. In September 2009, a US$70 million loan was approved to
expand the highway network and a US$25 million for a citizen security and justice program and
US$10 million for road improvement.
The Bank provided unprecedented support to the country in 2010 as part of a boarder financial
support from multilateral financial institutions in support of the Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF.
In February 2010, the Bank approved 3 policy based loans and 1 hybrid PBL/investment loan for a total
of US$215 million. The areas of intervention were the same as the previously approved PBLs (public
financial management, education and competitiveness) and a PBL focused on human capital
protection. During the second half of the year the Bank approved an investment loan to support
competitiveness in the agricultural sector US$15.0 million, as well as two phases of a new policy based
program totaling US$400 million aimed to support fiscal consolidation.

Because of the macroeconomic deterioration following the stalling of the SBA in 2011, IDB support to
Jamaica decreased. The Bank disbursed US$131 million in 2011 and US$69.6 million in 2012. Because
of the stabilization of the economy and in support of the Extended Fund Facility with the IMF, the
Bank increased its support in 2013, including through budget support.
In 2013, the Bank disbursed US$101.4 million, including US$60 million in budget support in the area
of public financial and performance management. Another US$140 million in budget support was
approved in the 1st quarter of 2014, supporting the areas of competitiveness and fiscal reform.
During 2013, one investment loan for public sector efficiency was approved totaling US$25 million.
In addition, one operation is programmed for approval in calendar year 2014 totaling US$20 million,
which will support citizen security.
As of December 2013, the Bank’s portfolio consisted of 15 investment loans1 valued at
US$452.6 million, and 27 non-reimbursable technical cooperation valued at US$31.6 million. Forty one
percent of the IDB loan resources and fifty seven percent of the TC funds have been disbursed, leaving
US$278.4 million available for disbursement.

Disbursements reached a low point of US$12.5 million in 2005, but have rebounded ever since. They
doubled to US$25 million in 2006, and reached US$34 million in 2007. Due in large part to policybased lending in 2008 and the approval of the liquidity program in 2009, total disbursements rose
dramatically to US$144.2 million, and US$151.5 million in those years respectively. The figures for
2010 reflect the above mentioned unprecedented support that implied a positive cash flow of more
than US$626.0 million. As such, disbursements leveled somewhat in 2011 to US$131.4 million, 2012
to US$52.3 million and 2013 to US$101.4 million.

Country Strategy with Jamaica
The current Country Strategy focuses on supporting efforts to reestablish fiscal sustainability,
maintain social stability, and promote private-sector led growth. This will be realized through
lending and technical assistance in the following priority areas: (i) Fiscal Sustainability; (ii) Social
Protection and Safety; and (iii) Financial Sector & Business Climate. To mitigate fiscal and social
impacts posed by extreme climatic events, Disaster Risk Management and Climate Change
Adaptation will be a cross-cutting theme.
Country Systems
In keeping with the agenda to improve and use national systems the Government of Jamaica, with
the support of multilateral institutions and bilateral donors has prepared a wide range of studies in
different areas, including a joint World Bank and IDB, Country Financial Accountability Assessment
and Country Procurement Assessment Report (CFAA/CPAR) in 2005, and a Public Expenditure and
Financial Accountability Report (PEFA) in May 2007. Following the recommended actions of those
reports, the IDB and the Government agreed on the main areas of the local fiduciary systems for
financial control and procurement procedures that needed to be strengthened, and the IDB went on
to provide resources to finance development and reform activities stemming from the CFAA/CPAR,
with non-reimbursable technical cooperation funds. Furthermore, in order to ascertain progress
made in recent years and to determine eligibility to audit IDB-funded projects a follow-up
assessment of the Office of the Auditor General of Jamaica was undertaken during a mission fielded
in the third quarter of 2010.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA

Since 2007, Jamaica has developed a comprehensive handbook, more concrete regulations defining
its public procurement including a procedure for managing contractual disputes, enhanced
accessibility of information, separation of the Office of Contractor General and the National
Contracts Committee, as well as creating national standard bidding documents. Although the
national procurement system conforms to established principles of procurement based on
international standards, some outstanding issues remain to be resolved. With the agreement of the
Government of Jamaica, the IDB would undertake an update of the latest country assessment of the
national procurement system to identify (a) the improvements in the pertinent aspects of the
country procurement system, and (b) the readiness to rely on Jamaica’s national procurement
systems for Bank-financed projects with a view to adoption of procurement country systems. Ideally,
this work can be accomplished together with the World Bank. In addition, the IDB PRODEV facility
and the PFPM Programmatic PBL will also support the introduction of performance-based budgets
and accrual accounting. The Multi-lateral Investment Fund (MIF) will also promote better access by
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to public procurement.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of May 19, 2014

I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. In early
2003, Jamaica started participating in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), which
provides participants with a framework for the development of the statistical system.
Key websites for statistics on Jamaica:
Bank of Jamaica:

http://www.boj.org.jm/

Ministry of Finance and Planning:

http://www.mof.gov.jm/

Planning Institute of Jamaica:

http://www.pioj.gov.jm/

Statistical Institute of Jamaica:

http://www.statinja.com/

National Accounts: The Statistical Institute of Jamaica (STATIN) provides quarterly and annual data
on GDP by type of economic activity and annual data by expenditure and income (both in current
and constant prices). GDP by expenditure and income was first published in 2014. STATIN is
currently working on quarterly demand-side GDP data and expects to provide this data in 2016.
Progress has been made including through updating the base year for the national accounts data in
constant price terms from 2003 to 2007, but weaknesses remain, including dated surveys for
household expenditure (2004/5). Addressing these shortcomings has been hindered by a lack of
resources. Assistance on national accounts methodology has been provided by Statistics Canada
and STA.
Price statistics: Jamaica (with assistance from the IMF Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance
Center, CARTAC) revised its consumer price index (CPI) series in 2007. The CPI revision updated
expenditure weights of the CPI that had dated from 1984. The new CPI weights are based on a
household survey conducted in 2004–05. In addition, the STATIN compiles and disseminates the
producer price index (PPI) on a monthly basis covering mining and manufacturing industries (base
2005 =100). There are plans to improve the scope of the PPI by covering other industries like
agriculture, electricity, gas, services, etc.
Government finance statistics: Budgetary central government operations and public debt data
(with the exception of non-guaranteed debt by public entities) are updated on a monthly basis. The
demand side of GDP is not available at high frequency, making it difficult to assess the fiscal policy
stance. Also, data on operations of public entities outside the consolidated fund (which includes all
public bodies that are fully financed through the state budget) are only available with lag of more
than a month, making the assessment of the overall balance of the public sector challenging.

JAMAICA

Government finance statistics are available at:
Debt: http://www.mof.gov.jm/dmu/
Budget: http://www.mof.gov.jm/programmes/em/fpmu/default.shtml

Monetary and financial statistics: Monetary statistics published by the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) are
sectorized, classified, and valued in accordance with international standards, and are provided to the
Fund for the most part in a timely manner. The BOJ initiated the submission of monetary and
financial statistics based on standardized report forms in March 2007. Financial sector statistics
outside of the banking system have improved substantially, but some gaps remain.

Balance of payments: The BOJ compiles and disseminates balance of payments statistics in
national publications on a monthly (only aggregated data) and annual basis. The authorities have
started the compilation of balance of payments data on the basis of BPM6.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS) since February 28, 2003.

No data ROSC is available.

III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
No data on industrial production, wholesale or producer prices, import volumes, or export and
import prices have been reported for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS) in
recent years.
Detailed annual balance of payments and international investment position (IIP) data are reported
by the BOJ for publication in the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY) and the IFS. In
September 2007, Jamaica reported for the first time IIP data to STA; annual IIP data since 2005 are
now available in BOPSY and IFS. Currently, information on deposit money banks and monetary
authorities is being reported on a regular basis.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 20, 2014

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation and Fourth
Review Under the Extended Fund Facility with Jamaica
and Approves US$70.9 Million Disbursement
On June 20, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation and fourth review through the Extended Arrangement under the
Extended Fund Facility (EFF) with Jamaica.1 The completion of the review enables the
disbursement of an amount equivalent to SDR 45.95 million (about US$70.9 million)
bringing the total disbursements under the arrangement to SDR 268.59 million (about
US$414.4 million)
The Executive Board approved the EFF arrangement for four years and a total of
SDR 615.38 million (about US$948.1 million, the equivalent of 225 percent of Jamaica’s
quota in the IMF—see Press Release No. 13/150) on May 1, 2013.
In early 2013, the Jamaican authorities adopted a comprehensive economic reform program
to tackle the challenges of low growth and high debt head-on. Since then, fiscal policy has
been tightened further and extensive structural reforms have been implemented, including
wide-ranging tax reform and a fiscal rule anchored on a reduction in public debt to 60 percent
of GDP by 2025/26. The authorities also initiated significant reforms in the financial sector,
and have allowed the exchange rate to depreciate. In addition, and in view of minimizing the
social impact of the reform program, the government has taken steps to strengthen social
protection programs, including through the cash transfer program (PATH), a vital component
of the social safety net.
Following the Board discussion of the review, Mr. Naoyuki Shinohara, Deputy Managing
Director, and Acting Chair made the following statement:

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board.

“Jamaica’s program implementation under the Extended Fund Facility has been
commendable. The achievement of a primary surplus in a short time is impressive. Essential
social spending has been safeguarded and steps are being taken to strengthen the social safety
net. Continued support by the international community remains crucial as Jamaica is
undertaking this difficult adjustment.
“With upfront fiscal adjustment and the steadfast implementation of an ambitious and wideranging structural reform agenda, the initial dividends from the reorientation of policies are
emerging. The government’s economic strategy aims to boost growth and employment, place
public debt on a sustainable path, restore competitiveness, and strengthen the social safety
net. Its full implementation will bring about tangible benefits for Jamaica and its people.
The Executive Board also concluded the 2014 Article IV consultation with Jamaica.
A gradual economic recovery appears to be under way. Growth is estimated at 0.9 percent in
FY2013/14, as mining, agriculture and tourism picked up. Recorded unemployment remains
high, but fell from 16 percent to 13.5 percent (in seasonally adjusted terms) from April 2013
to January 2014. Inflation declined to 7.6 percent (year-on-year) at end-April, as the impact
of the ongoing depreciation of the exchange rate was countered by weak domestic demand.
These factors also caused a sharp reduction in the current account deficit to 9.5 percent in
FY2013/14. Gross international reserves increased to US$2 billion at end-March 2014.
The public sector’s fiscal position was balanced in FY2013/14, following a deficit exceeding
4 percent of GDP in the previous year. This resulted from lower interest costs and an increase
in the primary surplus of the central government to 7.5 percent of GDP. The 2014/15 budget
aims to maintain this primary surplus. The authorities’ ongoing fiscal consolidation efforts
and gains from the early 2013 debt exchange have reduced public sector debt from
147 percent of GDP in March 2013 to 140 percent a year later.
Standard indicators of the soundness of the financial sector remain broadly positive,
including the share of non-performing loans and capital-asset ratios. Stress test results from
the Bank of Jamaica confirmed that banks largely remained in compliance with capital
requirements under a range of shocks. However, the financial system is still heavily exposed
to government debt holdings and a decline in the market value of government bonds could
have a negative impact on financial institutions’ capital.
The steadfast implementation of planned policies should support a gradual economic
recovery. Growth is projected to reach almost 1½ percent in 2014/15, as the negative fiscal
impulse comes to an end. The gradual impact of various supply side reforms and rising
confidence with implementation of the authorities’ comprehensive reform program are
expected to help raise growth to beyond two percent over the medium term. The risks to the
outlook remain high, however, and include a possible disruption of external financing flows,
natural disasters, lower partner-country growth, and oil price shocks.

Executive Board Assessment2

Executive Directors welcomed the emerging signs of economic recovery and the marked
improvements in fiscal and external balances. Directors commended the authorities for the
impressive implementation of their economic transformation program, notably the ambitious
fiscal adjustment. They stressed that steadfast implementation of the economic strategy and
sustained broad public support for the reform agenda would be critical to achieving the
objectives of growth, employment, and poverty reduction.
Directors noted that downside risks to the outlook remain high, and that the economic and
social costs of the adjustment effort have been substantial. Careful sequencing and
prioritizing of wide-ranging reforms, with the full support of the international community,
will be important. Directors welcomed as critical the steps being taken to safeguard social
spending and improve the social safety net to protect the most vulnerable.
Directors commended the authorities for the remarkable front-loaded fiscal consolidation
aimed at reducing public debt to sustainable levels. They welcomed in particular the
achievement of a primary surplus that is exceptional by international standards, progress on
tax reform, and the adoption of a fiscal rule. Directors agreed that efforts should focus on
improving tax collection. At the same time, accelerated efforts are needed to reform the
public sector and contain the wage bill, address contingent fiscal risks by strengthening the
performance of public entities, and improve public financial management to better leverage
the growth impact of scarce public investment. Directors also looked forward to progress on
strengthening debt management.
Directors supported the overall stance of monetary policy, which aims to balance the multiple
objectives of containing inflation, rebuilding reserves, and ensuring sufficient credit to the
real economy. They recommended increasing reliance on interest rate channels and
expanding the monetary policy toolkit for liquidity management, while maintaining exchange
rate flexibility. Directors welcomed the plan to adopt inflation targeting once prior conditions
have been met.
Directors welcomed progress in strengthening the banking system, including the adoption of
legislation on bank supervision. They encouraged a proactive approach to address remaining
vulnerabilities in the financial system, giving priority to reforming the business model of the
securities dealers. Further consolidating supervision and enhancing the bank resolution
framework are also crucial.
Directors stressed the importance of promoting growth and job creation, by reducing red
tape, improving infrastructure, and boosting competitiveness. They welcomed the
improvement in price competitiveness resulting from a flexible exchange rate. Reducing the
price of electricity and focusing training on critical skills remain important priorities.

Statement by Thomas Hockin, Executive Director for Jamaica
and Trevor Lessard, Advisor to the Executive Director
June 20, 2014
We thank the staff for their informative report and continue to value their assistance as
Jamaica navigates through its multi-year adjustment program to improve competitiveness,
growth, and employment. With the help of external partners and the support of domestic
stakeholders, significant reforms have taken place that will pave the way towards strong and
sustainable growth. Fundamental tax reform that levels the playing field will assist the
economy now and pay dividends for many years to come. To secure the gains of painful
fiscal consolidation, comprehensive fiscal rules tailored to the unique characteristics of
Jamaica have been enacted, anchored in a medium-term debt target of 60 percent of GDP.
Significant tax reform has been undertaken and administration has improved, with additional
initiatives being implemented. Structural reforms to boost productivity, encourage job
creation, and improve business competitiveness are proceeding apace while strategic
investments are underway, along with steadfast debt reduction. These will be the focus of
the program going forward.
Fiscal Policy and Debt Sustainability
In order to place public debt on a steeply downward trajectory, the Government of Jamaica
(GoJ) has successfully implemented an unprecedented fiscal adjustment in a short time.
Starting from a primary balance of approximately 3.2 percent of GDP in 2011/12, the GoJ
has successfully raised this surplus to 7.6 percent of GDP in 2013/2014, modestly exceeding
the 7.5 percent program target. The budget is expected to post a minuscule deficit in
2014/2015 (0.5 percent), before being balanced in 2015/16 and moving into surplus for the
remainder of the decade.
My authorities would like to recognize the important contributions made by several
stakeholders in achieving this massive shift in the fiscal position of the GoJ. A
comprehensive wage agreement with public sector employees has been a critical ingredient
in the shift to fiscal sustainability. The financial sector agreed to a debt exchange, the NDX,
which provided important interest payment relief and fiscal space for the Government to
implement its reform program. Finally, despite partial mitigation resulting from the GoJ
commitment to maintain the real value of social spending for the next three years, Jamaicans
have endured a period of austerity as part of a collective effort to move the economy on to a
new growth path.
My authorities are appreciative of the Fund’s willingness to change the profile of the next
two disbursements to direct budget support. As the staff report indicates, the timing of cash
flows for the first half of the fiscal year, along with continued temporary illiquidity in the
domestic bond market for Government securities, has created some timing issues. Shifting
the form of Fund assistance for the next two disbursements will help avoid the GoJ entering

2
frozen domestic markets where appetite for Government debt instruments is currently
limited. We see the Fund’s willingness to provide budget support as a vote of confidence for
the program and are hopeful it will be catalytic, inspiring further confidence in domestic
stakeholders and other international partners.
With regard to debt sustainability, under staff’s baseline scenario public debt in Jamaica is
expected to be 99.3 percent by 2019/20, down from 146.9 percent in 2012, effectively
reducing the public debt-to-GDP ratio by more than 50 percent of GDP within 7 years.
Indeed, there is reason to be cautiously optimistic that in 2019 the debt ratio will in fact be
lower than currently forecast. An acceleration in global growth, especially in the US, and
better than anticipated dividends from the GoJ’s reform agenda could materially affect the
medium-term forecast. Moreover, due to the idiosyncrasies of the DSA, it should be noted
that the primary balance in the DSA baseline is 0.5 percent less than in the macroeconomic
framework for the years 2014-2019, inclusive. This cumulative difference of 3 percent of
GDP, plus savings from foregone financing costs, would have a non-negligible effect on the
debt-to-GDP level in 2020.
External competitiveness
The Bank of Jamaica (BoJ) remains committed to price stability, increasingly anchored on
lower inflation expectations, and a flexible exchange rate regime that reflects underlying
fundamentals. The BoJ is also committed to gradually rebuilding NIR, essential for building
confidence, while limiting its interventions in the market to smoothing excessive volatility
that inevitably arises from the bunching of demand for FX within a shallow market.
The BoJ agrees with staff that substantial improvement in the price competitiveness of the
Jamaican economy has been achieved over the last year as the exchange has moved in line
with market fundamentals. As a result, BoJ analysis indicates that the exchange rate is much
closer to equilibrium than the staff’s assessment (3-15 percent overvaluation) would suggest.
As staff alludes to in Annex III, the econometrically derived equilibrium real exchange rate
(ERER) is purely backward looking and is poorly suited to providing an accurate assessment
of the exchange rate during times of significant policy and exchange rate adjustment.
Excluding the ERER method, staff’s assessment shows an exchange rate that is close to
equilibrium, especially considering the substantial variability inherent in these assessments.
Going forward, future movements in the nominal exchange rate are likely to be driven by
macroeconomic and trade relevant variables, such as the inflation differential between
Jamaica and its major trading partners, and the success of policies to raise productivity and
remove obstacles to investment.

Financial Sector
My authorities feel that it is important that stakeholders not underestimate the complexity
and risks involved with the fundamental reform of the financial system that is envisioned
under the program. In the past, the financial system has, by necessity of the fiscal stance,
focused too much on allocating resources to the public sector. Going forward, with a much
improved fiscal position, efforts are being made to shift financing towards productive,
growth enhancing investment. The establishment of two credit bureaus and the creation of a
central credit registry, along with other transformative measures, should assist in the growth
of the private sector credit market.
My authorities are unwavering in their commitment to this reform since it will bolster
stability in the system and facilitate much needed credit flow to the real economy, but they
are cognizant that such sweeping reforms are not riskless and it is absolutely essential to
carefully sequence the reform process. Reforming the business model of securities dealers is
an example where careful sequencing will be critical to avoiding potential risks to financial
stability and market conditions, particularly for GoJ securities. Following the introduction of
a viable alternative business model for securities dealers through the availability of collective
investment schemes (CIS), the Government will introduce, in a gradual fashion, new legal
and regulatory frameworks for this sector by the end of 2014.
As mentioned in our last statement, the BoJ continues to operate in a complex environment
as it seeks to balance the multiple goals of maintaining price stability, managing bank
liquidity and rebuilding NIR. Consequently, it has been gradually expanding its toolkit. The
creation of a standing liquidity window for banks and the expansion of repo instruments are
recent actions by the BoJ to respond to the liquidity demands of the system. The BoJ will
continue to gradually enhance and expand its toolkit to respond to liquidity pressures and
prepare for the eventual transition to a full-fledged inflation targeting regime over the
medium term.
Boosting Growth and Competitiveness
The implementation of the growth agenda is critical to the long-term success of Jamaica. My
authorities largely agree with staff that there are key supply side impediments that need to be
overcome in order for Jamaica to experience robust growth. In the first year of the program,
of necessity, there was a focus on restoring stability and avoiding a serious economic and
financial downturn. Going forward, the emphasis will be placed on addressing the main
impediments to growth as the authorities focus on reducing electricity costs, eliminating
bureaucratic red tape, improving infrastructure, and increasing tax compliance. The reality is
that none of these obstacles will be removed overnight, but my authorities understand the
importance and benefits of tackling these challenges quickly.

4
To assist the private sector in spurring growth and creating jobs, my authorities continue to
work on transforming the public sector to make it more efficient, nimble, and client driven.
Although many initiatives have been ongoing for some time, a detailed action plan for public
sector transformation will be completed by end-September 2014. The action plan will focus
on gaining efficiencies through shared corporate services; optimize the size, number and
structure of departments and agencies; improve control and accountability systems within
government; explore avenues to outsource services that can be more effectively delivered by
expert providers; and ensure that pay in the public sector is better aligned with job
requirements and responsibilities.
Conclusion
More than a year into the authorities’ Fund supported program, Jamaica is in a better place
than it was 12 months ago. Nevertheless, the authorities are not complacent and are well
aware of the necessity to continue to pursue reforms that will move Jamaica from stability to
growth.
