SAMOA
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation with Samoa
Approved by Ray Brooks and Aasim Husain
April 22, 2010
Context: Samoa has been subject to severe social and economic shocks. The September
2009 tsunami undercut prospects for a quick recovery from the global recession and saddled
Samoa with massive private and public sector rebuilding costs. The Fund has played a
catalytic role in securing donor support and provided emergency assistance under the
ESF/RAC of SDR5.8 million (50 percent of quota).
Discussions: Apia, March 2–6, 2010 with Prime Minister Tuilaepa Malielegaoi, Ministry of
Finance Chief Executive Iulai Lavea, Central Bank of Samoa Governor Papali’I Tommy
Scanlan, and other senior officials and representatives from financial and business sectors as
well as donors.
Team: Mr. Unteroberdoerster (head), Ms. Pongsaparn (all APD), Mr. Ralyea (FIN), and
Mr. Mellor (AsDB). Mr. Pereira (OED) participated in the discussions.
Focus: Disaster rehabilitation and economic recovery; fiscal sustainability; private-sector led
growth.
Exchange Rate: Samoa maintains a peg to a basket of currencies with undisclosed weights.
Samoa has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an
exchange system that is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current
international transactions.
Previous Fund Advice: Samoa has a good track record in maintaining fiscal sustainability
and pursuing structural reform in line with Fund recommendations. The authorities remain
committed to measures outlined in the staff report for the ESF/RAC request (IMF Country
Report No. 10/46) that would underpin macroeconomic stability during tsunami-related
reconstruction.
Statistical Issues: Core economic data are updated regularly and published on official
websites. National accounts data are not prepared on an expenditure basis, while balance of
payments data are limited and subject to frequent revisions.
Consultation Cycle: 24-month. The authorities would welcome an interim staff visit.

I. STAFF APPRAISAL AND SUMMARY
1.
Samoa has suffered severe social and economic shocks. The September 2009
tsunami undercut prospects for a quick recovery from the global recession and saddled
Samoa with massive private and public sector rebuilding costs. The authorities responded
swiftly, adopted a fully-costed rehabilitation plan, and made quick progress in securing
concessional financing. The Fund has played a catalytic role in securing donor support and
provided emergency assistance under the ESF/RAC of SDR5.8 million (50 percent of quota).
2.
The outlook is challenging and subject to considerable uncertainty. Because of the
tsunami’s potentially severe impact on tourism, real GDP is likely to contract this financial year
while faltering export earnings and reconstruction-related imports could result in a significant
widening of the current account deficit. The unprecedented scale of the disaster, a still fragile
global recovery, and weaknesses in Samoa’s national accounts data mean that the timing and
strength of the eventual recovery are difficult to predict. Moreover, Samoa remains exposed to
severe natural disaster risks.
3.
The fiscal strategy to shoulder the rebuilding costs, minimize capacity risks, and
ensure fiscal sustainability remains appropriate. In line with commitments supporting the
authorities’ request for emergency financial assistance (IMF Country Report No. 10/46), Samoa
has made significant progress in securing concessional donor support and prioritizing
reconstruction spending. However, further efforts along these lines will be needed to address
the remaining tsunami-related fiscal financing gap. Moreover, it will be important to return to
the public deficit target once reconstruction is completed to safeguard Samoa’s favorable debt
outlook and fiscal space to deal with future shocks. Effective and timely implementation of the
government’s public financial management reform plan will help underpin this strategy.
4.
Prudent management of monetary policy and the basket peg will be more critical
than usual. In spite of severe shocks, the basket peg has remained credible, while the tala
exchange rate does not appear out of line with economic fundamentals. However, in order to
avoid undue fiscal tightening during the reconstruction period, the Central Bank of Samoa
(CBS) will need to be vigilant in detecting early signs of balance of payment pressures and
should make adjustments if necessary. While the current historically low policy rates are
appropriate, the CBS should in time adopt a more neutral stance as the domestic recovery gains
traction and regional central banks withdraw stimulus.
5.
Eventually, the Samoan economy will need to rely more on a vibrant private
sector for growth. The staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to wide-ranging
structural reform. In particular, efforts to increase access to and economic use of customary
land, and state-owned enterprise reform will be important to attract more private investment
(both foreign and domestic) and improve overall economic efficiency.

II. BACKGROUND: WEATHERING THE GLOBAL RECESSION AND 2009 TSUNAMI
6.
After more than a decade of strong economic performance, the global recession
and the 2009 tsunami dealt Samoa major setbacks (Table 1 and Figure 1).


Real per-capita income growth since the mid-1990s has been significantly higher than
for most comparator countries. Prudent fiscal and monetary policies and structural
reforms underpinned this performance.



However, the global recession hit parts of the economy severely, notably
manufacturing with the downsizing of a plant for automotive parts. In addition,
construction also recorded a significant decline in FY 2008/09, in part reflecting the
unwinding of activity related to the South Pacific Games, while agriculture and fishing
suffered from poor harvests. As a result, real GDP fell 5 percent in FY 2008/09,
recording the worst slump in two decades. Estimates for the first quarter of FY 2009/10
point to continued economic weakness



Nevertheless, Samoa’s external position
remained comfortable. The current
account deficit narrowed in FY 2008/09
(on provisional data) as remittances and
tourism receipts, Samoa’s main foreign
exchange earners, continued to grow.
Official reserves remained stable, well
above the central bank’s target.

Sources: Samoan authorities; and Fund staff estimates.

The tsunami in September 2009 caused human suffering and damage to physical
infrastructure, including tourism, of an unprecedented scale. Beyond the human cost,
the physical damage is estimated by the UNDP and the World Bank at US$60 million
(over 10 percent of GDP), but the cost of infrastructure rehabilitation, strengthening
social safety nets, and investing in disaster protection, including resettlement, is
expected to be significantly higher.

7.
The government responded swiftly to both shocks, supported by foreign aid and
Samoan communities.


The authorities responded early in the global recession with monetary and fiscal
stimulus. The Central Bank of Samoa (CBS) has lowered policy rates (CBS securities
overall rate) by nearly 500bps since mid 2008 to ¼ percent, broadly in line with
Australia and New Zealand. However, the pass-through to commercial lending rates
has been limited as banks tightened risk management and built excess liquidity. As
part of an economic stimulus package in the wake of the global recession, the

government started to increase development spending in 2008. The deficit was
budgeted to double to over 10 percent of GDP in FY 2009/10, largely financed by
grants and concessional loans.


A massive humanitarian relief effort was mounted within days after the 2009 tsunami
and attention is now shifting toward implementing a recovery framework that focuses
on maintaining access to basic health and education services, infrastructure
rehabilitation, resettlement, and investments in disaster risk reduction. Given the
poverty implications of the disaster, the framework is integrated with the Strategy for
the Development of Samoa (SDS) 2008–12, Samoa’s blue-print for poverty reduction
and growth.



A strong initial response from private overseas remittances and donor support,
including the Fund’s emergency assistance, have helped offset balance of payments
pressures so far, with official reserves rising by about US$16 million between
October 2009 and February 2010 to US$130 million (4 months of prospective import
cover).
III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS

8.
As a result of the tsunami, real GDP is expected to contract about 3 percent this
financial year and the current account deficit is set to widen substantially.


The tourism sector, including small beach fales (typical for Samoa), has been
severely hit. Based on cross-country recovery experience and Samoa-specific patterns
of tourism demand, staff estimates that about 1½–3½ percent of GDP could be lost in
the first year after the tsunami.1 Beyond tourism, the widespread damage to physical
infrastructure implies that other key sectors such as commerce, transport, and
communication are also directly hit.



However, with economic activity returning to normal and infrastructure rehabilitation
spending providing a further boost, growth could increase significantly in 2010/11
before converging to potential (Table 2).



Shortfalls in tourism receipts and a sharp increase in capital goods and other imports
related to infrastructure rehabilitation would result in a widening of the current
account deficit to about 20 percent of GDP in 2009/10 and 2010/11 (Table 3).

mute undue inflation pressures from tsunami-related public and private spending.

9.

This outlook is subject to considerable uncertainty.



First, this relates to the unprecedented scale of the damage. At this early stage of
reconstruction, unanticipated bottlenecks or adverse spillovers between different
sectors (e.g., infrastructure rehabilitation and tourism) may emerge, making it
difficult to predict the recovery path.



Moreover, Samoa’s image as a safe tourist destination may have suffered, and it
remains exposed to natural disasters.



While the global recovery remains fragile, a stronger-than-anticipated recovery of
regional economies and a favorable response to upcoming international rugby and
other sporting events in Samoa could, however, result in stronger-than-anticipated
remittances and tourism revenue.



Moreover, the uncertainty surrounding this outlook is compounded by weaknesses in
Samoa’s national accounts. These may result in a potential for underestimating the
contribution of the tourism sector and an overstatement of manufacturing.2
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS: RETURNING TO SUSTAINED GROWTH

10.
Policy discussions focused on the need for strong and coordinated efforts at every
policy level to return Samoa to sustained growth: (1) the central role of fiscal management
in supporting the rebuilding effort while also maintaining public debt sustainability; (2)
prudent monetary and exchange-rate management to underpin a sound macroeconomic
framework; and (3) structural reform to make the private sector the engine of growth.

2

One important factor is that the 2000 benchmark surveys for the production-based national accounts are likely
outdated, resulting in underweight for those sectors that grew rapidly in recent years, such as tourism.

8
A. Fiscal Management: From Rebuilding to Maintaining Sustainability
11.
The fiscal challenges from emergency relief and rehabilitation are daunting. The
government has adopted an economic recovery framework for four years through 2012/13
with a fiscal cost of about US$100 million (18 percent of GDP). This not only includes
resettlement to safer areas and repair of infrastructure to allow access to basic social services,
but also provides for social safety nets, and investments in disaster risk reduction.
12.
The government is committed to minimize the fiscal burden and capacity risks
arising from rehabilitation and maintain

20



Securing concessional donor support and prioritizing spending plans. The government
has already identified 60 percent of the funding needs for the four-year recovery
framework in new grants and concessional financing. It has adopted a supplementary
budget for FY 2009/10, which covers a quarter of the recovery framework, is fully
funded by grants and concessional loans, and focuses on infrastructure that is key to
resuscitate growth, such as utilities and tourism, as well as basic social needs.



Returning to the public deficit target. A widening of the fiscal deficit to 10 percent of
GDP in FY 2009/10 and an average of 7 percent of GDP the following 3 years of
reconstruction is unavoidable (Table 4). However, in line with their debt strategy, the
authorities intend to reduce the fiscal deficit to less than 3 percent of GDP once tsunamirelated reconstruction is completed in 2013. This would stabilize the net present value of
public debt at about 40 percent of GDP––a comfortable level, providing room to absorb
future shocks (Supplement 1: Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis
2010).

13.
Despite indications of a favorable budget outturn, fiscal risks remain that will
require strong efforts to underpin the government’s commitment.


A better than initially budgeted outturn for the first half of FY 2009/10 will likely
curtail tsunami-related fiscal pressures in the near-term. Revenue performance has
been on target as tsunami-related import-duty exemptions were kept at a minimum

9
and car imports boomed after the road switch (from right to left in 2009).
Development spending under the initial budget has been delayed, reflecting capacity
constraints and a reprioritization of spending execution towards reconstruction under
the supplementary budget.

and the authorities agreed
1/ After carry over from 2009/10
that every effort should be
made to secure more grants and concessional loans in filling this gap. If the gap were
to be filled on non-concessional terms, the net present value of Samoa’s public debt
could increase by 5 percent of GDP over the current baseline. This would reduce
Samoa’s ability to absorb future shocks without risking an unsustainable debt burden.

14.
The authorities concurred with staff advice that existing medium-term
development spending plans should also be reviewed. In consultation with key donors, redirecting to the extent possible funds to rehabilitation would not only help close the
financing gap in outer years, but also mitigate capacity constraints in government
administration. Delays are becoming evident in the slow implementation of projects under
the initial 2009/10 budget. The staff emphasized that restraint on recurrent non-priority
expenditure and on any general public wage increase is also required.
15.
The authorities and staff agreed on the need to implement the government’s
public financial management reform plan. The team welcomed the recent improvements
in tax administration with revenue collection slightly better than budgeted and called for a
quick resolution of remaining income tax arrears. Likewise, timely application of the new
procurement guidelines designed with donor technical assistance will allow Samoa to adopt
international best practice and reduce the potential for wasteful spending.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy: Managing a Sound Framework
16.

The team supported the government’s commitment to the currency basket peg.



The basket peg regime remains credible. In spite of the severe shocks from the global
recession and tsunami, official reserves continued to increase and CPI inflation has
returned to low levels. At the same time, the tala exchange rate does not appear to be
out of line with fundamentals; although, in recent years, it has appreciated markedly

in real effective terms as the nominal effective rate has remained stable (Figure 2 and

would help avoid the need for undue fiscal tightening during the reconstruction
period.

17.
The current monetary stance with historically low policy interest rates is
appropriate, given the need to support the economic recovery. However, as the global
recovery gains traction and regional central banks withdraw monetary stimulus, the CBS
agreed with the team’s advice that it should in time move to a more neutral stance. A careful
balance will need to be struck between avoiding pressures on foreign exchange reserves from
negative interest-rate differentials and providing continued support to the economic recovery.
Although capital controls afford the CBS some influence over monetary conditions, the
benefits are limited. The mission noted that the pass-through of the CBS’ policy rate cuts since
August 2008 to commercial lending rates has been low by international standards owing to
structural impediments amplifying risk aversion of banks in the downturn (Figure 2).4
C. Structural Reform: Promoting Private-Sector Led Growth
18.
Over the past two decades, structural reforms have helped make Samoa a more
attractive place to do business. The team welcomed recent reforms to simplify company
formation and business registration processes that have lowered the overall cost of starting a

The CBS undertakes the review of the currency basket once a year, and there are no statutory requirements as
to the composition and the weights of the basket. The CBS can make single discretionary exchange-rate
adjustments of up to +/-2 percent against the currency basket without cabinet approval. While there is no formal
limit on the frequency of such adjustments, it is understood that the CBS would request cabinet approval for
larger ad-hoc adjustments.

new business by three quarters. However, further reforms to foster private-sector led
economic growth – a key goal of the Strategy for Development of Samoa – are needed to
help ensure sustainable economic growth.
19.
The team and the authorities broadly agreed that reforms to facilitate the
economic use of customary land and reduce the role of state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
in the economy would contribute significantly to a more vibrant private sector.
However, the authorities cautioned that any reform must be equitable and in keeping with
Samoa’s social and traditional values.


Use of customary land. The lack of clear legal title to customary land, which
accounts for about 80 percent of all land in Samoa and an inability to transfer
ownership inhibit its economic use (Box 2). The government has appropriately
focused on reforms to ease land registration. The passage of legislation to allow
banks to use capital improvements on leased customary land as collateral is also a
step in the right direction to improve investors’ access to credit. Continued
community outreach will be necessary to realize the full benefits of these reforms.
However, the team noted that legislation to cap the rise in the market value of
freehold land, which reflects its scarcity value, should be avoided. The authorities
broadly agreed with the need to pursue further land-use reforms, but emphasized that
they need to be carefully calibrated with maintaining Samoa’s cultural heritage and
social traditions.



SOE reform. SOEs are placing a significant strain on the Samoan economy and the
government’s budget (Box 3). The team welcomed the Prime Minister’s effort to
reinvigorate the reform agenda. In particular, further efforts need to be made to
enforce hard budget constraints and implement existing corporate governance
legislation including through more clearly defined community services obligations
(CSO) met by SOEs. The mission welcomed progress made in bringing selected
SOEs to privatization, including SamoaTel. The authorities agreed that, given that
existing public debt is on concessional terms, proceeds from the sale of SOEs should
go towards deficit reduction and filling the remaining tsunami-related fiscal financing
gap.

20.
A vibrant private sector will also require a deeper and sound financial system.
As the ratio of nonperforming loans has risen from 6 percent at end-2008 to over 8 percent at
end-2009, risk aversion of banks has been amplified by structural weaknesses that have
hampered credit intermediation and effective risk management (Table 5). Chief among them
are lingering uncertainties in the enforcement of land-related collateral and the lack of a
credit bureau. Given the urgency caused by the tsunami in improving access to credit, the
team supported the government’s subsidized loan program for small operators in the tourism

13
sector.5 However, the team emphasized and the authorities concurred that such schemes
should be strictly limited to avoid undue budgetary risks or distortions that hamper longerterm growth prospects. In addition, there was agreement that as the financial system evolves,
it will be important to further strengthen financial system supervision and regulation to better
gauge vulnerabilities of banks and nonbank financial institutions.
21.
Building on improvements in compilation and dissemination of key economic
statistics will serve to enhance policy credibility and reduce uncertainty for the private
sector. Samoa is the only Pacific island that disseminates monthly and quarterly economic
statistics through government websites. Yet data are subject to frequent revisions, owing to
weaknesses in compilation and coverage, complicating economic analysis. The team
welcomed the government’s use of technical assistance, including through PFTAC, and
noted that improvements to national accounts and the coverage of BOP data are priorities.

The program amounts to T5 million (½ percent of GDP). For further details see Selected Issues Paper “Samoa:
Impediments to Bank Intermediation and Monetary Transmission”.

BOX 1. SAMOA: EXCHANGE RATE ASSESSMENT
Excluding the impact of the tsunami,
the current account deficit appears to
be in line with Samoa’s structural
savings-investment norm. Once the
tsunami-related recovery is completed,
Samoa’s current account deficit is
projected to decline to about 9 percent of
GDP in 2013/14. While sensitive to
assumptions on key variables, such as
population growth, staff estimates based
on a sample of 55 low-income countries
suggest a savings-investment norm of
about 6–10 percent of GDP for Samoa.

Other indicators of a deviation of the exchange rate from medium-term fundamentals
do not point to a misalignment:


Foreign reserves rose steadily in recent years and are now about double their level just
four years ago. Staff project reserves to remain around 3½–4 months of imports of
goods and services at the end of this fiscal year.



Tourism receipts have risen at double-digit rates over the last several years in part due to
the introduction of new airline flights. They have become Samoa’s most important



The decline in fish exports (nearly
20 percent between 2007 and 2009) mainly reflects supply-side factors. Moreover,
although fish exports are the second most important commercial activity, they are only
equivalent to 4 percent of tourism earnings.



Remittances, which account for about 25 percent of GDP, have performed strongly over
the last several years, reaching an all time high in 2007/08. Importantly, remittances
have remained stable during the global financial crisis, and increased in the immediate
aftermath of the September 2009 tsunami, underscoring the role of remittances as a
shock absorber.

15
BOX 2. SAMOA: TAPPING THE ECONOMIC POTENTIAL OF CUSTOMARY LAND
The nature of land ownership in Samoa inhibits economic development. Customary
land, which is owned by extended families represented by their chiefs, accounts for
around 80 percent of Samoan land.1 The chiefs direct the use of the land, giving
entitlements to access land, although customary ownership rights flow from a mix of
titles and ancestral transfers. The land cannot be transferred outside a village or turned
into free hold land. As is the case in other Pacific island countries, establishing clear title
to the land is costly and time consuming. Leases are legally possible2, but are time
consuming and expensive to arrange.
The government recognizes that increasing access to customary land for
development is important and has undertaken legal and policy reforms to this end.3
In conjunction with a public outreach campaign, recent reforms have focused on
facilitating land registration. In addition, legislation passed in the last couple of years
allows banks to use leasehold improvements on customary land as collateral; however,
no bank has done so, largely because of the uncertainty associated with contract
enforcement.
Moreover, a new land registration system was introduced in March 2009, but less
than 10 percent of the land has been registered so far. This reflects the difficulty and
cost, in terms of time and money, in establishing title to land, which requires land owners
to advertise notice of intent to title property for three months and survey the land.
Disputes over land titling are handled through the Land and Titles Court and can take
years to resolve.
The pace of reform is likely to remain slow and deliberate. The government’s reform
effort is tempered by a desire to foster balanced and equitable growth and a respect for
Samoa’s traditional values and culture. In addition, the government’s commitment to
address a key impediment – the inalienable nature of customary land – is unclear.
Looking ahead, practical and likely politically feasible reforms the government could
consider are establishing a “one stop shop” for customary land matters, developing a
database of leased and leasable land and continuing its outreach efforts and
encouragement of land registration.
______________________________
1

The government owns 11 percent of the land through the several agencies, including the Samoa Land
Corporation, the Samoa Trust Estate Corporation, and the Land Board. The government seeks to increase
access to this land through issuing leases. The remaining 9 percent of the land is freehold.

2

Customary land can be leased for a 30 year period with an option to renew for another 30 years for hotel
development and a 20 year period with the option to renew for another 20 years for all other purposes. The
Ministry of Nature Resources and Environment (MNRE) assists landowners and potential investors in the
development of customary land, including the drafting of customary land leases.

The Asian Development Bank, through a Japanese trust fund, has recently supported technical assistance
in this area.

16

BOX 3. SAMOA: STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISE REFORM1
State-owned enterprises (SOEs) account for 10 percent of formal employment, but
constitute a drag on economic growth and the government's budget. For the nonstrategic SOEs that are available for privatization, the return on equity was just
3.3 percent for FY2007/08, compared with the government’s own target of 7 percent. In
addition to the direct costs to the economy, SOEs divert potential private and public
investment away from priority sectors. Ongoing SOE investment and foregone earnings
were equivalent to almost 60 percent of health and education expenditure during 2002–
06.
Despite previous achievements, Samoa’s SOE reform program has slowed since
2007. Privatization is continuing, albeit slowing with the removal of Agricultural Stores
Corporation from the privatization pipeline after it had received initial privatization
preparation support and the delays associated with the sale of Samoa Shipping Services.
The privatization of SamoaTel is currently targeted to be completed before the end of
2010. The combined book value of companies slated for privatization is about
T70 million (FY2007/08) or 4½ percent of GDP.
Regardless of ownership, the key to successful SOE reform in Samoa will be placing
SOEs on a fully commercial footing, with independence from political directives,
hard budget constraints, exposure to competition, and full accountability. A
functioning Community Service Obligation (CSO) framework is vital for the
commercialization of SOEs. However, the nature and magnitude of CSOs are not clearly
and transparently defined. The Public Bodies (Performance and Accountability) Act
enables SOEs to claim reimbursement from the Government for the cost of providing
CSOs approved under the provisions of the Act and Regulations. Those provisions,
however, are not enforced, resulting in conflicting interpretations of what constitutes a
CSO. This contributes to poor CSO management that depresses SOE profitability and
reduces their efficiency. SOEs do not currently have the capacity to prepare, or the
Government to effectively monitor, CSO contracts.
Existing corporate governance legislation is based on international good practice,
but implementation has been challenging. Only the reporting and disclosure
requirements are being fully met by the SOEs. Of the other regulations, as of end
FY2009, 121 out of the 270 positions available on SOE boards were held by public
servants and members of parliament, even though they are prohibited from serving as
directors of SOEs in line with good international practice. The implementation of
governance and accountability mechanisms will be key to putting SOEs on a commercial
footing and improving overall economic efficiency.

SAMOA
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 20101
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by Ray Brooks and Aasim Husain (IMF)
and Vikram Nehru and Sudarshan Gooptu (IDA)
April 22, 2010
Based on the low income country debt sustainability analysis (LIC DSA), Samoa remains at
low risk of debt distress.2 The overall assessment of debt distress is not substantively different
from the last joint DSA (IMF Country Report No. 07/185). Samoa’s external and public sector
debt remains sustainable even after significant borrowing to finance post-tsunami
reconstruction. The present value (PV) of external debt to GDP is projected to peak at
40 percent under the baseline scenario. This leaves a cushion relative to the policy-dependent
threshold of 50 percent for Samoa to absorb future shocks. Large worker remittance flows
equivalent to 25 percent of GDP provide a further cushion. However, it will remain important
for Samoa to continue seeking concessional financing. Borrowing on non-concessional terms
to finance reconstruction would significantly eat into the borrowing cushion.
I. BACKGROUND
1.
The external and public debt sustainability analyses are based on the standard
LIC DSA framework.3 The DSA presents the projected path of Samoa’s external- and

This DSA was prepared jointly with the World Bank, and in collaboration with the Asian Development Bank,
in accordance with the Debt Sustainability Framework for low-income countries approved by the Executive
Boards of the IMF and IDA. The debt data underlying this exercise were provided by the Samoan authorities.

Samoa is classified as a “strong performer” according to the three-year average of IDA’s Country Policy and
Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index under the joint IMF/IDA debt sustainability framework. The thresholds for
“strong performers” are: 50 percent for PV of debt to GDP; 200 percent for PV of debt to exports; 300 percent for
PV of debt to revenues; 25 percent debt service to exports; and 35 percent debt service to revenues.

public-sector debt burden indicators, and draws some conclusions on the forward-looking
sustainability of debt.
2.
Samoa’s pre-tsunami stock of external debt as of June 2009 was relatively low.
The stock of external debt was below 40 and 30 percent of GDP in nominal and present value
terms, respectively. Virtually all of Samoa’s public debt is external. The stock of domestic
public debt is small, around 2.3 percent of GDP in nominal terms composed mainly of stateowned enterprise debt for which the government has assumed responsibility. The government
has not issued any domestic debt since 2006. Contingent liabilities related to existing
guarantees on the state-owned enterprise (SOE)’s stock of debt amount to about 1.1 percent
of GDP in nominal terms. Together with interest-only guarantees on SOE debt, contingent
liabilities amount to about 1.2 percent of GDP on present value terms (Table 1a).
3.
Multilateral debt comprises the vast majority of the debt stock. The Asian
Development Bank is the largest creditor with claims amounting to 41 percent of Samoa’s
external debt stock. The largest bilateral creditor is China, which holds 16 percent of
Samoa’s external debt.
4.
Samoa pursues a sound public debt management strategy. Quantitative targets are
set to keep nominal net public debt at less than 40 percent of GDP and the government
actively seeks to borrow on concessional terms. In addition, a recent World Bank Debt
Management Performance Assessment identified a number of strengths particularly in the
areas of governance of debt and the overall debt management strategy. It also noted a few
areas that required further attention, including the need for a single Treasury account to
improve cash management.4
II. BASELINE SCENARIO
5.
The baseline scenario assumptions are presented in Box 1. The financing
requirement for the post-tsunami recovery framework leads to a sizeable buildup in the stock
of external debt over the near to medium term. This build up is incorporated into the baseline
scenario for the updated debt sustainability analysis and includes IMF financing provided in
December 2009 under the Exogenous Shocks Facility amounting to 3 percent of Samoa’s
external debt. Nonetheless, the debt ratios remain within their policy dependent thresholds
(50 percent of GDP for low risk of debt distress rating) under the baseline scenario. The
baseline also assumes that the authorities, as is their intention, approach donors to request
additional support in the form of grants and concessional loans to cover the projected
financing gaps.

Framework for Low-Income Countries” (http://www.imf.org/external/pp/longres.aspx?id=4419).

Debt Management Assessment Performance prepared by the World Bank (January 2010).

3
BOX 1. KEY ASSUMPTIONS
Real GDP growth: Real GDP is projected to contract about 3 percent in the first year
after the September 2009 tsunami, which severely hit the tourism sector. However, with
economic activity returning to normal and post-tsunami infrastructure rehabilitation
spending providing a further boost, GDP growth could converge quickly to its long-run
potential, which is assumed to be 3 percent, slightly below historical averages.
Inflation: The change in the average CPI is expected to decline to around zero percent y/y
at the end of FY 2009/10 on base effects from lower global food and commodity prices
and unusually strong food supply before returning towards its long-run average as
economic growth picks up in 2011 and beyond.
Fiscal balance: The government’s post-tsunami economic recovery framework for the
four years through 2012/13 has a fiscal cost of about 18 percent of GDP. As a result, the
fiscal deficit is projected to widen to 10 percent of GDP in FY 2009/10 and average
7 percent of GDP the following three years of reconstruction. However, the government
remains committed to reducing the fiscal deficit to less than three percent of GDP once
reconstruction is completed in 2013.
External sector: The non-interest current account deficit will also widen significantly in
FY 2009/10 on the back of tsunami-related reconstruction imports and a fall in tourism
receipts and remain elevated through 2013, when reconstruction is expected to be
completed. Net FDI inflows as a percent of GDP is assumed to grow very gradually to
7 percent of GDP at the end of the projection period, as the tourism sector develops
further and investment levels converge with those in other Pacific islands.
Financing flows: The government has secured donor commitments to finance tsunamirelated expenditures into FY 2010/11 and is committed to seeking concessional assistance
to finance the remainder of the economic recovery framework. Remittances remained
stable during the global financial crisis, and are expected to remain significant throughout
the projection period, growing in line with source countries’ income. No financing from
privatizations, commercial loans, or short-term loans is assumed throughout the period.

III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Baseline
6.
Under the baseline, Samoa’s external debt burden indicators remain below the
indicative thresholds, which is consistent with debt sustainability throughout the
projection period. The PV of external debt to GDP peaks at slightly over 40 percent in
2013 and then gradually falls to 25 percent in 2030 – well below Samoa’s policy-dependent

4
threshold level of 50 percent. The present value of debt to exports and debt service to exports
remain below their relevant thresholds. If remittances were added to the denominator for debt
service, the ratio would be well below 3.5 percent throughout the projection period compared
to a policy-dependent threshold for debt-service to exports of 25 percent. The baseline ratios
exceed those generated under a scenario where the key variables are set at their historical
averages because GDP and export growth under the baseline scenario are below their
historical averages.
7.
Relative to the last staff report on the authorities’ ESF/RAC request after the
2009 Tsunami (IMF Country Report No. 10/46) the external debt-to-GDP and external
debt-to-exports ratios differ only slightly. Specifically, the present value of external debt to
GDP is a little higher due to a lower projected nominal GDP growth, while the present value
of external debt to exports is somewhat lower because of a greater concentration of grant
financing in 2009 and 2010 than was assumed in IMF Country Report No. 10/46. In addition,
exports of services are projected to be slightly higher in FY2009/10 due to an unexpected
temporary increase in volunteer arrivals in the first quarter of the year and additional sporting
events (Table 2a).
8.
Under the various bound tests, the ratios remain manageable for the shocks
considered (Table 2b and Figure 1). The combination shock using one-half standard
deviation shocks for real GDP and export value growth and the U.S. dollar deflator is the
most extreme shock. Only the PV of debt-to-GDP peaks above its respective indicative
threshold of 50 percent before falling back below the threshold by 2020. If remittances are
included, the PV of debt-to-GDP-and-remittances ratio peaks above the lower modified
threshold of 45 percent for only four years before falling below the modified threshold in
2016 (Figure 3). All other indicators remain below, often by a wide margin, their thresholds.
Non-concessional borrowing
9.
Staff also made calculations in which the remaining tsunami-related financing gap
is filled on non-concessional terms. The main purpose of these calculations is to illustrate
that, notwithstanding a generally favorable debt outlook, the authorities’ commitment to only
seek concessional assistance to finance tsunami-related reconstruction is appropriate. Staff
assumed the authorities could borrow at 9.25 percent per annum for a term of five years,
similar to the terms on Senegal’s euro-bond issued in December 2009. The additional cost
associated with non-concessional borrowing would absorb a significant portion of the cushion
provided for borrowing in the event of a shock under the baseline scenario. Specifically, nonconcessional borrowing adds about five percentage points of GDP to the present value of
external debt to GDP relative to the baseline. This would leave a cushion of less than four
percent of GDP for additional borrowing in the event of shock before the present value of
external debt-to-GDP ratio would breach the policy-dependent threshold.

IV. FISCAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
10.
The baseline scenario for the updated public sector debt sustainability now
includes data on SOE debt. The government has guaranteed 12 SOE loans contracted with
the Samoa National Provident Fund and two commercial banks. The guarantees are
equivalent to about 3.2 percent of GDP. The creditors have exercised guarantees on four of
the loans and the government has assumed responsibility for servicing the loans. The rest
remain contingent liabilities of the government.
11.
Public sector debt under the baseline scenario5 also is sustainable and in line
with the authorities debt management strategy. The present value of public sector debt
relative to GDP briefly exceeds the government’s target of 40 percent of GDP during the
reconstruction period before falling below the target ceiling in 2015 (Table 1b and Figure 2).
Under this alternative scenario, in which the primary balance is held unchanged from 2010,
the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio breaches the policy-dependent threshold in 2014 and continues
to rise thereafter and the PV of debt-to-exports ratio follows a similar trajectory. This
highlights the need for the government to follow through on its commitment to reduce the
fiscal deficit to less than three percent of GDP once reconstruction is completed in 2013.
Under all other shock scenarios, the public debt ratios remain below their policy dependent
thresholds. 6
V. CONCLUSION
12.
Samoa remains at low risk of debt distress. Although the debt ratios will rise
significantly over the next three to four years as the government receives foreign financing to
recover from the 2009 tsunami, the debt outlook is expected to remain favorable, given a low
initial level of indebtedness, Samoa’s track record of prudent macroeconomic management,
and assuming the tourism sector returns to trend growth. As a result, the overall assessment
of debt distress is not substantively different from the last joint DSA (IMF Country Report
5
6

The fiscal baseline assumes that creditors do not exercise existing guarantees on SOE debt.

While the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio also exceeds its policy-dependent threshold initially due to a one-time real
deprecation, it follows a downward trajectory and drops below 50 percent of GDP in 2015.

6
No. 07/185). The present value (PV) of external debt to GDP is projected to peak at
40 percent under the baseline scenario. This leaves a cushion relative to the policy-dependent
threshold of 50 percent for Samoa to absorb future shocks. Even under the most extreme
stress test scenarios, most indicators of debt sustainability, except for the PV of debt-to-GDP
ratio, remain below their indicative thresholds, often by a wide margin. Large worker
remittance flows equivalent to 25 percent of GDP provide a further cushion. If these are
included, the PV of debt-to-GDP-and-remittances ratio remains below its lower modified
threshold under all alternative shocks considered except for a very temporary breach of the
threshold by a small margin in the combination shock. However, it will remain important for
Samoa to continue seeking concessional financing. Borrowing on non-concessional terms to
finance reconstruction would significantly eat into the borrowing cushion.

Sources: Samoan authorities; and staff estimates and projections.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same as
in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level
after the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

ANNEX II: SAMOA––RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of March 2010)

Since Samoa became a Bank member in June 1974, 16 IDA credits totaling over $99.7 million
have been committed. The Bank has also executed a range of trust fund financed activities.
Bank finance for Samoa has focused on supporting the successful reform efforts since the mid1990s. Investments have helped support critical infrastructure, the finance sector, agricultural
production, cyclone reconstruction, and health sector reform.
Samoa has an IDA-15 (FY09–FY11) allocation of $40 million. Samoa’s IDA-15 allocation was
more than doubled to respond to the devastating tsunami that occurred on September 29, 2009.

Infrastructure Asset Management Phase 2. The objective of this second-phase program
(approved December 2003, US$12.8 million plus additional finance of US$8 million and
significant trust fund support) to be carried out over a period of eight years is to enhance the
economic, environmental and social sustainability of transport and coastal infrastructure
assets, and to manage these assets, natural resources, and disaster risks through an effective
partnership with private sector stakeholders. The success of efforts to build private sector
contracting capacity––a central element of the program––was evident in the rapid and

Telecommunications and Postal Sector Reform. This project (approved December 2002,
US$4.5 million) assists Samoa to improve the performance of its telecommunications and
postal sectors by increasing competition and private sector participation; strengthening
institutional and regulatory capacities; and enhancing the provision of telecommunications
and postal services, particularly in rural areas. Effective competition in GSM mobile
services, achieved through the project, produced spectacular results. The number of overall
customers (GSM and fixed line) exceeds 110,000, which is a ten-fold increase from the
beginning of the project.
Health Sector. Through the Health Sector Management project (approved June 2008, IDA
US$5 million), the Bank is supporting government’s reform program aimed at promoting
preventative healthcare, and ensuring equitable access to a modern, effective, efficient health
service, delivered in close collaboration with the private sector. Implementation is within a
sector coordination framework, with Australia especially closely involved. Samoa is broadly
on track to meet health sector MDGs.

Three new activities are expected to be presented to the Board for consideration in May 2010:






DPL: A $20 million development policy credit to assist the government respond to the
global economic downturn and to finance post-tsunami reconstruction costs. This is
based on a policy matrix developed by the Government in collaboration with the World
Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and other key partners. Policy actions are focused
on: (i) addressing post-tsunami reconstruction needs, (ii) targeted support to the most
vulnerable, (iii) maintaining overall fiscal discipline, (iv) reducing the cost of doing
business and SOE reform, and (v) strengthening consultative processes with
stakeholders.
Transport: A $10 million investment to strengthen transport and infrastructure services
in tsunami affected areas, which will be implemente din conjunction with the current
successful SIAM2 operation.
Health: Additional financing of $3 million to assist in addressing pressures on the health
system emerging as a result of the tsunami.

In addition, the Samoan Government has requested support from the Bank to undertake reforms
to strengthen the competitiveness of the agricultural sector and to increase opportunities for the
private sector to access agricultural supply chains for export and for the tourist market.
IFC has been active in Samoa, particularly in the telecoms sector. IFC has invested US$18.5
million in Digicel, encouraging this new private operator to enter the liberalized Samoan
telecoms market. This has been a crucial element in the successes achieved in improving
connectivity in Samoa. IFC investments have encouraged over US$80 million in total private
investment in the telecoms sector, making this the largest single private investment in Samoa.
In support of a significantly scaled up program, the Bank in November 2009 opened a joint
liaison office in Samoa, in conjunction with the Asian Development Bank.

ANNEX III: SAMOA––RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK1
The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) operations in Samoa started in 1969. Up to the end of
2009, 33 loans totaling US$159.4 million for 30 projects and technical assistance totaling
US$28.68 million for 87 projects have been provided.
The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2008–12 for Samoa focuses on poverty reduction with
three pillars for intervention: (i) removal of infrastructure constraints, (ii) improvement of access
and delivery of public services, and (iii) promotion of private sector development. The CPS
builds on a coordinated strategy with the other main development partners, and acknowledges
lessons from the past, by focusing on sectors where AsDB has strong comparative advantage,
particularly power; water, sanitation, and drainage; and private sector development.
A Power Sector Expansion Project was approved in 2007, with Japan Bank for International
Cooperation and Government of Australia co-financing, for a total amount of US$88 million.
AsDB’s approved ADF lending for this project is US$26.61 million. Two TA grants were
approved in 2009 for a total of US$1.6 million, comprising a project preparatory TA for
improved delivery of water supply, sanitation, and drainage services to residents of Greater Apia
and a capacity development TA in support of the improved use of customary land. A US$1.00
million grant has been provided for immediate tsunami relief in October 2009.
Most recently, in April 2010 the Economic Recovery Support Program (totalling US$26.8
million) was approved and loan funds from subprogram 1 (US$16 million) are expected to be
disbursed by May 2010.

ANNEX IV. SAMOA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. Core economic and monetary data are
updated regularly and published on official websites. However, balance of payments data are
limited and subject to frequent revisions while expenditure-based national account data are
under development.
Samoa participated in the Pacific Regional General Data Dissemination System (GDDS)
Project in November 2003. The metadata is undergoing review prior to web-posting
consultations with country authorities. On-going technical assistance missions have been
provided by STA and PFTAC to improve national account statistics and financial sector
indicators. The standardized report forms (SRFs) for reporting monetary data to the IMF and
an integrated monetary database became effective in January 2009.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Samoa
On May 17, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Samoa.1
Background
After more than a decade of strong economic performance, the global recession and 2009
tsunami dealt Samoa major setbacks. Real per-capita income growth since the mid-1990s has
been significantly higher than for most comparator countries. Prudent fiscal and monetary
policies and structural reforms underpinned this performance. However, the global recession
hit parts of the economy severely, notably manufacturing. In addition, construction also
recorded a significant decline, in part reflecting the unwinding of activity related to the South
Pacific Games, while agriculture and fishing suffered from poor harvests. As a result, real GDP
fell 5 percent in FY 2008/09, recording the worst slump in two decades.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
Nevertheless, Samoa’s external position remained comfortable. The current account deficit
narrowed in FY 2008/09 (on provisional data) as remittances and tourism receipts, Samoa’s
main foreign exchange earners, continued to grow. Official reserves remained stable, well
above the central bank’s target.
The tsunami in September 2009 caused human suffering and damage to physical
infrastructure, including tourism, of an unprecedented scale. Beyond the human cost, the
physical damage is estimated by the UNDP and the World Bank at US$60 million (over
10 percent of GDP), but the cost of infrastructure rehabilitation, strengthening social safety
nets, investing in disaster protection, resettlement, and lost tourism earnings is expected to be
significantly higher.
The authorities responded early in the global recession with monetary and fiscal stimulus. The
Central Bank of Samoa (CBS) has lowered policy rates (CBS securities overall rate) by nearly
500bps since mid 2008 to ¼ percent. The government also started to increase development
spending in 2008 and the pre-tsunami fiscal deficit was budgeted to double to over 10 percent
of GDP in FY 2009/10, largely financed by grants and concessional loans.
A massive humanitarian relief effort was mounted within days after the September 2009
tsunami and attention is now shifting toward implementing a recovery framework that focuses
on maintaining access to basic health and education services, infrastructure rehabilitation,
resettlement and investments in disaster risk reduction. Given the poverty implications of the
disaster, the framework is integrated with the Strategy for the Development of Samoa 2008–
12, Samoa’s blue-print for poverty reduction and growth.
A strong initial response from private overseas remittances and donor support, including the
Fund’s emergency assistance, have helped offset balance of payments pressures so far, with
official reserves rising to US$130 million at end February 2010 (4 months of prospective import
cover).
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They commended the
Samoan authorities for their swift response to a series of severe shocks, including the global
recession of 2008 and the September 2009 tsunami. They welcomed the adoption of a
comprehensive recovery plan, which would help safeguard the social and economic progress
achieved by Samoa in recent years. Directors noted, however, that Samoa’s prospects for a
quick recovery remain challenging and subject to considerable risks, given the scale of the
shocks, a still fragile global recovery, and the island’s susceptibility to natural disasters.

3
Directors commended the authorities for their prudent fiscal policy, which has significantly
strengthened the fiscal position in recent years, and welcomed their commitment to return to
their deficit target over the medium-term once tsunami-related reconstruction is completed.
They noted that stabilizing public debt at a comfortable level would be particularly important for
a small open economy, such as Samoa, that is vulnerable to external shocks.
They also noted that the significant fiscal cost of emergency relief and rehabilitation had
resulted in sharply higher fiscal deficits in the next few years. Directors supported the
prioritization of spending in the supplementary budget, which favors basic social services and
areas that are key to revive the economy, and were encouraged by the progress made in
securing concessional donor support. To further reduce fiscal risks and minimize remaining
tsunami-related financing needs, Directors recommended re-directing some development
spending under existing plans to tsunami-related infrastructure rehabilitation. Directors
underscored that timely implementation of the government’s public financial management
reform plan will also be important to ensure efficiency of spending.
Directors supported the authorities’ commitment to the exchange-rate basket peg as an
effective anchor of sound macroeconomic policies. They noted staff’s finding that the
exchange rate did not appear out of line with economic fundamentals. Directors stressed that
prudent monetary and exchange rate policy will be critical during the reconstruction period and
called on the CBS to remain vigilant in detecting early signs of balance of payments pressures.
The authorities should stand ready to make exchange-rate adjustments as necessary, and
raise policy interest rates to a more neutral level as the domestic recovery gains traction and
regional central banks withdraw stimulus.
Directors also encouraged further structural reform to enhance prospects for private sector-led
growth, including by building on recent progress in state-owned enterprise reform, and
increasing access to and economic use of customary land.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Hi-Su Lee, Executive Director for Samoa
and Benjamin Pereira, Alternate Executive Director
May 17, 2010
Background
1. Our Samoan authorities wish to express their appreciation to the staff for the
cordiality and frankness which characterized these consultations. The consultations
provided a timely opportunity for our authorities to take stock of the progress made in
recent years under the Strategy for the Development of Samoa (SDS) 2008/092011/12 and in the wake of the 2009 tsunami which has greatly affected this small
island nation and led to the granting of the ESF-RAC facility late last year. The
authorities considered the exchange of views on key policy issues to be useful in
supporting their ongoing efforts to preserve macroeconomic stability and to ensure
long term growth. They continue to value the Fund’s assessment of Samoa’s policies
through the Article IV consultation process and given the global risks we currently
face, they welcome the next Article IV consultation in 24 months time.
2. Samoa’s performance has been supported by prudent economic and financial
management and the effective implementation of structural reforms over the past
decades resulting in real per capita income in excess of $US 3,000 p.a. This
achievement was underpinned by political stability and the extensive efforts to foster
broad consensus for important reforms.
3. As a small island state, Samoa continues to be vulnerable to risks from its small size
and population, geographic remoteness, narrow production base, vulnerability to
terms of trade fluctuations and susceptibility to natural disasters. Given these
vulnerabilities and risks, Samoa registered its worst slump for two decades – a
4.9 percent fall in GDP over 2008-2009 – as a result of the global crisis, and the poor
harvests in agriculture and fishing. The effects of the September 2009 tsunami
undercut the prospects of a quick recovery from the global recession and saddled
Samoa with massive private and public sector rebuilding costs. Accordingly, our
Samoan authorities remain committed to continuing with a framework of prudent
macroeconomic policies as well as a progressive structural reform agenda for longerterm sustainable growth.
Recent Economic Developments
4. The latest real GDP statistics – for the year to December 2009 – showed a contraction
of 1.8 percent over the corresponding 2008 period. As set out in the staff report, the
medium-term prospects for Samoa remain sound and supported by the services sector
based on tourism recovery, the implementation of the tsunami rehabilitation work
program, and a brighter global outlook.

5. Core inflation indicated a decline in prices of 2.7 percent in February 2010 over the
same period last year. Staff estimates headline inflation to increase to 3.0 percent in
2010/11 and 4.0 percent thereafter as tsunami rehabilitation efforts intensify and
global recovery resumes.
6. These developments are expected to underpin recovery in the external sector, and the
official reserve cover is likely to remain at 3.5 months of imports in the medium term.
Gross external debt is expected to rise from 52.4 percent of GDP in 2009/10 to
58.3 percent in 2013/14 (38.1 percent in net present value terms). At this level, staff
and authorities believe that Samoa’s debt level will remain low risk.
Macroeconomic Policy
Fiscal Policy
7. Although our Samoan authorities remain committed to prudent fiscal policy, the
substantial fiscal requirements for the four-year tsunami recovery framework and the
fiscal stimulus to offset the global crisis derailed the meeting of the usual mediumterm fiscal target. The authorities’ main fiscal objective is for the budget deficit to
return to the medium term target of less than 3.0 percent as set out under the SDS
after the completion of the phased tsunami rehabilitation activities in 2013/14.
8. Our authorities welcome the finding in the Debt Sustainability Analysis that there is
low risk of debt distress. The authorities are cautious of the fiscal risks posed by the
remaining financing gap if it is not filled in a timely manner, and of the pressures on
debt sustainability that would come from meeting the financing gap using loans rather
than grants. Amid these risks, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank are
front loading budget support disbursements to negate the possibility of a financing
gap. The authorities have a retrospective budget reimbursement arrangement with
donors for funding tsunami rehabilitation activities, and this has allowed timely
implementation of the planned recovery work. The authorities also have the option to
effectively adjust the timing of the implementation of the current public sector
investment program consistent with their administrative and implementation capacity.
9. To cover for the remaining budget financing gap, driven by the tsunami rehabilitation
program, of 7.0 percent of GDP in total from 2010/11 onwards, the authorities will
intensify bilateral efforts to attract new grants from donors including the European
Union, Australia, New Zealand and other potential development partners. The
authorities also see merit in prompt publication of the staff report to further enhance
the prospects of future grants and concessional financing.

10. The Medium-Term Budget Framework has already been established with the first set
of forward estimates for 2009/10 – 2011/12 published. The authorities will reactivate
the Macroeconomic Policy Coordination Committee, which comprises of the Ministry
of Finance and Central Bank, and is to support the credibility of forward estimates.
The Public Finance Management Reform Plan (PFMRP) will also involve the
Ministry of Revenue to assess the need of further tax and customs reforms and the
PFMRP process and roles and responsibilities of institutions will be clearly
articulated.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
11. Our authorities remain strongly committed to the current pegged exchange rate basket
regime, which has served Samoa well in anchoring the nominal economy, resulting in
stable inflation and strong policy credibility. Despite the severe shocks from the
global recession and tsunami, staff found that the exchange rate is in line with
fundamentals with nominal exchange rate remaining stable while the real effective
rate markedly appreciated. The authorities’ view is that the Central Bank of Samoa’s
(CBS) discretion to adjust the exchange rate by +/- 2.0 percent against the currency
basket is crucial for avoiding undue fiscal tightening during the reconstruction period.
This exchange rate adjustment process is controlled by an internal accountability
process to ensure its effective and efficient use. The CBS will closely monitor the
process to ensure that the risks to the external position and inflationary pressures are
minimized. The CBS also stands ready to withdraw current monetary stimulus and
move to a neutral stance as the global recovery gains traction.
12. The Samoan authorities are grateful for the staff’s assessment as set out in the
Selected Issues paper on the effectiveness of the credit channel and monetary
transmission. The low degree of pass-through explains in part the authorities’ one-off
subsidized loan program to small operators in the tourism sector to aid tsunami
recovery. Looking beyond the immediate term, the CBS will carefully consider staff
recommendations for financial sector development and strengthening oversight and
regulation of financial institutions and the system. The authorities also look forward
to future engagement with staff on policy steps that might be taken to support
development in the financial sector.
13. The Fund financing under the 2009 ESF-RAC was used to bolster official reserves as
remittances fell short of their annual growth trend. Our authorities agree that,
consistent with price and exchange rate stability, it would be prudent to maintain the
reserve cover in the range of 3.5 - 4.0 months of imports in the medium term.

Structural Reforms
14. Consistent with the SDS and the strategy to make the private sector the engine of
growth, the Samoan authorities have made varying degrees of progress in its
structural reform agenda since the last Article IV consultation as follows.
Economic Use of Land
15. The Samoan authorities together with the Asian Development Bank assistance have
delicately progressed the land reform program despite its sensitivities and some
public opposition. The main objectives of the land reform are easing the lease of
customary land and for the land lease agreements to be able to serve as collateral for
borrowing. Public communication about the land reform will be fundamental to
gaining community support and its ultimate success.
16. To date, the authorities have changed the land registration system and supported
progress on the land reform through a necessary land legislation amendment. The
authorities note that staff’s practical recommendations in Box 2 are consistent with
their proposed strategy on this issue. The confidence of the banks in the process of
using lease agreement as financial collateral will be crucial to this development. The
introduction of the Strata Titles in 2009 will provide more flexibility in terms of
common ownership of a building on leased land with the purpose of attracting foreign
investment.
State-Owned Enterprises
17. The authorities concur with staff that successful SOE reform will require placing
SOEs on a fully commercial footing, with independence from political directives,
hard budget constraints, exposure to competition, and full accountability. Consistent
with good international practices, a Cabinet appointed committee is currently
reviewing the feasibility of the Cabinet decision to remove all civil and public
servants from SOEs’ Boards by 1 July 2010. The review will consider the limited
pool of directors available for Board selection and will likely involve a substantial
contribution from the Institute of Directors in preparing new directors for their Board
roles and responsibilities. Also under preparation is the establishment and the
designing of a mechanism for creating unit trusts to assist in diversifying ownership
of privatized SOEs when the momentum picks up. The authorities are also committed
to enforce the Community Service Obligation (CSO) through improving SOEs’ CSO
awareness and ensuring effective implementation and enforcement of the CSO.

18. On privatization efforts, our authorities recognize that progress has been slow but are
of the view that the delay has been fitting given the adverse effects of the global crisis
on the attainable prices of SOEs for divestment/privatization. To move forward, the
privatization of SamoaTel is on the card with proceeds from sale to provide for fiscal
space.
Agriculture Development
19. The efforts in agricultural development have been focusing on activities such as the
National Export Strategy in 2009 to promote agricultural-based export commodities
and import substitutions, the strategy on fruit and vegetables sub-sector, and research
on agricultural processing, in the absence of a holistic and encompassing sector
planning framework to underpin all these efforts. Therefore, the proposed formulation
of a sector plan which is on the pipeline will provide the framework to encapsulate
agricultural policies and strategies critical for resource allocation in this sector. The
timely assistance from the World Bank will concentrate on the implementation of
policy requirements and the required strategies for revitalizing this key sector and
identifying Samoa's comparative advantage.
Economic Statistics
20. As staff noted, Samoa is the only Pacific island that disseminates monthly and
quarterly economic statistics through government website. This was only possible
through substantial investments in its statistics officers through continuous training
from the Fund Training institutions, provision of technical assistances from the
Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Cooperation, and the Secretariat of the Pacific
Community. The authorities understand the merit of timely and reliable economic
statistics, hence the proposed investment to strengthen the capacity and capability of
the Bureau of Statistics, including according high priority to improvements to
national accounts and the coverage of BOP data.
