GRENADA
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation with Grenada
Approved by José Fajgenbaum (WHD) and Matthew Fisher (PDR)
September 10, 2007
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background. Grenada’s economy has rebounded after the devastating impact of Hurricanes Ivan and
Emily, with the recovery centered on reconstruction and 2007 Cricket World Cup preparations. The
economic outlook is favorable, as several major tourism investment projects get underway. Inflation has
been subdued. Fiscal performance, however, has been much weaker than programmed in 2006−07, owing
to capital expenditure overruns. Public debt reached 125 percent of GDP at end−2006, leaving little room
for maneuver in the event of exogenous shocks.
Fund relations. The last Article IV consultation was concluded in July 2005. On April 17, 2006, the
Executive Board approved a PRGF arrangement for 90 percent of quota. The program went off track
relatively soon thereafter, owing to fiscal slippages, the slow pace of structural reforms, and the need to
address the longstanding issue of an unregulated bank. The 2007 Article IV consultation had been delayed
while discussions focused on measures needed to complete the PRGF review.
Discussions centered on the key challenges, progress with which could revitalize the PRGF program:
• Restoring fiscal and debt sustainability. The authorities recognized that corrective action was needed to
compensate for the recent fiscal slippages. But the high debt levels call for an even stronger fiscal effort,
including the use of all divestment proceeds to pay down expensive debt rather than to finance capital
expenditure. This would allow the government to reach its debt-to-GDP target of 60 percent by 2017,
rather than 2025 under current policies. The authorities found it difficult to scale back capital expenditure
as much as recommended by staff, preferring to use half of divestment proceeds for project financing.
• Safeguarding financial sector stability. Grenada’s financial system weathered well the impact of the
hurricanes, and Grenada recently established a single regulatory agency to supervise nonbank financial
institutions. The authorities shared the mission’s concerns about the continued operation of an unregulated
bank and insurance companies’ deposit-taking activities. They are exploring options to supervise the bank,
and intend to conduct a thorough investigation of insurance companies’ activities.
• Managing vulnerabilities. The government has taken steps to mitigate the risk of natural disasters and
to diversify the economic base. Staff highlighted Grenada’s vulnerability arising from large government
and external financing needs over the foreseeable future.

• Reinvigorating the structural reform agenda. Critical reforms include addressing the issue of the
unregulated bank; improving the business environment to sustain competitiveness; reforming the tax
concessions regime (although the authorities no longer intend to fully eliminate tax holidays in light of
regional competition); introducing a VAT; strengthening the capacity to evaluate and prioritize capital
projects; enhancing tax administration; and developing a full-fledged Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS).

I. CONTEXT FOR DISCUSSIONS
A. Background
1.
In recent years, a series of exogenous shocks have buffeted Grenada, causing
sharp fluctuations in output and putting pressure on the fiscal accounts (Figure 1).
Hurricanes in 2004 and 2005 wreaked unprecedented damage (estimated at more than
200 percent of GDP), compounding the sharp dropoff in tourism after the September 11,
2001 attacks in the United States.
2.
Grenada’s public debt rose
sharply in this period. Initially, the
authorities tapped international capital
markets, nearly doubling public debt
ratios. Subsequently, the massive
destruction caused by the hurricanes
complicated the authorities’ nascent
efforts to tackle the large fiscal
imbalances. They recognized that public
debt was unsustainable and initiated a
collaborative debt restructuring.

3.
In 2006, the authorities launched a comprehensive medium-term economic
reform program, developed in consultation with civil society groups. Its key objectives
are sustained high economic growth, restoring fiscal and debt sustainability, reducing
vulnerabilities, and alleviating poverty.
4.
The Fund supported the authorities’ program with a PRGF arrangement
approved in April 2006, but the first review has not yet been completed.1 Large fiscal
slippages in 2006 (which have continued into this year) resulted in missing the performance
criterion on the central government primary balance by a substantial margin. The slow pace
of structural reforms also contributed to the delay with the review. Lack of action in
addressing the longstanding issue of an unregulated bank was another key factor. The
situation with the bank has been complicated by the bank’s lawsuit against the government
and the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), with the validity of the bank’s license in
contention and the resulting lack of clarity over supervisory authority.

While Grenada has been very receptive to the Fund’s policy advice,
implementation has been challenging. The authorities have actively sought Fund and
CARTAC technical assistance, particularly in the areas of tax policy, debt management,
statistics, and the financial sector regulatory framework. However, limited capacity
(e.g., staffing constraints, difficulties with intensive economic monitoring) and political
constraints contributed to implementation difficulties. In hindsight, the government also
viewed some aspects of the original PRGF program as being too ambitious.

B. Recent Developments and Outlook
7.

The economy has largely recovered following Hurricanes Ivan and Emily:
•

•

Economic activity has rebounded strongly, with annual real GDP growth averaging
7 percent during 2005–06, driven by reconstruction, preparations for the Cricket
World Cup (CWC), and revival of the tourism sector.
Inflationary pressures have dissipated.
After peaking at almost 6 percent at
end-2005 following a large adjustment
to domestic fuel prices, 12-month CPI
inflation declined to 2.5 percent by May
2007. Notwithstanding this sharp
decline in headline inflation, rising food
prices have led the government to use
moral suasion with importers of basic
food items to reduce their margins.

External developments have been driven by post-hurricane effects. Following a
spike in 2005 due to the post-hurricane construction boom, imports declined during
2006. Exports also fell, reflecting the depletion of nutmeg stocks and the long lead
time required for nutmeg production to recover. The current account deficit in 2006
improved slightly, with rising tourism receipts nearly offsetting the decline in
insurance payouts after 2005. The evolution of the current account in 2005–06
reflected the impact of the hurricanes, as indirect indicators suggest an improvement
in competitiveness (Figure 2). Foreign direct investment financed about 40 percent of
the current account deficit. During January–May 2007, stayover tourist arrivals grew
nearly 10 percent over the previous year, toward pre-hurricane levels. In the first
quarter of 2007, cocoa exports came back on line, while the value of other exports
remained broadly constant. With imports picking up and a decline in income and
transfers, the first quarter current account deficit widened slightly.

•

Monetary developments have
been favorable. Growth in
credit to the private sector,
which had declined sharply
after Hurricane Ivan, picked up
pace in 2006 and 2007. The
leading contributors to the rise
in credit were construction and
tourism, while loans to
agriculture fell.

1/ A spike in broad money growth in 2005 followed by a dip in 2006
reflected, respectively, insurance inflows for hurricane damage and
subsequent drawdowns to pay for reconstruction.

8.
Fiscal performance deteriorated markedly in 2006 (Figure 3). Tax collection was
lower than programmed during 2006, the result in part of negotiated revisions to the
parameters for the National Reconstruction Levy (NRL) (with a rate of 3 percent rather than
the planned 5 percent). At the same time, spending on goods and services was greater than
projected, reflecting higher utility costs and transfers to households. Government investment
reached 20 percent of GDP, about 5 percentage points higher than envisaged, on the back of
higher-than-expected costs for reconstruction and preparations for the CWC. These
expenditure overruns led to a primary deficit almost 7 percentage points of GDP higher than
targeted (measured on a below-the-line basis). The resulting deficit was financed through the
accumulation of domestic arrears (which they intend to clear, as soon as they have the
resources), a drawdown of deposits, and an increase in public debt that raised the debt-toGDP ratio from 120 percent at end-2005 to 125 percent by end-2006.

Data through the first half of 2007 indicate that fiscal slippages have continued.
Despite a substantial shortfall in grants relative to pledges, expenditures have not been kept
in check, with transfers higher than projected and capital spending outpacing grant
financing.2 The overall deficit during the first half of 2007 reached 2.2 percent of annual
GDP, compared with the revised program target of 1 percent for the whole of the year. This
deficit was financed primarily through overdrafts and the drawdown of deposits. In addition,
the government accumulated arrears amounting to EC$20.3 million on unrestructured
domestic debt to the nonbank public due on June 30.3
10.

Implementation of the authorities’ structural reform program has been uneven:
•

with solid progress in the implementation of fiscal measures. The politicallydifficult NRL came into effect in early 2006. An automatic fuel pricing mechanism
was adopted in October 2006 to protect revenues from oil price fluctuations. The
collection of tax arrears is being strengthened. Publication of information on tax
concessions has begun. Work towards the implementation of a VAT is proceeding,
with the authorities aiming for introduction in early 2008.

•

and important steps toward reducing vulnerabilities. Grenada recently established a
single regulatory agency—Grenada Authority for the Regulation of Financial
Institutions (GARFIN)—to strengthen supervision over the nonbank financial sector.
To mitigate the risk of further natural disasters, Grenada signed up for the World
Bank’s Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) and is taking steps
toward giving the Building Code force of law.

but with delays in advancing

only three have been met, two

tax holidays, based on their experience negotiating with several large investors. The
benchmarks on legislative action regarding tax concessions will only be met by end2007, and in modified form. An agreement with trade unions on the public service
wage path is yet to be reached, reflecting trade unions’ skepticism about the accuracy
of official inflation data. Resolving the issue of the unregulated bank remains
outstanding (see ¶27). Other reforms—from public sector modernization to the onestop shop for investors—have been delayed, mainly reflecting capacity constraints.
11.
The economic outlook is favorable. Boosted by the initiation of several major
upscale tourism projects and the continued gradual recovery of agriculture, real GDP is
projected to grow at 3 percent in 2007 and 4 percent thereafter. The investment projects are
expected to generate significant spillover effects on the broader economy, including
increased employment; linkages with the agricultural and other sectors; and substantial oneoff financial resources for the government in the form of land transfer taxes and proceeds
from land sales. The effects are already being felt, with land prices having doubled in parts of
Grenada over the past year.
12.
The political environment for reform remains challenging, as the government
has a one-vote majority in the Parliament. Although elections are not due until
February 2009, there is speculation that the government might call an early election. The
political cycle appears to be in full swing, complicating the prospects for fiscal adjustment
and other structural reforms.
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS 4
Discussions centered on the key macroeconomic challenges facing Grenada: restoring fiscal
and debt sustainability, safeguarding financial sector stability, managing vulnerabilities, and
enhancing competitiveness to underpin growth.
A. Restoring Fiscal and Debt Sustainability
13.
The overarching objective of the government’s reform program is to restore
fiscal and debt sustainability. The government’s highly successful debt restructuring (now
largely complete) has resulted in substantial debt service savings (Box 1). Furthermore, as
4

Staff visited St. George’s on four occasions from September 2006 through April 2007, with the aim of
completing the First Review Under the PRGF. The authorities then agreed to proceed with the 2007 Article IV
discussions during July 11–17, 2007. The missions met with Prime Minister Mitchell, senior government
officials, the opposition, trade unions, and representatives of the banking and business communities. The team
included Nancy Wagner (Head), Pablo Druck, and Hunter Monroe (all WHD), with José Fajgenbaum (WHD),
David Hofman (PDR), Thordur Olafsson (MCM), and Moni SenGupta (LEG) participating in some missions.
Paul Jenkins (OED) joined the final discussions.

11
noted above, a number of structural measures have been implemented to address the difficult
fiscal situation. However, the government’s plan to halve the debt-to-GDP ratio to 60 percent
(the ECCB’s established benchmark) by 2015 has been set back by the large fiscal slippages
in 2006 and 2007. In light of emerging shortfalls in pledged grants, implementing the capital
program for 2007 as budgeted would imply an overall fiscal deficit of 7½ percent of GDP.

Box 1. Status of Debt Restructuring
Commercial debt
Progress to date. A highly successful debt exchange was undertaken in November 2005. Overall
participation reached 91 percent of eligible debt, or about US$237 million (about 40 percent of total
public debt). The restructuring involved a net-present-value reduction of 40–45 percent (using a
9 percent discount rate), for exit yields in the 9–10 percent range, and reduced debt servicing costs by
83 percent during 2005–08.
Outstanding issues. The authorities are making good faith efforts to find and engage the
nonparticipating creditors. They have offered to one of them, holding about 5 percent of the eligible
debt, a settlement on the same terms as the debt-exchange participants received. They are inviting
remaining creditors to come forward.
Debt to official bilateral creditors
Progress to date. In May 2006, the Paris Club agreed to reduce debt service to Paris Club creditors by
more than 90 percent for the duration of the PRGF arrangement. The Paris Club also agreed in
principle to consider a further restructuring of Grenada’s debt, if needed, at the end of the PRGF
program. The authorities have signed bilateral agreements with Belgium, France, and the United

Outstanding issues. Under Paris Club rules, the rescheduling could be suspended if the first review
under the PRGF is not completed. For non-Paris Club creditors, agreement is yet to be reached,
including on the debt (and arrears) owed to Taiwan Province of China, Grenada’s largest bilateral
creditor. In March 2006, the Ex-Im Bank of Taiwan Province of China sued the Grenadian
Government in New York, and the authorities are seeking an amicable resolution.

The current debt sustainability analysis (DSA) indicates that Grenada is at high
risk of debt distress.5 Even a concerted effort to reduce debt would still leave the country
highly vulnerable to another external shock. Moreover, Grenada’s debt sustainability outlook

12
has deteriorated since the last DSA.6 While some of this deterioration is due to a change in
underlying assumptions,7 most is caused by the fiscal slippages of the last 12–18 months.
15.
The authorities recognized that corrective action was needed to address the
slippages. They explained that the expenditure overruns resulted from greater-thananticipated costs of reconstruction, combined with pressing development needs and CWC
preparations. As a corrective action, the government agreed to work closely with line
ministries to reprioritize capital projects, with the aim of substantially lowering capital
expenditure this year. They have also been trying to reach agreement with trade unions on a
public sector wage package which, although allowing for a real increase in wages, would still
reduce the wage bill as a percent of GDP over time. The authorities also expect substantial
divestment proceeds this year from the sales of land for prospective tourism projects and of
equity shares in some companies; they plan to use half of such proceeds to pay down
expensive debt and the remainder to finance their capital program. These measures taken
together should be sufficient to contain the overall deficit to about 3¼ percent of GDP this
year and the primary deficit (including grants) to about 1 percent of GDP.
16.
The mission stressed that Grenada’s high public debt leaves little room for
maneuver, reducing the country’s flexibility to respond to any future shocks. If another
strong hurricane were to strike, this could substantially delay the achievement of fiscal and
debt sustainability. Moreover, the recent reliance on unsustainable financing sources raises
the risk of disorderly adjustment and could further undermine the government’s financial
reputation.8 The mission, therefore, stressed the need to adopt the stronger policy framework
proposed in the active scenario discussed below. Such a stance would help unlock
disbursements of grants and concessional financing from the donor and creditor community,
including the European Union (EU)and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB).9

See IMF Country Report No. 06/277, Annex I, Medium-Term Outlook and Debt Sustainability.

7

The previous DSA included only half of guaranteed debt and assumed a discount rate of 9 percent. The current
DSA includes all guaranteed debt and assumes a discount rate of 5 percent, consistent with the Debt
Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries.

8

Standard and Poor’s downgraded Grenada’s credit rating from B- to CCC+ in April 2007, citing rising fiscal
pressures and lack of payments discipline, including arrears (since cleared) to domestic commercial banks. In
August 2007, the rating agency reversed the downgrade, owing to “measures taken in June 2007 to streamline
the government’s debt-payment mechanism,” noting that this “significantly reduced the risk of new intermittent
arrears.” These measures included a standing order with a bank to service government debt held by other banks
from the government’s deposit account.
9

For example, disbursement of the first tranche of the EU’s budget support (planned for 2007) is dependent
upon “overall satisfactory assessment of Grenada’s macroeconomic framework, as verified by evidence
provided in an IMF assessment.”

under 9 percent of GDP, consistent
with the fact that reconstruction is largely completed, and to 8 percent thereafter, in line with
the historical average before the recent shocks. It would also require implementing some
additional revenue-enhancing measures over the medium term (e.g., an inflation adjustment
to the fuel surcharge); and keeping real wages and spending on transfers, goods, and services
constant over the medium term. The scenario assumes that all divestment proceeds would be
used to clear arrears and pay down expensive debt, rather than to finance additional
budgetary expenditures. This would prevent the erosion of the government’s net asset
position, as the reduction of its assets would be fully offset by the reduction in liabilities. In
contrast, with the baseline scenario using current fiscal plans (Tables 2a, 2b and Box 1 in the
supplemental DSA), the targeted debt ratio of 60 percent is only reached by 2025.

18.
In view of Grenada’s high debt levels, the authorities have chosen a conservative
approach to managing the concessional financing associated with the PetroCaribe
Agreement. They intend to use this financing judiciously, with a view to improve the debt
service profile, by investing the net present value of the future debt obligations in an

14
earmarked account and using only the remainder as financing for budgeted social programs
(thus replacing more expensive forms of budget financing). The mission supported this
approach, but advised that all associated expenditures be transparently recorded on budget
and that safeguards be put in place to ensure that the funds in the earmarked investment
account are used as planned. It also stressed the importance of seeking further technical
assistance to build up debt management capacity. The authorities concurred with staff’s
recommendations.
19.
The mission underscored the importance of strengthening public finance
management if the government is to achieve its fiscal goals. In particular, it encouraged
the government to enhance its capacity through intensive training in Public Sector Investment
Program (PSIP) techniques.10 Staff welcomed the steps toward strengthening fiscal oversight
by adopting new guidelines for extra-budgetary spending in June 2007, which require that all
requests for such spending be directed to the ministry of finance before submission to
Cabinet. In the context of adopting a ten-year National Strategic Plan, the authorities
expressed interest in moving toward multiyear budgeting, which the mission strongly
supported.

Corporate income tax yields

The authorities have revisited plans to stop granting tax holidays in light of
recent negotiations with top-tier investors. This experience indicated that, notwithstanding
the high cost of concessions to the budget, a unilateral elimination would place Grenada at a
strong disadvantage in the highly

should be done in a transparent,
nondiscretionary manner and only to qualifying projects above a sufficiently high threshold
so as to minimize the adverse impact on the fiscal accounts.
21.
The authorities plan to reassess the value of real estate for property tax
purposes. A substantial increase in property taxes is expected, given that property values
have not been adjusted since 1994. The authorities anticipate completion within two years.
10

In early 2007, the authorities received preliminary training from the CDB in such techniques.

15
The mission agreed with the authorities’ approach to increase property taxes in a stepwise
manner to smooth the transition to higher taxes.
22.
The mission commended the government for stepping up efforts to improve tax
collection and reform tax administration. Particularly important has been the creation in
early 2007 of a new unit in Inland Revenue to collect tax arrears, with the aim of collecting
about EC$18 million annually over the next few years. Reforms will focus first on the
implementation of the VAT, but will be broader reaching as well, particularly for Customs,
including the simplification of customs clearance and strengthening of audit capacity, risk
management, anti-smuggling, and fraud detection. Staff suggested that the authorities set a
firm timetable for carrying out the planned reforms.
23.
The authorities viewed the future VAT as the cornerstone of a more efficient and
effective tax system. The VAT (together with excise taxes) will replace the general
consumption tax and several nuisance taxes, with the chosen parameters based on revenueneutrality (in practice, however, the strengthened tax administration being put in place is
expected to imply some revenue enhancement). Although the authorities launched the White
Paper in January 2007, the VAT’s introduction is likely to be delayed into the first half of
2008 (from October 1, 2007). The mission encouraged the government to address the
business community’s uncertainty over the date of implementation and to avoid further
delays by pressing ahead with key actions, including recruiting and training of staff, passing
the VAT and excise legislation, and adopting transitional procedures for bonded warehouses.
24.
The authorities remain committed to reducing poverty and improving social
indicators. They agreed that expenditure priorities should be in line with the social
development agenda described in the country’s PRS, now under preparation. The
government has worked closely with donors to secure the resources necessary to build new
housing for those displaced after the hurricanes and to rebuild the health and education
infrastructure. Youth training and development are core components of the efforts to reduce
unemployment. The government also plans to maintain the initiatives put in place in 2006 to
cushion the impact of fuel price increases on vulnerable groups.
B. Safeguarding Financial Sector Stability
25.
Safeguarding the stability of the domestic financial sector has been a top priority
of the government. The authorities recognized that strong financial sector supervision
remains key to mitigating risks. Under GARFIN, the authorities have begun to step up
supervision of the broader financial sector and are continuing to benefit from CARTAC’s
assistance to strengthen the new agency’s capacity.

1/ Excluding the unregulated bank.

27.
The mission urged the authorities to address the longstanding issue of an
unregulated, fast-growing bank. Owing to a dispute over the validity of the bank’s license,
the ECCB does not supervise the bank and has kept it out of the formal clearing and
payments system. The mission strongly encouraged the authorities to find an approach,
consistent with Grenada’s legal framework, to supervise the bank and to conduct an
independent assessment to determine the bank’s financial condition. The authorities believed
that the bank’s operations posed risks to the rest of the financial sector, although they are
contained because other banks have tried to limit their linkages with this bank. The
authorities recognized the importance of having all financial institutions properly supervised
and are exploring options in this regard. Progress in this area would also be a key step toward
completing the First Review Under the PRGF program.

17
28.
The commencement of GARFIN’s operations in March 2007 has provided an
ideal opportunity to address some remaining gaps in the regulatory and supervisory
framework. The mission welcomed the authorities’ plans to make several crucial
amendments to the GARFIN Act to make it more effective. In this context, foreign exchange
trading services and micro-financing will be defined as money services business to bring
such activities under the supervision of GARFIN.11 With the new supervisory agency still in
its early stages of operation, the authorities recognized that capacity-building was crucial for
GARFIN to be able to fully carry out its responsibilities. Foreign exchange trading entities
can also pose a significant risk of money laundering/terrorism financing (ML/FT), especially
if they engage in funds-transfer services.
29.
The authorities are aiming to enact a new Insurance Act by December 2007. In
conjunction with GARFIN, the Act is expected to strengthen insurance supervision, improve
contract certainty, and better protect policyholders. The mission expressed concern about the
growing deposit-taking activities of insurance companies. Some of these companies are
offering fixed-term deposits with annual interest rates up to 9 percent per year, far in excess
of that offered by commercial banks, with the funds invested abroad. This activity has been
undermining the client base for the domestic commercial banking system, and their much
higher interest rates could indicate riskier investment activities on the part of the insurance
companies (of which depositors may not be fully aware). In addition, the growth in deposittaking increases the potential risk of ML/FT activity in insurance companies to a level not
dissimilar to that of banks and other deposit-taking entities. The mission welcomed
GARFIN’s plans to conduct a thorough investigation of insurance companies’ activities and
to determine, in coordination with the ECCB, whether banking licenses should be required.
C. Managing Vulnerabilities
30.
Grenada remains highly vulnerable to exogenous shocks. Grenada’s greatest
vulnerability stems from the possibility of another natural disaster. In the aftermath of the
hurricanes, some insurance companies have now expanded the “hurricane belt” to include
Grenada. The economy is also now more dependent on tourism than it was at the time of the
September 11 attacks as a result of the hurricanes’ destruction of nutmeg production
capacity. Grenada’s highly-open economy is also vulnerable to terms-of-trade shocks,
including movements in world fuel prices.

11

A recently-formed foreign exchange trading service has been claiming a risk-return profile more akin to a
pyramid scheme than a valid investment. Banks report that clients have even requested loans to invest with this
company. The mission supported GARFIN’s plans to obtain regulatory powers over this new type of financial
company, and to act promptly after a full investigation.

intended to provide
short-term liquidity support to the budget and not full insurance coverage, the mission
welcomed the government’s steps toward giving the Building Code force of law to prevent a
repeat of the damage caused by the recent hurricanes.

32.
Diversifying the economic base and increasing regional ties are other important
means to reduce Grenada’s vulnerability. The government has recently begun to
implement a newly-developed National Export Strategy with the aim of economic
diversification (e.g., moving toward higher value-added in the agricultural sector; marketing
local arts and crafts; broadening the basis for tourism beyond “sun, sand, and sea”). The
mission also encouraged the authorities to work toward continued external trade
liberalization within CARICOM. OECS members (including Grenada) approved a draft
treaty in May 2007 to establish an OECS Economic Union.
33.
In view of Grenada’s high susceptibility to shocks, the mission stressed that a
core element for mitigating risks is to prepare a detailed risk management plan. It
encouraged the government to develop such a plan, taking into consideration various
scenarios, including those related to natural disasters, financial sector instability, and trade
shocks. In addition, the mission recommended that the government create a contingency fund
of at least 1 percent of GDP, to be held in a deposit account with the ECCB as a cushion to
address any urgent, unanticipated liquidity needs.12
34.
A key vulnerability stems from large financing needs for the foreseeable future.
Owing to concerns about the government’s repayment capacity, some local market
12

This contingency fund is incorporated into the mission’s recommended active policy scenario, but not the
baseline scenario.

19
participants noted that they would not lend to the government at this point, even to rollover
debt. Rollover risk could be substantial for domestic debt, as outstanding treasury bills alone
amount to 5 percent of GDP.13 The mission, therefore, stressed the importance of rebuilding
the government’s financial reputation through strong fiscal adjustment. The mission also
highlighted the medium-term balance of payments vulnerabilities in the context of the high
public debt burden. In particular, given the expected decline in grants, the sizable current
account deficit (projected at 25 percent of GDP in 2007) implies that Grenada will become
increasingly dependent on large FDI inflows. Should these flows fail to materialize, growth
could suffer. This makes it all the more important that Grenada enhance its competitiveness
and ensure its reputation is not impaired by fiscal or financial difficulties.14
D. Enhancing Competitiveness
35.
In the highly competitive global environment, a key factor determining
Grenada’s growth prospects is its international competitiveness. Discussions focused on
the wide range of determinants of competitiveness, from relative pricing considerations (as
indicated by the real effective exchange rate (REER), for example)) to the broader climate
for investment.

competitiveness is currently not an
issue.15 Higher world fuel prices
account for the bulk of the adverse
movements in Grenada’s terms of
trade. Movements in the real effective

measures, have been favorable (Figure

1/ The shaded band around the equilibrium exchange rate represents ±1 standard

The rescheduling of external debt has minimized the short-term rollover risk.

14

While the ongoing repricing of credit is likely to make it more expensive for ECCU governments to borrow
on commercial terms, there has been only a weak link between emerging market spreads and spreads observed
on regional capital markets. See “Financial Integration in the Caribbean,” forthcoming Executive Board paper.
15

Grenada is a member of the ECCB, which manages monetary policy and the exchange system for its eight
members. The common currency, the Eastern Caribbean dollar, has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of
EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar since July 1976.

20
real exchange rate does not appear to be misaligned; staff analysis finds no statistically
significant deviation of the REER from its estimated equilibrium level.16 The mission
underscored, however, that fiscal consolidation will be important to support competitiveness
and the sustainability of the currency board arrangement.
37.
Improving Grenada’s business environment is also essential to sustain
competitiveness over the longer term. According to the World Bank’s 2007 “Doing
Business Indicators” report, Grenada ranks 73 out of 175 countries and does poorly amongst
Caribbean competitors (Figure 4). Moreover, on several indicators—enforcing contracts
(143), registering property (145), and closing a business (151)—Grenada scores in the
bottom quintile.
38.
The authorities are determined to push ahead with reforms to enhance the
investment climate. Many of the planned reforms have suffered delays; for example, efforts
to create a one-stop shop for investors ran into legal and technical problems, and resource
constraints hampered plans to facilitate land transactions through upgrading the land registry.
The newly-created ministry of economic development and planning—responsible for
overseeing many of the agencies involved with investment planning and approval—may
facilitate implementation of the reform agenda. The authorities have taken the World Bank
ratings very seriously and have already developed a detailed action plan, in consultation with
the business community, to address these weaknesses.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
The economy’s rebound since the devastation of the hurricanes has been
remarkable. This is a testament to the Grenadian people’s resilience, the donor and creditor
communities’ support and, not least, the government’s impressive efforts to revive the
economy, including the launching of a medium-term economic reform program in the
aftermath of the hurricanes.
40.
The government’s reform program rightly focuses on the key economic
challenges facing Grenada—fiscal and debt sustainability, durable high growth,
poverty alleviation, and vulnerabilities. The government has made progress in addressing
each of these areas: introducing politically-difficult but critical fiscal measures; working
closely with creditors to restructure the debt; mobilizing donor support to finance
reconstruction in 2005–06; initiating a wide range of structural reforms, with a unifying
theme of enhancing the investment environment and reducing vulnerabilities; securing
16

This assessment is based upon a time series model linking the REER to measures of Grenada’s fundamentals.

incorporate and register a new firm. It examines the procedures, time, and cost involved in launching
a commercial or industrial firm with up to 50 employees and start-up capital of 10 times the
economy’s per-capita gross national income.
4/ This topic examines the steps, time, and cost involved in registering property, assuming a
standardized case of an entrepreneur who wants to purchase land and a building in the largest
business city—already registered and free of title dispute.
5/ This topic looks at the efficiency of contract enforcement by following the evolution of a sale of
goods dispute and tracking the time, cost, and number of procedures involved from the moment the
plaintiff files the lawsuit until actual payment.
6/ This topic identifies weaknesses in existing bankruptcy laws and the main procedural and
administrative bottlenecks in the bankruptcy process.

investor commitments to major tourism projects; putting in place targeted social safety nets;
and undertaking work on a PRS to advance social development.
41.
Major challenges remain, however, with the DSA indicating that Grenada is at
high risk of debt distress. Fiscal slippages over the past year or so have gone against the
attempts to place debt on a sustainable trajectory. The resulting increase in debt has eroded
the room for maneuver in case of further natural disasters, trade shocks, or financial sector
instability. Moreover, current fiscal policies, if continued, would imply that the debt situation
would remain unsustainable.
42.
Fiscal consolidation remains the cornerstone underpinning debt sustainability. If
the government were to pursue a front-loaded fiscal adjustment, it could reach its targeted
debt ratio of 60 percent of GDP by 2017, still three years ahead of the ECCB’s target date for
ECCU members to achieve that ratio. An important element of this scenario is the use of the
expected substantial divestment proceeds from sales of land and shares this year to pay down
expensive debt, rather than to finance additional budgetary expenditures. In contrast, a
scenario based on current fiscal plans—including the use of half of all divestment proceeds to
finance capital expenditure in 2007—would imply that the targeted debt ratio would only be
reached by 2025, and with a weaker government net asset position.
43.
Enhancing public financial management will be critical to achieve the fiscal
goals. Crucially, there is a need to clear arrears as soon as possible and avoid further reliance
on unsustainable financing. A track record of budgetary discipline will be important to
bolster investor confidence and improve Grenada’s credit rating. Structural measures to
underpin fiscal consolidation include improving the efficiency of the tax system (supported
by a timely VAT introduction), enhancing the effectiveness of public spending, and
modernizing the public service. The authorities are taking steps to improve expenditure
control and strengthen capacity to screen and prioritize capital projects.
44.
Strengthening the health of the financial sector should be a top priority. The
issue of the unregulated bank should be addressed without delay. First steps would be to
conduct an independent assessment of the bank to determine its financial condition and find
an approach, consistent with the domestic legal framework, to supervise the bank. Regarding
the nonbank financial sector, the authorities are to be commended for strengthening their
supervisory framework, including plans to amend the GARFIN Act to address emerging risks
in the insurance sector and broaden regulatory coverage to new financial entities. Although
Grenada has a comprehensive AML/CFT framework in place, some of the recent financial
sector developments also underscore the importance of strengthening this framework’s
effectiveness to deal with potential risks of ML/FT activities.
45.
The government rightly places great emphasis on reducing vulnerabilities. The
authorities’ strategy to reduce natural disaster-related risks is welcome. It includes

23
strengthening Building Code enforcement, enacting a new Insurance Act, and participating in
the CCRIF. In light of Grenada’s heavy dependence on tourism, the government is also
aiming to diversify the economic base with the help of its National Export Strategy.
Bolstering the government’s financial reputation is also crucial to ensuring solid access to
credit markets and to continued FDI flows in light of large domestic and external financing
needs for the foreseeable future.
46.
External competitiveness does not currently appear to be an issue in Grenada.
The real effective exchange rate is at its lowest point in more than two decades, supported by
sustained low inflation and the EC dollar’s depreciation against the currencies of trading
partners. Indirect indicators, including tourism sector developments, also suggest the real
exchange rate level is broadly competitive. Looking ahead, however, fiscal consolidation will
be key to supporting competitiveness and the sustainability of the currency board
arrangement.
47.
The structural reform agenda needs to be advanced to maintain the growth
momentum and support competitiveness. Ultimately, the greatest challenge facing
Grenada is creating the conditions for strong, sustainable, private-sector-led growth in a
highly competitive global environment, which would also be key to addressing the social
agenda. Wide-ranging reforms—including setting up a one-stop shop for investors, reforming
the tax concessions regime, strengthening capacity to evaluate capital projects, and
developing a PRS—have been initiated, but the pace of implementation needs to be stepped
up to fully reap the benefits of these early efforts. With investors’ high level of interest in
Grenada at present, this is an opportune time to push through the reforms to improve the
business climate.
48.
Progress with fiscal consolidation, financial sector supervision (most crucially of
the unregulated bank), and the structural reform agenda would also set the stage for
moving forward with the first review under the PRGF program. Completing the review
could also unlock much-needed grants and concessional financing and facilitate continued
support from Paris Club creditors. This additional external support would reinforce the
authorities’ efforts to advance their homegrown economic program.
49.
While data provision is generally adequate for surveillance purposes, better
statistics are needed to support effective economic management. Significant
improvements in coverage and timeliness are needed to support policy analysis, policymaking, and informed public debate. Data that need strengthening include those for national
accounts, labor markets, tourism, balance of payments, debt, and public enterprises.
50.
Notwithstanding the above challenges, the economic outlook for Grenada is
favorable. Growth prospects are promising, as agriculture continues to recover and the new
tourism projects come on stream, raising Grenada’s profile as an upmarket tourist

24
destination. These developments, combined with progress with the government’s reform
objectives, should lay the foundation for strong, sustainable growth in the years ahead.
51.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place in accordance with
the July 15, 2002 decision on consultation cycles.

2/ Taxes on property include both property taxes and transfer taxes. Property taxes are expected to increase starting in 2008 due to the program to revalue

3/ The sharp drop in taxes on international transactions and the concurrent rise in taxes on domestic goods and services reflect the expected introduction
of the VAT in 2008.

1/ After debt restructuring in 2005.
2/ Taxes on property include both property taxes and transfer taxes. Property taxes are expected to increase starting in 2008 due to the program to revalue
real estate. Transfer taxes are expected to return to their recent historical trend after a jump in 2007 due to one-off sale of assets.
3/ The sharp drop in taxes on international transactions and the concurrent rise in taxes on domestic goods and services reflect the expected introduction
of the VAT in 2008.
4/ Difference between overall balance and identified financing.
5/ Includes debt of PetroCaribe Grenada Ltd.

ANNEX—SUMMARY OF APPENDICES
The full appendices to this report are issued as a supplement and can be viewed in CyberDocs on the Fund’s
intranet and on the secure extranet for Executive Directors and member officials.
Fund Relations
Grenada’s outstanding purchases amount to SDR 5.2 million, 44.59 percent of quota. Grenada is a member
of the ECCB, which manages monetary policy and the exchange system for its eight members. The common
currency, the Eastern Caribbean dollar, has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per
U.S. dollar since July 1976. Grenada has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and
maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions. The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on July 13,
2005 (IMF Country Report No. 05/290). CARTAC, MCM, and FAD have provided extensive technical
assistance.
Relations with the World Bank Group17
In September 2005, the Eastern Caribbean Sub-Region Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY 2006–09
was presented to the Board of the World Bank. The strategy supports the sub-region’s development agenda
through two main pillars: (1) stimulating growth and improving competitiveness; and (2) reducing
vulnerability, by promoting greater social inclusion and strengthening disaster risk management. There are
six active World Bank projects in Grenada for a net commitment of approximately US$42.35 million:
Telecommunications and ICT Development, Public Sector Modernization, Education Reform Project,
HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, the Hurricane Ivan Emergency Project, and the Caribbean Catastrophe
Risk Insurance Facility.
Relations with the Caribbean Development Bank18
Grenada continued to receive special financing from the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) for projects
intended to facilitate the recovery and reconstruction process; to build capacity; and to assist with poverty
reduction. The financing apportioned to Grenada incorporates a blend of the Bank’s Special Development
Funds (SDF) and ordinary capital resources, designed to yield a concessionary grant element of 35 percent.
The main activities include the Grenville Market Square Development Project, Project Management
Training, a Country Poverty Assessment, and physical infrastructure and housing.
Statistical Issues

Grenada participates in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). Although data
provision is sufficient for program monitoring, significant improvement is needed to facilitate
effective surveillance by addressing weakness in coverage, timeliness and frequency of data.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
GRENADA
Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the Staff of the International Monetary Fund
In consultation with the World Bank Staff
September 10, 2007
Grenada’s debt sustainability outlook has deteriorated since the last debt sustainability
analysis (DSA),1 with fiscal slippages in 2006–07 a major contributor. Based on Grenada’s
2004–06 average Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA)2 rating of “medium,”
Grenada exceeds the thresholds for the ratio of the net present value (NPV) of external debt
to GDP and to exports (but not other thresholds). Even under an active fiscal adjustment
scenario (as outlined in the accompanying staff report), the ratio of the NPV of external debt
to GDP will remain above the threshold until 2018, and the authorities’ target of 60 percent
for the ratio of nominal public debt to GDP could only be achieved by 2017. Thus, Grenada
is at high risk of debt distress.
I. CONTEXT
1.
Grenada’s economy has rebounded strongly following Hurricanes Ivan and
Emily. Reconstruction is now largely completed, and the economic outlook is favorable, as
several major tourism investment projects get underway. Real GDP growth averaged
7 percent a year during 2005–06 and is projected at 3 percent in 2007 and 4 percent
thereafter, reflecting a further strengthening of tourism and the recent initiation of several
major tourism projects. Twelve-month CPI inflation, after peaking at almost 6 percent at end2005 following a large adjustment to domestic fuel prices, fell to 2.5 percent in May 2007.
2.
In the aftermath of the hurricanes, the Grenadian authorities recognized that
their public sector debt was unsustainable and undertook a collaborative debt
restructuring.
¾

A highly successful exchange for commercial debt was concluded in November
2005. Overall participation reached 91 percent of eligible debt, or about
US$237 million (about 40 percent of total public debt). The restructuring involved a

reduction of 40–45 percent in net present value terms, for exit yields in the
9-10 percent range, and reduced debt servicing costs by 83 percent during 2005–08.
¾

For official debt, a Paris Club agreement was reached in May 2006.3 This reduces
debt service to Paris Club creditors by more than 90 percent through 2008. For nonParis Club creditors, agreement has not yet been reached with the Taiwan Province of
China, Grenada’s largest bilateral creditor (with a quarter of all official bilateral debt).
II. UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS

3.
The baseline scenario is based upon the government’s current fiscal policies. The
main assumptions of the DSA are described in Box 1.
Box 1. Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions (2007–27)

3

•

Real GDP growth after 2007 is projected at 4 percent per year, slightly above the
historical average of 3.6 percent and consistent with the previous DSA. In the near term,
this growth projection appears realistic given the recent sharp increase in investor interest;
the strong growth in Grenada’s largest private employer, St. George’s University; and the
gradual recovery of the agricultural sector. In the longer run, the projection assumes that
the authorities undertake the structural reforms needed to sustain growth.

•

Inflation is projected to remain low, at 2 percent per year, consistent with historical
averages.

•

The primary balance of the central government improves from the historical deficit of
2.2 percent to a surplus of about 2 percent, reflecting the authorities’ commitment to limit
capital expenditure to 8 percent of GDP.

•

Grants decline from high post-hurricane levels to 1 percent of GDP, and the interest rate
on new borrowing increases from 2 percent through 2010 to 7 percent by 2020, as
concessional financing tapers off; with a discount rate of 5 percent this implies a negative
grant element for new borrowing in later years. The projection assumes that Grenada
receives concessional financing under the PetroCaribe initiative during 2007–11 (see
below), and that the grant element is used to finance budgeted programs, replacing more
expensive forms of budget financing. The interest rate on debt restructured in 2005
increases from 1 percent through 2008 to 9 percent by 2019.

•

The current account deficit is assumed to narrow over time due to strong growth in
tourism and a falloff in imports from high post-hurricane levels; the deficit is increasingly
financed by foreign investment.

Under Paris Club rules, the rescheduling could be suspended if the first review under the PRGF is not
completed.

38

III. EVALUATION OF PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Grenada’s public debt as of end-2006
4.
As of end-2006, Grenada’s public sector debt stood at 125 percent of GDP.
External debt accounted for 69 percent of total debt (Table 1), almost all owed by the central
government. Commercial debt accounted for about one-half of external debt, and multilateral
debt, mostly from the Caribbean Development Bank, accounted for another one-third, with
the remainder owed to bilateral and non-Paris Club creditors. In NPV terms, public sector
debt stood at 114 percent of GDP, reflecting the concessional element of multilateral and
restructured debt. As noted above, the restructuring of Grenada’s commercial debt implied a
reduction of 40–45 percent on the NPV of future debt servicing flows. As with the previous
DSA, this calculation assumes that the bilateral debt to non-Paris Club creditors is
restructured on terms comparable to those of the commercial debt exchange.
The baseline (current policies) scenario
5.
Grenada’s debt sustainability outlook has deteriorated since the last DSA, in
large part due to fiscal slippages in 2006–07.4 Public sector debt increased by 5 percentage
points of GDP during 2006 to 125 percent of GDP (Table A1a), rather than falling as
anticipated in the previous DSA. The authorities’ nominal debt target of 60 percent of GDP
will now be achieved by 2025 under the baseline (current policies) projection rather than in
2015 in the previous DSA. The NPV of debt falls to 57 percent of GDP by 2027 (Figure 1),
slightly higher than the nominal debt ratio, reflecting commercial debt at interest rates above
the discount rate of 5 percent. The public sector debt-to-revenue ratio falls from 301 percent
in 2006 to 139 percent in 2027. By contrast, the debt service-to-revenue ratio would increase
from 9.9 percent in 2006 to 11.5 percent in 2027, reflecting declining concessionality, with a
ratio of 21–24 percent during 2021–25 as restructured debt amortizes.5
6.
The baseline projection incorporates debt accumulated under the PetroCaribe
Agreement during 2007–11. Based on current oil prices, this agreement would provide
concessional financing of about 0.3 percent of GDP in 2007, increasing to an annual average
of about 1.4 percent of GDP.6 The financing terms are highly concessional, with an interest
4

Some key underlying assumptions have also changed, contributing to the deterioration in the debt
sustainability outlook. The previous DSA included only half of guaranteed debt and assumed a discount rate of
9 percent. Consistent with the Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries, the current DSA
includes all guaranteed debt and assumes a discount rate of 5 percent.

5

The high level of debt service in 2007 incorporates the clearance of domestic expenditure arrears, which were
2.8 percent of GDP at end-2006.
6

The PetroCaribe Agreement finances 40 percent of oil imports (up to a ceiling) when the international price of
oil is between US$50 and US$90 per barrel. The share financed would be lower than 40 percent if the oil price
falls below US$50 per barrel and would be higher if it rises to US$100 or more per barrel.

39
rate of 1 percent and a maturity of 25 years (including a two-year grace period), implying a
grant element of 48 percent if the liability is in U.S. dollars.
7.
Recently missed payments on domestic debt signal financial distress. In April
2007, Standard and Poor’s downgraded Grenada’s credit rating from B- to CCC+, citing
rising fiscal pressures and lack of payments discipline, including arrears (since cleared) to
domestic commercial banks. The downgrade was reversed in August 2007 owing to
“measures taken in June 2007 to streamline the government’s debt-payment mechanism.” In
addition, Grenada could not meet its payment obligations on EC$20.3 million of
unrestructured domestic debt to the nonbank public due on June 30.7

8 percent per year thereafter. Other
assumptions include: implementing some additional revenue-enhancing measures over the
medium term (e.g., an inflation adjustment to the fuel surcharge), and keeping real wages and
spending on transfers, goods, and services constant over the medium term. This scenario also
assumes that the first review under the PRGF is completed by year-end and the positive
assessment by the Fund unlocks some additional grants conditioned on such an assessment.

The authorities informed the bond holders that full payment would be made by the fourth quarter of 2007.

1/ Both scenarios assume an active structural reform program.

Other scenarios
9.
Economic growth and the primary balance are key factors underpinning
Grenada’s debt trajectory. In a scenario under which historical levels of the primary deficit
(2.5 percent of GDP) and GDP growth (3.7 percent) remain unchanged, the NPV of debt
would rise to 130 percent by 2027 (Table A1b). The NPV of debt to revenue increases over
time, and the debt service-to-revenue ratio increases to 33 percent (Scenario A2).
10.
The need to contain expenditure if growth does not materialize is underscored
by the sensitivity analysis. In Bound Test B1, growth falls to -2.2 percent in 2008 and 2009,
fiscal revenue is assumed to remain constant as a share of GDP, while expenditure is held
constant in nominal terms. In this scenario, the ratio of the NPV of debt to GDP rises sharply
to 157 percent.
11.
Further exogenous shocks would also have a significant impact on Grenada’s
debt dynamics. Both growth and the primary balance are adversely impacted by shocks,
including natural disasters, foreign growth, and the volatility of grants. For example, with a
natural disaster in 2008 that reduced GDP growth to zero for three years and increased the
primary deficit by 3 percentage points of GDP for each of those years, the NPV of debt
would rise to 71 percent of GDP (Scenario A5). Grenada’s participation in the World Bank’s
Caribbean Catastrophe Insurance Facility, which is not incorporated in this analysis, would
help cushion the financial impact of further disasters.

41
IV. EVALUATION OF EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
12.
Grenada exceeds its thresholds—based on the Debt Sustainability Framework
for Low-Income Countries—for the ratio of the NPV of external debt to GDP and to
exports. Based on Grenada’s 2004–06 average CPIA rating of “medium,”8 the thresholds are
40 percent and 150 percent for the ratios to GDP and exports respectively, while for 2006,
Grenada’s ratios were 75 percent and 234 percent respectively.9 It falls below thresholds on
the NPV of debt to revenue and for the ratio of debt service to exports and to revenue.
13.
Although Grenada’s external public debt would fall significantly in the baseline
scenario, it would remain above the NPV of debt-to-GDP threshold for an extended
period (Table A2a). The ratio of the NPV of external public debt to GDP would not fall
below the 40 percent threshold before 2022, while the NPV of debt to exports would only fall
below the 150 percent threshold by 2011 (Figure 2).
14.
Bound tests show significant sensitivity in the short term, with much weaker
effects by 2027 (Table A2b). Under an alternative scenario with key variables—GDP
growth, the current account deficit, and FDI) at historical averages—the NPV of debt would
rise to 156 percent of GDP by 2027 (Scenario A2). Under this scenario, the debt-to-exports
ratio would rise to 347 percent in the same year, while the debt service-to-exports ratio would
rise sharply as restructured debt matures.
V. CONCLUSIONS
15.
Owing in large part to fiscal slippages in 2006–07, Grenada’s debt sustainability
has deteriorated since the previous DSA. The analysis indicates that Grenada’s debt is
unsustainable under current fiscal policies, even though they incorporate some adjustment.
While the authorities’ efforts to limit expenditure in 2007 below the budgeted level is a first
step toward a sustainable debt trajectory, much greater fiscal adjustment will be needed to
ensure that debt is placed firmly on a declining trajectory. The recently missed payment on
domestic debt and Standard and Poor’s downgrade (albeit subsequently reversed) underscore
the financial strains and the need for urgent corrective action.
16.
On the external front, Grenada is at high risk of debt distress, with several debt
indicators above their indicative thresholds under a variety of scenarios. Even under an
active fiscal adjustment scenario, it will require a determined and prolonged effort to bring
debt down to sustainable levels. Furthermore, this favorable outcome would be severely
affected by another external shock, such as a hurricane or a shock to tourism, leading to an
unsustainable trajectory for debt.

The previous three-year average (2003–05) CPIA rating for Grenada’s performance was “strong.” Even with
this higher rating, Grenada would still exceed the indicative thresholds for the debt ratios to GDP and exports.

1/ The coverage of public sector debt is public and publicly guaranteed debt, including debt of public enterprises and the debt of the central government to the NIS.
2/ Gross financing need is defined as the primary deficit plus debt service plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last period.
3/ Revenues excluding grants.
4/ Debt service is defined as the sum of interest and amortization of medium and long-term debt.
5/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

Source: Fund staff projections and simulations.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), noninterest current account in percent of GDP, and nondebt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the
shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A3 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

VIII. Safeguards Assessment: Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Eastern
Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) is subject to a full safeguards assessment under a four-year
cycle. The most recent assessment was completed in July 2007, and concluded that the
ECCB continues to have appropriate control mechanisms in place, which have strengthened
since the first safeguards assessment completed in 2003. ECCB management places emphasis

51
on good governance and sound controls, and has enhanced the bank’s transparency and
accountability since the last assessment, including the publications of financial statements
that comply with International Financial Reporting Standards. The assessment made some
recommendations to sustain the ECCB’s safeguards framework going forward.
IX. Exchange Arrangement: Grenada is a member for the ECCB, which manages
monetary policy and the exchange system for its eight members. The common currency, the
Eastern Caribbean dollar, has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per
U.S. dollar since July 1976. In practice, the ECCB has operated like a quasi-currency board,
maintaining foreign exchange backing of its currency and demand liabilities of close to
100 percent. Grenada accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 in
January 1994. It maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions.
X. Article IV Consultation: Grenada is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The
last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on July 13, 2005 (IMF
Country Report No. 05/290).
XI. FSAP Participation: Grenada participated in the regional Eastern Caribbean Currency
Union FSAP conducted in September and October 2003. The Financial System Stability
Assessment is IMF Country Report No. 04/293.
XII. Technical Assistance:
Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Centre (CARTAC)
CARTAC has provided wide-ranging assistance in developing a Medium-Term
Macroeconomic Framework (as part of the Structural Adjustment Technical Assistance
Program); preparing to implement a VAT, building upon previous work, including draft
VAT/excise laws (prepared by LEG) and a VAT sensitivity study and training/publicity tasks
(undertaken with CARTAC/FAD assistance); assisting customs with
ASYCUDA/ASYCUDA++ and with the exchange of information with inland revenue;
drafting legislation to establish the single supervisory agency, Grenada Authority for the
Regulation of the Financial Institutions (GARFIN) and supporting the newly established
agency; and training for nonbank supervisors. CARTAC has also provided substantial
assistance in improving the production and dissemination of macroeconomic statistics,
including national accounts compilation; rebasing of the consumer price index; initiating
work to prepare export-import price indices; training in the processing of trade data; and
improving external sector statistics as part of a major CARTAC/ECCB project.

52
Other Technical Assistance (2006–07):
FAD and LEG have provided extensive assistance in tax policy and administration. In
particular, FAD and LEG have assisted in the design and drafting of a VAT and related
changes to excise taxes. LEG has also assisted with training for tax officials and with the
finalization of the VAT and excise laws. A series of FAD missions have provided further
assistance on implementing a VAT and on tax and customs administration more broadly.

Appendix II. Grenada: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of April 30, 2007)
In September 2005, the Eastern Caribbean Sub-Region Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
for FY 2006–09 was presented to the Board of the World Bank. The strategy supports the
sub-region’s development agenda through two main pillars: (1) stimulating growth and
improving competitiveness; and (2) reducing vulnerability, by promoting greater social
inclusion and strengthening disaster risk management. Recognizing the Organization of
Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) countries’ weakened creditworthiness due to high debt
ratios, Bank activities will focus on leveraging available donor grant financing. Following the
recommendations of the recently completed growth and competitiveness study for the OECS,
IBRD and IDA support would focus on providing technical and financial assistance for
interventions to support the two main pillars. An indicative Base Case lending scenario
consists of about US$51.3 million in IDA resources for the four OECS blend countries
(Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines). This amount includes
the estimated IDA country allocations for each of the four countries during FY 2006–09, and
an IDA Regional allocation of US$15.2 million for two regional projects: US$12 million for
Catastrophe Risk Insurance and US$3.2 million for Infrastructure and Utilities Reform.
A. Projects
There are six active World Bank projects in Grenada for a net commitment of approximately
US$42.35 million.
The Telecommunications and ICT Development Project, approved in May 2005 for
US$540,000, aims at improving the access, quality, and use of telecommunications and ICT
services to achieve socio-economic development in the OECS. The project has the following
four components: Component (1) will strengthen the national and regional regulatory
frameworks and promote additional competition in the telecommunications sector.
Component (2) will review current universal access policy, create related guidelines, and
provide financial support to establish a Universal Service Fund (USF). Component (3) will
improve growth and competitiveness in ICT-enabled services through utilization of
broadband infrastructure. Component (4) will ensure management and administration of the
overall project.
The Public Sector Modernization Technical Assistance Project, approved in
December 2005 for US$3.5 million, supports the Government of Grenada in the process of
modernizing its public sector. The project has the following components: Component(1) will
finance: (i) the strategic review of the proposed organizations and functions for conversion to
Executive Agencies status; (ii) the preparation of detailed, modernization and financing plans
for each conversion; (iii) the preparation of a Policy Framework for Executive Agencies; and

54
(iv) the preparation of enabling legislation—including the preparation of a draft Executive
Agencies bill to be presented to Cabinet and Parliament under Grenada's legal framework.
Component (2) will support the strengthening of the Small Business Development Centre
(SBDC) of the Grenada Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) that will provide
technical assistance and training to the micro/small segment of the business community.
Component (3) will support Grenada in taking the lead to jointly procure select goods and
services with other OECS countries. Component (4) will strengthen the Public Sector Reform
Unit by providing financial and technical resources and training in key policy areas.
The Grenada Education Reform Project, approved in June 2003 for US$8.0 million, is a
follow-up to an earlier education project. Its goal is to build human capital, with a view to
contributing to economic diversification and more sustainable growth. Key objectives are to:
(i) increase equitable access to secondary education; (ii) improve the quality of the teaching
and learning processes, with more direct interventions at the school level and an increased
focus on student-centered learning, and (iii) strengthen management of the education sector
and to improve governance of schools.
The HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Program, approved in July 2002 for
US$6.04 million, is funded under the Multi-Country APL for the Caribbean Region. Its
objectives are to: (i) curb the spread of the HIV/AIDS pandemic; (ii) reduce the morbidity
and mortality attributed to HIV/AIDS; (iii) improve the quality of life for persons living with
HIV/AIDS; and (iv) develop a sustainable organizational and institutional framework for
managing the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The Bank’s support to Grenada under this project
amounts to US$6.0 million.
The Hurricane Ivan Emergency Project was approved in November 2004 for
US$10 million, with an additional US$9.8 million added in September 2005. This emergency
assistance for Grenada was implemented to respond to the effects of a devastating hurricane
that hit the island in September 2004. The project supports the recovery efforts of the
Government of Grenada through the financing of critical imports and rehabilitation activities
in key social sectors.
The Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) was approved in
January 2007. This is the world’s first ever multi-country catastrophe insurance pool. The
bank has approved a US$4.5 million IDA credit for Grenada to finance their contribution to
the fund over three years. The Facility will enable governments to purchase catastrophe
insurance coverage against adverse natural events, such as a major earthquake or hurricane.
The CCRIF allows participating countries to pool their country-specific risks into one, betterdiversified portfolio, resulting in a substantial reduction in the premium cost.

B. Economic and Sector Work
The Bank has completed a series of analytical work relating to: public sector capacity in the
OECS including the Institutional and Organizational Capacity Review, the OECS
Procurement Assessment Review, and the OECS Financial Accountability Assessment. In
conjunction with the IMF, a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) was completed in
early 2004. The Bank also recently completed an OECS study on Growth and
Competitiveness, a Caribbean Air Transport Rationalization Report and a report on Crime,
Violence and Development: Trends, Cost and Policy Options in the Caribbean. Work is
ongoing on an OECS Private Sector Financing Study, and a Caribbean Skills and Curriculum
Study.

Appendix III. Grenada: Relations with the Caribbean Development Bank
(As of May 2, 2007)
A. New Projects and Technical Assistance
Grenada continued to receive special financing from the Caribbean Development Bank
(CDB) for projects intended to facilitate the recovery and reconstruction process; to build
capacity; and to assist with poverty reduction. The financing apportioned to Grenada
incorporates a blend of the Bank’s Special Development Funds (SDF) and ordinary capital
resources, designed to yield a concessionary grant element of 35 percent. The SDF,
administered exclusively for high-priority development loans, offer loans with longer
maturities and grace periods, as well as lower interest rates than those applied in the Bank’s
ordinary operations.
Grenville Market Square Development Project
In 2006, an investment loan of US$11 million was approved to assist in the development of
Grenville Town as the main urban centre serving the island’s northern and eastern coasts.
The market square will be renovated and a new abattoir and bus terminus will be provided.
Project Management Training
Grenada benefited from two training programmes to improve project administration capacity.
Country participants took part, along with other Caribbean countries, in an extensive,
regional training programme, which emphasizes quality project design and efficient project
execution.
The Government of Grenada also benefited from a one week in-country training workshop
on Cost-Benefit Analysis. The training provided participants with the tools and techniques
required for the identification, preparation and initial screening and prioritization of project
proposals for inclusion in the Public Sector Investment Programme (PSIP). It enabled
participants to establish the link between individual project proposals and macroeconomic
objectives; prepare initial project proposals; and understand and apply the tools and
techniques of Financial, Economic, and Uncertainty and Risk Analysis, and interpret results.
Country Poverty Assessment
The Government of Grenada launched its CDB-supported Country Poverty Assessment
(CPA) in February 2007. Financed by a technical assistance grant of US$355,000, this
assessment will provide quantitative poverty data garnered from the conduct of a National
Survey of Living Conditions to be used to update the critical or indigent poverty line, and the
absolute poverty line. CPAs also assess the current conditions affecting the welfare of the
poor, identifies policies, strategies and programmes that would sustainably reduce the extent

57

and severity of poverty. Through a highly participatory process, the CPA incorporates the use
of qualitative participatory techniques (such as focus groups, stakeholder, community and
national consultations) to provide insights on living conditions and coping strategies of
marginalized communities and vulnerable groups. These are critical inputs for the
preparation of Grenada’s Poverty Reduction Strategy. Grenada’s last CPA was conducted in
1998.
B. Ongoing Activities
Loan disbursements continued for projects under implementation. These included capital
works to upgrade and rehabilitate physical infrastructure including the road and bridge
network, and to reduce the risk of rock fall and landslip events in the aftermath of natural
hazards. Disbursements were also directed for debt support to assist the government in
meeting its financial obligations, as well as to improve the shelter conditions of low-income
households through the provision of 116 serviced lots at two sites—Soubise and Mount Gay.
These form part of government’s long-term programme of housing and human settlement
recovery and reconstruction in Grenada.

Appendix IV. Grenada: Statistical Issues
Since March 2001, Grenada has participated in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS). Its metadata are posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board,
although these have not been certified and updated recently. The metadata include short- and
medium-term plans for statistical development. Improvement in several key areas are needed
to facilitate effective surveillance. Some of the outstanding issues are detailed below.
A. Real Sector
There are a number of deficiencies in the real sector statistics. National accounts are provided
annually. However, GDP by expenditure is available only with long lags, and real GDP by
sector is not available. The estimation of gross capital formation needs to be improved and
sectoral price deflators computed. There are discrepancies in the foreign trade estimates
prepared by the customs department and the Central Statistical Office (CSO), and coverage,
consistency, and timeliness of tourism data are limited.
Consumer prices are the only real sector data provided between missions. The basket used to
compute the consumer price index was last updated in 2000. A producer price index is not
available.
Labor statistics are limited and outdated, with 1998 being the most recent year for which data
are available. There are no regular wage and unemployment data. Data collected during the
2001 population census are still being processed. The CSO is working with the International
Labor Organization (ILO) to improve the coverage of labor market statistics.
B. Public Finances
The reporting of central government data has improved in recent years, with quarterly data
being provided to the ECCB, WHD, and other users in Fund economic classification format
with lags of about two months. However, there appear to be inaccuracies in the composition
of public expenditure. Moreover, capital expenditures could include current expenditure
items, and the nature of expenditures in the Public Sector Improvement Program needs to be
scrutinized carefully. In addition, spending on outsourced activities is not broken down into
the appropriate categories, but rather grouped into a single category.
The coverage of the rest of the public sector is very limited, and there are no consolidated
public sector accounts. There is no systematic reporting of information to the ministry of
finance. Annual statements for some public enterprises are provided during Fund missions. It
would be useful to institute a mechanism for the regular reporting of financial data pertaining
to the rest of the public sector.
The authorities do not report fiscal data for publication in IFS. Grenada has not provided any
fiscal data, either on a GFSM 2001 basis, or a cash basis, for presentation in the

59

GFS Yearbook. The ECCB disseminates Grenada’s quarterly GFS data in its Economic and
Financial Review.
C. Monetary Accounts
The ECCB compiles monthly data on depository corporations (central bank and other
depository corporations) and reports the accounts attributable to Grenada to STA using the
standardized report forms with a lag of about two months for publication in the IFS and the
IFS Supplement. The ministry of finance does not collect data regularly on finance
companies, building societies, and credit unions, which also accept deposits, and on other
financial corporations; this may improve with the formation of the Grenada Authority for the
Regulation of Financial Institutions.
Expanding institutional coverage to include all depository corporations and the other
financial corporations, such as credit unions and insurance companies, would enhance
understanding of savings and credit as well as improve compilation of monetary aggregates.
In addition, improved classification of financial instruments and loan categorization would
enhance identification of credit flows to different sectors of the economy.
D. Balance of Payments
The ECCB compiles and reports balance of payments statistics on an annual basis, using
information collected by the CSO. The latest data published in the IFS and Balance of
Payments Yearbook are for 2005. Incomplete, provisional data have been produced for 2006
by the ECCB. These will be completed and finalized later this year or early in 2008.
Many of these statistics are based on information collected from surveys, and are not
comprehensive. Trade statistics have traditionally been more reliable and available by SITC
classification on a quarterly basis. However, reliability and detail of trade statistics have
suffered considerably in the aftermath of Hurricane Ivan (September 2004) and reporting is
not yet fully back on track.
Enhanced data sources and better compilation procedures are needed to improve the accuracy
of balance of payments statistics. Moreover, quarterly balance of payments statistics and
international investment position data are not compiled.
E. External and Domestic Debt
The database for government external debt is quite comprehensive, and can be used to
provide detailed and reasonably up-to-date breakdowns of disbursements and debt service.
However, data availability on domestic debt, government-guaranteed debt, and debt of public
enterprises is limited, and there is no data on private external debt.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
Grenada
On September 26, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Grenada.1
Background
Grenada’s economy has rebounded after the devastating impact of Hurricanes Ivan and Emily,
with the recovery centered on reconstruction and 2007 Cricket World Cup (CWC) preparations.
Real GDP growth averaged 7 percent a year during 2005–06 and is projected at about 3
percent in 2007 and 4 percent beyond, reflecting a further strengthening of tourism, the recent
initiation of several major tourism projects, and a gradual recovery of agriculture. Inflation has
remained low, buttressed by the regional currency board arrangement.
The external current account deficit improved slightly in 2006, with rising tourism receipts nearly
offsetting the tapering off of large insurance payouts in 2005. The deficit is expected to remain
large, at over 20 percent of GDP over the near term, mainly financed by foreign direct
investment and capital grants. In particular, there has been a substantial increase in foreign
direct investment in the tourism sector. External competitiveness appears to have improved
recently, but fiscal adjustment and enhancing the investment climate will be important to
sustaining competitiveness over the longer term.
Monetary and financial developments have been favorable. Growth in credit to the private sector,
which had declined sharply after Hurricane Ivan, picked up pace in 2006. Grenada’s banking

Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country’s authorities.

62
system is resilient, having weathered the hurricanes well. While there was a temporary increase in
the share of nonperforming loans following Hurricane Ivan, unsatisfactory assets have since been
steadily declining, with the share falling below pre-hurricane levels. Grenada also established a
single regulatory agency to strengthen supervision of nonbank financial institutions.
Large fiscal slippages in 2006–07 have slowed the pace of restoring fiscal and debt sustainability.
Despite revenue-enhancing measures, capital expenditure overruns (owing to higher-thananticipated costs for reconstruction and CWC preparations) led to much higher fiscal deficits than
targeted. As a result, public debt rose, reaching 125 percent of GDP at end-2006, leaving little
room for maneuver in the event of future shocks. On current policies, the overall deficit (including
grants) this year would be about 3¼ percent of GDP, compared with almost 7 percent in 2006.
Absent more active and front-loaded fiscal adjustment, the authorities’ debt-to-GDP target of
60 percent might not be achieved until well after 2020, the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank’s
regional target date.
Implementation of the structural reform agenda has been uneven. Solid progress has been made
with fiscal measures, including the introduction of the National Reconstruction Levy, the adoption
of an automatic fuel pricing mechanism, strengthened collection of tax arrears, and work toward
implementing a VAT. Important steps have also been taken to reduce vulnerabilities, such as
participating in the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility and taking steps toward giving
the Building Code force of law. Other structural reforms have suffered delays, including legislative
action to reform the tax concessions regime, creating a one-stop shop for investors, strengthening
the capacity to evaluate and prioritize capital projects, and modernizing the public sector.
The government’s highly successful debt restructuring is now largely complete and has resulted in
substantial debt service savings. The authorities have continued good-faith efforts to pursue debt
restructuring agreements with the few remaining nonparticipating creditors.

Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed Grenada’s strong economic rebound in the aftermath of hurricane
devastation and the broadly favorable economic prospects, with major tourism investments
under way and the gradual recovery of the agricultural sector. At the same time, substantial
challenges remain, in particular the weak fiscal position and high debt levels, which erode the
room for maneuver in the event of further external shocks. The debt situation would remain
unsustainable if current fiscal policies were continued. Against that background, Directors
agreed that the authorities’ home-grown reform program focuses appropriately on achieving
fiscal and debt sustainability, durable high growth, poverty alleviation, and the mitigation of
vulnerabilities.
Directors welcomed the steps that have been taken by the authorities to place Grenada’s fiscal
position on a more solid footing, including the implementation of an automatic mechanism for
setting fuel prices and a broadly-based National Reconstruction Levy. They noted, however,
that further fiscal consolidation will be key to placing debt on a sustainable trajectory. Spending
restraint will be needed, including on capital expenditure and the public sector wage bill. The
expected divestment proceeds should be used to pay down expensive debt, rather than to

63
finance additional budgetary expenditures. Directors called on the authorities to explore a
regional solution to the current counter-productive tax abatement competition among
Caribbean countries.
Directors encouraged the authorities to strengthen public financial management and adopt
multi-year budgeting. They recommended clearing arrears as soon as possible, avoiding
reliance on unsustainable financing, and enhancing capital project evaluation capacity. They
welcomed the authorities’ intention to introduce a VAT, and encouraged them to move forward
expeditiously in line with their implementation schedule. A track record of budgetary discipline
would help boost investor confidence, which will be critical to maintain credit market access
and foreign direct investment flows. Directors noted that technical assistance from the Fund in
the areas of debt management and the budget could be useful.
Directors considered that external competitiveness appears adequate, with Grenada’s share of
the regional tourism market increasing. Fiscal consolidation will help sustain competitiveness
and support the regional currency board arrangement.
Directors commended the authorities for strengthening the financial system’s supervisory
framework, as evidenced by the establishment of a single regulatory agency for nonbank
institutions. They supported plans to address regulatory gaps in the insurance sector and bring
all nonbank financial entities under the regulatory agency’s oversight. Directors called on the
authorities to bring the unregulated commercial bank under proper supervision without delay.
Directors welcomed the efforts being made by the authorities to enhance the business climate
and improve competitiveness, including through the recently developed national export
strategy, the one-stop shop being established for investors, and other measures to reduce
business costs. They encouraged the authorities to accelerate the implementation of these
and other aspects of their structural reform agenda, including moving ahead with reforms to
arrangements governing tax concession.
Directors welcomed the steps taken to strengthen enforcement of the building code and enact
a new Insurance Act, which will help mitigate vulnerabilities.
Directors encouraged the authorities to further strengthen the coverage, quality, and timeliness
of the statistical database to support policy analysis, surveillance, and public debate.
Directors encouraged the authorities to work toward completion of the pending first review
under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement—by taking corrective
action on the fiscal front, addressing the issue of the unregulated bank, and accelerating the
pace of structural reform. These steps would unlock additional financial resources and help lay
the foundation for strong, sustainable growth in the years ahead.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
