STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 3, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context: Turkey’s economy has grown on average by 6 percent annually since 2010, but
this has come at the expense of a persistently large external deficit making the economy
sensitive to changes in external financing conditions. Inflation is high and above the
authorities’ target, and real policy interest rates remain negative. The exchange rate
continues to be stronger than suggested by fundamentals.
Challenges: Policies should focus on rebalancing the economy, reducing the external
deficit—by boosting savings rather than decreasing investment—and lowering inflation
to preserve competitiveness. Over the medium term, implementation of the ambitious
structural reform agenda is critical to raising potential growth.
Key policy recommendations:
 Fiscal policy should be tighter, raising domestic savings by increasing the primary
surplus by 2 percent of GDP by 2017.
 Renewing the focus of monetary policy on the inflation target, by setting and
sustaining a positive real policy interest rate.
 Expanding the (macro)prudential toolkit to contain risks to financial stability, in
particular the banking system’s wholesale external foreign exchange funding.
Traction of past Fund advice: The authorities and staff agree that the external
imbalance should be reduced, and that this should be done while preserving investment.
They also concur that lowering inflation is a key objective. Moreover, to preserve
financial stability, the authorities introduced well-targeted macroprudential measures to
slow the rise in household leverage and encourage banks to increase core funding. They
plan to tackle structural issues through the 10th Development Plan. However, the
authorities believe risks are lower than what staff believes and that the economy has
enough buffers to withstand reasonable shocks. Thus fiscal and monetary policies would
remain more accommodative than recommended by staff.

CONTEXT: HIGH GROWTH, PERSISTENT IMBALANCES
1.
Strong growth has been accompanied by a persistently large current account deficit
and high inflation. Driven mostly by domestic demand growth, Turkey has managed to rebound
strongly after the global financial crisis, growing at 9 percent per year on average in 2010–11, but it
has since been growing more modestly. The authorities’ policies and large capital inflows have

ended the year at 7.4 percent, once again above
the 5 percent target.
2.
Ample capital inflows, intermediated by the financial sector, and financial deepening,
eased credit constraints and led to rapid growth of private sector credit and consumption.
Private savings decreased, opening up a large gap between (low) saving and (modest) investment.
Hedged external wholesale foreign currency borrowing has become a key feature sustaining loan
growth, and the loan-to-deposit ratio has risen well above 100 percent.

3.
Severe turbulence hit Turkey in early 2014. Fed tapering, loose and opaque monetary
policy, and domestic political uncertainty led to a 15 percent exchange rate depreciation early in the
year. The authorities initially embarked on unsterilized FX intervention, which resulted in a rapid loss
of international reserves. Subsequently, the central bank increased the one week repo rate by
550 basis points and adjusted its policy framework. The banks and corporate sector have shown
resilience during this short-lived period of turmoil, with corporate FX losses not translating into
non-performing loans.

4.
Reducing inflation and the external deficit is essential to contain the risk that shocks
could force an abrupt adjustment in the future. Inflation remains too high, and staff projects that
the current account deficit will remain between 5½–6 percent of GDP on current policies. Reflecting
in part the large share of short-term external debt, gross external financing requirements will exceed
a quarter of GDP per year (Annex II). The net foreign asset position, which has already deteriorated
by about 25 percentage points of GDP since 2008, will also weaken further. The current account
deficit remains 2½–5 percent of GDP higher than warranted by fundamentals and optimal policy
settings. Thus, the estimated real effective exchange rate misalignment is 10–20 percent (Annex III
and Box 1). These trends are not sustainable, and if they are not redressed, Turkey could sooner or
later suffer a sharp adjustment.
5.
Yet, macroeconomic policies have not supported rebalancing by increasing domestic
savings, leaving Turkey exposed to shocks. Fiscal and monetary policies have been too loose.
Public sector expenditure has grown faster than GDP, and the structural primary balance has
deteriorated. The monetary stance has emphasized growth over inflation, and thus has been too
loose for too long. Negative real policy interest rates have caused high inflation, thereby eroding
competitiveness and reducing incentives for private savings.

Turkey has benefitted from a supportive international environment for emerging
market economies, but the future environment is more uncertain. Over the next year, monetary
policy is expected to start normalizing in the United States, which could reduce capital flows to
emerging markets. On the other hand, monetary policy in the Euro Area is moving in the opposite
direction, and Turkey’s investment grade sovereign credit rating may continue to support capital
inflows. The overall environment for capital flows to Turkey is therefore likely to be more mixed
going forward.
7.
Turkey is in the midst of a long electoral cycle. After winning the local election earlier this
year, the Justice and Development Party—in power since 2002—faces parliamentary elections by
June 2015.

Box 1. Turkey’s External Sector
In 2013, Turkey’s current account deficit worsened to 7.9 percent of GDP driven by strong private
domestic demand and re-stocking of gold. Over the past 5 years, the current account deficit has
averaged 6.4 percent of GDP, with large fluctuations in the recent years. Weaker domestic demand
conditions and decreased gold imports in 2014 point to another episode of external rebalancing. The
deficit is expected to narrow to 5.8 percent of GDP by year-end.
Exports to the MENA region moderated. The share of export to the region fell from 32.2 percent of
total in 2012 to 27.9 percent in 2013, partly due to diminished gold re-exporting activities. Iraq remains
the most important export market in the region, and the second largest export destination for Turkey
(after Germany), accounting for 8 percent of total exports. Conflicts in several MENA countries in 2014 are
expected to negatively impact Turkey’s trade with the region. And although there are signs that exports
to traditional European partners are beginning to pick up, the recovery is expected to be slow due to the
region’s subdued economic recovery.
Real effective exchange rates (REERs) depreciated in the second half of 2013. CPI- and PPI-based
REERs fell by 10 and 9 percent, respectively, compared to end-2012. The REERs continued to depreciate in
the first quarter of 2014, but due to high inflation and currency appreciation, have since re-appreciated to
levels seen in the 3rd quarter of 2013.
In staff’s view, the overvaluation of the REER is in the 10–20 percent range—consistent with a
current account gap of 2½–5 percent of GDP (Annex III). This gap reflects staff’s view that the current
account norm for a fast-growing emerging market economy such as Turkey is likely to be higher than the
model-estimated -0.9 percent of GDP. At the same time, the gap is larger than in last year’s assessment
due to the current account deterioration in 2013. In 2014, slowing domestic demand has lowered the
current account deficit, and hence the current account gap. However, as the real effective exchange rate
has depreciated just 5 percent compared to the average in 2013, staff continues to see the exchange rate
overvaluation in the 10–20 percent range.
The REER overvaluation contributes to Turkey’s external competitiveness gap. The positive inflation
differentials with trading partners and trade competitors continue to weigh on Turkey’s competitiveness.
The recent bout of nominal exchange rate depreciation has helped contain the REER overvaluation, but
not enough to outweigh price increases and deliver a sustained competitiveness gain. While the nominal
exchange rate has fallen by 13 percent since end-2011, the current CPI- and PPI-based REERs are at
about the same levels as at end-2011.
Low FDI provides another view on Turkey’s competitiveness challenge. In 2013, Turkey saw a total
FDI inflow of 1.6 percent of GDP, below the average of 2.5 percent of GDP for its G-20 emerging-market
peers. The share of FDI in the tradable sector, which had been gaining grounds in previous years, receded
back to 47 percent of total, on account of greater FDI into financial services. The low FDI into Turkey may
partly reflect the trend decline in FDI flows into most emerging markets since 2009. At the same time,
Turkey’s high inflation, volatile growth, and structural bottlenecks likely play key roles in impeding FDI

OUTLOOK: CYCLICAL REBALANCING, MODEST
MEDIUM-TERM PROSPECTS
8.
A cyclical rebalancing is underway. Growth decelerated to 2.7 percent (annualized) in the
first half of 2014, driven by public sector spending and net exports, as private consumption and
investment weakened. Monetary policy tightening in response to exchange rate pressure in the first
quarter, macroprudential measures to cool credit growth, and exchange rate depreciation weakened
private domestic demand, thus compressing import growth and reducing the current account

TURKEY

deficit. But the smaller external deficit is mostly due to cyclical factors and the one-off effect of net
gold imports.
9.
Staff expects GDP to grow by 3 percent in both 2014 and 2015. Monetary easing since
April and concomitantly easier financing conditions should produce a modest rebound of private
domestic demand in the second half of 2014. In addition, public spending is expected to remain
supportive of growth. Net exports and the public sector are likely to contribute each about
1½ percentage points to GDP growth this year. In 2015, on current policies, growth will remain at
around 3 percent, with a larger domestic demand contribution (including a sizeable contribution by
the public sector) and negative net exports. However, private investment is expected to remain
subdued until the end of the long electoral cycle.
10.
However imbalances remain significant. The premature monetary easing, which has left a
negative real policy interest rates, pass-through from the lira depreciation, and food price inflation,
is expected to leave inflation at 9 percent at year-end, well above the 5 percent inflation target. And,
on unchanged policies, inflation is not expected to return to target next year either. Moreover, as
GDP once again rotates towards domestic demand in 2015, the current account deficit is projected
to widen to 6 percent of GDP in 2015, from 5¾ percent in 2014 based on an oil price assumption of
US$99.4 per barrel.
11.
Without a change in policies, medium-term economic performance is likely to be
weaker than in the recent past. Turkey’s low domestic savings and challenges related to
competitiveness are limiting investment and exports. Thus, on current policies and national saving
rates, staff has revised annual medium-term growth to about 3½ percent. The lower growth rate is
expected to contain inflation and the deterioration of the current account, although both will remain
elevated at about 6 percent. As such, while vulnerabilities are not envisaged to grow, the baseline
assumes a continued willingness of investors to finance a large external deficit.
Authorities’ views
12.
The authorities broadly share staff’s outlook. They recognize downside risks to their
original official growth forecast for 2014, and that inflation is likely to exceed their objective. For
2015, however, the authorities see an acceleration of growth to around 4 percent, as they expect
domestic demand to play a larger role. They believe the real exchange rate is close to equilibrium
and judge that the improvement in the external balance will continue with increased net exports.
The authorities acknowledge that, in the medium term, rebalancing the economy towards
investment and exports is necessary to avoid a decline in trend growth. However, they believe their
reform program will be sufficient to achieve this objective.

RISKS: CAPITAL FLOWS
13.
Capital flow reversal remains the main risk. Shocks to market expectations about
monetary policy normalization in advanced economies or changes in expectations about emerging
economies’ growth prospects could result in a reduction of capital inflows or, in extremis, even a
8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TURKEY

sudden stop. A sharp decrease in inflows would result in a large compression of absorption to close
the external deficit and lead to a recession. As imbalances remain large, and the buffers present in
the economy are diminishing, the impact could be more pronounced than the 2009 recession
(Box 2). In this environment, loose macroeconomic policies to maintain fast growth—which will slow
the reduction of the external imbalance and lower credibility—increase risks. And even if the recent
gradual adjustment of the external imbalance were to continue, a meaningful reduction in the large
external financing needs will take several years, during which vulnerability to volatility in capital
flows will remain significant.
14.
Other risks center on slower European growth, geopolitical issues, and the strength of
the policy framework (Box 3). Lower than anticipated growth in Europe would hurt demand in
Turkey’s main export market. The economic spillovers to Turkey from conflicts in Syria and Iraq have
negatively impacted exports. The effects of tensions between Ukraine and Russia have thus far been
limited, but if they were to lead to generalized risk aversion in financial markets, the impact could
become significant. A sharp increase in oil prices would have an immediate pronounced effect on
Turkey’s import bill, further widening the external gap.
Authorities’ views
15.
The authorities agree with staff on the risks, but see them as less likely to materialize
and believe buffers are sufficient. In their view, gradual monetary policy normalization in
advanced economies is accurately priced in by markets, and any abrupt volatility along the way is
likely to be temporary. They point to the sharp 2009 recession and the economic turbulence at the
beginning of 2014 to illustrate that the Turkish economy is flexible and has sufficient buffers to
cope. The authorities assess the corporate and banking sectors balance sheets as robust. These
strengths, combined with a strong public sector position and flexible exchange rate, would in their
view allow for an adequate macroeconomic policy response and prevent systemic distress. While
slower European growth is a concern, the authorities point out that exports to Europe grew in the
first half of 2014, a period when European growth was low too. And even though exports to Iraq
have decreased sharply, the authorities expect a rebound in the remainder of the year. Finally, they
believe investor sentiment remains favorable towards Turkey, and that the recently announced
monetary easing in the Euro Area will be supportive of flows to emerging markets.

Box 2. The External Imbalance: Buffers and Policy Space
The external deficit is expected to remain elevated throughout the forecast horizon. This box discusses the
evolution of balance sheets, buffers and policy space since 2008.
Vulnerability indicators

Balance sheets are more stretched…
From 2008 to 2013, current account deficits have weakened
the net international investment position. Banks rely more on
external funding, which amounted to 18 percent of GDP by
the end of 2013 compared to 5½ percent five years earlier.
This has not been accompanied by a similar increase in
external assets but instead by an increase in domestic credit
to the private sector. Banks’ FX exposure has not increased
because on-balance sheet open positions are hedged
off-balance sheet and because much of the domestic
corporate sector credit expansion has been in FX.
Non-financial corporates’ FX borrowing from banks increased
to 18 percent of GDP in 2013 from around 5 percent in 2008
with a corresponding increase in non-financial corporates’ net
open FX position. Households continue to hold more FX
assets than liabilities as FX lending to household is prohibited.
…buffers remain but are smaller…
Banks, corporates, and households have become more
leveraged. Corporates have less equity to absorb potential
losses from currency depreciation, to which they are
increasingly exposed. Banks’ direct FX exposure is limited but
indirect exposure has risen through credit risk from their FX
lending to non-financial corporates. At the same time, their
capital buffers have declined since 2008, although they
remain well-above the regulatory minimum. Household
leverage has increased to over 50 percent of disposable
income, due to high consumer credit growth.

…and policy space is more limited than in 2008.
While gross international reserves have increased from 2008
to 2013, this is due to banks’ FX reserves. Net FX reserves
(those directly available for intervention) have declined. Also,
with a negative real policy rate there is no monetary policy
space compared to 2008 when the real rate was around
6½ percent. However, even though the structural fiscal
position has deteriorated, there is fiscal space as government
debt is low at around 36 percent of GDP, an improvement
since 2008.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the
view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is
meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between
30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the
authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

THE POLICY AGENDA: REDUCE IMBALANCES, BOOST
SAVINGS
The macroeconomic policy mix should focus on bringing down the external imbalance and
lowering inflation to reduce vulnerabilities and preserve competitiveness. The preferred adjustment
is through higher domestic savings to preserve investment (Box 4). Current macroeconomic policies
do not support such adjustment. Staff hence advises tighter fiscal and monetary policies in the near
term to achieve higher domestic savings and lower inflation, while using macroprudential policies
to preserve financial sector resilience. To the extent that fiscal policy is tighter, the burden on
monetary policy would be reduced. The current international environment provides a potentially
brief window of opportunity for such adjustment, which should therefore not be delayed.

A. Fiscal Policy—Reduce Stimulus, Increase Savings
16.
In 2014, the budget primary surplus target is likely to be missed. Although, due to
high inflation, growth of central government revenues is in line with the budget forecast despite
weaker domestic demand, expenditures have been allowed to grow above the budget ceilings.
Total primary revenues have increased by 10 percent y-o-y through August and are projected to
increase by 9 percent in 2014, exceeding the budget forecast by about 0.2 percent of GDP,
largely due high inflation and one-offs. 1 Central government primary spending has grown by
13½ percent y-o-y through August, compared with a budget target of 7.4 percent for the year,
which will lead to an overrun in primary expenditure of about 1 percent of GDP. On a net basis,
the central government primary balance is therefore likely to miss the budget target by about
0.2 percent of GDP. In the broader non-financial public sector, the deviation from the authorities’
plan is expected to be somewhat higher as a result of a weaker than planned performance of
state-owned enterprises (SOEs) due to delayed adjustments in regulated energy prices, enacted
in October.
17.
The structural deficit remains large, although debt sustainability is not a concern
(Annex I). Despite relatively strong headline fiscal indicators, the structural deficit remains large at
about 3 percent of GDP this year. Non-discretionary central government primary spending
remains about two-thirds of total expenditure. Between 2006 and 2013, central government
primary spending has grown by 5.4 percentage points of GDP, more than the 3 percentage point
of GDP decline in interest spending. Over this period, buoyant revenues—mainly taxes on
consumption and imports—have kept the budget balance from deteriorating. However, this
masks a widening structural deficit2, as consumption and imports, which are relatively
revenue-rich, will have to decline when the economy rebalances towards exports and investment.
This could limit fiscal policy space in a downturn, even with debt below 36 percent of GDP.
1

Privatization revenues are below the line and not accounted in the fiscal balances quoted above. However, in
Turkey the law allows for excess privatization revenues to be spent freely and hence they are financing sources
for additional spending.

The structural deficit calculation is based on an absorption gap approach.

Box 4. Policy Options to Reduce the External Imbalance
Turkey’s large current account deficit is the result of low national savings of around 14 percent of GDP, some
6 percentage points below investment. Using the IMF’s Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal Model (GIMF)
this box analyzes different approaches to reducing the external imbalance. It concludes that a combination of
increased private and public savings would yield the best results. This contrasts with recent developments,
where investment has been curtailed by one-off monetary policy tightening and a higher country risk premium.
Four approaches are analyzed. These are i) a 2 percent of GDP permanent increase in private savings (e.g.,
through setting up a second pillar pension system or prefunding severance payments); ii) a 2 percent of
GDP permanent increase in public savings (through lower transfers, lower public consumption, and
increased VAT); iii) a 2 percentage point increase in the monetary policy rate for one year; and iv) an increase
in the country risk premium (an initial 4 percent increase that gradually falls to ½ percent), which might
follow from a protracted failure to adjust policies.
Relative to the baseline, GDP falls in the first year of the
adjustment in all four scenarios. Tighter monetary policy has
the largest immediate negative impact on GDP of about
2½ percent. A higher country risk premium has a persistent
negative impact on GDP (of about 2 percent) as it permanently
reduces investment. Higher private or public savings have
limited negative impacts with increased private savings
increasing GDP in the long run.
Tighter monetary policy and a higher country risk premium
affect private investment negatively. The increased country
risk premium leads to 10 percent lower investment for three
years after which it settles at a 4 percent lower level in the
longer run. Tighter monetary policy reduces investment
temporarily by about 4 percent. Increased private and public
savings affect investment only moderately with a slight positive
effect from increased private savings.
Tighter monetary policy has limited effects on the current
account. Monetary policy tightening has a positive impact on
the current account through import contraction as private
domestic demand slows. However, it will also have negative
effects as the higher interest rate leads to exchange rate
appreciation. The net effect is a limited (less than ½ percent of
GDP) and short lived improvement in the current account.
Increased private or public savings reduce the external
imbalance. Policies to increase public and private savings
improve the current account by 1 percent of GDP in the short
run and 1½-2 percent of GDP in the longer run, entirely
through higher national savings. A higher country risk premium
also leads to an immediate current account improvement of
2 percent of GDP due to a sharp (5 percent) temporary
depreciation. However, this is driven by lower private
investment with negative growth consequences both in the
short and long run.

Staff argued that fiscal policy should play a bigger role in supporting higher domestic
saving… This would contain domestic demand, reduce pressure on monetary policy and deliver a
more competitive real exchange rate. The excessive burden on monetary policy calls for a
frontloaded fiscal adjustment. In addition, a stronger public balance sheet would counterweigh the
trend deterioration in private sector balance sheets, by creating fiscal space to cushion private
deleveraging in the event of a shock.
19.
…and advised that a tighter fiscal stance should be pursued. In the short run, staff
suggested expenditure growth be curbed, in recognition of the fact that meeting the 2014 budget
ceiling is no longer feasible. For the 2015–17 medium-term plan (see Box 5), staff recommended a
cumulative fiscal adjustment of 2 percent of GDP vis-à-vis staff’s baseline. This is akin to achieving a
central government primary surplus of close to 2 percent by 2017. Staff welcomed the planned start
of this adjustment in the 2014–16 medium-term plan (MTP). However, on staff’s projection the
authorities’ target for 2016 in the 2014–16 MTP will be missed by about 1 percent of GDP. Thus, the
mission recommended frontloading the adjustment in the next two budgets, targeting an increase
in the primary balance of 1½ percent of GDP by 2016, and an additional ½ percent in 2017 in the
2015–17 MTP. The recommended adjustment is skewed towards expenditure rather than revenue
measures. This is because indirect taxation is already high, there are some upside risks to personnel,
social security and capital expenditures, and because budget flexibility needs to be preserved. Staff
also argued for permanent rather than temporary measures. Given the macroeconomic imbalances,
staff sees room for discretionary fiscal stimulus only in the case of a major shock that would push
the economy into recession.

Authorities’ views
20.
The authorities agreed that there could be expenditure overruns in 2014, but believe
that the budget headline targets will be missed by less than expected by staff. They forecast lower
primary expenditure than projected by staff, and point to their new tax amnesty—which affects
about TL100 billion of arrears—as a possible upside risk to tax revenues and to social security
collections, which would reduce transfers from the central government. In addition, they expect a
slowdown in capital spending in the later part of the year, which will help contain the expenditure
overrun.

Box 5. The 2015–17 Medium-Term Program
The macroeconomic assumptions underlying the medium-term program are more conservative than
last year’s. The growth trajectory has been shifted downwards in the short-term, while inflation will take
longer to converge to the central bank’s target. The current account deficit for 2014 was revised down by
about ¾ of a percent of GDP, in part as a result of slower growth and a more competitive exchange rate,
with further adjustments in the medium term, albeit at a more modest pace. The MTP’s assumption of
higher savings, fostered by tighter fiscal policy and structural reforms, would be consistent with a reduced
external imbalance.

Staff is less sanguine about growth prospects than the MTP. In staff’s view the authorities’ adequate
emphasis on fiscal adjustment will contribute to reducing the external imbalance and support the central
bank’s efforts to bring inflation to target. However, it will likely also result in lower growth than the
authorities’ objective in the MTP. Staff considers that there is little slack in the economy and, while
structural reforms could raise growth potential, they will likely take time to implement and for results to
materialize.
The new MTP envisages a tighter fiscal stance over the medium term. While there is some slippage in
2014, the target for the public sector remains unchanged for 2015, with a more aggressive adjustment for
latter years than previously envisaged. Encouragingly, the adjustment is predicated on reducing spending at
the central government level. The stronger fiscal adjustment and the emphasis on current spending are
welcome developments. The tighter stance will contribute to the gradual reduction of external imbalances,
and ameliorate pressure on monetary policy. However, the reduction in spending will prove challenging if
the expected growth fails to materialize, as has been the case with previous MTPs.

The authorities agreed with staff that higher public savings are needed in the medium
term. Although they see no need to increase the primary surplus on grounds of debt sustainability,
they believe a stronger public sector position is needed to help reduce the external imbalance and
rebuild fiscal buffers. They also broadly share the view that containing expenditure is the key to
improving the structural balance. Thus, they aim to increase the primary surplus towards 2 percent
of GDP in the next three years, starting with about 1 percent of GDP adjustment in the 2015 budget.
In addition, they have adjusted energy prices so as to eliminate losses in the SOE sector.

B. Monetary Policy—Close the Credibility Gap
22.
Staff welcomed the adjustment of the
monetary stance and framework in January
2014. The CBRT’s increase in interest rates and
move towards normalization of the monetary
framework effectively contained the fallout from
heightened domestic uncertainty and financial
market volatility. The episode thus underscored
the role that a clear framework and appropriate
stance can play in preventing turbulence.

the spring. In particular, monetary policy
loosening starting in May was premature in staff’s view, as inflation was close to double-digits and
inflation expectations were deteriorating. This has resulted in a monetary stance that is inconsistent
with the authorities’ inflation target and by most measures opened a significant credibility gap
(Box 6). In addition, by limiting liquidity provision at the policy rate—in order to be able to drive
funding costs above the policy rate—the CBRT has once again moved the framework away from a
conventional setup.

Between 2006 and 2013, the inflation target was
met only twice. This was in part due to the
unorthodox framework with which the CBRT provided
liquidity to banks at multiple rates and with multiple
instruments, rather than using only the key policy rate.
This hampers market’s ability to gauge the reaction
function of the CBRT. It is also due to the high
exchange rate pass through that generates inflation
volatility in periods of less favorable capital inflows. As
a result, inflation expectations are poorly anchored and
the monetary transmission mechanism has been
undermined.

credit growth running at 18 percent. Missing the inflation target in the last three out of four years,
with outcomes above the top end of the +/-200bps band around the target, has led to a significant
deterioration in the capacity for the CBRT to anchor inflation expectations in the face of transitory
price shocks. Thus, staff called for an increase in the policy interest rate to reach a positive real level,
which should be sustained to bring both inflation and expectations to target. The rate increase
would serve as an important signal that the central bank prioritizes inflation, and would aid in the
resumption of the de-dollarization trend of the economy.
25.
In addition, staff called for full normalization of the monetary policy framework.
Normalizing the framework by committing to providing full liquidity at the policy rate would
facilitate communication and help improve monetary transmission. Together with the advocated
rate increase it would serve the CBRT’s credibility.

Staff also advised the authorities to accumulate more foreign exchange reserves over
time, as market conditions allow. January’s intervention and the CBRT’s regular FX sales have
eroded net international reserves. While gross reserves of US$135 billion account for about
117 percent of the Fund’s metric in mid-2014 and appear reasonable by this metric, they are not as
ample as those of peer countries. In addition, much of these reserves are commercial bank FX
deposits related to the reserve option mechanism (ROM) and FX reserve requirements. As such, the

The central bank believes it reacted well to turbulence in January. The interest rate hike
served to quickly restore confidence, and stabilized the exchange rate. Moreover, the simplification
of the monetary framework helped their communication strategy. In addition, they point to the
change in the upward trend in resident foreign exchange deposits as a sign that their decision
restored credibility.
28.
The CBRT sees high inflation as being due to idiosyncratic shocks, and expects headline
inflation to decline given what they felt was a tight monetary stance. They explain the current high
headline inflation by the drought that has resulted in high food inflation (a major component of the
CPI basket), and the exchange rate pass through to inflation. While they acknowledge some
deterioration in pricing behavior, they judge economic conditions as supportive of disinflation with
no demand push to prices and a negative and widening output gap. In addition, they look at overall
financial conditions taking into consideration monetary policy and the impact of macroprudential
policies implemented by the bank regulator (BRSA) to slow consumer lending. Taken together, they

believe overall set of policies are restrictive for the real economy and that this will help bring
inflation to target. Moreover, they expect that product market reforms to limit food inflation will
contribute to disinflation over the medium term.
29.
Finally, the central bank deems the pace of accumulation of international reserves
appropriate. They explained the stock of reserves would suffice to withstand balance of payments
stresses akin to those experienced in the recent past. While they see a need for higher net reserves,
they are satisfied with the pace of accumulation through EXIM bank loans.

The banking sector remains well-capitalized. The impact of exchange rate depreciation
and higher interest rates on non-performing loans (NPLs) has been limited. The ratio of NPLs to
total loans currently stands at 2.8 percent, although NPLs are slightly higher in recent vintages.
Banks were largely able to pass January’s interest rate increase on to their customers, thus their net
interest margin remained at around 2 percent. Lower credit growth did dent banks’ profitability,

Still, banks’ wholesale external foreign exchange funding has risen rapidly throughout
the banking system, presenting rollover risk. The sector’s loan-to-deposit (LtD) ratio stands at
114 percent, with the ratio at 84 and 131 percent for foreign (FX) and local currency respectively.
Wholesale external funding in FX is, on the margin, financing the expansion of local currency
lending. Driven by the interest rate differential, this exposure has risen from US$61 billion in 2009 to
US$137 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2014, US$85 billion of which is at short maturity.
Banks hedge the exchange rate risk associated with this funding, mainly off balance sheet, and
hence the net open FX position of the sector is not large at 0.1 percent of GDP. Still, in case of a
reversal of market sentiment, the rollover (refinancing) risk and hence FX liquidity risk associated
with the gross exposure is significant. Should these risks materialize, banks’ ROM (and possibly FX
reserve requirement deposits) with the CBRT could be used to partially cover the FX liquidity needs.

Box 7. Recent Evolution of Banking Sector Profitability
Banks’ average profitability has decreased in
recent years. Since 2010, loans have doubled, and
equity is up by more than 50 percent, but profits
have hardly increased. Between 2005 and 2010,
ROAEs and ROAAs averaged 23 and 3 percent,
respectively but they have now reached levels of
13–15 and 1.5–2 percent, respectively.

Lower profitability is largely explained by lower
net interest income and less efficiency in the
sector. Since the second half of 2010, ROAE has
decreased on average by 9.5 percentage points1
About 80 percent of this reduction is due to a
decrease in net interest income while the rest is due
to a worsening of net non-interest income.
Lower net interest income is largely explained by
a contraction of credit to the government which
has not been offset by a decrease in interest
expenses. Interest income fell by 17.4 percentage
points on the back of a 1.8 percentage point
decrease in the profitability of the loan book, but
mostly due to a decrease in interest from securities
of 13.5 percentage point. This, in turn, was the result
of a large decline in government securities in the
banks’ portfolios which fell from 38 to 16 percent of
total assets over the same period.
Decreasing profitability is likely to promote a
drive for efficiency or consolidation. Over the
medium term, banks will need to bring loan growth,
equity and profits back into line, with a focus on
enhancing margins. This can be achieved via more
discipline on pricing, cost efficiencies, risk
management, increasing revenue streams from fees,
or through sector consolidation.

Banks also remain indirectly exposed to exchange rate risk through foreign exchange
lending to non-financial corporates. Driven in part by tax and prudential policies encouraging
moving FX lending onshore, these loans have increased to some US$151 billion in July 2014 from
less than US$40 billion in 2008.6 However, prudential regulations limit indirect foreign exchange rate
risk by limiting these loans to firms with exports receipts and larger companies with greater access
to financial hedging and FX assets. A recent micro-based study by the central bank indeed suggests
part of this net open position is hedged by exports receipts. Some US$27 billion in FX-indexed
loans, however, is not subject to the same regulations, even though they carry similar risks.
Prudential regulation prohibits household credit in FX.
33.
Staff complimented the authorities on the implementation of measures to slow
consumer credit growth and strengthening of stress tests. After tightening credit card limits and
increasing provisioning rates in the Fall of 2013, the authorities implemented further limits on
installment purchases effective February 2014 (Annex IV). As a consequence, consumer credit
growth has slowed from almost 40 to 18 percent (13-week moving average, annualized) in the year
to August 2014. Staff is further encouraged by the authorities’ plan to introduce general
debt-to-income limits for consumer lending. Staff also welcomed significant improvements in stress
testing methodologies. Staff also argued that maintaining a level playing field is essential for
supervision, and to preserve confidence.
34.
To preserve financial stability, additional macroprudential measures targeting banks’
wholesale external FX financing could be considered. Specifically, to slow FX leverage in the
banking system, the authorities could, after a comprehensive quantitative impact study, consider a
menu of options (Box 8).7 Such policies—which have been successfully implemented in other
countries (see selected issues paper)—would contribute to a gradual decrease of FX leverage in the
banking system, thus preserving its resilience. At the same time these measures would likely slow
the growth in FX lending to companies. While these policies would indirectly affect domestic
demand, staff cautioned they are not a substitute for tighter macroeconomic policies.
35.
In addition, the mission suggested other possible measures to reduce incentives for
the non-financial corporate sector to take on exchange rate risk. Staff argued that since FX
lending to unhedged corporations is riskier than Lira loans, higher risk weights (i.e., requiring
additional capital charges) and/or additional provisioning on FX loans could be considered. Staff
advocated that the prudential treatment (in particular eligibility requirements) of FX-indexed lending
be brought into line with that of FX lending, as the risks are the same.

6

While offshore FX borrowing is not prohibited, in 2013, the authorities introduced a levy of up to 3 percent of
principal on such borrowing.
7

The authorities decided to start remunerating (as of November 2014) banks’ required reserves in TRL as a way to
reduce their incentives to leverage in cheaper foreign exchange funds (see Annex IV).

Box 8. Containing Wholesale Foreign Exchange Funding in the Banking Sector
Banks’ wholesale funding in foreign exchange has
increased in recent years to fund Lira loans. Over
the last few years, banks have increased cheap
wholesale funding in foreign exchange to extend Lira
loans. For the sector as a whole, the gap between
foreign exchange liabilities and deposits has increased
to TL397 billion (some US$180 billion or 21 percent of
total assets), and the Lira loan to deposit ratio now
stands at 131 percent.

In tandem, on-balance sheet FX leverage has
increased. Partly as a result of the rapid increase in
wholesale funding in foreign exchange, the
consolidated on-balance sheet net open FX position
has increased to US$44 billion. This is almost fully
hedged, but at increasing cost of off-balance sheet
counterparty and rollover risk. Reserve requirements
on FX liabilities are designed to discourage short
term borrowing but are obviously low if aimed at
discouraging foreign exchange funding.

FX wholesale funding doubled to extend Lira loans.

Several price-based macroprudential measures
could be considered. The reserve requirement differential between foreign exchange and Lira liabilities
could be increased. Additionally, reserve requirement rates could be adjusted to discourage banks’ short
term FX wholesale borrowing. Also, the remuneration differential between Lira and foreign exchange reserve
requirements could be increased. The overall aim of all these price measure would be to decrease banks’
spread between borrowing in Lira and foreign exchange.
Consideration should also be given to complementary non-price measures. For instance, a ceiling on
the use of derivatives for FX hedging purposes while keeping the current net open position limits, or on the
non-core to core foreign exchange liabilities ratio would have the obvious impact of containing wholesale
foreign exchange funding. A ceiling on the Lira or overall loan to deposit ratio would force banks to reduce
wholesale foreign exchange funding to the extent that this is used to fund Lira loans.
Any macroprudential measure needs to be supported by a comprehensive impact study. Price
measures aimed at curbing foreign exchange wholesale funding need to take into consideration the ability
of banks to pass on the additional costs to creditors or debtors. Only non-price measures can deal with
highly inelastic supply of foreign exchange liabilities or demand for assets.

Staff noted the increased loans flowing in to the construction sector, partly in foreign
currency. Loans to the construction sector—which account for 6½ percent of GDP—have risen

of resources to construction may prevent them from being used in more productive sectors.
Therefore, staff advised to carefully monitor lending to the construction sector, and discourage
unhedged FX lending to this sector.
37.
Turkey has made significant progress in enhancing its anti-money laundering and
combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) framework. It has addressed the deficiencies
which had prompted closer monitoring by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), including by
adequately criminalizing terrorist financing and establishing procedures to identify, freeze, and
confiscate terrorist assets. In October, Turkey was removed from the FATF’s list of countries with
strategic AML/CFT deficiencies and FATF no longer calls on countries to consider the risk emanating
from such deficiencies.

Authorities’ views
38.
The BRSA believes the banking system is healthy and the regulatory framework is
adequate. They point to high capitalization, low NPLs, and good liquidity buffers. While they
recognized declining banks’ profitability in the face of lower consumer credit growth and fee
restrictions imposed for consumer protection purposes, studies suggest the impact will remain
manageable. They also pointed out that recent macroprudential measures have slowed the growth
of household leverage. In addition, they have started impact studies related to plans to introduce
prudential debt-to-income limits for consumer loans. They see all these measures as further
prudential steps to reduce risks to financial stability.
39.
The authorities agree that rollover risk linked to banks’ wholesale external funding in
foreign exchange has increased in recent years. However, they emphasize both the ease of
obtaining such funding and the banks’ substantial FX deposits at the CBRT associated with ROM and
FX reserve requirements. With respect to FX risk in the broader economy, the authorities point to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

TURKEY

their micro-based study that suggests many of the corporates borrowing in FX are naturally hedged,
and to anecdotal evidence suggesting some of the loans are also covered by FX collateral. At this
time, the BRSA does not see a need for additional macroprudential measures targeted at banks’
wholesale external foreign exchange funding, pointing out this funding does not translate to
domestic FX lending. Overall, the authorities see their prudential and macroprudential policies as an
integral part of their macroeconomic management toolkit, to be used in pursuit of rebalancing the
economy. Finally, the authorities were pleased with FATF’s recognition of their efforts to improve the
AML/CFT framework.

D. Structural Policies—Boost Productivity and Raise Private Sector Savings
40.
The authorities plan several initiatives to improve competitiveness. These center on the
business environment, energy dependence, informality, the labor market, and education. To improve
the business environment, the authorities adopted a new commercial code in 2012. Large-scale
privatizations of the energy distribution networks and the expansion of renewable and nuclear
electricity generation will contain energy imports over the medium term. Measures to decrease
informality will also improve competitiveness by leveling the playing field for the formal sector and
improving incentives to invest in human and physical capital. The national employment strategy
aims to facilitate the use of part-time and temporary labor in the formal market, thereby further
fighting informality and increasing labor participation.
41.
Staff agrees with the authorities that structural reforms are critical, but prioritization
and implementation is critical. Policy changes have boosted participation in voluntary private
pension funds. Staff saw additional private and public pension reform as a potential avenue to
increase private sector savings in the medium term. In addition, given staff’s assessment that
Turkey’s exchange rate is overvalued, the authorities’ focus should be on reforms that reduce the
competitiveness gap. Staff proposed that more could be done to boost progress in the authorities’
priority policy areas. The business climate could be further improved by simplifying licensing,
regulation, tax administration and compliance, to enhance efficiency and predictability. Improving
the efficiency and consistency of the judiciary should also facilitate the business climate. Informality
and labor market functioning could be improved by reducing the labor wedge and simplifying the
taxation of labor—specifically by adopting the draft income tax reform and reducing the relatively
high cost of pension and severance premia for part-time workers. Reforms to increase educational
outcomes could boost productivity and employment.

Authorities’ views
42.
The authorities agree that the structural reform agenda is critical to close the
competitiveness gap and realize Turkey’s economic potential. They point to the 10th Development
Plan as clear evidence of a bold and well-targeted set of structural reforms. It strives to reduce energy
dependence by boosting renewable, nuclear, domestic source based electricity generation and
increasing energy efficiency. Labor force participation is to be increased and the functioning of labor
markets improved through changes to the labor code, enhanced child care facilities, better

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TURKEY

education, and tax incentives for employment. Debt financing will be discouraged by offering
incentives for companies to rely on equity. Together, these measures are expected to increase
domestic savings and reduce the external imbalance. The Development Plan has been approved by
parliament and the authorities are in the process of drafting coordinated implementation plans. Still,
they aim to start implementation of key steps only after the 2015 parliamentary elections.

STAFF APPRAISAL
43.
Turkey’s economy has grown by an impressive 6 percent on average since 2010. The
economy recovered swiftly from the great financial crisis and unemployment dropped to its lowest
level in the last decade. More recently, the authorities effectively contained the fallout from
heightened domestic uncertainty and financial market volatility. However, rapid growth has come
with high inflation and a large external deficit. These imbalances are holding back growth potential
and increasing risks, and need to be addressed with carefully sequenced macroeconomic policies
and structural reforms.
44.
Growth is set to continue, albeit at a more moderate pace. In 2014, GDP is expected to
grow by 3 percent, driven by public sector support, net exports, and a mild revival of private
domestic demand in the later part of the year. However, inflation will exceed the central bank’s
target once again, reflecting premature monetary easing, and the current account deficit—although
decreasing—will remain elevated.
45.
Without a change in policies, future economic performance is likely to be weaker than
that of the recent past. Turkey’s low domestic savings and competitiveness challenges limit
investment and exports. Thus, on current policies and national saving rates, annual economic growth
is expected to slow to about 3½ percent in the medium term. This lower growth rate would likely
limit inflation and the deterioration of the current account deficit. But it would also mean that
Turkey’s income convergence with advanced economies would be slow, potentially leaving Turkey in
a middle income trap.
46.
The financial system remains well-capitalized. Capital adequacy ratios are high on
average, and mostly based on high quality capital. Nonperforming loans are low and well
provisioned. However, banks are increasingly reliant on—for now—ample and cheap external
wholesale funding in foreign exchange. In tandem, banks have increased their indirect foreign
exchange risk through foreign currency lending to non-financial corporations.
47.
The main risk to the outlook is a sharp decrease in capital inflows. Turkey’s external
gross financing needs of more than 25 percent of GDP leave the country exposed to sudden shifts in
capital flows, which could lead to an abrupt and costly adjustment of the real economy. Risks are
compounded by the fact that, as leverage has increased in the private sector, buffers to withstand
shocks have diminished. The longer imbalances are allowed to increase, and the slower the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

TURKEY

authorities are to create additional policy space to respond to shocks, the more costly such
adjustments will become.
48.
In the near term, the macroeconomic policy mix has to play a bigger role in
rebalancing the economy and addressing imbalances. Turkey’s growth is constrained by its
dependence on consumption, slow export growth, and sizable investment needs, against the
backdrop of a large external deficit. The challenge of rebalancing the economy can only be met by
implementing a stronger macroeconomic policy mix, especially until the authorities’ structural
agenda begins to bear fruit.
49.
The authorities are commended for their proposed fiscal adjustment in the next three
years to help reduce the external imbalance and relieve pressure on monetary policy.
Government non-interest current expenditure has been growing faster than the economy and policy
has been too stimulative. Moreover the structural balance has been deteriorating in recent years,
although debt sustainability is not a concern. Thus, the authorities’ new 2015–17 medium-term plan
correctly aims to increase the primary surplus towards 2 percent of GDP by 2017. Moreover, their
stated intention to achieve this adjustment through expenditure reductions would help strengthen
the structural balance. In addition, the tighter fiscal stance would reduce the burden on monetary
policy to meet the inflation target and would also result in a more competitive real exchange rate.
This would help rebalance the economy away from consumption, support private investment, and
improve the competitiveness of the tradable sector. Also, a stronger public sector position would
create additional policy space to react to shocks as private sector balance sheets become more
stretched.
50.
The monetary stance needs to be consistent with the inflation target and the
framework normalized. The current policy rate is not compatible with reducing inflation to the
5 percent target. Thus the monetary stance needs to be tightened and sustained to anchor
expectations and lower inflation to the targeted rate. The monetary effort needed to achieve the
inflation target would be smaller if the fiscal stance were tighter. In addition, normalizing the policy
framework would facilitate communication, as was apparent in January 2014, and help improve
monetary transmission.
51.
Although gross international reserves are adequate, it would be prudent to increase
net reserves. The level of gross reserves is in line with international standards, although they are not
ample and are still below levels seen in peer countries. Net reserves are low, however, thus providing
limited buffers in case of prolonged periods of exchange rate volatility. The central bank should
therefore gradually bolster its net international reserves through sterilized interventions, as market
conditions permit.
52.
The strength of the banking sector must be preserved. Maintaining the standards of
supervision and ensuring a level playing field are essential. The authorities are also encouraged to
consider expanding their prudential and macro prudential toolkit to maintain financial stability. In
order to curb rollover and foreign exchange risk in the economy, the authorities could, after
conducting a careful impact analysis, introduce further measures that encourage banks to reduce

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TURKEY

wholesale foreign exchange funding and reduce incentives for the corporate sector to borrow in
foreign exchange. Yet such policies would not be a substitute for tighter macroeconomic policies.
Moreover, prudential measures (in particular eligibility criteria) applied to foreign exchange-indexed
lending should be brought in line with those applied to straight foreign exchange loans, as the risks
associated with both types of loans are the same.
53.
For the medium term, the structural reform policy agenda needs to be revitalized.
Macroeconomic policies can support rebalancing and preserve financial stability in the near term,
but improved medium-term growth will depend on progress with structural reforms aimed at
enhancing Turkey’s economic potential. Thus, staff encourages the authorities to accelerate the
ambitious reform program included in the 10th Development Plan. The priority should be to
implement policies that encourage higher private sector savings, and promote lower energy
dependence.
54.
It is recommended that the next Article IV Consultation with Turkey be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Annex I. Public Debt Sustainability
At about to 35 percent of GDP (measured as general government gross debt according to
Maastricht criteria), Turkey’s public debt ratio is well below its historical ten-year average. Gross
public sector financing needs are about 10 percent of GDP, and will remain high at about 7 percent
of GDP over the medium term. The DSA suggests that Turkey’s government debt is sustainable even
under different shock scenarios. Given the debt structure (average maturity of 6 years, 64 percent of
total debt at fixed interest rates, and only 31 percent of the debt in foreign exchange) the direct
interest and exchange rate pass-through to the budget is relatively slow. Only the impact of lower
GDP growth rates represents a significant threat to debt dynamic. While all public debt profile
indicators are below early warning benchmarks, the high external financing requirements point to
risks arising from the external debt position.
Baseline and Realism of Projections1


Debt-levels. Turkey’s favorable debt dynamics are underpinned by a primary surplus and
trend GDP growth above the real interest rate. A higher-than-projected fiscal effort in
2013 was more than compensated by the impact of a weaker than envisaged currency,
leading to a slightly higher debt to GDP ratio than previously envisaged. Nonetheless, staff
forecast that the ratio will continue its declining path from already moderate levels reaching
29.5 percent in 2019—down by 6.7 pp since end-2013. At 10 percent of GDP in 2013, gross
public financing needs have decline from 18.4 percent on average for 2003–2011—but will
remain high by the end of the projection period.



Growth. Past projections of growth outcomes show high forecast errors, possibly due to high
volatility of GDP in Turkey, but don’t seem to have a systematic bias that undermine the
assessment of sustainability. The current growth projections are below those of a year ago,
which lessens their positive impact in reducing the level of debt. The output gap is roughly
closed in 2014, and is projected to remain closed over the medium term. Turkey’s debt is
highly sensitive to big swings in GDP growth, highlighting the relevance of growth shocks in
the stress tests.



Sovereign yields. While Turkey’s yields remain quite volatile, they have decline from the
levels in the first quarter of 2014. The spreads against the US bonds in the last three months
remained on average at 217 bps, higher than its lowest value of 118 bps observed in May
2013. The effective interest rate is forecast to decline from 10 percent in 2013 to 8.8 percent
in 2014. In the medium term, the effect of lower inflation will counter the push from
international rates yielding slightly lower rates.

The new DSA framework is described in (http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2013/050913.pdf).



Fiscal adjustment. In the baseline the structural primary balance deteriorates due to lower
structural revenues and the primary spending drift linked to increasing budget rigidities. The
maximum projected 3-year adjustment of the cyclically-adjusted primary balance is close to
zero.



Maturity and rollover. Given current debt structure (average maturity of 6 years, 64 percent
share of fixed interest debt to total debt, and only 31 percent denominated in foreign
currency), the direct interest and exchange rate pass-through to the budget are small.

Shocks and Stress Tests


Primary balance shock. A deterioration of 1.0pp of GDP in the primary balance for 2 years
delays by 2 years the downward trend of debt-to-GDP ratio relative to the baseline.
Sovereign borrowing costs are pushed up (25 bps for each 1 percent of GDP worsening in
the primary balance). The impact on the debt-to-GDP ratio and gross financing needs levels
by 2019 is modest.



Growth shock. Real output growth rates are lowered by 1 standard deviation, or
4.6 percentage points, for 2 years starting in 2015. The decline in growth leads to lower
inflation (0.25 percentage points per 1 percentage point decrease in GDP growth). The
nominal primary balance deteriorates significantly compared to the baseline as nominal
revenues fall against unchanged expenditure plans, reaching -3.7 percent of GDP by 2016.
The deterioration in primary balance leads to higher sovereign borrowing costs (see above).
The debt-to-GDP ratio increases to about 42 percent during the growth shock and then
gradually trends down. By the end of the period, gross public financing needs climb toward
10 percent of GDP.



Interest rate shock. The real effective rate reaches similar levels as in 2009, which implies a
permanent increase in spreads by 682bps. The government’s interest bill climbs reaching an
implicit average interest rate of 12.2 percent by 2019. The debt-to-GDP ratio remains at low
levels reaching just 32.6 percent in 2019, and gross public financing needs reach around
11½ percent of GDP by 2019.



Contingent liability shock. A one-time bail out of the financial sector is assumed to
increase non-interest expenditures by 10 percent of banking sector assets.2 This is combined
with real GDP growth shock (1 standard deviation for 2 years). Sovereign borrowing costs are
pushed up (25 bps for each 1 percent of GDP worsening in the primary balance) while

2

This shock is equivalent to 5.4 percent of GDP. The shock could also be seen to cover (a combination of) other

contingencies, part of which could be a bailout of PPP projects. PPP projects with treasury investment guarantees
amount to 0.9 percent of GDP, while treasury guaranteed loans (outside the general government) amount to 1.2
percent of GDP.

inflation declines (0.25 percentage points per 1 percentage point decrease in GDP growth).
Debt rises to 42 percent of GDP in 2016 and then gradually declines. Gross public financing
needs increase to about 10 percent of GDP in the medium term.


Combined shock. A combined shock incorporates the largest effect of individual shocks on
all relevant variables (real GDP growth, inflation, primary balance, exchange rate and interest
rate). In the case of Turkey, a combined shock would increase debt to around 46.5 percent of
GDP, still below the average debt level between 2003 and 2011.

Real GDP Growth Shock

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TURKEY

Annex II. External Debt Sustainability
At nearly 50 percent of GDP, Turkey’s gross external debt is a source of vulnerability. Associated
with this high debt is a high external financing requirement of 27 percent of GDP. Over the
medium term, both external debt and gross financing needs are projected to remain elevated. The
debt path is robust to most stress tests, but susceptible to large depreciation shocks.
Turkey’s gross external debt is sustainable under the baseline and plausible alternative
scenarios, albeit with increased vulnerabilities. External debt stood at 47.4 percent of GDP at
end-2013, and is projected to remain around 50 percent of GDP over the medium term. The high
external debt stock reflects the country’s reliance on debt-creating inflows to finance the large
and persistent current account deficit. In this regard, Turkey has benefited from the loose global
liquidity conditions in recent years, but at the expense of increased external liabilities and the
associated volatility. The pace of external debt buildup is expected to moderate as the current
account deficit stabilizes and external funding conditions normalize.
Large external financing requirements create rollover risks. Turkey’s annual gross external
financing needs are large—around 27 percent of GDP in 2014—driven by the high current
account deficit and increased reliance on short-term financing. External debt sustainability
therefore is vulnerable to sudden and sustained shifts in international investors’ risk appetite,
which could trigger simultaneously an increase in borrowing costs and exchange rate pressure.
Over the medium term, gross financing needs are projected to come down slightly to around
24 percent of GDP, with some lengthening of debt maturities by the private sector.
Most external debt is long-term, but short-term debt has been increasing. The share of
short-term debt is expected to have peaked in 2013 at 33 percent of total, without further
buildup. As such, the share of short-term debt is projected to come down to around 26 percent
of total by 2019. Banks account for over 70 percent of short-term borrowings, with non-resident
deposits (classified as short-term debt) accounting for half that amount. Private creditors hold
68 percent of Turkey’s external debt, bond investors 20 percent, and official creditors the
remaining 12 percent.
Turkey’s external debt is robust to growth, interest rate, and current account shocks. To be
conservative, the standard growth shock of one-half standard deviation was replaced with a one
standard deviation shock equivalent to a 4.6 percentage-point reduction in growth. In the same
vein, the interest rate shock was customized to mirror the large increase in spreads experienced
in 2008. Under these scenarios, the standard current account balance shock, or a combination of
the three shocks, external debt would remain below 60 percent of GDP. However, Turkey’s
external debt sustainability is vulnerable to large exchange rate shocks. A sustained one-time
depreciation by 30 percent, with other variables following their baseline paths, would increase
external debt to almost 80 percent of GDP. In practice, however, this scenario is unlikely to
materialize as a shock of such magnitude would precipitate sharp adjustments in the current
account that would mitigate the impact on external debt.

Turkey
Foreign asset Background. Turkey’s net international investment position (NIIP) is about -48 percent of GDP, and is comparable to peers.
and liability
However, the composition of foreign liabilities has also worsened in recent years, with short-term debt liabilities accounting for
position and 16 percent of GDP.
trajectory
Assessment. The current net IIP level does not point to a solvency problem at this stage; however, if the current account deficit
does not narrow in the years ahead, the ongoing trend deterioration in IIP would present a challenge. Moreover, the
composition of foreign liabilities exposes Turkey to liquidity shocks.
Current
account

Background. The current account (CA) deficit increased to 7.9 percent of GDP in 2013, partly on the back of temporary gold
restocking. The deficit is expected to decrease to 6.3 percent of GDP in 2014.
Assessment. Turkey continues to suffer from low private saving. In 2013, domestic demand-led growth widened the deficit. The
EBA model estimates a 2013 CA gap of -5.7 percent of GDP. However, staff’s assessment is that the underlying CA in 2013 was
some 2½ to 5 percent of GDP weaker than the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. Tighter fiscal
and monetary policies would reduce this gap somewhat. Substantial currency depreciation in late 2013 and early 2014,
combined with tighter monetary policy and supporting macro-prudential measures that are expected to reduce domestic
demand, will likely lower the current account deficit. Thus a forward looking assessment for 2014, incorporating recent
developments, also lowers the CA gap.

Real
exchange
rate

Background. The real effective exchange rate (REER) has fluctuated considerably in recent years. From a peak in 2010, the REER
fell steeply in 2011 and then appreciated by 15–20 percent through early 2013; it then depreciated through the end of 2013, to
near its 2011 low. In 2014, the REER appreciated again; as of May, the REER was fairly close to its 2012 and 2013 year averages.
Assessment. Analyzing the 2013 year average REER, the EBA regression model estimates a 19 percent overvaluation. Consistent
with the CA assessment, the staff assessment is that the REER was 10–20 percent stronger on average in 2013 than the level
consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings.

Capital and
financial
accounts:
flows and
policy
measures

Background. Turkey has received substantial capital inflows in recent years. In 2013 net inflows (including net errors and
omissions) amounted to some 9 percent of GDP, thereby over-financing the current account deficit in the context of reserve
accumulation of about 1.2 percent of GDP. Short-term debt remains the predominant financing instrument. Amid shifting
external financial conditions, Turkey has not made use of capital controls on inflows or outflows.

FX
intervention
and reserves
level

Background. The lira exchange rate is floating, along with occasional intervention and reserve accumulation. In June 2013, the
central bank started selling foreign exchange to the banks through regular auctions. The cumulative total amount of these sales
reached US$17.6 billion in 2013. This continued in 2014, with cumulative interventions reaching US$20.2 billion at end-January.
Turkey’s gross reserves equaled 116 percent of the IMF composite adequacy metric at end-2013 versus 114 percent at end2012. Adjusting this metric for ROM-related reserve holdings reduced it to 95 percent at end-2013. Reserve cover of short term
debt declined from 83 percent in 2012 to 78 percent at end-2013. Further taking account of the current account deficit that
needs to be financed, reserve cover drops to 53 percent. Thus, reserves available for intervention are significantly lower than
gross reserves.

Overall Assessment

TURKEY

52

Annex III. External Stability Report Country Pages
Overall Assessment:
Turkey’s external position is substantially
weaker than the level consistent with
medium-term fundamentals and desirable
policy settings.
The current account deteriorated vis-à-vis
2012, as did external buffers. Net international
reserves are low, and Turkey remains
vulnerable to capital flow reversal.

Potential policy responses:
Given the country’s external imbalance, a
significantly tighter fiscal policy over the
medium term and continued structural reforms
geared at increasing private sector savings are
needed. In addition, monetary policy should
continue to keep real interest rates solidly in
positive territory. Finally, the CBRT should use
any opportunity to accumulate net
international reserves, limiting foreign
exchange intervention to support the currency
to smoothing periods of excessive volatility.

Assessment. Despite projected improvements in the current account deficit, short-term debt inflows expose Turkey’s private
sector to significant rollover risks. Gross external financing needs are estimated at over 25 percent of GDP in 2014. In an
environment of tighter global liquidity, the likelihood of risks materializing has increased.

TURKEY

Assessment. Given Turkey’s low net international reserves, reserve accumulation is warranted.

Turkey (continued)
Technical
Backgroun
d Notes

1/ The assessment that the current account is 2½–5 percent weaker than medium-term fundamentals is based on the fact that the 5.7 gap identified by the EBA current account
analysis is mainly a result of an unexplained regression residual, as well as staff’s assessment that the current account deficit norm for an emerging market economy catching up to
developed countries is likely to be higher than the -0.9 percent norm estimated by the EBA regression.
2/ The EBA analysis of the REER identified a 19 percent overvaluation whereas the result of the External Sustainability (ES) Approach translates into a 16 percent REER overvaluation.
Given that by April 2014 the REER has depreciated by some
8 percent from the 2013 average REER and that unexplained regression residual accounts for all of the overvaluation identified in the EBA REER exercise, staff’s assessment is that
the REER valuation is in the range of 0–10 percent.

The CBRT starts paying an interest rate on banks and
financing companies’ required reserves (RR) in TRL.
The interest rate on RR will be the weighted average
cost of the CBRT’s funding rate minus 700bps for all
banks for 2014. Starting with 2015, the interest rate on
RR will be the weighted average cost of the CBRT’s
funding rate minus 500bps for banks and financing
companies that have a core funding (i.e.,
(deposit+shareholder’s equity)/credit) ratio higher
than the sector average and that maintain or increase
their own core funding ratios with regard to the
reference period, and minus 700bps for the remaining
banks and financing companies.

WORLD BANK RELATIONS
1.
Turkey and the World Bank Group have a strong partnership, which has continuously
deepened. Turkey’s National Development Plans form the basis of the partnership between Turkey and
the World Bank Group. The Ninth (2007–13) and the new Tenth Development Plan (2014–18) overlap the
CPS period. The main pillars of both Development Plans are fully consistent with the CPS. With the CPS
Progress Report endorsed in October 2014, the CPS FY12-15 is extended by one year to include FY16.
The three main strategic objectives and CPS pillars; namely (i) enhanced competitiveness and
employment; (ii) improved equity and social services; and (iii) deepened sustainable development remain
highly relevant. The CPS PR reflects less than anticipated demand for lending in support of education and
increased emphasis on governance and transparency as critical elements of Turkey’s competitiveness. The
CPS PR also aligns the WBG’s engagement with the new WBG Strategy and its twin goals of boosting
shared prosperity and eradicating poverty.
2.
The CPS has delivered financing of over US$5.5 billion during FY12-14. The distribution is:
US$2.7 billion through IBRD, US$2.8 billion through IFC, and US$65 million through MIGA. In addition,
IBRD lending over US$1.15 million has already been approved in FY15. The IBRD financing envelope for
the five year CPS-period is expected to be up to US$6.45 billion with US$3 billion combined in FY15 and
16 reflecting the additional exposure available following the increase in the IBRD Single Borrower Limit.
IFC’s own-account investment program in Turkey is expected to be in the range of US$600-650 million
each in FY15 and FY16.
3.
Turkey’s development priorities provide ample opportunities for unlocking value from
closer cooperation across the WBG and other partners. The energy sector is an example where IBRD
work on the regulatory framework has helped unlock significant IFC supported private investment to
expand renewable energy and energy efficiency. The same opportunity presents itself in the health
sector, the railway sector, the municipal sector and in PPPs more generally, with the health sector most
advanced. In the financial sector, the combined balance sheet and product range of the WBG will be
mobilized to increase the domestic funding pool and attract longer term financing, particularly to benefit
Turkish exporters and SMEs and infrastructure financing. The World Bank Group engages with civil
society in the preparation and implementation of projects and collaborates closely with other
development partners such as the IMF, the EU, UN organizations, and other key bilateral partners

A. International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
4.
Turkey is the IBRD’s fourth largest borrower in terms of debt outstanding. Turkey’s active
portfolio of investment operations with the World Bank’s IBRD financing includes 13 projects with total
net commitments of US$5.742 billion (as of September 2014). The investment portfolio and pipeline
support the energy sector, financial and private sector development, urban development, natural
resource management and health.

Turkey greatly values the WB’s knowledge work. The large analytical and advisory program
with around 40 tasks during FY12-14 is carried out with the Government and a broad range of
stakeholders. Major tasks are focused on long-term structural and institutional issues, including
improvements in the investment climate, how to boost trade competitiveness and regional trade
integration, promote skills and job creation, and orient fiscal policy to support growth. A growing area of
common interest is to share Turkey’s lessons with other developing countries. A new World Bank Report
‘Turkey’s Transitions: Integration, Inclusion, and Institutions’ looks at Turkey’s lessons learned over the
last 30 years. Going forward the engagement will focus on a more programmatic approach of our
knowledge service delivery and the introduction of reimbursable advisory services (RAS).
6.
The Turkey program is supported by selected Trust Funds. The Turkey Trust Fund portfolio
currently consists of 37 Recipient or Bank-executed Trust Funds. They amount to US$167.3 million, with
the bulk of funding (US$150 million) accounted for by the Clean Technology Fund (CTF).

B. International Finance Corporation
7.
Turkey, a member of IFC since 1956, is IFC’s second-largest client. IFC’s work in Turkey is part
of the joint World Bank/IFC CPS. From 2008 to 2011, IFC invested US$3.7 billion in 47 projects in Turkey,
including US$2 billion from IFC’s own account. In the same period, IFC mobilized about US$1.7 billion. In
2010, IFC established its Istanbul office as the first IFC Operations Center. Today it is IFC’s largest office
outside of Washington, DC, with 200 staff serving 52 countries in the Europe, Middle East, and North
Africa region. As of December 31, 2013, IFC’s investments in Turkey during FY12–14 have been over
US$2.1 billion, exceeding the expected investment program in Turkey for the FY12–15 CPS period.

C. Multilateral Guarantee Agency
8.
Turkey is MIGA’s 10th largest country by gross exposure representing about 3.5 percent of
MIGA’s gross portfolio. Portfolio consists of 4 projects with gross exposure of US$432 million or
US$238 million net of reinsurance and all in the infrastructure sector (as of August 2014). Turkey will be
the subject of targeted MIGA business development efforts to unlock opportunities for credit
enhancement—as well as political risk insurance coverage. The most promising opportunities for MIGA at
this point in time seem to lie in the financial sector (supporting on-lending to Small and Medium
Enterprises (SMEs) and exporters), urban transport, as well as public private partnerships (PPPs) in the
health care sector. Prospective MIGA support for outgoing Turkish investment, supporting backward
linkages with the Turkish economy, is focused on manufacturing projects in the MNA region.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision to the Fund is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, despite
certain shortcomings.
Real Sector Statistics
2.
Price Statistics: Data on producer and consumer prices are published monthly, with a
short lag. The consumer price index (CPI) and the producer price index (PPI) generally conform to
international standards. The methodology of the CPI was improved with the introduction of a 2003
based index, and this new CPI has been in effect since 2005. The methodology of the CPI was further
improved in 2009 to take account of the prices of telecommunication services. The CPI does not
cover owner-occupied dwellings, commodities produced by households for own consumption, and
expenditures on commodities obtained through in-kind payments. The PPI is compiled only by
product (and not by economic activity).
3.
National Accounts: Quarterly national accounts are published with a 2-3 month lag.
The Turkish Statistical Institute (TURKSTAT) compiles and disseminates quarterly GDP by production
and expenditure approaches, in current prices and in volume terms. The annual GDP is a sum of the
four quarters. The GDP by income approach was estimated for 2002–2012, but the results are not
yet published. The main weaknesses of the system for compiling quarterly GDP at current prices are
the lack of annual benchmarks and the reliance of fixed ratios that are outdated (ratios from the
2002 Supply and Use Tables (SUTs) are used). During the last year, provisional versions of SUTs for
2009, 2010, and 2011 have been compiled. These versions will be updated with the 2012 SUTs and
will be available by the end of 2014. TURKSTAT will disseminate national accounts based on the
System of National Accounts 2008 (2008 SNA)/The European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010) at
the end of 2015. Sectoral financial balance sheets are compiled for financial corporations on a
quarterly basis, and for the general government and nonfinancial corporations on an annual basis.
The financial accounts for the remaining sectors (households and rest of the world) will be
disseminated by the end of 2014 and a full set of financial accounts including flows, in 2015.
Monthly data on industrial production are published with a lag of five to six weeks.

4.
There is a wide range of data on labor market developments, with the biannual
Household Labor Force Survey (HLFS) replaced with a monthly survey at the beginning
of 2000. HLFS is published every month. Coverage of wage developments in the private sector has
improved through the use of quarterly surveys of the manufacturing sector.
Government Finance Statistics
5.
Budgetary data are published monthly, with a lag of some 2−3 weeks. Coverage of the
budget is incomplete, with some fiscal operations conducted through extra budgetary funds, for
which data are available only with long lags. Fiscal analysis is further complicated by some quasiINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TURKEY

fiscal operations carried out by state banks, state economic enterprises (SEEs), and other public
entities; and technical problems associated with consolidating the cash-based accounts of
governmental entities with the accrual-based accounting of SEEs. It is difficult to reconcile fiscal data
with monetary and BOP data, especially in the accounting of external debt flows and central
government deposits.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
6.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Data on the central bank balance sheet, and
provisional data on the main monetary aggregates and total domestic credit, are published
weekly, with a one- and two-week lag, respectively. Data on the monetary survey and deposit
interest rates are published monthly, with a one month lag, except for year-end data, where the lag
is two months.
7.
Public data on banks’ external funding could be improved. The CBRT reports data on
banks’ foreign assets and liabilities. However, these include data on transactions with banks’
branches abroad that are classified as nonresidents in accordance with the IMF’s Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual and from the BOP perspective. The Banking Regulatory and Supervision
Agency (BRSA) maintains data on the consolidated banking sector, which are compiled based on the
Basel principles with more accurate information on the true foreign assets and liabilities; however,
these data are not currently disseminated in a public report.
8.
Financial sector surveillance: In the area of financial soundness indicators (FSIs), the BRSA
reports all 12 core FSIs, 12 of the 13 encouraged FSIs for deposit takers, and 11 of the other
encouraged FSIs—two FSIs for other financial corporations, three FSIs for the nonfinancial corporations
sector, one FSI for households, two FSIs for market liquidity, and three FSIs for real estate markets. The
FSI data and metadata for Turkey are posted on the Fund’s FSI website.
External Sector Statistics
9.
External sector statistics: External sector statistics are compiled in broad conformity with
the conceptual framework of the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5).
Data Standards and Quality
10.
Turkey subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). The latest Data
ROSC was published in September 2009.
Reporting to STA
11.
Turkey reports fiscal data for publication in the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook. The latest data available are for 2012 and cover the general government sector and its
subsectors with coverage of both stocks and flows, including a full general government balance

sheet. Monthly data are reported on an irregular basis for publication in International Financial
Statistics (IFS), starting from September 2009.
12.
The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) reports to STA the Standardized
Report Forms 1SR for the Central Bank and 2SR for the Other Depository Corporations on a
monthly basis with a one month lag. The SRF 4SR for Other Financial Corporations has been
reported to the Fund on a quarterly basis from May 2014 and published in IFS from the July 2014
issue.
13.
The CBRT reports quarterly BOP data to STA with about two months lag; in May 2012, it
started reporting quarterly IIP data from 2006 onward. The CBRT participates in the Coordinated
Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) and Coordinated Direct investment Survey (CDIS). For CPIS,
starting with end-June 2013 data, the CBRT reports with semi-annual frequency and enhanced
scope, including data on the institutional sector of the nonresident issuers of securities, and on the
institutional sector of the resident holder cross-classified by the institutional sector of selected
nonresident issuers. In addition, the CBRT commenced reporting encouraged additional detail on
the currency composition of portfolio investment holdings.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 21, 2014

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Turkey
On November 21, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Turkey.1
Turkey’s economy has grown on average by 6 percent annually since 2010, but this has come at
the expense of a large external deficit making the economy sensitive to changes in external
financing conditions. Macroeconomic policies have been too accommodative, inflation is high
and well above the authorities’ target, real policy interest rates remain negative, and the
exchange rate continues to be stronger than suggested by fundamentals. These imbalances are
holding back growth potential and increasing risks. They need to be addressed with carefully
sequenced macroeconomic policies and structural reforms aimed at increasing aggregate savings,
competitiveness and potential output.
The financial system remains well capitalized with non performing loans low and well
provisioned. However, banks are increasingly reliant on external wholesale funding in foreign
exchange and, in tandem, have increased their indirect foreign exchange risk.
The main risk for Turkey remains a capital flows reversal, associated with monetary policy
normalization in advance economies or changes in the country risk premium. Other risks center
on slower European growth, geopolitical issues and the strength of the policy framework.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Turkey’s positive growth and employment performance in recent
years, and commended the authorities for weathering well financial market turbulence in
early 2014. However, Directors noted that high inflation, a large external deficit, and reliance on
external financing pose vulnerabilities and could put pressures on the economy. Against this
background, they emphasized that macroeconomic policies should be geared towards
rebalancing the economy, lowering inflation, and strengthening buffers together with ambitious
structural reforms aimed at boosting domestic savings and fully realizing Turkey’s economic
potential.
Directors agreed that fiscal policy should play a bigger role in addressing external vulnerabilities
and reducing the burden on monetary policy, while providing space for greater spending in
priority areas. Accordingly, they supported the fiscal tightening envisaged in the 2015 budget
and the substantial increase in the primary surplus within the 2015-17 medium-term program,
although a few Directors saw merit in a more ambitious pace of adjustment. Directors agreed that
consolidation efforts should primarily focus on improving spending efficiency and limiting
current expenditure growth while preserving capital investment.
While welcoming the monetary tightening in early 2014, Directors generally called for a
renewed focus on reducing the inflation rate, by setting and sustaining a positive real policy rate
to reduce inflation and anchor expectations. Most Directors also encouraged further
normalization of the monetary policy framework, which would improve communications and
strengthen monetary transmission. A few Directors were of the view that the monetary policy
framework could have multiple objectives, taking into account the various challenges the country
faces. Directors highlighted that increasing foreign exchange reserves, as market conditions
permit, will help strengthen resilience.
Directors noted that the financial system remains sound and well capitalized but called for
continued vigilance. They welcomed the success of recent macroprudential measures to limit
consumer credit growth, and to encourage more core funding in the banking sector. Directors
recommended additional steps to curb growth in wholesale foreign exchange funding and to
reduce incentives for the non-financial corporate sector to take on exchange rate risk. They
commended the significant progress made in enhancing Turkey’s AML/CFT framework.

2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3
Directors emphasized the importance of increasing national savings, particularly private savings,
and reducing reliance on external financing. They encouraged the authorities to move forward
with the ambitious reform agenda included in the 10th Development Plan, giving priority to
increasing private sector savings, improving competitiveness and the business climate, and
sustaining education and labor market reforms to boost productivity.

Statement by Mr. Ibrahim Canakci, Executive Director for Turkey and Mr. Cem Gokcen,
Advisor to Executive Director
November 21, 2014
We would like to thank staff for the comprehensive and informative set of papers that provide an
in-depth analysis of the Turkish economy and financial system. Our authorities appreciate the
thorough and candid discussions with the Article IV mission.
The Turkish economy registered a notable recovery in the wake of the global economic crisis
and expanded by 5.5 percent on average between 2010 and 20141. Unlike the economic plague
described as jobless recovery, buoyant growth in Turkey translated into 5.7 million new jobs
since total employment dipped in 2009. A widening external deficit and inflationary pressures,
however, have emerged as side effects of the recovery, driven by strong credit expansion and
domestic absorption.
The staff report characterizes the improvements in the external accounts as cyclical. However,
the authorities view that the prudent policy mix was the driving force behind the rebalancing
even in the most recent period, while acknowledging that cyclical factors have also provided
some support. In fact, it should be noted that starting from the second half of 2011, the
authorities responded in a timely manner and introduced a set of measures to limit domestic
demand growth and contain a rapid increase in credit and a widening in the current account
deficit. In response to tight fiscal policies, monetary policy response and macroprudential
measures, credit growth remained within the authorities’ indicative limits and the current account
deficit-to-GDP ratio declined by 3.6 percentage points to 6.1 percent in 2012. Furthermore,
consumer price inflation plummeted to 6.2 percent in 2012 year-end, the lowest level in the last
25 years. In view of the reemergence of inflationary pressures and a widening current account
deficit in 2013, additional macroprudential measures were put in place and monetary policy was
tightened in late 2013 and early 2014.
The overall macroeconomic setting remains stable. The electoral cycle will end in the first half of
2015, and no elections are scheduled to take place between mid-2015 and 2019, which will
provide a window of opportunity for major structural reforms. Notwithstanding external shocks,
the Turkish economy is on track to grow at a sustainable pace. Denting the external imbalance,
maintaining price stability and upholding the reform momentum remain the overarching
objectives. Fiscal policy will be supportive of the rebalancing process and relieve the pressure on
monetary policy while contributing to the growth momentum and domestic savings. Monetary
policy is focused on price stability with financial stability under its radar. The authorities will
pursue an ambitious reform agenda.

Recent Macroeconomic Developments
Growth
After the strong growth reading in the first quarter of 2014, economic activity lost some steam.
Private expenditures waned in the second quarter as macroprudential measures kicked in late
2013 to early 2014 while public spending remained weak. A contraction in the agricultural sector
and the negative contribution from the construction sector weighed on growth. In the first half of
2014, year-on-year growth remained moderate at around 3.3 percent, while net exports’
contribution to the headline figure was 2.7 percent.
Leading indicators—except for investment demand—point to a revival in economic activity
amid relatively weak performance in the second quarter. In September, industrial production
gained pace and grew by 9.3 percent in annual terms. Subdued growth, especially in the major
trading partners, and geopolitical tensions may limit export growth. GDP growth is likely to be
around 3.3 in 2014, a tad higher than staff’s expectations, with external demand contributing
2 percentage points.
External Balance
Improvement in the real exchange rate, moderate credit expansion and demand rebalancing
supported the adjustment in the current account deficit. September current account deficit data
came in at US $2.2 billion, which brings down the 12 month rolling deficit from US $48.9 billion
to US $46.7 billion. Total exports, mainly driven by demand from European countries, are
expected to reach US $161 billion in 2014. Imports will be around US $244 billion and the
current account deficit will plunge to 5.6 percent of GDP in 2014, which is almost 1 percentage
point better than envisaged at the beginning of the year.
The rising trend in the share of FDI and long-term capital flows, which includes banking and the
real sectors’ long-term net credit and bonds issued by banks and non-financial sectors, in the
financing mix highlights the improvement in external deficit financing.
Inflation
Inflation hovered above the target triggered mostly by high domestic food prices and FX
pass-through. Negative supply-side shocks brought about by the adverse weather conditions put
significant pressure on food prices and contributed to the divergence between international and
domestic food prices. The strong FX pass-through and tax hikes on automobiles also fueled the
headline rate.
After climbing to 14.4 percent in August 2014, annual food price inflation eased to 12.6 percent
in October on the back of the deceleration in unprocessed food inflation. The food price
inflation’s contribution to the headline figure was 3.1 percentage points in October. The
deterioration in core inflation started to fade recently and the core inflation trend improved in the
third quarter reflecting the impacts of the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential
measures. Yet, administrative price adjustments in natural gas and electricity tariffs in October

3
and still high food prices delayed the improvement in the headline figure. The Central Bank of
the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) expects year-end inflation to be around 8.9 percent.
Outlook: Medium-Term Program for 2015–2017
Main Objectives
Built upon a cautious, realistic and consistent macroeconomic framework, the Medium-Term
Program (MTP), unveiled in early October, aims at further strengthening macroeconomic
fundamentals and addressing major challenges, which are underlined in staff’s analysis. Policies
and structural reforms scheduled for implementation in the next three years are geared towards
maintaining price stability, improving external imbalances and bolstering domestic savings.
The MTP’s objectives also include reorienting resources to more productive sectors, enhancing
production capacity and technological advancements as well as improving export contribution to
GDP growth and boosting productivity.
Macroeconomic Projections
The authorities are more sanguine on the growth outlook, expected improvement in the external
deficit and the inflation rate in the medium term.
Growth is projected to rise gradually to 4 percent next year and 5 percent in 2016 and 2017 on
account of investments especially in the productive sectors, which will mostly be financed by
increasing domestic savings, and productivity gains, particularly in the industrial sector. Private
fixed investments will revive and grow by 8.7 percent on average during the MTP’s time frame.
Estimated gains in total factor productivity, which held back growth in the last two years, will be
one of the factors boosting growth going forward.
Having remained attentive to macroeconomic stability, the authorities will restrain the increase
in private consumption beyond household disposable income growth. This will be mostly done
through prudential measures. Private savings are expected to rise from 11.7 percent in 2014 to
13.1 percent in 2017, making an important contribution to the increase in the domestic savings
ratio. With a tight fiscal policy stance in place, the public sector will also continue to contribute
to domestic savings.
Against the background of higher domestic savings, favorable oil prices and measures to
suppress the reliance on imports, the current account deficit will remain contained at around
5 percent of GDP, notwithstanding the surge in GDP growth. The recent fall in oil prices, if
sustained, would help achieving a much sharper reduction in the current account deficit despite
the sluggish growth trend in Turkey’s major export markets.
Following the exchange rate stabilization, the FX pass-through is expected to die out by the end
of 2015 and open up room for a decline in the inflation rate. Inflation is expected to fall to
6.3 percent at the end of 2015 based on the assumption that domestic food prices normalize, oil
prices remain stable and exchange rate effects gradually weaken. Going forward, a tight fiscal

4
policy stance will be an essential factor contributing to the monetary guardian’s fight against
inflation. In the medium term, inflation is forecast to converge to the target.
Macroeconomic Policies and Structural Reforms
Fiscal Policy
Fiscal discipline remains intact. The authorities plan to limit current expenditure growth in an
effort to rein in the public investment-savings deficit while capital spending will be reoriented to
infrastructure spending and R&D investments. The total public sector primary surplus will
increase by 1.4 percentage points to 1.8 percent of GDP in 2017 with the public sector overall
balance yielding a surplus of 0.1 percent of GDP. Improvement in the primary surplus will
decrease public debt to 28.5 percent of GDP in 2017.
As a cornerstone of Turkey’s macroeconomic policy setting, fiscal discipline will help to prop up
domestic savings and provide the necessary space that may be required for structural reforms.
Strong public balances will also support the CBRT’s mandate to maintain price stability. 2015
draft budget law is crafted to strike the right balance between strengthening infrastructure,
improving quality of public services and maintaining fiscal discipline. The authorities are also
focused on maximizing the contribution of public investments to growth, and improving the
resource allocation and efficiency of public spending. Education and healthcare spending will
continue to receive a major share of the budget, with education spending constituting
22.5 percent of tax revenues.
The new Income Tax Law, submitted to the Parliament, will broaden the tax base, make the tax
system fairer and enforce voluntary tax compliance. New policies are in the pipeline that will
modernize the tax procedures law and streamline stamp duty and other charges that will lower
the cost of doing business. The authorities are also committed to effectively fight against the
informal economy.
Monetary Policy
The FX market came under pressure due to heightened financial market woes in emerging
markets and country-specific factors at the end of 2013. The CBRT provided FX liquidity
through foreign exchange selling auctions and directly intervened in the FX market when the
pricing mechanism was impaired. In an effort to contain the adverse implications of market
jitters on price and macroeconomic stability, the CBRT hiked the one week repo rate by 550
basis points to 10 percent in January 2014. Furthermore, the monetary policy framework was
simplified with Turkish Lira liquidity provided mostly at the one week repo rate. Frontloaded
monetary tightening proved effective as risk premia recovered notably in the second quarter,
which also reflects diminished domestic uncertainties.
Amid improvements in the global liquidity conditions and the external and domestic sentiment,
and signs that the cumulative impact of the currency depreciation on inflation steadily declines,
the CBRT initiated a series of measured rate cuts to roll back frontloaded tightening early this
year. A first rate change in April 2014 slashed the late liquidity window lending rate to

5
13.5 percent. The CBRT cut the one-week repo rate by a cumulative 175 basis points between
May–July 2014. In the meantime, with a recent tightening in its liquidity policy, the CBRT kept
the yield curve flat, which confirms the tight monetary policy stance.
The CBRT remains vigilant to avoid a deterioration in inflation expectations that may affect
pricing dynamics and hence the inflation outlook. There is a broad range of instruments in its
toolkit including policy rates, macroprudential policies, a reserve requirement ratio and liquidity
policy, which can be used to manage inflation expectations. Judgments based merely on the level
of policy rates may not give an exact impression about the monetary policy stance. Liquidity
policy and the effective cost of funding from the CBRT should also be taken into account in
order to get a clear and complete picture of the monetary policy. Taking all tools in place into
consideration, the authorities believe that financial conditions are tight and will quell the
inflation rate.
The authorities concur with the staff’s assessment that reserve buffers need to be bolstered
though the current pace of accumulation seems appropriate. The CBRT receives FX flows from
export rediscount credits. Through export rediscount credits, which are extended to companies
through intermediary banks in domestic currency and repaid by companies in FX, a total of US
$12.9 billion will be added to the reserves in 2014.
Financial Sector Policies
The Turkish banking system remains robust and resilient with the average capital adequacy ratio
well above regulatory standards, strong asset quality, and ample liquidity buffers. Regulatory and
supervisory standards are compatible with international standards. Despite the recent volatility in
the currency markets and interest rates increase, the non-performing loans ratio remained well
anchored at about 2–3 percent. The average capital adequacy ratio is 15.9 percent and the capital
structure is mainly composed of core equity. The stress test results of both the CBRT and the
Banking Regulation and Supervision Authority (BRSA) indicate that, as a whole, the sector is
resilient to idiosyncratic shocks.
In light of the strong pickup in consumer lending, the authorities put in place a set of prudential
measures to limit the growth trend to more balanced levels and reorient resources to more
productive sectors. Credit card spending with installments has been the major driving force of
the total credit card balance growth in the last five years. Following the first round of changes in
credit card limits and maturity limits on consumer loans in the last quarter of 2013, the number
of installments on credit card spending was limited to 9 months in early 2014. Additionally,
loan-to-value requirements for car loans were differentiated based on the value of cars. Higher
funding costs were reflected in the consumer and commercial lending rates. Macroprudential
measures pursued by the banking watchdog weighed especially on consumer credit demand.
Consumer lending growth slowed down significantly from 27.8 percent in 2013 to 14.3 percent
in mid-September on FX adjusted terms, whereas commercial loan growth remained robust.
The CBRT announced that the Turkish Lira component of required reserves will be remunerated,
where the rate of remuneration will be based on the financial institutions’ core liability ratios.
This will be instrumental in encouraging banks to manage balance sheets cautiously and thus

6
strengthen financial stability. The remuneration rate will be the weighted average cost of the
CBRT’s funding rate minus 700 basis points for all banks and financing companies for
November-December 2014. Starting from 2015, for financial institutions with core liability ratios
above the sector’s average remuneration rate will equal the weighted average cost of the CBRT
funding minus 500 basis points. For those with ratios below the average rate will be weighted
average cost of the CBRT funding minus 700 basis points.
New prudential measures are in the pipeline. There is ongoing work on collecting household
income data that may be used as a basis to introduce caps on the level of household debt to
income. In the meantime, the Turkish Parliament authorized the Ministry of Finance to introduce
a partial tax deductibility on corporate debt. This prudential measure would basically lower the
tax deductibility threshold on debt from 100 percent to 90 for companies with a total debt to
assets ratio above 50 percent. The Ministry of Finance has not implemented this measure so far,
but it remains in the authorities’ toolkit.
The direct and indirect FX risks which the Turkish banking system is exposed to are limited and
manageable. The banking sector FX loans to the non-financial corporates (NFCs) are subject to
strict underwriting rules and loans are highly collateralized. Historically, the NPL ratio for FX
loans has been under 1 percent. Banks’ external FX funding rollover ratio remains above 100
percent and they have not experienced any difficulty to rollover their FX funding. Total FX bond
issuances by Turkish banks abroad grew by 46.1 percent year-on-year in 2014 and reached US
$23 billion with an average maturity longer than 5 years. Banks have substantial amounts of FX
deposits at the CBRT kept as part of ROM and FX reserve requirements. Moreover, the CBRT
stands ready to provide around US $10.8 billion to banks through its lender of last resort facility
should they face FX rollover problems. Rates for US$ and euros stand at 7.5 and 6.5 percent,
respectively. Even though this is a relatively costly facility, the CBRT may adjust its cost and
limits available to the banks depending on the new conditions to provide additional relief.
The FX risk of NFCs is lower than implied by macroeconomic data. A micro-based study by the
CBRT revealed that FX borrowing of many NFCs is naturally hedged. 63 percent of real sector
companies do not have FX loans, while 68 percent of companies having FX loans generate
export receipts, which eliminate FX risk. Anecdotal evidence also shows that some of the loans
are covered by FX collateral. NFCs were able to rollover their external debt in the last four years
as the external debt roll-over ratio remained above 100 percent.
Structural Reforms
The authorities are determined to step up the reform process, paving the way for a major leap
forward in Turkey’s economy. To provide a clear and holistic framework and prioritize the
implementation of reforms, 25 comprehensive transformation programs were mapped out in
parallel with the 10th Development Plan, a roadmap that lays out the medium-term perspectives
and policies required to reach the 2023 targets.
The first reform package, unveiled in November, includes nine transformation programs and 417
action plans. The primary goal is to improve the value added of exports and lower the
dependency on imports in energy. Industry specific measures will be designed to increase

7
productivity and competitiveness. In response to these policies, the export-import coverage ratio,
which stood at 60 percent in 2013, is estimated to soar to 70 percent in 2018. Special emphasis is
put on innovation, R&D and technology development. The government will support startup
companies especially in the innovative fields along with investments in technology intensive
production in several sectors.
Domestic resource utilization in energy production and energy efficiency is essential to lower the
energy import bill, which constituted approximately 22 percent of total imports in 2013. The
authorities will develop new financing models and incentives for energy efficiency investments,
encourage capacity improvements in renewable energy and promote efficient use of domestic
coal resources.
With the remaining transformation programs in the pipeline the authorities will address the
weaknesses in the labor market, improve the business climate, and bolster competitiveness and
productivity.
