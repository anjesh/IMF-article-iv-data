STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Context. The growth slowdown continued in 2013, reflecting pre-existing structural
reasons, despite accommodative policies. The fallout from geopolitical tensions relating
to Ukraine is bringing the economy to a standstill. Fiscal tightening is expected this year
as the non-oil deficit remains near record high. In response to mounting pressures on the
ruble, the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) raised interest rates to address risks to mediumterm inflation and increased intervention to support the ruble. Some structural reforms
were initiated, including a partial pension reform and a new procurement law.
Near-term macroeconomic policy mix. Faced with exceptional circumstances, policies
should aim at preserving macroeconomic stability. A tighter monetary stance is required
over the next year to attain the 2015 inflation target. The CBR should resume its policy
towards greater exchange rate flexibility as soon as the current uncertainty subsidies.
Modest fiscal tightening, despite the economic slowdown, appears justified as output
remains close to potential. Adhering to the fiscal rule is essential to support its credibility
and the needed medium-term fiscal consolidation.
Medium-term policy challenges. Structural reforms remain essential to enhance
Russia’s growth potential. Continued efforts at global integration are necessary to attract
investment and boost potential growth. Reforms discussed in the context of the stalled
OECD accession negotiations should continue, including improving labor markets and
reducing tax burden, administrative barriers, and corruption. Pushing ahead with the
privatization plans should enhance economic efficiency. Additional fiscal consolidation in
outer years is recommended to rebuild buffers and to safeguard intergenerational equity.

CONTEXT
1.
Russia’s growth is slowing because of pre-existing structural reasons and the fallout
from geopolitical tensions. The growth slowdown that started in 2011 continued in 2013 despite
accommodative policies as the economy hit capacity constraints. The fallout from recent geopolitical
tensions relating to Ukraine and, to a lesser extent, the turmoil in emerging markets (EM) following
the Fed’s discussion of tapering unconventional monetary policy are bringing the economy to a
standstill.

This follows an almost doubling
of Russia’s real GDP per capita over
2000-2012. During that period, growth also
contributed to a significant decline in
poverty rates and unemployment. However,
after almost 15 years of growth based on
rising oil prices, macroeconomic
stabilization, and increasing use of spare
resources, this growth framework has
reached its limits.

Source: Haver Analytics.
3.
The authorities had begun taking
some steps toward addressing the structural bottlenecks. Since the 2008–09 crisis, the Russian
authorities have strengthened their macroeconomic framework with the introduction of a fiscal rule,
a transition toward inflation targeting and a more flexible exchange rate. Some structural reforms
were initiated: the introduction of procurement and anti-corruption laws, measures to strengthen the
judicial system, the creation of a Federal Business Ombudsman and a number of initiatives aimed at
improving the business and regulatory environment. However, the privatization agenda has stalled
and other structural bottlenecks continue to hamper growth, seriously constraining its long-term
potential.

4.
Geopolitical uncertainties are taking a heavy toll on an already weak economy.
Following Russia's actions in Crimea, a number of countries imposed sanctions on Russian individuals
and entities (Box 1). Concern about a possible escalation of sanctions has increased the uncertainty
of doing business in Russia and is having a chilling effect on investment, while bond issuance has
declined sharply. This comes at a crucial moment when the old growth model based on energy and
use of spare capacity has been exhausted and moving to a new growth model based on
diversification requires new investment, including foreign technology. Moreover, this risks derailing
the reform agenda and a shift toward more emphasis on economic self-reliance rather than
integration with the rest of the world.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
5.
Growth in 2013 slowed despite accommodative policies and high oil prices (Figure 1).
Growth slowed to 1.3 percent in 2013 due to a contraction in investment—mainly reflecting
destocking of inventories and a reduction in state-owned enterprises’ capital spending—while
consumption remained robust owing to strong real wage growth and an unsecured consumer credit
boom. Net exports also contributed to growth in 2013, but the share of non-oil exports in the
economy continued to decline. Inflation remains above the CBR target. The slowdown appears
principally structural and the output gap remained small (Selected Issues Paper).

Box 1. Sanctions and Counter-Sanctions
The United States, the European Union (EU), Japan, Switzerland, and other countries, have adopted
sanctions against Ukrainian and Russian individuals and entities in response to the unfolding situation in
Ukraine, as well as the suspension of bilateral negotiations on a variety of topics. The EU has also
suspended a number of bilateral discussions and imposed travel restrictions and financial sanctions.
Canada, Switzerland, and Australia have announced their own programs of financial sanctions. A number
of non-EU member European countries have aligned their national policies with EU decisions.
To date, the actual targets and measures taken differ across jurisdictions. For example, around
45 individuals and 20 companies have been designated for financial sanctions by the United States, while
the EU named about 70 individuals and fewer than 5 companies. In addition, the U.S. Department of
Commerce has announced that it will deny export licenses for any high-technology items that could
contribute to Russian military capabilities and revoke any existing export licenses that meet these
conditions.
On March 20 and March 24, Russia imposed retaliatory sanctions on U.S. and Canadian government
officials. Russia also passed a bill to create a national payment system insulated from foreign companies’
influence, and is considering the creation of a national rating agency.

Fiscal policy became more accommodative in 2013. The general government balance
moved from an overall surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP in 2012 to a deficit of 1.3 percent of GDP in
2013, owing to weak revenues due to the economic slowdown and increased VAT refunds after the
completion of large infrastructure projects. Russia continues to rely on oil revenues, as evidenced by
a general government non-oil deficit of more than 12 percent of GDP. As a consequence, close to
80 percent of the oil revenues targeted for savings in the Reserve Fund (RF) were used to offset the
decline in non-oil revenues and worse-than-expected privatization receipts. Hence, despite high oil
prices, the RF remains well below the 7 percent targeted by the authorities. A timid and incomplete
pension reform was introduced (Box 2).
Box 2. Pension Reform
The fiscal viability of the Russian public pension system is concerning.1 The main problem is a low
statutory retirement age (60 for men and 55 for women) given the expected demographic dynamics
and the many exemptions making the effective retirement age even lower.
The reform introduced in December 2013 did not increase the statutory retirement age. Starting in
2015, contributors will earn notional pension points over their working life. The value of notional
points will be assessed annually based on the system’s revenue (including government transfers to
be decided annually) divided by the sum of all notional points earned by pensioners. Other changes
to the system include: (i) providing financial incentives to delay retirement; (ii) increasing the
contribution rate for self-employed and hazardous jobs; (iii) increasing the minimum requirement of
years worked from 6 to 15, before claiming a pension; and (iv) introducing a threshold of notional
points before claiming benefits. These changes will increase the effective retirement age. A person
earning minimum wage would require 40 years to accumulate the minimum notional points needed
to claim benefits under the system.
According to the authorities, the generosity of the system – expressed as the ratio of the average
benefit to the average wage – is expected to decline gradually by about 10 percentage points, from
its current level of 37 percent. Under the new system, transfers from the federal government are
expected to decline by about 1 percent of GDP by 2030.

Before March, monetary policy was accommodative and ruble flexibility increased. The
CBR had kept policy rates constant since September 2012 amid a softening of economic activity and
above-target inflation (Figure 1). It also eliminated its targeted foreign exchange (FX) interventions
and widened its non-intervention band while reducing the cumulative level of FX interventions
necessary to move the exchange rate corridor, increasing the flexibility of the ruble. During this time,
capital outflows persisted, spurred by expectations of continuing ruble depreciation.

8.
Pressures on the ruble have
intensified in early 2014. The Fed
tapering talk of May 2013 did not affect
Russia as much as other EMs given that
Russia had not experienced large capital
inflows. Nonetheless, at end–2013 and
early 2014, pressures re-emerged as
inflation remained relatively high, policy
rate tightening fell behind other EMs, and
growth prospects and fundamentals
outlook deteriorated. A move to increase
ruble flexibility facilitated a needed
orderly depreciation before March.

10.
The banking system remains broadly stable amid a gradual slowdown of unsecured
retail credit growth and a stepping-up of bank oversight. Since the 2008 crisis, the banking
system has moved from a negative to a positive net foreign asset position (Figure 5).
Non-performing loans have remained relatively constant throughout 2013, reaching 6.4 percent in
March, and were almost fully provisioned (Table 6). Capital adequacy ratios were relatively stable and
remained above the statutory minimum of 10 percent (Figure 3) while overall liquidity has edged
down (Table 6). The prudential measures taken in 2013 and early 2014, including tightening risk
weights and raising provisioning, have significantly reduced the growth of unsecured consumer
lending and were concomitant with a decline in the banking sector profitability (Table 6). The
authorities have enacted legislation to tighten regulation over predatory lending practices which
should come into effect in July, intended to further reduce risks from consumer lending. With
increased supervisory powers (¶31), the CBR has stepped up its banking supervision since the second
half of 2013. This resulted in a wave of bank closures, mostly very small banks, found in breach of
banking operations or money laundering laws. Some depositors have reallocated their savings from
smaller to bigger banks. The extensive coverage of personal deposits by the Deposit Insurance
Agency (DIA), which covers 99 percent of retail deposits by number and 70 percent by value, has
provided an important confidence backstop, and payouts to insured depositors have proceeded
within a period of two weeks.
11.
The current account surplus shrank but capital outflows continued in 2013. The current
account surplus declined to 1½ percent of GDP in 2013 from 3.6 percent of GDP in 2012. This
reflected weaker oil and merchandise exports, as well as continuing deterioration of service and
income account balances. Net private capital outflows, which had mirrored the evolution of the
current account surplus, remained elevated in 2013 at about 3 percent of GDP. Outflows were driven
by the nonbank private sector via shadow capital flight and net portfolio outflows. The authorities
are considering measures to promote “de-offshorization,” i.e. to discourage Russian individuals and
companies from using foreign corporate structures to conceal beneficial ownership or obtain undue
tax advantages, which could reduce net capital outflows and increase government revenues. In May,
Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus signed a treaty on the creation of the Eurasian Economic Union to
become effective starting 2015.
12.
Russia’s external position in 2013 was weaker than its medium-term fundamentals
(Annex II). While the REER gap identified for 2013 narrowed and perhaps closed following the recent
depreciation, a lasting improvement in the current account would require sustained consolidation on
the fiscal policy front and structural reforms to improve competitiveness. Foreign reserves are
adequate, standing at the end of April 2014 at US$472 billion or 143 percent of the IMF’s calculated
reserve adequacy metric, near the upper bound of the recommended range of 100–150 percent.1
External debt edged up due to a major acquisition in the oil sector but remains sustainable under the
baseline scenario (Tables 8–11, Figure 5 and 9).

13.
Net private capital outflows increased significantly in the first quarter of 2014 to
US$51 billion (Figure 2 and Box 3). Reserves at the CBR experienced additional downward pressures
following the sharp increase in FX intervention in early March. The increased level of FX swaps and
correspondent accounts between the CBR and domestic banks has temporarily cushioned the level
of reserves, which have not declined by the total amount of interventions. While FX swaps were used
to access CBR liquidity, the increase in the level of correspondent accounts at the CBR has reflected
increased foreign assets repatriation by domestic banks amidst increasing geopolitical uncertainties.
14.
Geopolitical tensions are negatively weighing on the cost and access to financing. Since
March, sovereign and private issuances have declined very sharply, with borrowing rates increasing
by an average of 100–150 basis points (Figure 2). The government has also cancelled a number of
domestic auctions. Moody’s and Fitch revised the outlook on Russia’s sovereign BBB rating from
stable to negative while S&P downgraded the sovereign rating by one notch to BBB-, its lowest
investment grade category. This downgrade forced similar ratings cut on major Russian corporations
such as Gazprom, Rosneft, and VTB bank, as well as subsidiaries of international banks. The
geopolitical uncertainty has also given rise to dollarization pressures.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
15.
Geopolitical tensions are bringing the Russian economy to a standstill (Figure 4, Table 2).
Investment will further contract due to uncertainty and the recent monetary tightening. Capital
outflows are expected to exceed US$100 billion in 2014, after reaching US$51 billion in the first
quarter (Box 3). Consumption will remain the main growth driver; net exports are also expected to
support growth as imports weaken (Table 3). Despite the economic slowdown, inflation is expected
to remain well above the CBR’s target due to the recent exchange rate depreciation. A slight recovery
in growth to 1 percent is projected in 2015, on the back of stronger exports and stabilization of
investment.
16.
Over the medium term, growth will continue to be constrained by supply-side factors.
The factors driving growth during 2000–2008, including oil price increases and utilization of spare
capacity, are unlikely to support growth over the projection. In addition, the contribution of labor
force is expected to be negative over the projection period due to adverse demographics and an
already-low unemployment rate.
17.
Risks are starkly on the downside (Annex III). The baseline projections assume a gradual
resolution of geopolitical tensions. Even without escalation, prolonged uncertainty and the resulting
deterioration of confidence could lead to lower consumption, weaker investment, and greater
exchange rate pressure and capital outflows than assumed under the baseline. More fundamentally,
sanctions could also derail further integration of Russia in the world economy, with the concomitant
adverse impact on long-term growth as reforms are postponed.
18.
Russia’s direct exposure to a deterioration of the economic situation in Ukraine is
moderate: (i) exposure of Russian banks to Ukraine is less than 2 percent of Russian banks’ assets;
(ii) exports to Ukraine are less than 5 percent of Russia’s total exports; and (iii) Russian loans and
arrears to Gazprom amounts to US$4.3bn (0.3 percent of GDP). However, about half of Russian gas
exports to Europe go through Ukraine, with limited possibility of rerouting through other pipelines in
the short run. In addition, some sectors (e.g., base metals, transport equipment, and chemicals) of
the Russian economy are closely-integrated with the Ukrainian economy, and disruption of these
supply chains could have important sectoral impacts. Uncertainty in Ukraine could undermine
confidence in Russia, affecting further domestic consumption and investment.

Box 3. Capital Flows in 2014
Net private capital outflows reached US$51 billion in the first quarter of 2014. This is much higher
than the outturn for the first quarter of 2013 at US$28 billion and somewhat lower than the total for
2013 at US$60 billion. However, seasonality is usually strong, with about half of annual outflows
occurring in the first quarter. Capital outflows in the first quarter were also lower than the peak of
US$132 billion in 2008 Q4 during the global financial crisis.
Larger net outflows were driven by higher-than-usual accumulation of financial assets abroad. In
particular, 2014 Q1 saw: (i) US$19.6 billion accumulation of cash foreign currency by non-banks abroad;
(ii) US$21 billion accumulation of foreign assets by banks; (iii) US$9.8 billion accumulation of other
foreign assets by non-banks. In addition, borrowing from abroad reverted to below average levels at
US$15 billion. During the period, domestic banks accumulated exceptional FX positions with the CBR—FX
swaps of resident banks with the CBR increased by US$5 billion and FX correspondent accounts with the
CBR increased by US$8 billion. Had domestic banks put this excess FX liquidity abroad, instead of parking
it with the CBR, capital flows would have reached US$ 64 billion.

19.
Other risks remain significant. Among them, external risks include the fallout from the EM
turmoil during the transition to higher global interest rates and an acceleration of capital outflows.
With 2/3 of exports of goods and ⅓ of general government revenues depending on the energy
sector, the Russian economy remains very sensitive to oil and gas prices. Domestic risks include a
sharper slowdown in investment, especially if business climate does not improve and financing
becomes even more constrained. In the medium term, investment may be stronger than expected,
also thanks to recent gas contract with China.
20.
Russia has large buffers to face these risks but growth prospects could be damaged.
Given the sizeable buffers from large international reserves, low public debt and the reduction of the
corporate sector maturity and currency mismatches (Figure 5), the materialization of these risks may
not endanger external sustainability but could imply a substantial setback to the growth outlook. At
the end of April, gross international reserves covered 190 percent of the 2014 short-term debt
outstanding at remaining maturity.
21.
However, a significant escalation of tensions could lead to a much deeper recession
and jeopardize external sustainability. An escalation of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine
could lead to stronger and broader sanctions targeting the financial and/or the energy sectors.
Sanctions on Russian banks would further disrupt commerce, investment, and consumption.
Significant trade disruptions could emerge if sanctions are targeted at the energy sector. Either of
these alternatives would severely impact confidence and intensify capital outflows. Both scenarios
could lead to a much worse growth outcome than assumed under the baseline and, in the extreme,
even jeopardize external sustainability.
22.
While the impact so far has been limited, possible outward spillovers could be sizable.
A further slowdown in Russia may affect Russia’s neighbors in Eastern Europe, Caucasus, and Central
Asia through trade, financial links, and remittances (Box 4). In addition to regional spillovers, Russia
14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

may have an effect on other countries outside the region. Russia typically accounts for 8 to
15 percent of major EM indices and its financial system is integrated with the international financial
system through various financial instruments, including off-balance-sheet derivatives. A disruption of
the Russian financial system or energy exports could have a considerable adverse impact on Europe
23.
The authorities broadly agreed with the outlook and the risk assessment. They
underscored geopolitical tensions as the main risk. The authorities also noted that pre-existing
structural problems remain an important constraint for investment and growth. The Ministry of
Economic Development is optimistic about the reform agenda and its implementation, projecting a
medium-term growth rate of about 2½ percent and inflation of around 4 percent. The authorities
shared their concerns that pass-through from the exchange rate depreciation to inflation may pose
challenges to achieving the 2015 inflation target but the CBR reiterated its commitment to react
promptly if inflation stays persistently above target. On the external side, the temporary suspension
of the OECD accession talks may delay Russia’s integration to the world economy, but the authorities
remain committed to continue implementing the necessary reforms and underscored the risks of less
integration. They noted that development of gas extraction and production in the Far East would
help Russia diversify its exports markets and broaden trade links with Asia.

Box 4. Regional Spillovers
Regional spillovers from Russia could be sizable and could spread through trade flows, remittances, and
the financial linkages.
Neighboring countries could be affected by the slowdown in Russian growth via trade and
remittances flows. Exports of goods and services to Russia amount to over 20 percent of GDP in
Belarus and are substantial for a number of countries in the Baltics, Eastern Europe, Caucasus, and
Central Asia. While direct trade links with central Europe are smaller, they may understate the
importance of Russia for their tradable sector where exports to Russia are channeled via Germany.
Several Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries receive large amounts of remittances
from Russia.
Russia supplies about one-third of European oil and gas consumption. While oil is relatively easy
to substitute, natural gas is less so. Finland, the Baltic countries, Belarus, and Czech Republic rely
almost entirely on Russian gas for their domestic consumption. Dependence is also high at
40-60 percent in central Europe and southeastern Europe. About half of gas exports from Russia
transits through Ukraine, 40 percent of which could be re-routed by using Belarus and Nord Stream
pipelines at full capacity. However, it would be hard to re-route LNG gas from Western Europe
coastline facilities to central Europe. From Russia’s perspective, the possibility of re-routing its gas
exports to Asia in the near term is limited by the absence of an appropriate pipeline system to China.
Most countries’ direct banking sector linkages with Russia are limited but some international
banks derive substantial profits from their Russian operations. Cyprus, Austria, and Hungary are most
exposed to the Russian banking system, with total asset of their subsidiaries in Russia of about
4-10 percent of national GDP. Foreign claims by BIS-reporting countries point to further exposures of
Austria, Sweden, and the Netherlands at about 2-4 percent of GDP in cross-border lending. Russian
banks, on the other hand, are major lenders in Armenia, Belarus, Cyprus, and Ukraine.
Direct financial linkages between Russia and most other countries via FDI and equity and debt
portfolio positions are limited. Russian FDI is important for immediate neighbors, financial centers,
and the Montenegro real estate sector. While 70 percent of outward and 65 percent of inward FDI
positions (stocks) for Russia in 2012 was with five countries, net FDI positions with these countries were
close to zero. Low net FDI positions suggest round tripping of Russian money through these locations
to take advantage of better property rights and favorable tax treatment. This limits the scale of
spillovers for host countries should these flows stop. Similarly, Russian inward and outward portfolio
investment has been channeled mostly via financial centers both for equity and debt flows. The largest
FDI investors in Russia are the US, Germany, U.K., France, and Finland, mostly in consumer sectors, such
as the automotive and food markets. Withdrawal of this “real” FDI from Russia would affect technology
and knowledge transfer, with an impact on potential GDP growth.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions focused on (i) implementing policies to cope with the impact of geopolitical tensions and
global financial volatility; (ii) enhancing the macroeconomic policy framework, including through the
transition to inflation targeting and strengthening the fiscal rule (iii) raising long-term growth by
introducing further structural reforms.

A. Monetary Policy: Delicate Transition to Inflation Targeting and to
Further Exchange Rate Flexibility
24.
A tighter monetary stance is required to attain the 2015 inflation target and anchor
inflation expectations. Inflation has increased to 7.3 percent in April 2014 (yoy) but is expected to
decline to 6.5 percent by year-end given the projected decline in food prices, the limits on utility
tariffs’ increases, and the emergence of a small negative output gap. Staff noted that the recent
cumulative policy rates increase of 2 percentage points signaled CBR’s commitment to contain
inflationary pressures. Nonetheless, staff views this monetary tightening as insufficient to bring
inflation to the CBR’s target of 5 percent in 2014, given the size of the recent ruble depreciation and
the lags in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. Moreover, despite the cumulative hike,
the real policy rate remains around zero, close to the estimated neutral rate and the slowdown is
mainly structural in nature. Staff advocated that the CBR should raise further its policy rates over the
next year to ensure that its 4.5 percent inflation target in 2015 is met, in order to anchor inflation
expectations in the transition to a full-fledged inflation targeting framework. Higher rates would also
help reduce capital outflows that have emerged amid geopolitical tensions, global liquidity
tightening and rate hikes by major EMs’ central banks.
25.
The CBR should resume its policy towards greater exchange rate flexibility as soon as
the current uncertainties subside. Staff argued that enhancing exchange rate flexibility and using
interest rates as the main policy instrument would increase the likelihood of a successful transition
to inflation targeting. Exchange rate flexibility provides an important buffer against external
shocks—in particular if the shocks and the associated currency stress are prolonged. Staff
recommended that as soon as the situation permits, the CBR should gradually simplify and eliminate
its intervention bands, lower the size of cumulative foreign exchange interventions required to move
the exchange rate corridor, and increase the size of the corridor shifts. Staff noted that the pressures
on the exchange rate have abated following the increase in the policy rates and the reduction in the
pace of the currency depreciation.
26.
The CBR should continue with steps to adopt inflation targeting by end–2014. The CBR
has been rationalizing the structure of its instruments and announced in September that the
one-week auction interest rate was to become its main policy rate with overnight standing facilities
forming the upper and lower bounds of the interest rate corridor. Strengthening the transmission
mechanism of monetary policy will require enhancing the signaling role of the policy rate and efforts
to deepen the interbank market and reduce its volatility. A clear timeline for implementing steps
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

towards formal adoption of inflation targeting remains also an important goal as well as enhancing
communication. In the context of a lack of bank collateral to access liquidity, amid an increasing
reliance on CBR funding by banks (Figure 3), the CBR created a three-year standing facility secured
by investment projects with a state guarantee. Staff views this mechanism as unlikely to foster
lending for investment projects as it does not address the structural weaknesses impeding
investment (Section D) and risks benefiting only large banks.
27.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to anchoring inflation while moving to
inflation targeting and to a fully-flexible exchange rate by end–2014. The CBR expects inflation
to come down to below 6 percent provided there are no additional external shocks and that the
announced caps on tariff increases are actually implemented. Given the uncertain outlook, the CBR
has adopted a wait-and-see mode with a tightening bias. The CBR concurs with staff that there are
sizeable risks that inflation will be higher than projected, but reiterated its commitment to act
promptly. In addition, the authorities reiterated their commitment to completing preparations for
and adopting formal inflation targeting by end–2014, including greater exchange rate flexibility.
Nonetheless, the CBR views the current FX intervention rule as appropriate as long as risks to
financial stability remain, given the uncertain geopolitical environment and the potential confidence
impact of further economic sanctions. The CBR viewed the use of capital flow management
measures as potentially counterproductive, signaling policy regression. The CBR indicated that the
new three-year facility was experimental and would involve only small amounts.

B. Financial Sector: Containing Risks
28.
Recent financial turbulence requires heightened scrutiny of financial stability. Staff
noted that even though many corporations benefit from foreign exchange receipts and appear to

(large) state-owned banks via lower profits
and higher provisioning. Staff advised the CBR to continue to monitor any systemic risk build-up via
its regular stress testing exercises and increased oversight.
29.
Risk from unsecured retail lending appears to be decreasing and the continued
strengthening of bank supervision is welcome. Prudential measures taken by the authorities have

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

reduced the growth of unsecured consumer lending, though it remains relatively high (Figure 3).
However, continued oversight remains warranted to ensure the effectiveness of the most recently
enacted legislation and prudential measures. The stepping up of banking supervision by the CBR
has signaled a strong commitment to deal with banks in breach of banking operations or money
laundering laws. Staff noted that this increased supervision will strengthen the stability of the
banking system and support the necessary consolidation of the sector. Staff advised the CBR to
continue to communicate widely and effectively its intended goals in order to maintain depositors’
confidence.
30.
The CBR has increased its supervisory and regulatory powers as progress is being
made in implementing Basel III rules and the recommendations of the 2011 FSAP. The capacity
to monitor systemic risks through regulating and supervising all bank and non-bank financial
institutions was enhanced following the creation of a mega-supervisor through the merger of the
CBR and the Federal Service for Financial Markets. In addition, the July amendments to the Banking
Law was in line with the 2011 FSAP recommendations (Annex IV). However, reforms are still pending
on introducing a unified administration regime for all banks, restricting open bank assistance by the
DIA to systemic situations, and setting limits on concentration of collateral in the repo market. In
preparation for the implementation of Basel III rules, legislation on capital requirements has been
passed while regulation on liquidity standards is being finalized. Staff welcomed the CBR’s
publication of the criteria for the designation of systemic banks, which will be subject to stricter
supervision and higher capital requirements.
31.
The authorities consider the financial system to be sound and resilient. However, they
broadly shared staff’s concerns about: (1) potential risks to the banking system from high policy
rates, low growth, and further economic sanctions; and (2) declining but still high unsecured
consumer credit growth. The CBR noted that financial and non-financial corporations are much
more resilient today than they were in 2008-09 given the extensive deleveraging that has taken
place in the banking system and the decline of FX and maturity mismatches for corporations as a
whole. The authorities’ regular stress tests, including scenarios of large depreciation, complete
shutdown from international financial markets and large negative growth, suggest that the banking
sector as a whole would remain stable and resilient— although capitalization in banks representing
one-third of banking system assets would drop below regulatory requirements. The CBR indicated
that it stands ready to offer support to illiquid but solvent banks should financial stability be
threatened. The CBR shared staff’s view that unsecured credit growth remains high, although it is
declining at a rapid pace. They were confident that recently adopted prudential measures would
further lower risks from unsecured consumer lending, which they viewed as non-systemic. The CBR
indicated that it will continue its campaign to revoke licenses for banks that are financially weak or
that have dubious operations, which it viewed as important to make the banking system stronger.
The CBR claimed that this stepping up of supervision is leading to a decline in money laundering
activities.

C. Fiscal Policy: Gradual Consolidation
32.
The fiscal stance is broadly appropriate for 2014 but flexibility could be considered in
case of a more severe cyclical slowdown. The general government non-oil structural balance is
expected to improve by 0.5 percent due to a reduction in VAT refunds and the implementation of
the federal fiscal rule (Figure 7). This may, however, overstate the fiscal tightening as the
government is expected to provide quasi-fiscal stimulus through the issuance of guarantees for
multi-year projects and finance infrastructure projects through the National Wealth Fund. The
modest direct fiscal tightening in 2014 appears justified despite the economic slowdown as the
Russian economy remains close to its potential. In addition, adhering to the fiscal rule is essential to
support its credibility given the current uncertain environment and the needed medium-term fiscal
consolidation. In the event of a more severe and prolonged cyclical downturn, fiscal policy could be
loosened, in view of the limited size of automatic stabilizers and the fact that monetary policy is
constrained by its inflation objective. Additional fiscal measures, if needed, should be temporary and
of high quality and be set in a medium-term framework that ensures sustainability.
33.
Market financing could be limited given the current geopolitical situation. In recent
weeks, the federal government has canceled some domestic bond auctions, stating that the implied
interest rates were too high given the sovereign rating and economic standing. In the event of a lack
of adequate financing, the federal government could revert to reducing transfers to the Reserve
Fund (RF) as in 2013 when non-oil revenues and privatization receipts were lower than expected.
34.
The baseline envisages an improvement in the non-oil balance over time. Non-oil
revenues are expected to pick up as the economy slowly rebounds while expenditures are expected
to be constrained by the implementation of the federal fiscal rule. Given the size of contingency
reserves in the federal budget (about 0.3 percent of GDP in 2014) and the possibility of re-allocating
spending within the budget, Crimea-related spending is not expected to affect the overall balance.
Under the baseline scenario, general government debt is expected to remain sustainable and low,
reaching 18 percent of GDP by the end of the forecasting period (Table 8).
35.
But additional fiscal
consolidation in outer years is
needed to rebuild buffers. At
4.3 percent of GDP, the RF is below
the authorities’ target of 7 percent of
GDP, which is designed to maintain
government spending unchanged in
the face of a reduction in oil prices to
US$60 per barrel for 2 years. Under
the baseline scenario the RF is not
expected to reach its target level over
the medium term. While appropriate
in the short term, the diversion of
resources intended for transfer to the

RF to offset the impact of shortfalls in non-oil revenues, privatization receipts and available
financing, would further distance the authorities from their objective. However, with the RF below its
target, the authorities risk pro-cyclical fiscal adjustments in the event of large and lasting oil price
decline. This risk is heightened given the already high level of oil prices. Staff argued for more
prudent oil-price assumption during the budget process to generate more savings. For example,
discounting the current benchmark oil price by approximately 15 percent would generate enough
savings to rebuild the RF to 7 percent of GDP by 2019. The resulting additional cumulative
tightening (compared to the baseline scenario) of about 1.5 percent of GDP could be achieved with
various measures (see table). This fiscal consolidation should be introduced gradually in order to
limit the adverse impact on the projected economic recovery.

36.
An even more ambitious long-term fiscal consolidation would be required to
safeguard intergenerational equity. With a non-oil primary deficit near 11.5 percent of GDP, staff
argued that the general government relies too heavily on oil revenues to bring its overall deficit
closer to balance. Staff noted that these revenues are associated with exhaustible resources and
should therefore be saved more to safeguard intergenerational equity. Staff estimated that under
the real permanent-oil-income-model approach, which maintains constant in real terms the
government’s use of its net wealth, an appropriate target for the non-oil primary deficit would be
roughly 5.5 percent of GDP. Currently, the baseline projection shows only a gradual improvement in
the non-oil fiscal primary deficit slightly above 7.5 percent of GDP by 2019. Reducing the non-oil
deficit would also offset possible Dutch disease effects and improve Russia’s external sustainability.
37.
Further pension reform would be pivotal for the consolidation effort. Despite the recent
reform (Box 2), the generosity of the system is expected to decline over time and may become too
low to be socially and politically acceptable, leading to fiscal pressure. Additional measures are
needed to ensure the viability of the system while keeping its generosity at an acceptable level.
These include: (i) increases in the retirement age (which is low in Russia by international standards);
(ii) encourage the formalization of employment in the underground economy; and (iii) improving
contribution compliance. Increasing the retirement age could also mitigate some of the expected
decline in the labor force and consequently support growth.
38.
Achieving fiscal consolidation depends crucially on resisting spending pressures.
Recent discussions about relaxing the federal fiscal rule could jeopardize the consolidation. In
addition, promises to further increase military spending and public sector wages, increased fiscal
pressures from geopolitical tensions, and incomplete pension reform could weigh negatively on
future budgets. Consolidation at the local level, which is not covered by the fiscal rule, is especially
vulnerable given the 2012 electoral promises to increase wages and local governments’ weak tax
revenues. In this context, staff welcomes the recent proposal by the Ministry of Finance to limit the
provision of tax expenditures. At the general government level, the authorities estimate that tax
expenditure in 2012 amounted to Rub1.8 trillion or close to 3 percent of GDP. In addition, the Prime
Minister has recently instructed the Ministry of Finance to propose a plan to reduce the public work
force by 10 percent.
39.
Given Russia’s infrastrcture needs, public investment should be increased despite the
fiscal consolidation. This implies resisting other spending pressures to preserve fiscal space and
prioritizing and reallocating expenditures toward investment. Over time, this objective could be
supported by the recently-introduced performance-based budgeting, which helps improve
efficiency of public spending. Public spending efficiency could also be buttressed by the new
procurement law (Box 6).

Box 5. Fiscal Transparency Evaluation (FTE) for Russia
A recent pilot of the IMF’s new FTE assessed the Russian government’s fiscal reporting, forecasting, and risk
management practices against the IMF’s revised Fiscal Transparency Code.1 The FTE found a number of
strengths including : (i) a comprehensive legal framework for fiscal management; (ii) frequent and timely
accrual-based fiscal statistics which consolidate federal and sub-national governments and extra-budgetary
units; (iii) a budget, submitted and approved in a timely manner, based on credible macroeconomic forecasts
and with a strong medium-term orientation; and (iv) firm central controls over key sources of fiscal risk
including annual limits on debt, credit, and guarantee issuance by federal and sub-national governments.
The FTE also highlighted some important gaps. First, Russia’s most comprehensive reports cover only about
60 percent of the total public sector expenditure while a fuller accounting, taking into account the large and
complex array of government-controlled enterprises, would reveal a much greater involvement of the state in
the economy as well as slightly negative overall net worth (Figure 1). Second, while reported balance sheets
include most conventional assets and liabilities, they exclude the government’s estimated 200 percent of GDP
in sub-soil oil and gas reserves and almost 300 percent of GDP in liabilities from public pensions and PPPs
(Figure 2). Third, while the federal budget is relatively comprehensive, a large and growing proportion is
classified as secret (rising from 14 to almost 25 percent of budget expenditure over the next three years as
more agencies and activities, such as border protection, are classified as national security and spending on
armaments increases), and there are plans for significant extra-budgetary activity via sovereign wealth funds.
Recommendations of the FTE include: (i) clarify the boundary between general government, public
corporations, and private sectors—currently the general government accounts exclude government-controlled
enterprises that perform non-market activities but these should be included in the general government
according to international standards; (ii) expand the institutional coverage to encompass the entire public
sector; (iii) publish a more comprehensive balance sheet including sub-soil assets and pension and PPP
liabilities; (iv) improve the coverage and detail of the annual budget; and (v) enhance the disclosure and
management of acute and long-term fiscal risks.

40.
The coverage of fiscal reports should be extended. While Russia compiles a
comprehensive set of the general government accounts that are broadly adequate for surveillance
28

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

(Informational Annex), these accounts understate the size of the general government, as they
exclude government-controlled enterprises that are performing non-market activities. In addition, as
noted in the recent Fiscal Transparency Evaluation (Box 5), Russia does not report statistics on the
broader public sector, which would include all government-controlled enterprises. A broader
definition of the public sector would reveal a much greater involvement of the state in the economy,
larger public debt as well as a negative overall net worth. Finally, a large and growing share of
budget expenditure is classified as “secret,” reducing the specificity and transparency of the budget.
41.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to the fiscal rule. They noted that structural
reforms are needed to stimulate the economy, instead of fiscal stimulus, but noted that in the event
of a significant slowdown, changes to the fiscal rule could be considered. The authorities agreed that
further fiscal consolidation is required over the medium and long term as the current level of the
non-oil balance is excessive. The authorities are cognizant of the spending pressures, and agreed
that there is a need to increase public investment, which could come from re-allocating resources
and the use of reserves. They noted that a sizeable portion of government spending goes to the
public pension system and did not rule out the possibility of increasing the retirement age in the
future, if needed.

Progress on structural reforms is pivotal to increase potential growth. This requires
addressing problems of governance and corruption, administrative barriers and regulation, and the
involvement of the state in the economy (Figure 8). In absolute terms, Russia is the third largest
energy subsidizer in the word (US$116 billion). Moreover, increasing labor mobility of workers in
“monocities,” which is constrained by subsidies and social benefits, could free up resources for more
productive use elsewhere. Finally, Russia could further exploit its comparative advantage by moving
to a profit-based taxation of natural resources instead of revenues-based taxation, which inhibits the

privatization plan, if market conditions allow, may also enhance productivity.

Banking and financial sector reforms are also key to boost investment and growth. The
banking system is highly concentrated, lacks depth, and is inefficient at channeling savings to
productive investment. The top three banks (state-owned) accounted for almost 60 percent of total
sector assets at year-end 2013. Concentration indices point to a moderately concentrated system
but large state-owned banks are found to exert more market power than others. With credit-to-GDP
at 55 percent, the depth of the financial system is relatively low compared to other EMs. Finally, the
banking system contributes only 6 percent of funding for business investment while peer
comparison shows that Russian firms have much less access to bank and external financing (Figure
8). This may reflect, to some extent, privileged access to bank financing by large SOEs. The reform of
the financial sector could also reduce capital outflows.

The Russian government has initiated a number of programs to combat corruption,
reform procurement, and improve the business climate. The overall strategic guidance comes
from bi-annual Anti-Corruption Plans, which have been issued since 2008. Public procurement rules
were reformed (Box 6). Moreover, Russia created a Federal Business Ombudsman in 2012 to protect
businesses. Finally, a set of 13 road maps have been elaborated and are being implemented with
public-private monitoring for improving critical areas of the business climate.
47.
Russia has improved its regime for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Combating the
Financing of Terrorism (CFT). In October 2013, Russia was removed from the FATF follow-up
process given that major identified deficiencies had been addressed. Going forward, Russia will be
preparing for its next assessment under the recently revised standards, which is more demanding
including in the areas of tax crimes and enhanced scrutiny of domestic politically exposed persons.
48.
Implementation remains crucial to having a tangible impact. Modernization of the
declaration system of asset, income and expenditure declarations for public officials would be an
important step, especially if it were to make the system more unified, transparent, and accessible.
Such measure could allow the authorities to use the AML framework more effectively in the fight
against corruption. It is also recommended that competitive, even-handed, and flexible
procurement procedures should be increasingly enshrined in legislation and practice so that
domestic and foreign firms and investors feel secure in their contractual, adjudication, and property
rights.
49.
Staff recommended reinvigorating implementation of the reform agenda. This would
include continuing the fight against corruption, reinvigorating the privatization agenda, reducing
price distortions, and improving competition. Staff welcomed the serious attention that the Russian
authorities have focused on the area of public procurement and await with interest the results of
current plans to amend the recently enacted 2013 procurement law. The PPP framework could

enhance transparency and accountability as long as the new PPP law is in line with best practices.
Direct state involvement in operations of SOEs should be limited.
50.
Staff noted that financial deepening is needed to support long-term growth. A deeper
and more efficient financial system would improve the allocation of capital, thereby enhancing
economic growth, and increase the saving rate in the private sector. Policies include reducing
banking sector fragmentation through consolidation and reduced public bank ownership, enhance
competition and encourage the development of medium-size banks, greater pricing transparency
and consumer protection, and further strengthening the role of credit bureaus and collateral
registries to reduce information asymmetries.
51.
The authorities broadly agreed and noted that they remain committed to the reform
agenda. They noted that adverse confidence effects are amplifying the deterioration in investment
prospects due to pre-existing structural bottlenecks. The Ministry of Economic Development will
continue implementing its reform agenda based on roadmaps, including in the following areas:
strengthening the rule of law and ensuring effective implementation of laws, regulations, codes and
policies; internet policy and information security; trade barriers and implementation of WTO
commitments; investment climate, corporate governance, and environment policy. In addition, the
authorities recognize the lack of access to financing by SMEs, and have recently taken initial steps to
support them through the establishment of the Agency for Credit Guarantees. The authorities
argued that excessive regulations and trade barriers have a negative effect on the business climate.

Box 6. New Procurement Law
Increasing the efficiency of government expenditure is key to improve fiscal space, to ensure that
public investment supports growth, and to fight against corruption.
A general reform of the procurement system in Russia started in 2005 when the following were
introduced: (i) changes in the process of placing orders; (ii) e-procurement (unified website launched
in 2011); (iii) use of a financial guarantee instead of qualification of bidders; (iv) third party payment
system; and (v) administrative appeal procedure.
A new procurement law came into effect on January 1, 2014. The main changes introduced were:
(i) compulsory planning procedure for all procurement types (Jan 1, 2015); (ii) procurement needs to
be based on state and municipal roadmaps; (iii) mandatory disclosure of beneficial owner
information by bidding companies; (iv) mechanisms for setting the initial contract price; (v) more
options for bidders to provide securities and guarantees against non-performance; (vi) new
contracting options—RFP (as opposed to a request for quote), two-stage tender, closed restricted
tender; (vii) conduct of all auctions (one of the many contracting options) electronically;
(viii) performance monitoring and auditing functions.

STAFF APPRAISAL
52.
Structural weaknesses and geopolitical uncertainties are taking a heavy toll on the
economy. Growth, already slowing because of pre-existing structural bottlenecks, is expected to
weaken to 0.2 percent in 2014 with considerable downside risks. Continued conflict could lead to
additional sanctions and worse outcomes. Critically, geopolitical tensions could slow, or even
reverse, the process of integration of Russia into the world economy, damaging Russia’s economic
potential.
53.
Faced with exceptional circumstances, policies should aim in the near-term at
preserving macroeconomic stability. In recent years, Russia has considerably improved its
macroeconomic framework with the adoption of a fiscal rule, the preparation for inflation targeting,
and the implementation of increased exchange rate flexibility. Strengthening these critical policy
anchors will support confidence and macroeconomic stability. Given the uncertainty about the
duration of the geopolitical situation and the limited cyclical slack in the economy, authorities
should refrain from short-term countercyclical policies.
54.
Further monetary tightening will likely be required over the next year to attain the
2015 inflation target. The CBR should stand ready to raise further its policy rates to meet its
4½ percent inflation target in 2015 and anchor inflation expectations. Higher rates would also help
reduce capital outflows. The CBR should resume its policy towards greater exchange rate flexibility
as soon as the current uncertainties subside. Enhancing exchange rate flexibility and using interest
rates as the main policy instrument would ensure a successful transition to inflation targeting.
55.
Continued strengthening of banking supervision is welcome. Increased supervision will
strengthen banks’ stability and support the necessary consolidation of the sector. The CBR should
34

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

continue to communicate its intended goals widely and effectively in order to maintain depositors’
confidence. Systemic risk from unsecured retail lending appears limited but continued oversight is
still warranted. The authorities should continue to work towards implementing the remaining FSAP
recommendations.
56.
The fiscal stance remains appropriate for 2014. Modest fiscal tightening, despite the
economic slowdown, appears justified as output remains close to potential. Adhering to the fiscal
rule is essential to support its credibility given the current uncertain environment and the needed
medium-term fiscal consolidation. Mounting spending pressures should be resisted in order to
preserve fiscal space for investment. Additional fiscal consolidation in the outer years is needed to
rebuild buffers. The current non-oil deficit remains very high and the overall deficit is low only due
to high oil prices. Further pension reform is necessary. Increasing the retirement age is vital to
ensure the viability of the system.
57.
Structural reforms remain essential to enhance Russia’s growth potential. Continued
efforts at global integration are necessary to attract high-quality investment and boost potential
growth. Reforms discussed in the context of the stalled OECD accession negotiations should
continue, as skill mismatches in the labor market, large tax burdens, especially for SMEs, and
administrative barriers and corruption remain key obstacles. Pushing ahead with the announced
privatization plans should enhance economic efficiency.
58.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government and includes public guarantees.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ EMBIG.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes changes in the stock of guarantees, asset changes, and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Annex I. Implementation of Past IMF Recommendations
During the 2013 Article IV consultation, Directors noted that the macroeconomic policy frameworks
had strengthened. With the economy at close to full capacity and growth slowing down, they saw
the need to increase potential output growth by further strengthening policies and decisively
implementing structural reforms, particularly supply-side reforms.
Key recommendations

Implemented policies

Fiscal Policy
Resist pressure for higher
spending.

The budget for 2014–16 is consistent with the adopted fiscal rule.
However, quasi-fiscal spending via NWF and issuance of
guarantees is increasing.

Medium-term fiscal
consolidation to rebuild fiscal
buffers.

Non-oil fiscal deficit remains high; while the Reserve Fund has
increased, it remains below the government target. In 2013,
transfers to the Reserve Fund were additionally limited by the need
to compensate for the under-execution of privatization proceeds.

Rebalance expenditure to
increase efficiency.

Discussion ongoing.

Advance pension reform.

Some changes adopted (see main text); increase in statutory
retirement age not considered, while replacement rate is expected
to decline in the medium term despite the reform.

Monetary Policy
Keep monetary policy on hold
with a tightening bias.

Policy rate held at 5 ½ percent (with tightening bias made explicit
in February 2014) until Spring 2014 when it was cumulatively
increased by 200 basis points.

Take further actions to
strengthen the transmission
mechanism.

Under discussion, including in the context of the President’s
mandate to the central bank to find ways to reduce lending rates.
To improve monetary signaling, in September 2013, CBR reduced
the number of policy rates, formally announcing the one-week
repo rate to be the key policy rate and establishing a symmetric
two percentage point-wide interest rate corridor around the key
rate.

Complete transition to a flexible
exchange rate and inflation
targeting by end-2014.

Preparation ongoing, including with technical advice from the IMF.
In response to market pressures, a temporary change to the
intervention rule was introduced on March 3.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

Financial Sector
Monitor growth in unsecured
consumer lending.

CBR increased risk coefficients for capital adequacy
calculations and provisioning requirements for highmargin consumer credits, and limited deposit rates
for banks with risky and aggressive policies. Federal
law adopted in December 2013 set limits on
deviations of individual bank credit rates to no more
than one-third higher than the average market rate
for similar credits.

Implement 2011 FSAP
recommendations to address
weaknesses in the supervisory
framework.

Legislations approved to empower CBR to (i) use
professional judgment in some situations; (ii) expand
supervisory authority over bank holding companies
and related parties; and (iii) sanction individual
directors and managers, raise capital requirements on
individual institutions, and impose restrictions on
transactions between affiliates. Implementation
guidelines pending.

Further strengthen corporate
governance, creditor rights, and
competition.

Legislation on credit bureaus approved, to ensure full
information about borrowers of consumer credit.

Structural Policies
Implement supply-side reforms to
raise the growth potential, with
policies to boost productivity, and
improve the investment climate,
governance, transparency, and
property rights protection.

Action Plan to boost growth approved by the Prime
Minister. OECD accession talks stalled. Bill to
introduce public private partnership framework being
discussed in Duma. Privatization has stalled.

Annex II. External Sector Assessment
The external position in 2013 appeared weaker than the level consistent with medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policy settings. While the REER gap identified for 2013 narrowed and
perhaps closed following the recent depreciation, a lasting improvement in the current account would
require sustained consolidation on the fiscal policy front and structural reforms.
The current account (CA) approach suggests an 11 percent REER overvaluation in 2013. This is
slightly more than estimated in the 2013 Article IV report, reflecting: (i) decrease in the 2013 current
account by more than what would be implied by fundamentals and current policies; and (ii) looser
fiscal policy in 2013 relative to trade partners. The oil price boom of the past 13 years has been
accompanied by a structural relaxation of the fiscal position, as the budget deficit followed the rise
of oil prices. The non-oil fiscal balance worsened by 9 percentage points of GDP and current
expenditures increased by 5 percentage points of GDP. More conservative fiscal policies over the
medium-term with the non-oil fiscal balance reaching the estimated sustainable level of 5.5 percent
of GDP would lead to a higher current account by 2 percent of GDP and a more depreciated REER.
The REER approach suggests an undervaluation but this approach may not be appropriate for
Russia. According to the REER model, the average REER was 7 percent undervalued in 2013. Most
of the appreciation of the equilibrium was driven by the following fundamentals: (i) trend
appreciation typical for a transition economy; (ii) increase in the share of the domestic debt held by
residents; and (iii) higher investment needs. However, the REER approach is less reliable in countries
with large structural changes and short data spans, like Russia. Traditional indicators do not suggest
a major deterioration of Russia’s external competitiveness. Unit labor costs (ULC) remained relatively
flat, and the share of Russia’s goods exports in percent of the world’s doubled. However, between
2000 and 2013, non-oil exports and current account surplus decreased by 12 and 16 percentage
points of GDP respectively. This suggests that the REER appreciation may be a symptom of Dutch
disease and focused policies may be needed to address its effects on the economy.
The net foreign asset (NFA) position is sustainable but should be higher for intergenerational
reasons. NFA is projected to increase moderately over time, although historically there has been
some disconnect between CA surpluses and NFA changes (Annex IV). Intergenerational equity
considerations and signs of Dutch disease suggest that a higher portion of oil income should be
saved. Foreign reserves are adequate, standing at the end of April 2014 at 143 percent of the IMF
ARA metric, near the upper bound of the recommended range of 100–150 percent. However, the FX
balances of the Reserve Fund and of the National Wealth Fund kept at the CBR are counted as part
of foreign reserves because they are invested in liquid foreign assets. As a result, higher than
“adequate” reserves are desirable, given that these balances are saved for precautionary and
intergenerational purposes.
The REER gap identified for 2013 narrowed and perhaps closed following the recent
depreciation in January–April 2014. In the first four months of 2014, the REER depreciated
7¼ percent compared to the 2013 average. As a result, the deviation of the REER from the 10-year
average went from 14 percent on average in 2013 to 6 percent in April 2014. Furthermore, the
current account in 2014 is projected to improve on the back of depreciation and projected
contraction in domestic demand.

Annex V. Why Does Russia Have a Low NFA Position Given
Years of CA Surpluses?
NFA position has not kept apace with the CA surpluses due to unfavorable valuation changes and
adjustment for “fictitious” capital outflows. The first factor is not expected to continue in the future as
the Russian stock market boom is expected to slow down. The second factor implies that the true NFA
position could be higher than the reported level. As a result, the NFA projected trajectory does not
seem to be a concern from an external sustainability perspective.
Years of CA surpluses and capital outflows suggest a much higher rate of wealth accumulation
than changes in the net IIP. Starting from 2000, cumulated CA surpluses suggest that the Russian
net IIP should have been over US$700 billion or 38 percent of GDP by 2011. Instead, the 2011 NIIP
stood at about US$140 billion or 7 percent of GDP. There was about 30 percent of GDP missing
from the net IIP. This is not necessarily because NIIP is mismeasured. Isolating changes in the NIIP
from valuation changes and other adjustments, e.g. focusing purely on transactions in financial
assets, implies that the NIIP has increased in line with CA surpluses.
The NIIP was brought down by two factors: unfavorable valuation changes and other
adjustments. The two factors combined to offset most of the transaction-based increase in the NIIP.
Valuation changes were most important in increasing the value of liabilities, while other adjustments
meant assets were lower than the accumulation of transactions and valuation changes.
Russia’s stock market boom increased the value of liabilities. Valuation changes in the liabilities
position were primarily in the portfolio and FDI equity positions. Those changes went hand in hand
with Russia stock market movements. As oil prices more than quadrupled since 2000, stock market
valuation rose by nine times. About half of the RTS index is composed of oil and gas companies.
This factor is not expected to be a drag on the net IIP position in the future. As the oil price growth
is expected to moderate, the Russian stock market boom will slow down.
The CBR’s BOP statistics department adjusts the asset position down by the size of so-called
“fictitious” transactions. These transactions represent capital outflows that are not backed up by
real economic activity, such as non-repatriation of exports proceeds, non-supply of goods and
services against import contracts, securities trading, lending to nonresidents, and fictitious
transactions with money transfers to residents’ accounts abroad. For example, when a company
reports to its bank that the transfer is done to prepay imports but then closes down before imports
are received, CBR will allocate this transaction to “fictitious” outflows. Other examples include: (i)
repeated large transfers abroad that deviate from standard remittances behavior; (ii) selling
securities at a loss to your agent; and (iii) non-receipt of export earnings. CBR has a system to
identify these flows based on detailed data on bank accounts, client information, and reputation of
their clients abroad. The Department of Financial Monitoring and Control has approved these
calculations.
“Fictitious” transactions, which historically account for over 50 percent of net private sector
capital outflows, receive a differential treatment in the BOP and IIP statistics. In the BOP
statistics, they are reported by the CBR in the financial account as accumulation of foreign assets.
54

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

According to CBR, the CA itself is accurately measured, as it reflects actual economic transactions
based on goods crossing the border. If these transactions were not separately identified in the
financial account, the net errors and omissions category would be much higher. “Fictitious” flows
are also recorded in the IIP statistics as purchases of financial assets abroad. However, the CBR then
adjusts the foreign assets position downwards by the amount of these transactions in other
adjustments. CBR chooses to adjust the IIP asset position down because they consider “fictitious”
transactions as money that is leaving the country to never come back. However, to the extent that
these are still foreign assets owned by residents, they could form part of the NIIP. If this adjustment
were not made, the NIIP in 2011 would be 270 US dollar billions higher, standing at 21 instead of
7 percent of GDP.

Exchange Arrangements: The de jure arrangement is other managed arrangement—namely, a
controlled floating exchange rate arrangement. The ruble value of a bi-currency basket is used as
the operating benchmark for transactions on the domestic foreign exchange market. The basket is
currently composed of €0.45 and US$0.55. The value of the bi-currency basket is determined under
the influence of both market factors and exchange interventions by the Central Bank of Russia (CBR).
Interventions take place both in interbank currency exchanges and on the over-the-counter
interbank market to limit daily fluctuations. The CBR does not set any quantitative limits on the
exchange rate level of the national currency, but its exchange rate policy aims at keeping short-term
fluctuations within an acceptable range, as determined by a floating operating band. Interventions
take place both at the limits of the floating operating band and within it. They are triggered once
the exchange rate crosses limits set by a nonintervention corridor, with intervention amounts and
intervals established in advance. The limits of the operating bands itself shift by 5 kopecks once a
predetermined cumulative volume of interventions has been reached. Effective October 13, 2010,
the CBR eliminated the fixed trading band of Rub 26-41 against the bi-currency basket, in force
since January 2009. Since 2010 the CBR has widened the moving intervention band from 3 to
7 rubles in four installments. Up until March 3, 2014, the CBR had successively reduced the volume
of cumulative interventions triggering a 5 kopeck shift in the operational band from originally
$700 million to $350 million and widened the non-intervention band from 1 to 3.1 rubles. Following
the heightened financial turmoil from the crisis in Ukraine, the CBR decreased the sensitivity of the
band to interventions, increasing the cumulative FX sales required to shift the operational band to
US$1.5bn. The range of permissible fluctuations may be revised further in response to changes in
macroeconomic indicators. The CBR aims at further scaling down its direct interventions and
creating conditions for the transition to a floating exchange rate regime by 2015. After the transition
to a floating exchange rate regime, the CBR intends to abandon exchange rate-based operational
indicators of its exchange rate policy. Owing to the continued control of the CBR over the exchange
rate determination, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed
arrangement. The Russian Federation accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of
the IMF Articles of Agreement with effect from June 1, 1996, and maintains an exchange system free
of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Article IV Consultation: Russia is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The last
consultation was concluded on September 18, 2013.
FSAP Participation, FTE and ROSCs: Russia participated in the Financial Sector Assessment
Program during 2002, and the FSSA report was discussed by the Board in May 2003, at the time of
the 2003 Article IV discussion (IMF Country Report No. 03/147). An FSAP update took place in the
fall of 2007, and the FSSA report was discussed by the Board in August 2008, at the time of
the 2008 Article IV discussion. An FSAP financial stability assessment took place during April 2011,
and the FSSA report was discussed by the Board in September 2011, at the time of 2011 Article IV
Consultation.

IMF-WORLD BANK COLLABORATION
The IMF and World Bank teams agree that Russia’s key challenges are to strengthen
macroeconomic stability and to improve growth prospects. Stronger core institutions and a
better regulatory, judicial, administrative and business environment are needed. This will support
private-sector investment and the creation of more and better jobs.
The teams identified several reform areas as macro-critical:


Strengthening the fiscal framework: Key elements of reform include: (i) strengthening the new
fiscal rule to rebuild fiscal buffers and save more of the exhaustible oil income for
intergenerational equity considerations; (ii) avoiding off-budget or other mechanisms for
increasing spending outside the federal fiscal rule; (iii) strengthening fiscal risk assessment and
transparency; and (iv) coordinating the National Wealth Fund domestic investment strategy with
the Budget process.



Public expenditure reforms: Key elements of reform include: (i) promoting aggregate fiscal
discipline and strengthening public expenditure efficiency and management; (ii) strengthening
capital budgeting in the road and rail sectors; and (iii) improving the efficiency of public
employment.



Reforming the pension system: The recent reform, while a step in the right direction, appears
insufficient to safeguard the viability of the system without jeopardizing pension benefits. Key
objectives of reform include managing long-run fiscal costs and providing reasonable pension
benefits to all pensioners current and future. In particular, increasing the retirement age would
cushion the projected impact on the labor force stemming from adverse demographic trends.



Strengthening the monetary policy framework: Key elements of reform include (i) further
increasing exchange rate flexibility, as the current geopolitical turmoil abates; and (ii) focusing
monetary policy toward inflation targeting.



Financial sector stability assessment and financial sector development: The banking sector
is stable but a consolidation of the banking system would be beneficial. Some of the 2011 FSAP
recommendations have yet to be implemented. Reforms would centered around: (i) introducing
a unified administration regime for all banks, (ii) restricting open bank assistance by the Deposit
Insurance Agency to systemic situations, (iii) setting limits on concentration of collateral in the
repo market; and (iv) improving SMEs’ access to finance.



Private sector development: Key reforms would aim at (i) improving the business climate;
(ii) increasing competition; (iii) diversifying the economy; and (iv) reducing the footprint of the
state in the economy.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

RUSSIAN FEDERATION



Improving the labor market: Key elements of reform include: (i) reducing skills mismatch; and
(ii) increasing labor market mobility. These reforms would also help to allow for continued
economic mobility and off-setting the demographic challenge of aging.

The teams agreed the following division of labor:


Strengthening the fiscal framework: The Fund will discuss further reform options with the
authorities during the Article IV consultations. The Fund will continue its dialogue with the
authorities on how to modernize the Federal Tax Service and improve transparency and
disclosure of fiscal risks. The Bank will provide assistance on public finance reforms, including tax
policy and administration, inter-budgetary relations, program budgeting and public expenditure
efficiency.



Public expenditure reforms: The Fund will discuss government plans for strengthening the
fiscal rule in the context of the Article IV consultations. The Bank will further explore cooperation
with the authorities in the areas of improving the business environment and public
administration reform, including in the regions.



Reforming the pension system: The Fund will discuss with the authorities the recent public
pension system reform during the Article IV consultations. The World Bank is involved in
activities of the intergovernmental working group on nonstate pension funds under the Ministry
of Finance, which supports the preparation of several legislative initiatives to improve nonstate
pension funds, supervision and operations.



Strengthening the monetary policy framework: The Fund has elaborated reform options and
discussed them with the authorities during the 2014 Article IV consultation. Envisaged follow-up
work includes: (i) examining the optimal width of the policy rate corridor; (ii) coordination
between monetary policy and government operations that affect liquidity conditions; (iii) foreign
exchange intervention policy; and (iv) effective communications policies.



Financial sector stability assessment and financial sector development: The Fund conducted
a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) Update in March/April 2011 and discussed reform
options with the authorities, along with participation of Bank staff. An IMF expert at the CBR
(resident advisor) has helped the authorities adopt the IRB of Basel II (internal-ratings based
approach for measuring credit risks) and Basel III frameworks and implement the
recommendations of the FSAP Update. The Bank board approved a Microfinance development
project which is currently pending signature. The Bank is also preparing a new lending project to
(a) achieve an orderly financial market expansion and development of domestic capital markets
to better serve the needs for corporate finance, (b) enhance financial market stability through a
modernized state-of-the-art regulatory framework and the implementation of robust
supervisory and enforcement mechanisms, and (c) reach global best practice standards in the
market infrastructure and regulation, in order to achieve a broader international reach as a

center of financing. However, with the recent changes in the supervisory architecture and recent
decision to create a Mega-Regulator under the Central Bank of Russia, which will absorb the
functions of the FSFM, the project is stalled and may need to be restructured or transformed
depending on the needs of the CBR.


Private sector development: The Fund will discuss further reform options with the authorities
during the Article IV consultations. The World Bank program supports the government in several
aspects to strengthen the private sector in Russia, this includes lending, technical assistance and
analytical work in the areas of diversification, innovation, and the investment climate.



Improving the labor market: The World Bank is actively supporting the authorities in
improving the vocational education system and in identifying solution for existing labor market
bottlenecks with the goal to increase Russia’s competitiveness.

The teams have the following requests for information from their counterparts:


The Fund team requests to be kept informed of progress in the macro-critical reform areas
under the Bank’s purview and the Bank will provide an assessment of the 2014–16 medium-term
budget in its regular economic report.



The Bank team requested that the Fund share on a regular basis with the Bank and invite, as
needed, the Bank’s comments on policy notes, draft staff reports, and other relevant materials;
and that Bank staff be invited to attend policy meetings, as has already been the case in the
context of Article Consultation Discussions.

The table below lists the teams’ separate and joint work programs during July 2013 to
September 2014.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. However, in the context of emerging
data demands for assessing external vulnerabilities, the scope for further data improvements exists.
Russia is an SDDS subscriber, has a range of statistical dissemination formats, and reports data for
the Fund’s statistical publications. These sources inform surveillance.
National Accounts: Data are broadly adequate for surveillance, but there have been concerns
about the reliability and consistency of quarterly GDP estimates among a wide range of users,
including Fund staff. Rebasing GDP estimates to a recent year would close the gap between GDP
estimate and its components. The Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) started a national account
development plan for 2011–17, which will expedite compilation of quarterly GDP estimates
consistent with the annual GDP estimates.
The Rosstat follows the 1993 SNA in general, although scope exists for methodological
improvements in the calculations of volume measures of the production-based GDP estimates,
including estimates of the output of financial intermediation services indirectly measured (FISIM).
The imputed rental services of owner-occupied dwellings are undervalued. Improvements in the
coverage of source data are constrained by an inadequate response to business surveys. The
unavailability of balance sheet data continues to be an obstacle for analyzing balance sheet
vulnerabilities, and work is underway to disseminate the first quarterly sectoral accounts and balance
sheets for 2012–14 by 2016.
Price statistics: Data are broadly adequate for surveillance. Monthly CPI and PPI, both compiled
using the Two-Stage (Modified) Laspeyres (2000=100), cover all regions of the Russian Federation.
The weights reflect expenditures in the 12 months ended the previous September. Aggregate price
indices are compiled for each good and service item for the 89 regions, seven federal regions, and
the Russian Federation as a whole. However, population weights, as opposed to expenditure shares
are applied to the individual regional indices possibly biasing the CPI downwards if price increases
are higher in regions with higher per capita expenditures. Detailed PPI weight data are published on
the Rosstat website for 2006–2013: and detailed data on total annual sales, which are used to
develop weights for the PPI, are also published by economic activity on the website under the
Entrepreneurship section, industrial subsection. However, the detailed weights are available only on
the Russian version of the website, making it less accessible by users. Further efforts to improve the
treatment of seasonal items in the core inflation index and a new household budget survey—which
has been under consideration for some time—could significantly strengthen data quality.
Government finance statistics: Russia participates in the G-20 Data Gap Initiative. The authorities
compile comprehensive set of the general government accounts based on the Government Finance

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) on annual basis. These data comprise the statement of sources
and uses of cash as well as the accrual based government operations (revenue, expenditure and
transactions in assets and liabilities), complete balance sheet (including non-financial assets),
holding gains and losses and other changes in volume of assets and liabilities, and outlays by
functions of government (COFOG). Monthly GFSM 2001 based statement of sources of uses of cash
is also compiled for the whole general government sector. The main data gaps are due to the
unavailability of quarterly primary data to compile the general government operation statement,
financial balance sheet, and gross debt (by instrument, maturity, residency, and currency). The
actual split of annual debt into foreign and domestic refers to the domestic/foreign currency rather
than residency. Additional gaps remain that affect the data quality for surveillance, for example the
lack of historical quarterly data, unexplained data breaks (for instance the reclassification of some
wage expenses from the budgetary central government accounts to the regional government
accounts (following 2011 reforms ), unavailability of monthly data on ruble guarantees prior to 2011,
no integrated debt monitoring and reporting system, and the lack of reconciliation between
different datasets of fiscal reporting (budget execution, cash flow statement, economic versus
functional classification, fiscal statistics data).
Monetary statistics: In the context of the recent global turmoil, analysis of balance sheet effects has
been hindered by a lack of comparable data on the currency and maturity breakdown of
banking-sector assets and liabilities. Adoption of data reporting in the full detail of the framework
for Standardized Report Forms (SRFs), as recommended by an STA mission in 2007 (and re-affirmed
by the ROSC mission in 2010), would provide comprehensive information on the currency and
instrument breakdowns of the assets and liabilities of the central bank, credit institutions, and other
financial corporations. Since March 2011, the Banking System Survey (which is equivalent to the
Depository Corporations/Broad Money Survey) published by the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) has
included a breakdown of positions by national and foreign currency. Publication of a similar
breakdown of positions by national and foreign currency in the central bank and the credit
institutions surveys would be useful for analysis.
External sector statistics: Balance of payments data are broadly adequate for surveillance, and
significant improvements have been made to enhance data quality. The CBR has recently published
the gross capital flow data for the private sector, which would facilitate the analysis of relatively
complex flows. Starting from 2012, the balance of payments is compiled according to the framework
of the Fund’s Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, sixth edition
(BPM6) and the CBR has revised historical data (2005–11), consistent with BPM6.
Partial data from a variety of sources are supplemented by the use of estimates and adjustments to
improve data coverage. In particular, the CBR makes adjustments to merchandise import data
published by the Federal Customs Service to account for “shuttle trade,” smuggling, and
undervaluation. Statistical techniques are also used to estimate transactions and positions of
foreign-owned enterprises with production sharing agreements, and these techniques are
continuously being improved. At the same time, Russian compilers are seeking to reconcile their
data with those of partner countries. Improvements have been made in the coverage and quality of

10

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

surveys on direct investment, and the CBR is participating in the Fund’s Coordinated Direct
Investment Survey.
Energy sector statistics: Data on the impact of oil production and exports on economic activity are
inadequate for surveillance. In recent years, the levels of oil production and consumption, and oil
price fluctuations have had a significant impact on economies of individual countries and for Russia,
the relative impact of oil production and exports on GDP has grown over the past decade. As a
result, there has been increased demand for information on oil and gas activities and products. It
would therefore be useful to measure the share of oil and gas sector in GDP, preferably on an
annual basis. The Russia team is currently working closely with the authorities, exploring options to
overcome this deficiency during 2014.

B. Data Standards and Quality
Subscriber to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since January 31, 2005. SDDS
flexibility option used for the timeliness of data on central government operations. A data ROSC
prepared in October 2003 was published on the IMF website on May 14, 2004. A data ROSC
reassessment in June-July 2010 was published on the IMF website on February 28, 2011 and
concluded that Russia’s macroeconomic statistics are generally of high quality. It found that
compiling agencies have made significant progress in adopting international statistical
methodologies and best practices.

C. Reporting to STA (Optional)
Data are being reported for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS), Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook, the Direction of Trade Statistics, and the Balance of Payments Statistics
Yearbook. The CBR reports the summarized data, in the MFSM-recommended format for the
surveys, on (i) the Central Bank Survey, (ii) the Other Depository Corporations Survey (covering
credit institutions), (iii) the Depository Corporations Survey, (iv) the Other Financial Corporation
Survey (covering insurance companies and private pension funds), and (v) the Financial Corporations
Survey (data cover the banking system, insurance companies, and private pension funds). For the
general government, the cash flow statement is published in the IFS, and operation statement
(economic and functional classifications) and financial balance sheet are published in the annual
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. Headline data on reserves are reported to the Fund and the
markets on a weekly basis with a four-business day lag. Comprehensive information is reported in
the Reserves Template with a lag of 20 days, exceeding SDDS timeliness requirement of one month.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with the Russian Federation

On June 27, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with the Russian Federation.
The growth slowdown that began in 2011, reflecting structural constraints, continued in
2013 despite accommodative policies. Real GDP growth slowed to 1.3 percent due to a
contraction in investment while consumption remained robust owing to strong real wage growth
and an unsecured consumer credit boom. The general government balance moved from a modest
surplus in 2012 to a deficit of slightly more than 1 percent of GDP in 2013. The Central Bank of
the Russian Federation (CBR) kept its policy rates constant until March 2014 despite abovetarget inflation.
More recently, geopolitical tensions have brought the Russian economy to a standstill. Staff
projects real GDP growth at 0.2 percent in 2014 with considerable downside risks. Concerns
about sanctions so far, as well as the threat of additional sanctions in the future, following
Russia's actions in Crimea, have increased the uncertainty of doing business in Russia and are
having a chilling effect on investment. Capital outflows could reach US$100 billion in 2014.
Consumption will remain the main growth driver in 2014 while net exports are also expected to
support growth as imports weaken. A slight recovery in growth to 1 percent is projected in 2015,
on the back of stronger exports and stabilization of investment. Despite the economic slowdown,
inflation is expected to remain well above the CBR’s target due to the recent exchange rate
depreciation.
Fiscal policy is being tightened. However, the non-oil deficit will remain high, highlighting
Russia’s reliance on revenues from exhaustible resources. The Reserve Fund balance has
increased but remains well short of the government’s 7 percent of GDP target.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
The CBR raised policy rates by 1½ percentage points in early March and a further ½ percentage
point in April and reduced exchange rate flexibility in response to the onset of geopolitical
tensions. The CBR also increased to US$1.5 billion the cumulative interventions required to
move the exchange rate corridor, lowering the flexibility of its FX rule. The discretionary
policies followed by the authorities helped contain the heightened currency and liquidity stress.
By the end of May, as the exchange rate traded firmly in the non-intervention zone, the CBR
took steps to allow more exchange rate flexibility.
The banking system remains broadly stable amid a gradual slowdown of unsecured retail credit
growth and a stepping-up of bank oversight. Non-performing loans ratio has remained relatively
constant. Capital adequacy ratio has been stable and remains above the statutory minimum. The
banking system has moved from a negative to a positive net foreign asset position, limiting
aggregate currency mismatch.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that despite accommodative policies, the Russian economy continues
to experience a slowdown, reflecting mainly structural factors. Directors agreed that, with the
economy operating close to its full potential, Russia’s growth model based on energy exports
with increasing oil prices and use of spare capacity is no longer reliable and that there is need to
move to a new model.
Directors observed that the geopolitical tensions are having strong negative consequences for the
Russian economy. The related sanctions and the possibility of their escalation have had an
impact through capital outflows, exchange rate pressures, and limited access to external
financing with higher borrowing costs, and are also raising the uncertainty of doing business in
Russia. Directors agreed that, while the immediate policy priority is to preserve macroeconomic
stability, enhancing the policy framework and undertaking further structural reforms will be
essential to boost investment and raise growth potential in the long term.
Directors concurred that the fiscal stance in 2014 is broadly appropriate but noted that flexibility
could be considered in the event of a more severe cyclical downturn. They emphasized that
adhering to the fiscal rule should support its credibility and the needed medium-term fiscal
consolidation to rebuild buffers and safeguard intergenerational equity. Directors welcomed the
changes to the public pension system but stressed that additional measures, such as increasing
the mandatory retirement age, would be necessary to ensure long-term viability of the system.

2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3
They highlighted that resisting spending pressures and increasing efficiency gains would help
create space for infrastructure investment.
Directors agreed that a tighter monetary policy stance is required to achieve the 2015 inflation
target and anchor expectations. They also welcomed the authorities’ commitment to continue
moving to an inflation targeting regime and to a fully-flexible exchange rate once the current
uncertainty subsides. In this context, they took note of the recent measures taken to increase
exchange rate flexibility.
Directors noted that the banking system remains generally stable and welcomed the regulatory
steps taken to slow the growth of unsecured retail lending. They concurred that the Central Bank
should continue to monitor the build-up of systemic risks through regular stress testing exercises
and increased oversight. Directors underscored that a deeper and more efficient financial system
would facilitate access to credit and support long-term growth. They also encouraged
implementation of the remaining Financial Sector Assessment Program recommendations, and
called for steps to reduce banking sector fragmentation through consolidation and enhancing
competition among banks.
Directors considered that deeper structural reforms are critical to enhancing Russia’s growth
prospects. They welcomed the authorities’ efforts to fight corruption and improve procurement
and the business environment. They encouraged the authorities to curtail state involvement in the
economy, reduce price distortions, especially utility prices, and take further measures to increase
investment and productivity. Directors also urged the authorities to revive the nearly-stalled
privatization program.
