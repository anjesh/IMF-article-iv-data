STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
March 10, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context. Thailand’s economy is undergoing a modest recovery after a sharp contraction
in early 2014, when domestic demand was adversely affected by political unrest in
Bangkok. The government was replaced in May 2014 in a military coup, which led to the
end of large-scale street demonstrations and an improvement of business and consumer
confidence.
Outlook. The recovery is expected to continue, with GDP increasing 3.7 percent in 2015,
although the economy is lacking a strong growth engine. With output below potential
and sharply lower fuel prices, annual CPI inflation is projected to fall to 0.1 percent,
undershooting the new target range. Risks to the outlook are slightly to the downside,
reflecting political and policy uncertainty and potential surge in global financial volatility.
Macroeconomic policy mix. The government’s plans for near-term fiscal stimulus
followed by consolidation within a medium-term framework are appropriate. Monetary
accommodation remains appropriate, and a further loosening may be useful if fiscal
stimulus is delayed. The exchange rate is broadly consistent with medium-term
fundamentals.
Fiscal policy. Fuel price reform and elimination of the rice pledging scheme have
reduced distortions by replacing price interventions with targeted income support. They
have also freed up some fiscal room, which can be used to finance the government’s
much-needed infrastructure investment program. An increase in the VAT, once the
recovery is firmly entrenched, will help keep public debt sustainable in the medium term.
Financial stability. Thailand has taken a number of important steps to strengthen the
financial stability framework, including the decision to extend the Bank of Thailand’s
supervisory and regulatory mandate to Specialized Financial Institutions. Credit growth
has moderated considerably. Nevertheless, pockets of vulnerability remain; mainly, high
household debt and the growth of nonbank financial intermediaries.
Structural policies. Thailand’s growth has slowed significantly in the last few years.
Looking forward, an aging population will present new challenges. Measures to augment
dwindling labor supply, increase infrastructure investment, improve education and
training, provide new incentives for R&D and high-value-added production, and step up
regional integration are expected to boost inclusive growth.

OVERVIEW

3.
Resilience. Despite a series of large
shocks, solid fundamentals have helped maintain
macrofinancial stability. Thailand has ample
international reserves, and the flexible exchange
rate has been an effective buffer against balanceof-payments shocks. The fiscal position is prudent
and public debt is moderate. Economic institutions
are credible. The banking system is well capitalized,
profitable and liquid.

1.
Political context. Thailand is going through a political transition. A decade of intermittent
political conflict and a succession of exogenous shocks have hampered policymaking and weakened
economic performance. A military coup in May 2014 ended large-scale social protests in Bangkok
and pacified the country, and a modest recovery has taken place. Nonetheless, there is still some
uncertainty as to how the polarization in the political system will be resolved even as the authorities
indicate that a new constitution will be approved this year and new elections will take place in 2016.

strategy is needed to tackle structural challenges and reinvigorate inclusive growth. To address
these issues, the government has embarked on a comprehensive reform agenda that cuts across
many areas, including education, healthcare, social inequalities, infrastructure investment, and other
policies to enhance growth, regional integration, and governance (Appendix I).

notably rice and rubber. Import compression
was another contributing factor, with real net exports increasing despite a lackluster export
performance and a fall in tourist arrivals as a result of the political situation. A financial account
deficit roughly offset the current account surplus, and international reserves declined by
US$10 billion to US$157 billion over the course of 2014, primarily due to valuation changes.

B. Outlook and Risks
8.
Outlook. A moderate rebound from a low base is expected for 2015. Private consumption
will be supported by pent-up demand and lower fuel prices. Investment should rebound after two
years of decline as various government agencies have cleared the backlog of project approvals.
Tourism is expected to continue the recovery started in recent months. However, the recovery of
domestic demand is expected to be moderate since private investment is hampered by low capacity
utilization, weak demand prospects, and political uncertainty, while consumption is held back by
high household debt and tighter credit conditions. Moreover, ramping up public investment is
taking longer than anticipated. With the economy lacking a strong engine, staff forecast growth of
3.7 percent in 2015. Inflation will largely be driven by oil price dynamics and the government’s
energy price policy. In the baseline, headline inflation is expected to pick up by end 2015, but yearaverage is projected at 0.1 percent.
9.
Risks. Risks to the outlook are tilted somewhat to the downside (Appendix II). Domestic risks
to the economy come from possible policy slippages, weaker-than-expected private demand, and
political uncertainty. External risks include a surge in global financial volatility and protracted slow
growth in advanced and emerging economies. On the upside, consumption, investment and exports
may experience a stronger boost from lower oil prices.
10.
Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly agreed with staff on the outlook. However, they
viewed risks to growth as roughly balanced, with downside risks—coming mostly from the external
front, particularly from the increased economic and policy divergence across key economies—offset

by an upside from faster-than-expected government spending boosting confidence and low oil
prices stimulating domestic demand. They also noted that Thailand has sufficient buffers to deal
with any potential global financial volatility.

REGAINING MOMENTUM WHILE SAFEGUARDING
STABILITY
A. Fiscal Policy—Boosting Potential Growth in a Sustainable Way
11.
Recent developments. In 2014, the fiscal position weakened in response to the sluggish
economy, earlier-approved tax cuts and other measures. The corporate income tax was reduced
from 30 to 23 percent in January 2012 and again to 20 percent in January 2013. Together with the
slowdown of the economy, the general government revenue decreased from 24.1 percent of GDP in
FY2012/13 to 22.5 percent in FY2013/14.4 At the same time, general government expenditures
remained at 24.3 percent of GDP, even as infrastructure spending dropped significantly on account
of political unrest. The debt-to-GDP ratio of the overall public sector, including state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) reached 45.5 percent in FY2013/14, well below the government’s ceiling of
60 percent. (Figure 3).

The FY2014/15 budget. The new government formulated a prudent budget, which gives
priority to restoring confidence while keeping the deficit largely unchanged at 2 percent of GDP.
Furthermore, with the fiscal stimulus package of about 3 percent of GDP announced in
October 2014, the authorities intended to boost spending in the first half of the year, in particular on
infrastructure projects, supplemented by carry-over of unspent funds from previous years.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THAILAND

Preliminary data suggest that budget execution in the first quarter did not meet the authorities’
expectations.
13.
Fiscal strategy. In the current juncture, fiscal policies should support the economic recovery
in the context of a medium-term fiscal framework that clearly signals the commitment by the
authorities to fiscal discipline. Higher public spending now, in particular on high-return
infrastructure, training and other areas that will boost potential growth, should be framed in a multiyear setting that comes along with credible plans for reforms on both the revenue and expenditure
side.
14.
Medium-term fiscal framework. The mission strongly supports the authorities’ plan to
prepare a new fiscal responsibility law (Public Finance Act). The new law should require the
formulation of a medium-term fiscal framework by the Cabinet that would show the expected path
of public debt as percent of GDP—in staff’s views, the current debt ceiling of 60 percent of GDP
prescribed in the Cabinet-approved fiscal Sustainability Framework is appropriate. The framework is
also expected to include a fiscal policy statement with a multi-year macroeconomic outlook, fiscal
objectives and targets, fiscal risk statement, debt sustainability analysis (see Appendix IV for staff’s
DSA) and long-term fiscal projections.
15.
Infrastructure projects. Staff welcomes the formulation of a multi-year public investment
plan for large infrastructure projects that aim at significantly enhancing connectivity with
neighboring countries and reducing logistic costs. Moreover, moving the projects to the budget,
both by the government and SOEs, is a welcome development that contributes to enhancing
transparency and accountability. The formulation of a medium-term fiscal framework will help
strengthen the link between budget and infrastructure investments, which are expected to increase
only gradually in the coming years. Given past unsuccessful attempts of ramping up public
investments, the authorities should consider carrying out an evaluation of the public investment
process with a view to identifying bottlenecks and potential efficiency gains.5

The staff’s baseline fiscal projections are consistent with the budget approved for 2014/15 but assume a lower
implementation rate for public investment projects (50 percent) for subsequent years.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THAILAND

16.
State-owned enterprise reform. Staff welcomes the authorities’ plan to strengthen
transparency and governance of SOEs, and to carry out a strategic review of all SOEs. SOEs play a
large role in service delivery, in particular in the transport and energy sectors. Their debt amounts
to 9 percent of GDP and 19 percent of total public debt. The authorities’ plan to restructure state
enterprises such as the State Railway of Thailand and the Bangkok Mass Transit Authority are
opportune, as these entities play an important role in transport infrastructure.
17.
Subsidy reform. Staff welcomes the subsidy reforms by the authorities, which have
contributed to rationalizing public expenditures while enhancing fiscal transparency.


Fuel subsidies. The authorities are implementing an energy pricing reform to reduce large
price cross-subsidies between energy sources, while ensuring that the vulnerable population
is protected through means-testing procedures (Appendix III). In addition, excises on diesel
are being gradually reinstated while LPG subsidies are reduced. The retail price of gasoline
has been reduced by passing through the lower international price. Staff welcomes the
ongoing energy price reform. The authorities should take advantage of the lower
international oil prices to fully reinstate excises, which would generate an
additional 0.5 percent of GDP starting in 2015, while continuing to protect vulnerable groups
with transfers that are means-tested.



Rice scheme. The authorities have abolished the rice pledging scheme that allowed farmers
to sell rice at above-market prices to the government, and introduced a new scheme that
provides direct cash transfers to small-scale farmers only. This is expected to result in
savings of about ½ percent of GDP per year.



Public obligation services. Government transfers to SOEs amount to about 0.8 percent of
GDP in the FY2014/15 budget and support the provision of public obligation services at
below-cost prices. As part of an effort to enhance fiscal transparency, the authorities should
improve the disclosure of public service obligations of SOEs, which could be included in an
annual consolidated report that covers fiscal risks.

18.
Tax policy. Staff welcomes the authorities’ plan to introduce an inheritance tax while
strengthening property taxes, with a view to enhancing the progressivity of the tax system. While
these taxes and energy reform are the priorities for now, the authorities should consider, under the
medium-term fiscal framework, the gradual increase of the VAT rate to 10 percent, from the current
7 percent, starting only when the economic recovery is well entrenched, while introducing programs
to mitigate the impact on vulnerable groups. Higher VAT is critical to bring the fiscal balance back
towards equilibrium over the next few years, by offsetting the revenue loss from the recent
reduction in personal and corporate income taxes. It would also allow for higher infrastructure
spending and for the needs of an aging population in the coming years.
19.
Tax administration and tax expenditures. The authorities are undertaking a strategic
review of the tax administration, in particular the Revenue Department, and have initiated a
technical dialogue on this issue with the Fund. In the face of a changing environment, there are

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

THAILAND

opportunities to improve the core tax administration processes, including those for registering
taxpayers, filing and processing tax returns and payments, and collecting tax arrears.
20.
Authorities‘ views. The authorities broadly agreed with the staff view of the overall
strategy.


The authorities emphasized that the short-term priority is to stimulate the domestic
economy through expansionary fiscal policy, while committing to fiscal discipline by
adopting new legislation on fiscal responsibility, drawing on international best practices.
They noted that the FY2015/16 budget, which is currently under consideration, envisages an
increase in the allocation of funds for capital expenditures. At the same time, the authorities
reiterated the importance of striking the right balance between speedy spending and the
need to ensure high transparency. The review of the governance of state enterprises is also
underway, with the “The State Enterprises Policy Committee6” taking the lead in proposing
the restructuring of some entities.



The authorities noted the sensitivity in raising the VAT rate, while recognizing the need to
enhance tax revenue in a medium-term setting. They agreed that a sustained economic
recovery is necessary before increasing the VAT rate.

Policy stance. While the current monetary stance is accommodative, there is scope for
further easing if the recovery is weaker than anticipated. The Bank of Thailand (BOT) cut the policy

response disappoints. In light of the banks’
tightening of lending standards, in staff’s views a lower policy rate would not exacerbate financial
stability risks, including from a rapid acceleration in consumer loan growth.

Also known as the Super Board and chaired by the Prime Minister, this committee was established in June 2014, to
recommend policies, management, and development plans for all SOEs.

10

THAILAND

22.
Inflation target. The Cabinet has approved the use of headline inflation instead of core
inflation and has set the target for the year-average CPI inflation at 2.5±1.5 percent for 2015. If
inflation falls outside the band, the BOT is to provide an explanation for the deviation, its
expectation regarding the timing of returning inflation to the target band, and contemplated
monetary policy response in an open letter to the Minister of Finance. In fact, as headline inflation
turned negative in January, BOT issued a letter in which it ascribed the negative inflation to a sharp
one-off fall in oil prices and sought to dispel concerns about generalized deflation by emphasizing
the stability of inflation expectations. It also highlighted the positive impact of the terms-of-trade
improvement on the economy and the long lags in monetary policy transmission and concluded
that its current accommodative stance should help lift headline inflation back within the target band
by year-end. Staff welcomes the switch to using headline inflation target, which is likely to facilitate
communication with the public by focusing on the most relevant and best understood measure. On
the other hand, the focus on the year-average measure of inflation may present communication
challenges. In addition, given the lags in monetary policy transmission and the importance of
anchoring expectations, setting indicative targets beyond the one-year horizon could be considered.
23.
Authorities’ views. The authorities viewed the current monetary policy stance as sufficiently
accommodative given the steady path of economic recovery in 2015. They agreed that the cyclical
stance of the economy suggested a need for stimulus, but believed that fiscal measures would be
the main factor supporting the economic recovery, while the effectiveness of monetary policy
transmission may be weakened in the current environment of low interest rate. They were also
concerned about unintended consequences of lower rates on financial stability. The authorities
explained that setting headline inflation as the monetary policy target would help facilitate central
bank communication and therefore anchor public inflation expectations more effectively. In
addition, targeting annual average inflation would provide them additional flexibility in dealing with
temporary shock, but does not preclude monitoring and, if warranted, reacting to monthly inflation
numbers.

C. Maintaining External Resilience
24.
Current account. The current account surplus is expected to rise somewhat in 2015 due to
lower oil prices, and then decline in the medium term.


Export growth has slowed significantly since 2012 on account of weaker global demand,
government’s intervention in the rice market, and lower commodity prices. Thailand’s export
share in global markets has declined slightly since early this decade, indicating emerging
competitiveness problems. These problems can be partially observed in a declining share of
electronic products in total exports, which was not fully offset by an increase in automotive
exports. Looking forward, exports are projected to grow only modestly on account of weak
global demand.



The rapid growth of tourism, in particular from China, has been the main driver of service
exports, although political unrest adversely affected tourism in 2014. However, tourism

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

THAILAND

appears to be gaining momentum as shown by a strong recovery in tourist arrivals in
December 2014.


Imports fell sharply in 2014, due to the decline in oil
prices, but more importantly to a sharp demand
contraction. Going forward, a gradual recovery in
imports is expected with the implementation of public
infrastructure programs and recovery of oil prices.

account balances have deteriorated in the last two years. Overall, the capital and financial account
registered a deficit of about US$15 billion in 2014.


Foreign direct investment (FDI) remains the largest form of capital inflows. Inward FDI
declined from US$13 billion in 2013 to US$12 billion in 2014, while outward FDI remained at
US$7 billion in 2013 and 2014. As a result, net FDI turned positive in 2013 and 2014 (from a
deficit in 2012). The government has taken steps to encourage inward FDI and liberalize
outward FDI. These steps may contribute to more startup of newly approved foreign
investment projects and a sustained increase of Thai FDI, especially to China and
neighboring countries.



Recent trends in portfolio flows to Thailand have been similar to those in other industrialized
ASEAN countries, driven mainly by changing risk appetite of investors. Although there were
net portfolio outflows in 2014, Thailand’s bond and equity markets remained resilient.



The net international investment position (NIIP) deteriorated from -2 percent of GDP in 2009
to -18 percent of GDP in 2013. Given the overall current account surplus during that period,
the deterioration likely reflects valuation effects and data revision. Going forward, the NIIP is
expected to remain broadly stable in the medium term.

26.
External sector assessment. Thailand’s 2014 current account (CA) and real effective
exchange rate (REER) are close to levels consistent with medium-term fundamentals and appropriate
policies. This assessment is based on the External Balance Assessment (EBA), a regression based
model analysis, and incorporates the impact of oil price declines and delayed public investment
in 2014 (Appendix VI). While the CA surplus is expected to widen in 2015 on account of lower oil
prices, it is expected to narrow to balance in the medium term. The REER is within a range of
±5 percent of the equilibrium level. The international reserves stand at 213 percent of the Fund’s
reserve adequacy metric. Thailand’s external debt is projected to remain relatively low over the
medium term, gradually declining from 37.9 percent of GDP in 2014 to 33.6 percent of GDP in 2020
(Appendix V).
27.
Regional integration. Thailand is increasingly taking advantage of its geographic location
by intensifying its integration with Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam (CLMV) and southern
China (Appendix VII). Multilateral infrastructure projects are improving the mobility of goods and

labor, while rapid growth in the neighboring economies has already expanded markets for Thai
goods and services. Both Thai and foreign companies have relocated some basic processing and
assembly activities to Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in the neighboring countries to take advantage
of lower labor cost in those countries. Some Thai conglomerates have become globally competitive,
and the launch of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) in 2015 may provide new opportunities
for investment and trade, including the reduction of tariffs for Thai goods in neighboring CLMV
countries.
28.
Authorities’ views. The authorities project that the current account in 2015−20, while
remaining in surplus, will decline gradually toward near-balance. They expected the financial
account, especially foreign portfolio flows, to remain volatile mainly due to volatility in global
financial markets. However, Thailand’s strong local investor base, both institutional and retail, should
enable orderly adjustments. The flexible exchange rate provides an important first line of defense
against external shocks. The authorities noted that Thailand’s competitiveness has been
deteriorating and Thailand has been losing its share of FDI relative to regional peers. However, the
prospects are promising as they are supported by strong fundamentals, planned public
infrastructure projects, geographical advantages, and the (Thai) Board of Investment’s (BOI) new
approach to investment incentives. The recently established SEZs in five border provinces facilitate
regional integration.

STRENGTHENING FINANCIAL STABILITY FRAMEWORK
29.
Financial landscape. Thailand’s financial landscape has changed since the global financial
crisis. The financial sector in Thailand is large, with assets near 359 percent of GDP. Commercial
banks assets account for 128 percent of GDP, higher than in Indonesia and the Philippines
(Appendix VIII). Growth in non-commercial banks financial assets has outpaced that of commercial
bank assets since 2008. As a result, while commercial bank credit-to-GDP ratio increased from
99 percent in 2007 to 128 percent in 2013, total

THAILAND

31.
Credit. As noted, total financial institution credit rose from 154 percent of GDP in 2007
to 197 percent in 2013. In the last two years, however, credit growth has slowed considerably, whole
Thai corporate foreign currency borrowing has also declined since 2013. Both supply and demand
factors have played a role. On the supply side, banks and SFIs have become more cautious in their
lending standards to households and small and medium enterprises (SME), while the expiration of
tax incentives for car purchase, lower investment and high household debt have dampened credit
demand. Market observers have noted that Thai corporates have a cautious approach to borrowing
due to the lessons from the Asian financial crisis. In view of the slowing credit growth, low share of
real estate loans, and no apparent real estate boom, staff does not see a need to tighten
macroprudential policies despite the low-interest-rate environment. Looking forward, credit is
expected to provide a smaller contribution to growth given the high leverage of households.
32.
Commercial banks. Commercial banks weathered the global financial crisis and political
turmoil well. Banks appear to be well capitalized, liquid, and profitable. While nonperforming loans
(NPLs) are rising, they remain low, and commercial banks appear well prepared to deal with them.
Banks are also expected to be able to handle well even higher NPLs if an economic downturn where
to lead to debt repayment problems, including from low income households that appear to be over
indebted. Basle III regulations on capital have been implemented. However, liquidity risks have risen
as seen in the high loan-to-deposit ratio and higher reliance on wholesale funding. While
commercial banks have become more cautious in lending to households and SMEs, they do not face
capital or liquidity constraints to expand credit (Figure 7).
33.
Household debt. After rising very fast for a number of years, the growth of household debt
has moderated. Thailand’s household debt-to-GDP ratio rose from 55 percent in 2007 to 84 percent
in 2014. Commercial banks provided only about 40 percent of household loans, while SFIs and NBFIs
supplied the rest. More than two thirds of household loans were used for consumption (including
purchases of cars and other durables), farming, and business, with the remainder used to buy real
estate and land. The authorities should strengthen monitoring the quality of consumption loans,

whose collateral value tends to be lower than that of housing. Mirroring the relatively low share of
real estate loans, Thailand has not gone through a real estate boom in recent years, except in
selected urban locations. Mitigating the risks are strong financial buffers, with household financial
assets at about twice the level of household debt. Household savings increasingly go to other forms
of financial instruments and vehicles, such as retail bonds and mutual funds (Figure 8).
34.
Corporate sector debt. Nonfinancial corporates appear to have reduced their bank loans in
recent years, partly due to the availability of

could result in opaque balance sheets.
35.
Regulation of non-commercial-banks. SFIs and NBFIs represent a large and growing
segment of the Thai financial sector. SFIs are interconnected with commercial banks via interbank
loans and exposure to the same customers. Staff welcomes the authorities’ plan to extend the BOT’s
supervisory and regulatory mandate to SFIs and encourages them to adopt an operational plan
swiftly. At the same time, the authorities should undertake a strategic review of the SFIs, including
their mandate, services, and financial operations with a view of clarifying their mandates and
focusing their operations in areas not covered by commercial banks. Given that SFIs face different
legal frameworks, a separate transitional plan is likely to be needed for each. In addition, credit
cooperatives, whose role and interconnectedness within the financial system are on the rise, are
regulated by the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), which appears to have insufficient supervisory
resources to oversee large credit cooperatives. Therefore, supervision of credit cooperatives should
be strengthened substantially, including through the technical assistance of the BOT to the MOA.
36.
Financial stability framework. Staff welcomes the steps that the BOT has taken to
strengthen the financial stability framework, including the publication of Financial Stability Reports
(FSRs) and the establishment of a Financial Stability Committee. In the latest FSR, the BOT’s stress
test of an interest rate shock (amounting to 2 percent) suggested that Thai firms can withstand this
shock, even as loan growth would slow down and banks’ nonperforming assets would increase
somewhat. Staff encourages the authorities to strengthen data collection to close data gaps in noncommercial banks. In addition, staff urges vigilance regarding financial risks related to household
debt and large Thai conglomerates. Finally, the authorities should review the crisis management
framework including the modalities for liquidity provision and bank resolution, as well as the
protocols for information sharing and policy coordination among various financial regulators.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

THAILAND

37.
Authorities’ views. The authorities see the main risk as over-indebtedness among lowincome households that borrowed from SFIs, while they believe that middle- and upper-middle
income groups may still have borrowing space. The authorities have placed high priority on
strengthening the work on financial stability as a strategic objective, including monitoring,
mitigating, and managing systemic risks. To this end, they have created a Financial Stability
Committee within the BOT that is tasked with systemic risk monitoring and mitigation. This
committee is composed of high-level executives from relevant departments such as monetary
policy, financial markets operations, financial institutions policy, banking supervision, and others. In
addition, the two FSRs, which were published in 2013 and 2014, identified credit risks from
household and SME loans with domestic consumption-related businesses as the main risks to the
financial sector. To strengthen the effectiveness of financial surveillance, the BOT encourages the
savings and credit cooperatives to include their clients in the national credit bureau database. By
linking with this database, the cooperatives will benefit from information supplied by other financial
intermediaries.

REINVIGORATING INCLUSIVE GROWTH
38.
Structural challenges. Thailand faces rapid population aging, with the dependency ratio
expected to trough this year and then start rising swiftly (Appendix IX). Nearly 40 percent of the
labor force is employed in low-productivity agriculture, and the reallocation of resources to higher
value-added sectors appears to have stalled (Appendix X). A significant share of Thailand’s export
capacity is in electronics, with some products facing low global demand growth (hard disk drives, fax
machines, digital cameras). While Thailand’s ranking in overall global competitiveness is strong (31
of 144), it ranks much lower on innovation, technological readiness, and education quality.7
39.
Avoiding the middle-income trap. Increasing productivity growth is crucial, and can be
achieved through several complementary channels. Implementing the ambitious public
infrastructure investment plans will alleviate bottlenecks and boost connectivity within Thailand and
with neighboring countries. Putting greater emphasis on practical subjects and cognitive skills in
schools, improving teacher standards, and aligning vocational training with labor market demand
would prepare the workforce better for the challenges of the modern economy.8 The welcome
replacement of rice and rubber price guarantees with targeted transfers should encourage
movement of farm workers to higher-productivity sectors.
40.
Addressing demographic challenge. There is scope to offset the impact of unfavorable
demographics by raising participation rates and by facilitating immigration. Older persons, whose
share in the population is rapidly increasing, may be induced to stay employed longer by more
flexible and accommodative working arrangements. The mandatory retirement at age 60 for

16

THAILAND

government employees should be reconsidered. In addition, Thailand would benefit from
streamlining its immigration system and opening its doors to more migrants.
41.
Authorities’ views. The authorities emphasized that Thailand is in the process of laying a
more solid foundation to future growth potential through numerous reforms aimed at modernizing
the economy. A new 7-year strategic plan launched by the Board of Investment incentivizes R&D
and innovation and promotes high value-added manufacturing. The ongoing public infrastructure
program will help eliminate logistic bottlenecks. A plan to improve access to finance by SMEs will
create an enabling environment to facilitate structural transformation of the economy. SOE reform
will improve their efficiency and transparency. The authorities also noted that the mandatory
retirement age has already been raised for some categories of civil servants and a broader increase
is under discussion.

STAFF APPRAISAL
42.
Outlook. The economy is recovering gradually from the disruption inflicted by a series of
shocks, including political unrest. A recovery in domestic demand is projected to boost GDP growth
by 3.7 percent in 2015, but with public investment projects slow to take off the ground and a weak
global environment, the economy is still lacking a strong engine of growth, and risks are to the
downside.
43.
Policy overview. Both monetary and fiscal stimuli are needed in the near term to support
the fledgling economic recovery. Over the medium term, fiscal consolidation and structural reforms
are essential to accelerate growth, while maintaining stability.
44.
Fiscal policy. Staff welcomes the ongoing energy price reform aimed at eliminating price
distortions and replacing price subsidies with targeted income support. In the same vein, replacing
price support for rice and rubber with transfers to needy farmers will reduce price distortions and
increase fiscal space. Staff endorses the broad strategy of providing fiscal stimulus in the near term,
particularly by accelerating infrastructure investment, followed by consolidation within a mediumterm framework. Raising the VAT rate once the recovery is firmly entrenched will be essential for
strengthening the revenue system and capping the public debt within the government’s ceiling in
the face of the ambitious public investment program.
45.
Monetary policy. With the economy still below potential, the current accommodative
monetary policy stance remains appropriate. However, further easing of the monetary stance may
be considered if fiscal stimulus is weaker than expected and the economic recovery remains
sluggish. Staff endorses the transition from targeting core to headline inflation, as it will facilitate
communication and enhance accountability.
46.
External sector. An improvement in the terms of trade has boosted the current account in
the short term. The exchange rate reacted flexibly to domestic and external shocks, including volatile
capital flows. On the whole, the baht has been broadly stable against the U.S. dollar over the course

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

THAILAND

of 2014, but has appreciated in nominal and real effective terms, particularly since July. Both the
current account balance and the real exchange rate are assessed to be close to levels consistent with
medium-term fundamentals and appropriate policies.
47.
Financial sector. Credit growth has slowed, but the degree of interconnectedness in the
financial system has increased and remains a source of vulnerability. Staff welcomes the recent
measures to enhance financial stability, including the publication of the Financial Stability Report
and the extension of BOT’s regulation and supervision to include SFIs and the formation of the
Financial Stability Committee. At the same time, the oversight of the fast-growing credit cooperative
sector needs to be strengthened.
48.
Structural policies. The government has taken a number of important structural measures
to reduce price distortions, enhance public infrastructure, promote high-value-added
manufacturing, boost regional integration, and improve education and training that are likely to
spur productivity growth and lift inclusive growth over the medium term. In light of the tight labor
market, the authorities should consider measures that would offset the impact of population aging
on labor supply, including raising the mandatory retirement age for civil servants and regularizing
migration from neighboring countries.
49.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Thailand take place on a
standard 12-month cycle.

Appendix I. Reform Agenda
Reforms. The authorities are currently working on a broad set of reforms through the national reform
council- a deliberate forum created to analyze and prepare reforms to the legislative body called The
National Legislative Assembly.
Scope and timeline. The government envisages moving forward in three phases and has
identified 11 areas for undertaking policies, some of which would lead to reforms. The first phase, which
was completed by the Military leaders that comprise the National Council for Peace and Order before
the formation of the current government, aimed at pacifying the country after a period. The second
phase began with the promulgation of the interim constitution in July 2014 and the ensuing formation
of the National Legislative Assembly and the Council of Ministers. The third stage will see the
organization of a general election under a new Constitution. Under this broadly-defined timeline, the
government intends to undertake policies and reforms in 11 areas that cut across a large spectrum of
issues that Thailand is facing.

11 areas of policies under the new government
1. Protecting and Upholding the Monarchy
2. Maintaining National Security and Foreign Affairs
3. Reducing Social Inequality and Creating Opportunities to Access Public Services
4. Education, Learning, and Fostering Religions, Arts and Culture
5. Improving the Quality of Public Health Services and Public Health
6. Enhancing the Country's Economic Potential
7. Promoting Thailand's Role and Exploring Opportunities in the ASEAN Community
8. Developing and Promoting the Application of Science, Technology, Research and
Development, and Innovation
9. Maintaining the Security of the Resource Base and Creating Balance between Conservation
and Sustainable Use
10. Promoting Administration of State Affairs that Upholds Good Governance and Prevents
and Suppress Corruption and Malfeasance in the Public Sector
11. Improving Laws and the Judicial Process

Economic agenda. In the area of enhancing economic potential, the government has announced its
intentions to push for many of the long-awaited reform agendas that they view as critically important in
enhancing Thailand’s competitiveness, while addressing social inequality. Reforms mentioned cover
such areas as energy prices (Appendix III), the tax structure, transport infrastructure, management of
state enterprises, and promotion of innovation and industries with high value-added sectors.

Appendix II. Thailand—Risk Assessment Matrix
Nature/Source

Likelihood

Impact

Policies to Minimize Impact

of Threat
External Risks
A surge in financial
volatility

H

M: While high international reserves and sound
commercial banks would mitigate the impact, a surge in
global financial market volatility could be disruptive,
particularly against the backdrop of vulnerabilities in
the nonbanks and SFIs and growing linkages between
cross-border financial flows and domestic credit
expansion

Allow exchange rate flexibility to be the first
line of defense, with judicious currency
intervention to avoid excessive volatility and
overshooting. Provide liquidity to ensure
orderly markets. Hold monetary policy and
use fiscal stimulus to bolster demand if market
volatility and capital outflows affect the real
economy.

Protracted period of
slower growth in
advanced economies

H

M: Deterioration in the advanced countries economic
outlook or a low import propensity of their recovery
would depress demand for Thailand’s exports.

Structural reforms and infrastructure
development would raise returns to private
investment and strengthen of growth.

Protracted period of
slower growth in
emerging economies

H

H: Given Thailand’s integration in regional supply
chains, a slowdown in major Asian economies would
have a severe effect on the country.

Slower export growth can be offset by
additional policy stimulus, combined with
structural reforms, infrastructure investment,
and partial reorientation toward fast-growing
regional markets (CLMV).

Domestic Risks
Slippages in
implementing
government’s
economic program

M

M: Slippages in implementation would have a negative
impact on the economy directly and by undermining
private sector confidence, thus weakening domestic
demand in an economy already facing a negative
output gap. Half-hearted reforms and insufficient
investment would also affect the economy’s potential in
the long run.

Lower the policy rate if fiscal stimulus is not
forthcoming. Accelerate structural reform
agenda.

Tepid private sector
response to political
stabilization and
reform

M

M: Weak domestic demand would weigh on growth.

Use available room for additional fiscal and
monetary stimulus. Announce an ambitious
reform agenda to bolster private sector
confidence.

Renewed political
instability

M

H: Consumer and business confidence would be
damaged, dampening private investment and
purchases of durable goods. Public investment plans
would be put on hold again. Supply-side disruptions
and international sanctions are possible. Capital flight
would put pressure on credit and asset markets.

Allow automatic stabilizers to work. Provide
ample liquidity to banks to minimize
disruptions in the financial system. If capital
outflows are modest, hold the interest rate and
let the exchange rate depreciate, but use
reserves to guard against overshooting.

Stronger response
to oil price decline
(upside)

M

M: If greater passthrough to fuel users is allowed, or
consumers and businesses react more vigorously than
expected to the increase in purchasing power and
decline in cost, domestic demand will be lifted.

Given the weak cyclical state of the economy
and the strong current account position,
stronger domestic demand would be welcome
news and would not require offsetting
measures in the near term.

“L”=Low; “M”=Medium; “H”=High. The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario
most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks
surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and
“high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time
of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Appendix III. Energy Price Reform in Thailand
Background. Thailand has a long history of controlling prices for economically or socially important
energy products. The oil shock of 1973 resulted in the creation of an Oil Fund to smooth price
swings. Socially sensitive fuels, in particular, diesel and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), have been
subsidized through the Oil Fund or exempted from excise taxes. More recently, biofuels such as
gasohol have benefited from lower taxes as a means of diversifying the fuel supply and promoting
domestically produced energy products.
Impact. Price controls have resulted in distortions in energy consumption, including a shift from
gasoline to diesel by automobile users and illegal use of subsidized LPG intended for cooking by the
industrial sector. A surge in global oil prices led to the depletion of the Oil Fund balance, which
reached a deficit of 9 billion baht end-July 2014. Furthermore, excise taxes were reduced, which led
to a significant loss of fiscal revenue. Excise taxes on diesel, for example, were cut from 5.841
baht/liter to 0.0055 baht/liter in 2011, as a means of keeping domestic retail prices relatively stable
even as international prices rose. The excise tax exemption on diesel alone is estimated to have cost
100 billion baht (about 1 percent of GDP) per year in terms of revenue shortfall.
Reforms. The previous government started to adjust the LPG price in 2011. While LPG price for lowincome household was maintained constant at B 18.13/liter, the price for industry and automotive
use was gradually raised over a period of one year by reducing subsidies. In September 2012, LPG
price for industry and automobile use had reached B 30.13/liter and B 21.38/liter, respectively.
The current government, as part of its reform agenda, has been pursuing additional reforms in the
energy price sector with the objective to eliminate large price cross-subsidies between energy
sources, while ensuring that the vulnerable population is protected.
This has been implemented by reducing subsidies and reinstating excises and Oil Fund levies on
fuels such as diesel and LPG. Excises and Oil Fund levies on other fuels have been reduced. As a
consequence, the deficit of the Oil Fund was eliminated by November 2014. At the same time, lower
international prices have been passed through to retail prices to a varying degree. The retail price of
gasoline, which was 50 percent higher than that of diesel at the beginning of September 2014, is
now 35 percent higher (as of January 30, 2015). LPG prices, which differed according to final use,
have been unified with the exception of a subsidized price for vulnerable groups. LPG price for lowincome households and street food vendors have been kept constant at B 18.13/liter, subject to
means tested measures. In addition, low-income households enjoy free electricity up to 50Wh a
month.
Below is a summary of recent developments.


36

Gasoline. The decline in the international price was partially passed through. As the average cost
of gasoline declined by B 11/liter (from B 23.65/liter to B 12.89/liter) between September 1, 2014
and January 30, 2015, the retail price also declined by B 11/liter (from B 44.86/liter to
B 33.96/liter).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THAILAND



Diesel. The lower international oil price was partially passed through to retail prices. While the
average cost of diesel declined by B 10/liter between September 1, 2014 and
January 30, 2015 (from B 24.46/liter to B 14.22/liter), the retail price declined by B 5/liter
(B 29.99/liter to B 24.16/liter). This is due to the partial reinstatement of the excises (from
B 0.83/liter to B 3.58/liter) and Oil Fund levies (from B 1.25/liter to 3.60/liter). The current excises
(B 3.58/liter) are still below what they used to be before 2011 (B 5.84/liter).



Liquefied Petroleum Gas. The differentiation of retail prices according to use (industry, cooking,
automobile, and low-income households) is reported to have resulted in the surge of illegal use
of subsidized LPG by certain sectors. This has led to the introduction of means-testing that
requires low-income households and street food vendors to register with the Ministry of Energy
in order to benefit from the subsidized LPG (B 18.13/liter). Furthermore, LPG prices were unified
in January 2015 into a single price (B 24.16/liter). While this meant lower LPG price for the
industry (from B 29.33/liter to B 24.16/liter), prices went up for the other uses (for cooking, from
B 22.63/liter to B 24.16/liter; and for automobiles, from B 21.38/liter to B 24.16/liter). LPG retail
prices for all uses are now above the average cost (B 14.48/liter).

Conclusion. Staff welcomes the energy price reforms by the authorities, which would contribute to
rationalizing public expenditures and enhancing fiscal transparency. While the reform is still ongoing,
it has already resulted in less price differentiation across different fuels while increasing the fiscal
revenue. The Oil Fund balance strengthened by 0.2 percent of GDP between July and
December 2014, turning from a deficit of B 7 billion into a surplus of B 15 billion. Excise tax and
import duty on petroleum products also increased. If the reform is fully implemented, revenue from
the excise tax and import duty on petroleum products is expected to increase by close to 1 percent
of GDP (from 0.6 of GDP in 2014).

Appendix IV. Thailand—Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
1.
Background. The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) framework for market access countries is
used to assess Thailand’s debt sustainability. The new framework expands upon the previous DSA to
include: (i) an assessment of the realism of baseline assumptions; (ii) an analysis of risks associated
with the debt profile; (iii) macrofiscal risks; (iv) a stochastic debt projection taking into account past
macrofiscal volatility; and (v) a standardized summary of risks in a heat map.
2.
Macroeconomic assumptions. After the slowdown of the economy in 2014 on account
mostly of the political instabilities, real growth is projected to average 4 percent in the medium term.
3.
Fiscal assumptions. In staff’s baseline projections, overall public sector deficit will gradually
increase from 1.9 to 2.6 percent of GDP between FY2015 and 2019 before coming down to
2.5 percent in FY2020. Regarding the planned infrastructure programs, staff assumes an
implementation rate of 50 percent compared to the planned disbursement schedules.
4.
Data coverage. Coverage of public debt in Thailand is fairly large. In addition to the central
government, nonfinancial State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and Specialized Financial Institutions (SFIs)
are also covered, with the latter limited to debt with government guarantee. Local authorities’ debt is
not included in the public debt and excluded from this DSA.
5.

Realism of baseline assumptions.



The median forecast error for real GDP growth during 2005−2013 is -2.2 percent of GDP and
may look relatively large at first glance. However, this was the period during which Thailand went
through a series of unexpected shocks that had significant impact on the growth, such as the
Global Financial Crisis, the flood in 2011 and more recent political unrests.



Past assumptions on primary balance and inflation are comparable to other countries.

6.
The DSA framework suggests that Thailand’s public debt is likely to remain sustainable
in the medium term under various sets of macroeconomic and fiscal shocks. However,
vigilance is needed to ensure that risks stemming from financial sector contingency liabilities
are well contained.
Under the baseline1, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to hover around 47 percent of GDP,
which is below the government’s ceiling of 60 percent and far below the benchmark of
70 percent. This contrasts with the historical scenario under which the debt-to-GDP is reduced
steadily to about 38 percent in FY2020 on the back of sustained fiscal surplus and a stronger
growth.



1

The baseline scenario assumes current policies and an implementation rate of 50 percent of infrastructure projects.

38

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THAILAND



The fan chart, which incorporates feedback effects between macroeconomic variables and relies
on historical data to calibrate shocks, illustrates the impact of additional risks to the baseline.
Even under the worst quartile case, the debt-to-GDP ratio will remain well under the benchmark
of 70 percent, suggesting that Thailand’s debt is likely to remain sustainable in the medium term
even in the worst case scenario.



Of the four macro-fiscal shock scenarios, namely, primary balance shock, interest rate shock,
growth shock and exchange rate shock, growth shock has the largest impact on debt ratios. Real
GDP growth is reduced by 10-year historical standard deviation (4 percent) for two consecutive
years from FY2015, resulting in a deterioration of the primary balance. This leads to higher
interest rate and lower inflation (0.25 percentage point per 1 percent of GDP worsening of the
deficit). The consequence is that the debt-to-GDP ratio reaches close to 54 percent of GDP in
FY2020, but still below the government’s ceiling of 60 percent and far below the benchmark of
70 percent.



Financial sector contingent liabilities shocks have by far the largest impact on debt ratios. A onetime capital injection equivalent to 10 percent of commercial banks assets results in a one-off
increase in government spending of 14 percent of GDP. If the shock is augmented to include SFIs,
the government spending increase jumps to 18 percent of GDP. These shocks are combined with
an increase in interest rate (0.25 percentage points per 1 percent of GDP worsening of the deficit)
and one standard-deviation shock to growth. By 2020, the debt-to-GDP ratio reaches 66 percent.
Under an augmented shock scenario that involves SFIs in addition to the commercial banks, the
debt-to-GDP ratio reaches 71 percent. While these scenarios may entail low probability, they
underscore the importance of enhancing the regulatory frameworks on financial institutions,
including SFIs.

7.

Heat map.



Despite its low share of foreign currency-denominated and short-term debt in the public debt,
Thailand faces risks arising from its external financing requirement (defined as current account
balance plus amortization of the country’s total short-term external debt at remaining maturity)
and large share of public debt held by foreigners. At 17 percent, the external financing
requirement exceeds the upper threshold of early warning benchmarks (15 percent) but the large
official foreign reserves of more than 40 percent of GDP provides comfortable buffers.



The share of the public debt held by foreigners (including official lenders such as the World
Bank) is 17 percent of total, slightly exceeding the lower threshold of early warning benchmarks
(15 percent). The existence of a well functioning domestic bond market underpinned by a wide
group of investor types provides some comfort in this regard.

Appendix V. Thailand—External Debt Sustainability Analysis
Summary. Thailand’s external debt1 is projected to remain relatively low over the medium term,
gradually declining from 37 percent of GDP in 2014 to 33 percent of GDP in 2020. Stress tests
indicate that external debt would remain stable under various scenarios including weaker GDP
growth, a lower current account balance, and a one-time 30 percent depreciation of the baht. Under
most of these stress scenarios, the external debt-to-GDP ratio rises somewhat above the baseline
over the projection period. In the case of the exchange rate depreciation scenario, the debt ratio
would rise to about 56 percent of GDP. However, this scenario does not take into account the
adjustment that trade flows would have if such a depreciation were to occur, i.e. a sharp
improvement in the current account that would significantly bring down the debt ratio.

Appendix VI. Thailand—External Assessment
Thailand
International
investment
position and
trajectory

Background. The net international investment position (NIIP) had been improving steadily from the large deficit hit in 2000 (48 percent of GDP), until 2009, when the NIIP came close to balance (-2 percent of GDP). Subsequently, large increases in direct
and portfolio investment valuations raised foreign liabilities and lowered the NIIP to -18 percent of GDP in 2013. Net foreign
liabilities are expected to remain broadly stable.
Assessment. The deterioration of the NIIP during 2010 – 2014 appears to be due largely to valuation changes, as on average the
current account was in surplus. There are limited risks to external debt sustainability because Thailand’s external debt is projected to
remain low and net foreign liabilities (as a percent of GDP) are expected to stabilize. That said, the rising share of short-term
external debt in total external debt (almost 44 percent) needs close monitoring.

Current account

Background. Thailand’s current account (CA) has been quite volatile over the last decade, ranging from a 4¼ percent of GDP
deficit to 8¼ percent of GDP surplus, against the backdrop of a relatively stable trend real appreciation and volatile economic
fundamentals. The current account surplus came down sharply from its peak in 2009 at 8¼ percent of GDP to -0.6 percent in 2013
and rose to 3.8 percent in 2014 and is expected to remain close to balance over the medium term.
Assessment. Staff assesses Thailand’s 2014 CA to be close to the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals and appropriate
policies, within a range of -5 to +5 percent of GDP). This is supported also by the EBA CA model estimate of a gap of 1.4 percent
of GDP, which incorporates the impact of the oil price declines and the delayed investment (in cyclically adjusted terms, the EBA
estimated CA norm and CA outcome are -0.8 and 0.7 percent of GDP, respectively).

Real exchange
rate

Background. Barring the global financial crisis, the Thai baht generally has been appreciating in real effective terms since 2005.
After appreciating strongly during late 2012 and the first four months of 2013, the real effective exchange rate (REER) weakened
until the first half of 2014 and then strengthened in the second half of 2014. As of end-2014, the REER (annual average) was about
3.2 percent weaker than its 2013 average level.

Overall Assessment
Overall Assessment: The external position is
broadly consistent with medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policy settings.
Reserves are more than adequate.
Potential policy responses:
A medium-term infrastructure investment
policy is key to unlocking growth by boosting
private investment, which would justify
temporarily larger current account deficits.
The authorities should continue to allow the
exchange rate to follow fundamentals. The
more-than-adequate reserves can support twoway flexibility of the baht while still providing
some scope for intervention to smooth
excessive volatility.
In view of the net capital outflows, slowing
credit growth, low share of real estate loans,
and no apparent real estate boom, there is no
need to tighten macroprudential policies despite
the low-interest-rate environment.

Assessment. Staff assesses the REER to be broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and appropriate policies, within a
range of -5 percent below to +5 percent above such a level. The EBA estimates do not point clearly to a REER gap (the EBA REER
regression model estimates an REER slightly on the weak side in 2014 by 1.9 percent).

flows and policy
measures

FX intervention
and reserves
level

Background. Equity and bond flows declined and became negative in 2013 and 2014 due to Fed’s tapering talk and political
uncertainties.
Assessment. While capital flows to banks reflect mostly hedging activities of the trade sector and therefore follow the trade balance,
portfolio flows benefited from the relatively better fundamentals of the Thai economy compared with advanced economies, but
faced headwinds from the withdrawal of unconventional monetary policies, emerging market sell-offs and domestic political
uncertainties. The authorities have allowed exchange rate flexibility to smooth capital flow volatility. Capital inflows are expected
to continue, although they will be partially offset by outward investment as the authorities push forward with their financial account
liberalization plans.
Background. The exchange rate is largely floating without evidence of intervention. International reserves declined primarily on
valuation changes. Gross official reserves are about 48 percent of GDP in 2014, over three times short-term debt, and at 213 percent
of the IMF’s composite metric. Thailand’s net forward FX position has declined to six percent of GDP in 2014.
Assessment. Thailand’s gross reserves are more than adequate and there is no need to build up reserves for precautionary purposes.
The exchange rate should continue to react flexibly to domestic and external shocks, including volatile capital flows

Appendix VII. Thailand’s Regional Integration
Regional integration between Thailand and the Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam (CLMV
countries) has proceeded at a fast pace in the last decade. This dynamic integration process can be
seen from various perspectives, including trade, investment, migration, and the ASEAN Economic
Community (AEC).
Trade. Trade integration between Thailand and CLMV countries has proceeded at a fast pace.
Although demand for Thailand’s exports from China, Japan, and ASEAN-4 fell, Thailand’s exports
to CLMV expanded in 2014. As a result, the shares of Thailand exports to CLMV countries
continued to rise. In particular, Thailand’s exports to Cambodia and Laos as a share of total Thai
exports have almost tripled in the last decade and have increased more than 70 percent in the
last four years. At the same time, Thailand’s imports from CLMV countries as a share of total Thai
imports have also been rising steadily, albeit at a slower pace than exports. In particular, both
Laos and Myanmar’s exports to Thailand as a share of total Laos and Myanmar’s exports reached
more than 33 percent in 2013.
FDI. Thailand and the CLMV countries have also witnessed rapid growth in bilateral direct
investment. More than 10 percent of Thailand outward FDI is destined to CLMV. Moreover, after
receiving inward FDI from CLMV countries during 2009−10, Thailand inward FDI from CLMV
countries turned negative, indicating CLMV’s investment flowing from Thailand back to CLMV.
These developments show that Thailand has been playing an increasingly active role in
promoting investment integration with CLMV countries.
Migration. CLMV countries are the main source of foreign workers in Thailand, with Myanmar
accounting for two thirds of all immigrants. In turn, Thailand has become a major migration
destination for Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar. For instance, there were 1.8 million registered
immigrants (mostly from Myanmar) and approximately 1 million unregistered immigrants.
AEC. The ASEAN Economic Community will further promote integration between Thailand and
CLMV countries. Bold steps forward in regional integration, especially further cuts in tariffs and
elimination of behind-the-border barriers, could reap substantial dividends for Thailand and
CLMV countries, including upgrading of the service sector. Progress with integration can also
help unlock structural reforms yielding further gains. Looking forward, the AEC is expected to
help transform ASEAN into a region with free movement of goods, services, investment, skilled
labor, and freer flow of capital.

Appendix VIII. Global Liquidity Transmission and the
Changing Financial Landscapes in the ASEAN-5 Countries
The transmission of global liquidity has changed the financial landscapes in the ASEAN-5
countries (Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, Indonesia, and Singapore, ASEAN-5) in the last
decade, which in turn, has led to changes in financial stability risks. Policymakers should
strengthen liquidity management, enlarge regulatory perimeters to include non-commercialbanks, and establish a formal and transparent financial stability framework.
Global liquidity expansion. Global liquidity has been expanding since early 2000s, and the
strong post-crisis monetary policy easing by major central banks spurred a further surge. The
money supply of the G4 (the United States, the United Kingdom, Euro Area, and Japan) − a
proxy for global liquidity—rose from US$ 15 trillion in 2000 to US$ 36 trillion in 2014. Foreign
exchange reserves, a proxy for official liquidity, increased six-fold from US$ 2 trillion
in 2000 to over US$ 12 trillion in 2014. International debt security issuance by emerging
market economies, a proxy for private liquidity, increased four-fold from US$ 554 billion
in 2000 to US$ 2.6 trillion in 2014. External loans to emerging markets, another proxy for
private liquidity, increased four-fold from US$ 777 billion in 2000 to US$ 3.1 trillion in 2014.
Global liquidity transmission to the ASEAN-5. Global liquidity has transmitted to ASEAN-5
through various channels, including portfolio inflows, international debt security issuance, and
external bank loans and deposits. Between December 2000 and June 2014, ASEAN-5 saw a
rapid increase in international debt security issuance (by nationality), which from US$70 billion
in 2000 to US$ 288 billion,1 while external loans and deposits, increased from US$ 272 billion
to US$ 787 billion.

Changing financial landscapes. Near-zero policy rates and large asset purchases by the Federal
Reserve and other major central banks have boosted asset prices and fuelled investor appetite
for risk. Large cross-border financial inflows have amplified domestic financial expansion in
ASEAN-5, leading to changes in the financial landscapes in the ASEAN-5.
Non-commercial-banks. A feature of the changing financial landscapes in the ASEAN-5 is the
growth of non-commercial-banks, though at different paces in different countries.


In Indonesia, they grew steadily with asset-to-GDP ratio increasing from less than
three percent in 2006 to five percent in 2013. And non-commercial-bank assets as a
share of total assets of all financial institutions grew from six percent in 2006 to
nine percent in 2013.



In Malaysia, they developed at a slower pace than its peers recently, with their asset-toGDP ratio remaining high around 26−28 percent during 2011 and 2013.



In the Philippines, they developed steadily, with their asset-to-GDP ratio remaining
around 10 percent during 2006 and 2013.



Non-commercial-banks in Singapore developed to a higher stage, with asset-to-GDP
ratio increasing from less than 100 percent in 2006 to 120 percent in 2013. The noncommercial-bank short-term funding as a share of total funding of all financial
institutions grew from 22 percent in 2006 to almost 24 percent in 2013.



In Thailand, these institutions developed rapidly. Excluding SFIs, non-commercial-banks’
asset-to-GDP ratio increased from 13 percent in 2006 to 21 percent in 2013, and noncommercial-bank assets as a share of total assets of all financial institutions grew from
10 percent in 2006 to 14 percent in 2013.

Risks to financial stability. There is a risk that protracted monetary accommodation and
resulting search for yield could be fueling credit mispricing and buildup of systemic liquidity risk,
especially in the nonbank sector. Therefore, ASEAN-5 should closely monitor potential risks to
financial stability, such as credit, liquidity, and exchange rate risks. These risks could be nontrivial
given the weak global economic recovery and lingering uncertainties about the full ramifications
of the China slowdown and rebalancing.
Policies implications for Thailand. The changing financial landscapes and the resulting
challenges point to the need for the authorities in the ASEAN-5 to consider measures to maintain
financial stability.


Regulation on non-commercial-banks. The authorities should enlarge financial
regulatory perimeters to non-commercial-banks, including SFIs, and contain the rapid
growth of leverage.



Liquidity management. The authorities should prepare for the possible liquidity
tightening arising from the expected U.S. monetary policy normalization. Useful
measures include encouraging greater exchange rate flexibility and taking
macroprudential and cooperative measures to provide liquidity when global liquidity
shortages actually materialize.



Financial stability framework. The authorities should continue to strengthen a formal
and transparent financial stability framework. Useful measures include giving the central
banks a more formal mandate to ensure financial stability in bringing both expertise and
incentives to the task of mitigating systemic risk; strengthening data collection to cover
data gap and monitor the buildup of financial stability risks; enhancing coordination and
information sharing among regulators across jurisdictions.

Appendix IX. Thailand’s Demographic Challenge
Thailand is undergoing one of the fastest demographic transitions in the world. This poses severe
challenges to growth, old-age security, and public finances. To address these challenges, Thailand
needs higher productivity growth, increased labor force participation (particularly by the elderly),
and a more open immigration system.
Population trends. Thailand is undergoing a
steep demographic transition. According to
UN population projections,1 Thailand’s total
population will peak in 2023, while its working
age population (age 15−64) will start declining
this year as a share of total population and
in 2018 in absolute numbers.

Korea and Singapore, but those countries are
experiencing it at much higher levels of income. Among emerging economies in the region, only
China’s transition is almost as rapid, but China is developing considerably faster than Thailand. In
contrast, under every conceivable scenario, Thailand will grow old before growing rich. Emerging
ASEAN economies other than Thailand are facing a noticeably slower transition.

Implications. Population aging presents a number
of challenges. Up until now, Thailand has benefited
from a demographic dividend, with labor force
growing faster than population for several decades.
The dependency ratio is at its trough, and is among
the lowest in ASEAN. Going forward, the ratio will
start climbing, driven by old-age dependency, with
negative implications for growth, old-age security,
and public finances.

Drivers. The main reason is a sharp drop in fertility.
Fertility Rates

decline.2 An increase in longevity (life expectancy
went up from 64 in 1980 to 74 in 2012) is another important driver of aging.

With the unemployment rate below one percent, in Thailand there is essentially no difference between labor
force and employment, and no margin to raise the employment rate for a given labor force participation rate.

pessimistic, with labor input declining by 0.1 percent in 2020 and 0.3 percent in 2023. Still, this
correction only pushes the negative trend back a couple of years.
Impact on public finances. As elsewhere, aging will lead to higher health care spending,
particularly in the public sector given Thailand’s universal coverage. In contrast to health care,
Thailand’s large informal sector is not covered by the public pension scheme and receives only
minimal assistance from the non-contributory old-age allowance. With increased longevity and
evolving cultural norms, traditional networks might not be able to provide adequate support to
the elderly coming out of the informal sector. As a result, the public sector may have to step in
with additional support. At the same time, the existing formal sector social security scheme may
not be sustainable, given low contribution rates and low retirement age.
Addressing the challenge. A multifaceted approach is required to deal with the demographic
challenge. In very broad terms, the impact of population aging on labor supply could be
counteracted by increasing labor productivity and by measures aimed at augmenting labor
supply. In Thailand, key to enhancing productivity is implementing the government’s
infrastructure investment plans, improving the quality of education and training, and reallocating
resources toward higher-value-added activities.

Augmenting labor supply. Two key reservoirs are the elderly and migrant workers. The share of
hexagenarians in Thailand’s population is rising sharply, and engaging them in productive work is
essential to cushion the effects of aging. That would be facilitated by accommodating work
environment (including flexible hours and part-time arrangements), improved health care, and
targeted training and by removing institutional obstacles such as mandatory retirement of
government employees at age 60. Many of

Thailand hosts over one million registered economic migrants, primarily from Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos.
However, the total number, including undocumented workers, is estimated to be around 4 million—about
10 percent of the country’s labor force.

Appendix X. Thailand’s Structural Transformation in Regional
Perspective1
Thailand stands out in international comparison as a country with a high dispersion of productivity
across sectors. It has especially low labor productivity in agriculture—the sector that employs a much
larger share of the population than is typical for a country at Thailand’s level of income. This suggests
large potential productivity gains from labor reallocation across sectors, but that process—which made
a significant contribution to Thailand’s growth in the past—appears to have stalled lately. The reasons
include a gap between the skills possessed by rural workers and those required in the modern sectors;
the government’s price support programs for several agricultural commodities, particularly rice; and the
uniform minimum wage.
Snapshot. While in most economies labor productivity in agriculture is lower than in other sectors, in
Thailand, the difference is particularly pronounced. At the same time, the share of agricultural
employment in Thailand, at nearly 40 percent, is considerably higher than what would be expected for
a country at its level of income. This combination of low productivity and high employment in
agriculture depresses the country’s overall productivity and standard of living.
Dynamics. Reallocating workers from agriculture into manufacturing and modern services could
boost productivity. Indeed, in the past, this inter-sectoral shift, reflecting structural transformation,
accounted for a considerable share of productivity growth in Thailand (as well as in many other Asian
economies). However, over the last few years this process has stalled, with both agricultural
employment and agricultural productivity nearly stagnant.
Explanation. There are several reasons why Thailand’s agricultural employment has been
exceptionally high for several decades, including culture and tradition as well as educational gaps. The
leveling of the share in the last few years, after trend decline, has likely been caused by a pickup in
global food prices, intensified government support for agriculture (particularly the rice pledging
scheme), and an increase in the minimum wage, which discourage employment in the formal sector.
Way forward. To accelerate Thailand’s path toward advanced economy status, it is important to
provide appropriate incentives and opportunities to its population. The government took the right
step in replacing the rice pledging scheme and price support for rubber with targeted income
transfers. Modernization of curriculum and increased support for rural schools would help equip
future generations of Thais with appropriate skills. Better information dissemination would help direct
people toward gainful employment in the formal sector. At the same time, incentives to hire
newcomers to the formal labor market may be enhanced by temporary tax breaks or minimum wage
waivers. Finally, various measures, including more efficient water management, enhanced agricultural
research and knowledge transfer, and reformed land tenure laws (which would facilitate consolidation
to take advantage of economies of scale), could help increase productivity and the standard of living
of those remaining in agriculture.

Appendix XI. Thailand—Staff Policy Advice from the 2013
Article IV Consultation
Staff Advice
Strengthen the medium-term fiscal framework
and embed it in the planned revision of the
Public Finance Act.

Policy Actions
The authorities are working on a fiscal
responsibility law (Public Finance Act) that will
require the formulation of a medium-term
fiscal framework by the Cabinet. The Fund is
providing technical assistance in this area.

Allow the exchange rate to continue to move
flexibly, limiting foreign exchange rate
intervention to preventing excessive volatility
and overshooting.

The Bank of Thailand has adhered to a policy
of flexible exchange rates, intervening in
foreign exchange markets only to prevent
overshooting.

Consider extending the current regulatory and
supervisory regime of commercial banks to all
deposit-taking institutions.

The government has made a decision to
extend BOT’s supervisory and regulatory
mandate to SFIs.

Replace generalized subsidies, in particular
energy and the rice pledging scheme, with
programs targeted at vulnerable groups.

The rice scheme has been replaced with
transfers to small-scale farmers. The authorities
have started an energy price reform by
reinstating excise taxes on diesel and reducing
cross-subsidies among different types of fuel.
Lower prices are maintained for vulnerable
groups, subject to means-testing.

Address infrastructure bottlenecks.

The government has endorsed a large-scale
public infrastructure investment program, to be
implemented over a number of years. The
authorities are planning to restructure state
enterprises such as the State Railway of
Thailand that will play an important role in the
expansion of the infrastructure.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
After more than a decade when the baht was effectively pegged closely to the U.S. dollar through a
basket of currencies, the exchange rate regime was changed on July 2, 1997. Both the de jure and de
facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating.
Last Article IV Consultation:
At the conclusion of the 2013 Article IV consultations, Executive Directors noted that skillful
macroeconomic management, as well as the strong fundamentals of the Thai economy have blunted
the impact of recent severe shocks and were underpinning a recovery. Looking ahead, they
encouraged the authorities to persevere in their efforts to rebuild fiscal buffers, strengthen financial
stability, and promote more inclusive growth. Directors considered that a gradual return to fiscal
consolidation will broaden the room for policy maneuver over the medium term and create space
for priority spending. They noted, however, that the achievement of the authorities’ targets may
require additional measures and would benefit from a stronger medium-term fiscal framework.
Therefore, they supported expanding investment in infrastructure and education, and replacing
generalized subsidies with targeted income support for vulnerable groups. They encouraged the
authorities to stand ready to normalize the policy stance if inflationary pressures re-emerge.
Directors also observed that capital flow volatility has presented challenges to macroeconomic
management. They agreed that Thailand’s strong international reserve position, together with
exchange rate flexibility and macroprudential and capital flow measures as appropriate, will help
address such volatility going forward. Directors welcomed the progress in developing the non-bank
financial sector, which should boost financial inclusion and facilitate investment. They also agreed
that policy actions to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory frameworks for non-bank and
specialized financial institutions are essential to safeguard the soundness of the financial system.
They welcomed the authorities’ aim to promote more inclusive growth and endorsed plans to boost
workers’ skills to address skills mismatches and labor shortages. They also supported plans to
expand infrastructure to lower transportation costs, promote commerce, and boost long-term
growth.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of February 2015)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. The authorities have continued to improve
the quality and coverage of data. The dissemination of additional data may enhance the basis for
macroeconomic analysis.
National accounts: The National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) compiles annual
and quarterly GDP estimates using both the production and expenditure approaches. The annual GDP
volume measures are derived at previous year’s prices and as chain-linked indices with 2002 as the
reference year. Quarterly national accounts estimates are compiled using a fixed base year (1998). The
NESDB plans to introduce new quarterly GDP current price and chain-linked volume estimates in 2015.
Price statistics: The Bureau of Trade and Economic Indexes (BTEI) compiles and disseminates a
monthly consumer price index with weights based on expenditure data collected from households
during the 2011 Socio-Economic Survey. Index coverage is restricted to middle-income urban
households. In addition to headline CPI, the BTEI publishes aggregate indexes for the low-income and
rural populations.
Government finance statistics: The authorities provide data to the Fund consistent with the
Government Finance Statistics Manual, 2001 (GFSM 2001). Data are contributed to both the Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook and the International Finance Statistics. General government fiscal data are
provided to the IMF annually—more timely publication would be desirable. Nonetheless, the authorities
publish monthly data for key GFS-based numbers for the central government budget on their website,
while estimates of quarterly general government GFS are published with some lag. In addition, the
authorities have started to compile GFSM 2001-based data for the non-financial state enterprises
(SOEs), although there are delays for selected SOEs. The authorities also publish public sector debt data
in their website, including debt of non-financial SOEs and government-guaranteed debt of Specialized
Financial Institutions.
Monetary statistics: The authorities submit the Standardized Reporting Forms (SRFs) for monetary
statistics on a timely basis. In January 2015, 10 FSIs for Thailand were published on the IMF’s FSI portal.
Balance of payments: The authorities started publishing balance of payments statistics under BPM6 in
September 2011. The historical data goes back to 2005—a longer historical series would be useful. The
methodology for compiling balance of payments data remains adequate. Additional source data to
complement the ITRS have been developed recently and coverage has been expanded to include
estimates of reinvested earnings and worker remittances outflows. Further improvements are expected
to enhance the data coverage and accuracy of BOP and IIP statistics, in particular in areas where new
concepts have been introduced by BPM6 such as in goods and services. Quarterly IIP data are
disseminated since late 2014 (starting with the first quarter of 2012), in line with SDDS'
recommendation. The data are collected quarterly and publicly available with a lag time of one quarter.
The last observation available for quarterly IIP is Q3-2014 (at time of assessment). Data on external debt
and debt service have significantly improved since the introduction of a quarterly survey of private
nonbank external debt.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Completes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Thailand
On March 30, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Thailand.
Background
After a sharp contraction in the first quarter of 2014, Thailand’s economy experienced a
modest recovery in subsequent quarters, to expand by 0.7 percent in the year as a whole.
Inflation decelerated toward the end of 2014 and became negative in January 2015 due to a
sharp decline in oil prices. Core inflation has remained stable at near 1.7 percent in the past
six months. The exchange rate stayed broadly stable against the U.S. dollar over the course
of 2014, but appreciated noticeably in nominal and real effective terms. Lower oil prices and
an import contraction triggered by weak domestic demand boosted the current account to
3.8 percent of GDP in 2014 from a -0.6 percent deficit the previous year.
The recovery is expected to continue in 2015 with growth projected at 3.7 percent on account
of some rebound in consumption, including from lower fuel prices, and in private investment
as backlogs of project approvals have been largely cleared by various government agencies.
Accommodative monetary policy will also support the recovery. Nonetheless, private
investment is being hampered by low capacity utilization, weak external demand, and
concerns over political uncertainty. Private consumption is also weakened by high household
debt and tighter credit conditions. The expansion of public investment has proven more
difficult than expected. At the same time, global demand for Thailand’s exports is weak.
Still, the current account surplus is projected to increase further this year as oil prices are
expected to be considerably lower on average than in 2014. Headline inflation is projected to
remain subdued in 2015 and recover somewhat toward the end of the year.
Risks to the outlook are tilted somewhat to the downside. Domestic risks to the economy
come from possible policy slippages, weaker-than-expected private demand, and political
uncertainty. External risks include a surge in global financial volatility and protracted slow

growth in advanced and emerging economies. On the upside, consumption, investment and
exports may experience a stronger boost from sharply lower oil prices.
The authorities have intentions to pursue a wide range of reforms to support the economy.
They are already implementing a fuel price reform; have replaced the rice pledging scheme
with transfers to small-scale farmers; endorsed a large public infrastructure investment
program; started a review of state-owned enterprises; and made a decision to extend the Bank
of Thailand’s oversight to the state-owned Specialized Financial Institutions. In addition, five
special economic zones have been established in border regions and the Board of Investment
has announced a new investment promotion strategy aimed at enhancing Thailand’s
competitiveness.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors were encouraged by the rebound of the Thai economy after recent
adverse shocks, and noted that the resilience of the economy has been underpinned by solid
economic fundamentals and prudent macroeconomic management. Directors agreed,
however, that the output gap will be closed only gradually and downside risks weigh on the
near-term outlook. Continued fiscal and monetary support will thus be needed for the period
ahead, while further structural reforms and infrastructure investment remain key to strong
and inclusive growth over the longer term.
Directors concurred that stimulating the economy while introducing a multi-year policy
framework to safeguard the sustainability of public finances are appropriate fiscal objectives
at this time. In this context, they also welcomed the ongoing reforms to generalized subsidy
programs, including the rice pledging scheme and energy pricing, and their replacement with
targeted and means-tested support to vulnerable groups. Directors welcomed the authorities’
plan to prepare a new fiscal responsibility law which will require the formulation of a
medium-term fiscal framework, as well as their plan to carry out a strategic review of all
state-owned enterprises and to formulate a multi-year public investment plan for large
infrastructure projects.
Directors viewed the current monetary stance as warranted. They noted that further monetary
easing could be considered if the expected recovery is delayed, with due regard for the
impact of lower interest rates on financial stability. Directors welcomed the transition to a
headline inflation target in the authorities’ policy framework. In this context, they considered
that inflation expectations remain well anchored and recent price developments do not
suggest the risk of entrenched deflation.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any
qualifiers used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors noted that volatile capital inflows have presented challenges to macroeconomic
management, and may continue to do so, in view of uncertainties in global financial markets.
Directors agreed that Thailand’s strong policy buffers, including ample reserves and a
flexible exchange rate regime, have served the country well and have provided the tools to
address potential market turbulence.
Directors welcomed the progress made in strengthening financial stability. The authorities’
decision to extend the prudential oversight of the Bank of Thailand to specialized financial
institutions represents an additional step in the right direction. Directors noted the importance
of continued efforts in this area, including strengthening the supervision of nonbank financial
institutions such as credit cooperatives.

Statement by Ms. Pornvipa Tangcharoenmonkong, Alternate Executive Director
March 30, 2015
1.
On behalf of the Thai authorities, I would like to thank the staff for the extensive
discussions during the Article IV Consultation and the comprehensive staff report. This
year discussions focused on macroeconomic policies to expedite growth, measures to
preserve economic and financial stability, and approaches to unlock structural bottlenecks
to lift up potential growth. The authorities are in broad agreement with the thrust of staff
assessment and would like to provide further details of recent macroeconomic
developments and policy efforts to address key challenges.
Updates on the Thai Economy and Near-Term Outlook
2.
Last year has witnessed a critical transition for Thailand. The economy had
weathered through a period of turbulences on both domestic and external fronts. The
economic expansion recorded only 0.7 percent growth in 2014, owing partly to domestic
political situations that hampered private sector investment and consumption. External
environment became less favorable for exports and the uncertainty in the global
economies as well as policy responses also added to the volatility in capital movements.
3.
Despite strong headwinds and disappointing growth in 2014, the authorities’ latest
growth projection for the Thai economy is at 3.8 percent1 for 2015. While this projection
in part reflects a low base, it is anticipated that growth will be driven by the gradual
recovery of domestic demand. Given strong economic fundamentals and resilient
financial system, the authorities will have policy space to provide needed tailwind for the
recovery. Declining fuel prices should partly benefit domestic consumption, while the
increased capital spending by government in infrastructure projects and other stimulus
packages should gradually crowd in private investment. On the external front, improved
prospects of advanced economies and further regional economic integration should also
offer better opportunities for Thailand’s export sector.
4.
My authorities view that the risks to growth outlook have now shifted slightly to
the downside, from the slower-than-expected domestic spending and heightened
uncertainty from policy divergence among major economies. Domestic spending,
especially the government investment, can also face some delay from the fiscal reform
process. It is also noted that the country has been experiencing signs of deteriorating
competitiveness due to changes in global trade structure, lagging technological
developments and innovations, and stagnant labor productivity.

Bank of Thailand’s projection as of March 2015

Monetary Policy
5. At the latest meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) on 11 March 2015,
monetary policy was eased further in order to lend additional support to the economy as
the recovery has been more sluggish than anticipated. Although lower policy rate may
help shore up private sector’s confidence, the steadfast implementation of public
investment as part of the planned fiscal stimulus packages is still deemed instrumental to
jump start a sustainable growth momentum. On inflation, we see a low probability of
deflationary pressure going forward as the declining headline inflation is expected to be
transitory due to the lower oil and commodity prices. Core inflation remained stable,
reflecting that most of the disinflationary pressure is rather supply driven.
6. We welcome the staff’s position in supporting the recent change in inflation targeting
framework of the Bank of Thailand (BOT) by turning from core to headline inflation at
the beginning of this year with an annual average target of 2.5 ± 1.5 percent. Such a
change is aimed to strengthen policy communication and enhance effectiveness of
monetary policy in anchoring long term inflation expectation. The headline inflation
should better reflect the cost of living and therefore can be better understood by the
general public, thus enhancing the communication effectiveness and policy credibility.
Furthermore, the annual average calculation should help provide sufficient flexibility to
respond to volatile changes in price levels while the BOT stands ready to take appropriate
actions, including proactive communication via open letter and other channels, should the
deviation from target is anticipated.
7. We take note of the staff’s assessment that divergent policy paths in major economies
and the ensuing global financial market volatility could be the main source of risks in the
near term. Against this backdrop, we remain committed to allow the currency to move
flexibly to absorb the impact of external shocks, while the adequate level of international
reserves will serve as additional buffer to excessive currency fluctuations. We also
welcome the staff’s notion that judicious currency intervention should help curb
excessive volatility that could be disruptive to financial market conditions and the real
sector.
Fiscal Policy
8.
The Thai authorities view that accommodative fiscal policy, while committing to
fiscal prudence, should be the key engine for reinvigorating economic growth in the near
term and elevate the country’s potential in the long run. While there are delays in
government budget processes on the account of on-going reforms to enhance
transparency and good governance of procurement process, the government has stepped
up efforts to expedite budget disbursement and pushed forth necessary infrastructure
projects in order to crowd in private investment and remove productivity constraints.

9.
The Public Finance Act, a fiscal responsibility legislation, is being finalized with
an aim to promote more transparent budget process and prudent medium-term fiscal
framework. The formulation of fiscal policy will ultimately be guided by the principles of
efficiency, effectiveness, transparency, and accountability. In this connection, the conduct
of fiscal policy in the forthcoming period should ensure prudent management of public
resources while effectively serving the purpose of inducing the sustained and inclusive
economic growth.
10.
We recognize that improving tax administration should help increase fiscal space
necessary for achieving the medium-term fiscal sustainability goals and overcoming
country’s long-term structural challenges. In view of revenue mobilization, the authorities
will press ahead with plans to improve tax compliance and public finance management,
as well as to broaden revenue bases. To compensate for decrease in tax revenue partly
due to reduction of personal and corporate income tax rates, the authorities consider it
plausible to gradually increase VAT rate from the current 7 percent to 10 percent if
economic recovery is strongly entrenched. On the expenditure side, the authorities are
exploring options to reduce tax expenditures through scaling down exemptions, while
alleviating the burden of most vulnerable groups with direct transfers and targeted
subsidies. The authorities also take advantage of low oil prices to reform the domestic
fuel pricing structure and energy subsidy programs. On this note, the authorities also
appreciate the Fund’s technical assistance on tax administration and trust that it will be
helpful in formulating strategy to enhance fiscal management, transparency, and
accountability.
Financial Sector and Financial Stability
11.
We welcome the staff’s acknowledgement of Thailand’s financial sector
soundness and the well-safeguarded financial stability. Commercial banks remain highly
capitalized, liquidity is ample, and NPL ratio remains low. The higher reliance on
wholesale funding of commercial banks has been mostly due to the rise in wholesale
deposits from corporates that are considered more stable than those from wholesale
borrowing. In addition, risks from household debt have moderated somewhat from the
slowdown of credit growth in recent period. Under this circumstance, the timely
implementation of Basel III and other prudential regulations in accordance with
international regulatory standards also helps further reinforce financial stability.
Nonetheless, my authorities remain vigilant and continue to pursue effort to enhance
financial surveillance mechanism. Among others are the regular joint meetings between
the Monetary Policy Committee and Financial Institutions Policy Committee and the
formation of internal committees for financial stability.
12.
The expansion of the BOT’s mandate to supervise Specialized Financial
Institutions (SFIs) should help prevent potential risks emerging from greater interlinkages between commercial banks and non-bank financial institutions. In doing so, it is

important to strike a right balance between allowing the SFIs to serve their legislative
mandate, while staying commercially viable under more stringent regulatory standards. In
this regard, the Fund technical assistance on SFIs reform provides valuable inputs for the
authorities to contemplate appropriate SFIs governance and regulatory reform agenda.
13.
We take note of staff’s concern over the rapid expansion of saving cooperatives’
share in financial system that might add risks to financial vulnerability. Nonetheless,
loans of saving cooperatives have relatively been restrictive in nature as credit would be
mostly extended to shareholders and the loan installments are tied to monthly salary. The
current NPL ratio stands at a very low level (less than 0.5% of total loans in 2013). They
are also exploring ways to strengthen their operational and supervisory framework
towards international standards.
14.
The recent success of ASEAN nations in reaching agreement on Qualified
ASEAN Bank is a key milestone for advancing financial integration to support the
broader agenda of ASEAN Economic Community. This will gradually liberalize financial
services as well as facilitate greater regional trade and investment, thus mutually benefit
consumers and better mobilize regional resources to finance economic activities.
Moreover, the achievement under the BOT’s second phase of Financial Sector Master
Plan (2010-2014) has helped enhance the efficiency and soundness of Thai banking
system in terms of preparing them for greater competition, developing financial
architecture conducive to growth, and strengthening supervisory capacity. Meanwhile,
the third phase of Financial Sector Master Plan (2015-2019) also aims to further promote
connectivity and financial inclusion, enter the new era of digital banking, as well as
preserve financial system stability.
Structural Reforms
15.
We are in agreement with the staff that implementing much-needed structural
reforms in a well prioritized manner is crucial for removing supply-side bottlenecks and
enhancing the potential growth. In fact, the current government has spearheaded the
reform plan not only to prepare the country for the long-term challenges but also to
improve good governance of public sector entities.
16.
On the large-scale investment projects, the authorities have laid out multi-year
plans to upgrade infrastructure and quality of logistics services to facilitate economic
growth in the long run. Better transportation networks will go a long way in promoting
intra-regional trade and connectivity. While pioneered by the government, these projects
are expected to significantly induce private sector to become a main driving force for
next phases of domestic investment in the period ahead.
17.
The reform of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) also ranks high on policy priorities.
The State Enterprise Policy Commission has been appointed to provide policy guidance
and monitor the ongoing SOEs reform agenda. It also has mandate to make necessary

decisions to strengthen SOEs’ financial positions to limit future fiscal burdens and
restructure the organization as deemed appropriate. The key objective is to enhance
efficiency and high degree of transparency of SOEs’ operations with improved corporate
governance to prevent political interference. To this end, the State Enterprise Policy
Commission recently approved in principle the establishment of a holding company to be
an independent regulator to oversee listed SOEs on the Stock Exchange of Thailand such
as the Thai Airways International Plc. and the Airports of Thailand Plc.
18.
Recognizing the wind of change in global trade pattern, Thailand is gearing
towards a technological upgrade to high-value added production. The Board of
Investment has launched new 7-year investment strategies with a focus on promoting
high value investments and those with a positive impact on society and the environment.
These include high-tech and creative industries, service industries that support the
development of a digital economy, and industries that utilize local resources. In parallel,
the government also adopts measures to support financing to small and medium
enterprises (SMEs) through the SFIs, together with promoting the coordination among
entrepreneurs, academia, and financial institutions.
19.
One of the key structural challenges is labor supply, which has started to decline
due to the trend of aging population. Research shows that increasing labor supply by
extending retirement age and reliance on foreign labor is neither sufficient nor
sustainable. The government, working in close collaborations with private sector,
continues its effort on development of skills in the labor force that match the need of
industry. The alignment of hiring needs, education in relevant skills, and the right
incentive structure is the most important requirement to unlock Thailand’s productivity
limit.
Final Remarks
20.
Despite economic headwinds, Thailand’s strong fundamentals, political clarity,
and unique cultural identity have helped the country to navigate through difficult times
and resuscitate confidence from both domestic and international stakeholders. Going
forward, preserving the macroeconomic and financial stability amidst global uncertainty
remains top priorities. On the back of ample space for short-term policy mix and various
structural changes on supply-side underway, combined with close cooperation between
public and private sector, promising opportunities remain for Thailand to achieve
sustainable long-term growth.
