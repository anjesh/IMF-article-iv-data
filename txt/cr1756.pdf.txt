IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Malta

On February 17, 2017, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Malta.
Malta is one of fastest-growing economies in Europe. Following an average growth of nearly 8
percent in 2014-15, output is estimated to have expanded by 4.1 percent in 2016, supported by
strong domestic demand. Robust job creation drove unemployment to record lows, despite rising
labor supply, while subdued wage pressures contributed to low inflation. The external position
remains strong, with sizable exports of services keeping the current account in surplus. Owing to
buoyant revenues and consolidation measures, the 2016 fiscal deficit narrowed to an estimated
level of 0.7 percent of GDP, well below the budget target of 1.1 percent of GDP, while public
debt declined further to about 60 percent of GDP.
Domestic banks remain well-capitalized and liquid, with profitability well above the levels seen
in European peers. Banks’ asset quality continues to improve, while measures have been taken to
reduce legacy non-performing loans. Credit growth to the private sector was subdued as credit to
the non-financial corporate sector contracted, but mortgage lending remained buoyant, resulting
in higher household debt and further increase in banks’ exposure to property-related loans.
Residential property prices showed a positive momentum in the face of rising demand and
sluggish supply response.
The outlook is favorable, though growth is set to moderate to 3.4 percent in 2017 and converge
to its potential of about 3 percent over the medium term as the impetus from domestic demand is
projected to weaken. As a result, the output gap is expected to close, while the current account
surplus is set to increase modestly. Strong job creation is likely to continue, keeping
unemployment low, while inflation is expected to pick up as import prices recover. Favorable
macroeconomic conditions, the low interest rate environment, and persistent primary fiscal
surpluses are expected to bring down public debt as a proportion of GDP in the coming years.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
The executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They commended the
authorities for implementing sound macroeconomic policies, which have contributed to strong
economic performance, robust job creation, low unemployment, and improved public finances.
While noting that Malta’s medium-term outlook remains strong, Directors agreed that as a small
and open economy, policies ahead should continue to focus on further enhancing the economy’s
resilience to shocks and strengthening competitiveness. They welcomed the authorities’
commitment to building fiscal buffers, preserving financial sector stability, and implementing
structural reforms to address the remaining impediments in the labor market, boost productivity,
and ensure inclusive growth.
Directors commended the authorities’ medium-term fiscal consolidation plan, which strikes an
appropriate balance between further lowering public debt and sustaining the growth momentum.
To achieve the fiscal targets, they highlighted the need to enhance the efficiency of tax collection
and contain the fast growing wage bill and spending on goods and services, including by
building on the recommendations of the recent in-depth spending reviews. Directors agreed that
further improving the financial health of SOEs and containing the long-term spending pressures
would reduce fiscal risks.
Directors noted that the banking system is well capitalized and liquid, with profitability well
above levels seen in peers. However, they observed that protracted low interest rates, weak credit
growth, legacy corporate non-performing loans (NPLs), and an uncertain external environment
pose challenges. In addition, banks’ high and increasing exposure to the property market
alongside persistent house price appreciation could also lead to imbalances. They encouraged the
authorities to deploy targeted macro-prudential tools to enhance the resilience of banks and
households to property market swings, close data gaps, and review the fiscal incentives related to
the property market. While there has been progress in reducing non-financial corporate sector’s
legacy NPLs, Directors noted that a faster resolution of remaining distressed loans would help
unlock resources for growth. They welcomed the authorities’ plans in this area, including their
intent to streamline the insolvency and bankruptcy frameworks. Directors underscored that
maintaining a robust implementation of the AML/CFT framework in line with international
standards would also help continue safeguarding the integrity of the financial system.
Directors concurred that the planned Malta Development Bank could support the economy by
alleviating financing constraints faced by small and medium-sized enterprises and by fostering
higher development investment. However, they underscored the need to ensure that the
Development Bank’s operations support the origination of new credit to viable firms, and
encouraged the authorities to adopt well-designed origination rules. Directors also noted that a
robust governance structure, prudent risk assessment, and adequate supervision will help
mitigate contingent liability risks to public finances.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors highlighted that continued structural reform momentum is needed to support high and
inclusive long-term growth. They called for sustained efforts to further increase female labor
force participation and reduce skill mismatches in the face of changing labor market demand.
Directors also underscored the need for further improvements in research and innovation and the
efficiency of the judicial system.

MALTA
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
February 2, 2017

KEY ISSUES
Context: Malta has recorded robust growth in recent years. Vibrant domestic demand,
favorable external conditions, and further progress with structural reforms supported
solid job creation, particularly in services, and reduced unemployment to record-lows.
This strong performance, together with fiscal discipline, contributed to continued deficit
and public debt reduction while solid profitability and adequate capitalization have kept
the banking system stable and resilient.
Outlook and risks: The outlook remains favorable, with medium-term growth
estimated at about 3 percent. However, downside risks predominate, reflecting mainly a
weaker external environment and rising anti-globalization sentiment. Uncertainties
surrounding the Brexit negotiations could weigh on economic activity through direct
and indirect exposures, while EU-wide corporate tax reform may impact the economy
unfavorably. While current data do not point to a misalignment of housing prices,
persistent strength in the property market may lead to imbalances, and—with high
exposure of banks to this market—amplify financial stability risks.
Challenges and policy priorities: Malta’s key challenges are to close the income gap
with the euro area, ensure equitable distribution of growth dividends, and enhance the
economy’s resilience to adverse shocks. Policies should, therefore, focus on building
fiscal buffers, safeguarding financial sector stability, and advancing structural reforms to
promote inclusiveness and competitiveness. Key priorities are:


Fiscal policy. Proceed with consolidation to reduce public debt ratio further and
build buffers. The adjustment strategy should rely on containing current spending
growth, particularly the wage bill and goods and services, and efforts to enhance tax
collection. Long-term spending pressures and risks emanating from fragile stateowned enterprises (SOEs) need to be addressed.



Macro-financial policies. Further reduce legacy non-performing loans (NPLs) and
increase loan-loss provisions. Close data gaps, adopt targeted macro-prudential
measures to enhance the resilience of banks and households to possible property
market swings, and ensure that fiscal measures related to the housing market do not
amplify the cycle. Increase access to finance to small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs) and reduce their vulnerabilities to shocks through a faster loan restructuring.



Structural reforms. Increase female labor force participation further and reduce skill
mismatches through active labor market policies and expansion of technical and
vocational training. Enhance SMEs’ innovation activities, including through greater
public sector support and provision of nonbank financing options. Improve the
efficiency of the judicial system, and streamline the corporate insolvency framework.

2.
The strong economic performance took place in the context of a continued
structural rebalancing. The economy has experienced a prominent increase in the relative
importance of the services sector in recent years, reflecting the emergence of new niche
industries and expansion of more traditional sectors. The structural shift has been job-rich and
attracted foreign workers, predominantly from the EU. As the growing sectors were largely
export-oriented, this rebalancing also contributed to a surge in services exports, improvement in
the current account balance, and a sizable increase in the net international investment position
(NIIP).

Box 1. Malta’s Competitiveness Developments
Malta’s external position remains strong. The CPI-based real effective exchange rate (REER) remained
broadly stable in recent years, registering a modest depreciation of about 1 percent between 2010 and 2015.
However, the ULC-based REER appreciated modestly over this period following a continuous appreciation
that took place since EU accession in 2004. The latter largely reflects a rapid increase in ULC due to a
composition effect, namely the structural shift from the more labor productive manufacturing sector towards
the less productive services sector. Despite the rise in aggregate ULC and the REER appreciation trend,
Malta’s external balance has improved rapidly in recent years.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
The outlook is strong, but risks are tilted to the downside
11.

Strong growth is projected to continue, albeit at a more moderate pace.



Real GDP growth is projected to remain robust, though decelerate to about 4 percent and
3½ in 2016 and 2017, respectively, on account of a weaker impetus from domestic demand.
The completion of large-scale infrastructure projects, notably in the energy sector, and
expiration of the previous EU funding cycle will drag investment growth lower while the
effect of the recent policy measures to increase disposable income will diminish and lead to a
gradual deceleration of private consumption growth. Against a backdrop of loose ECB policy,
favorable financial conditions are expected to support household credit growth (see
accompanying SIP). The contribution of net external demand to growth is projected to
remain low.



Over the medium term, growth is projected to decelerate towards an estimated potential of
about 3 percent, narrowing gradually the positive output gap, while inflation is set to
increase moderately as imported prices recover. Domestic demand will remain the main
engine of growth. However, ongoing deleveraging in the NFC sector, completion of
infrastructure projects, and structural rebalancing towards services, will keep credit to
corporates subdued and dampen the expansion of investment, while the moderation of
income growth will restrain private consumption growth. Current account surpluses are
expected to persist due to sizable services balances, and less buoyant domestic demand.

Risks to the outlook are skewed to the downside (see Risk Assessment Matrix,
Annex II). In view of Malta’s high openness, prolonged weaker growth in key trading partners
and rising anti-globalization sentiment would adversely affect exports, erode business
confidence, and undermine investment. Rising global interest rates would tighten financial

conditions, yet the limited linkages of international banks to the domestic economy and the
reliance of core domestic banks and the government on domestic funding are mitigating factors
(Box 2). Uncertainties surrounding the Brexit negotiations may adversely affect the economy
through direct and indirect exposures, while EU-wide corporate tax reform may impact Malta
unfavorably.4 Domestically, recent measures to boost the labor participation rate, completion of
infrastructure projects, and efficiency gains in the energy sector could have a prolonged positive
effect on growth. However, rising households’ debt could amplify risks from a sharp reversal in
house prices, while slower implementation of structural reforms could adversely affect
competitiveness and long-term growth. Persistent strength in mortgage lending and housing
market may lead to imbalances, and increase risks to the financial system and economic activity.
Authorities’ views
13.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff on the outlook and the sources of risks.
They stressed that Malta’s economic activity is expected to remain robust, supported by sound
policies, structural reforms and favorable conditions. While agreeing that external environment
poses downside risks, the authorities underscored Malta’s resilience to shocks owing to increased
economic diversification, strong domestic demand growth, and reliance on domestic funding.
The authorities viewed risks from the Brexit decision as largely contained, in part due to possible
relocation of UK-based firms to Malta. They stressed that, while the EU-wide corporate tax
reform may negatively affect the economy, there are other factors that make Malta attractive to
foreign firms such as the high labor market flexibility, the government pro-business agenda, low
cost compared to euro area peers, and the prevalence of English-speaking population. They also
argued that stronger than anticipated private investment growth provides an upside risk, and
noted that private consumption growth may prove stronger-than-expected on the back of
higher incomes and lower saving rate. Regarding the property market, the authorities
acknowledged that strong activity in the market may increase vulnerabilities, but noted that
house prices are not misaligned at the current juncture.

The second phase of the proposed Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base suggests that firms’ profits
will be allocated across member states based on a formula intended to reflect the activities in each country.

Box 2. Balance Sheet Analysis (BSA) for Malta1
The BSA presents a snapshot of outstanding balance sheet positions (stocks) forming the linkages
between different sectors of the Maltese economy, including with nonresidents. The BSA can be used
to study macroeconomic imbalances at the individual sector level as well as cross-sectoral linkages between
different sectors of the economy. The analysis for Malta is based on a rich source dataset, and thus allows
for a from-who-to-whom decomposition of financial assets based on 11 subsectors: (1) Government; (2)
Central Bank; (3) Core domestic banks ; (4) Non-core domestic banks ; (5) International Banks (banks with
limited interaction with domestic residents); (6) Investment Funds; (7) Insurance; (8) Other Financial
Intermediaries (OFIs); (9) Non-financial Corporations (NFCs); (10) Households (HHs); and (11) Rest of the
world (ROW).
The analysis confirms Malta’s position as a financial hub. The cross-sectoral linkages show that the OFIs
hold assets and liabilities vis-à-vis the ROW of approximately 1,950 percent of GDP, mainly reflecting the
activity of holding companies, captive financial institutions, and money lenders. Other depository
corporations are also very interconnected with the

asset and liabilities. A smaller, but still significant
part of financial services with external linkages is the
insurance sector (reinsurance in particular).
Potential vulnerabilities from
interconnectedness appear low while
macroeconomic imbalances are generally small.
Figure 1 shows that financial institutions with large
exposures to nonresidents are not significantly
connected to domestic sectors, suggesting that the
risk of external spillovers is relatively low.
Additionally, the nodes’ size in Figure 1, which
represent the sector’s net position, show that
macroeconomic imbalances are generally modest,
though the household sector is a large net lender,
with wealth mostly deposited at the core domestic
banks. The government and NFCs are net borrowers
mainly from banks, households, and the ROW.

Source: Central Bank of Malta and IMF staff estimates.
1/ The OFIs in the chart exclude the insurance sector and
investment funds. The nodes’ size represents the size of the
net imbalance between funds borrowed and lent by a sector,
while the nodes color represents whether a sector is a net
debtor (red) or creditor (green). The thickness of arrows from
a sector to another depicts the bilateral exposures.

Core domestic banks are at the center of intersectoral linkages among domestic residents.
They are net borrowers with respect to households,
with deposit liabilities almost double compared to
loan claims. The excess liquidity not used for lending is mostly distributed between deposits at the central
bank and holdings of government and foreign debt securities.

POLICY CHALLENGES
Malta’s high openness and heavy reliance on export-oriented sectors put a premium on enhancing
the economy’s resilience to shocks and strengthening competitiveness. Policies should, therefore,
focus on building fiscal buffers, safeguarding financial stability, and supporting the operating
environment for SMEs. Addressing the remaining structural weaknesses in the labor market and
improving the business climate would boost productivity and make growth more inclusive.

A. Further Strengthening Public Finances
14.
The 2017 budget aims to reduce the fiscal deficit further, following an overperformance in 2016. Strong economic conditions, lower support to SOEs, and expenditure
restraint measures, have led to a marked improvement in the 2016 fiscal position. Based on the
outturn through November, staff estimate the 2016 deficit at 0.7 percent of GDP, below the
budget target of 1.1 percent of GDP. The deficit reduction implies a structural adjustment of 0.4
percent of potential GDP, supported by higher-than-planned revenue from IIP, which more than
offset higher-than-anticipated expenditure on goods and services and compensation of
employees. Looking to 2017, the budget targets a deficit of 0.5 percent of GDP to be achieved
mainly through higher excises, and lower spending on social benefits, subsidies, and interest
payment. These measures are expected to deliver an additional structural adjustment of 0.4
percent of potential GDP and contribute to further reduction of public debt.
15.
The authorities’ medium-term consolidation plan should be underpinned by
specific measures. Malta’s high degree of openness, which increases its susceptibility to external
shocks, long-term spending pressures, and elevated level of government guaranteed debt (14
percent of GDP) underline the importance of

than the authorities. Under staff’s baseline
scenario, the overall deficit is projected to remain at 0.6 percent of GDP from 2017 onwards, thus

public debt-to-GDP ratio, contingent liabilities—stemming from SOEs and relatively large
banking sector—are a key risk (Annex IV).5
16.
Efforts to contain fast-growing current spending and enhance revenue collection
can support the planned fiscal consolidation. In particular,


The public sector’s wage bill and spending on goods and services are relatively high and
have increased rapidly in recent years. Measures to restrain these expenditures would help
reduce the risk of spending overruns. Furthermore, sustained expenditure rationalization
would require incorporation of recommendations of the recent in-depth spending reviews
and execution of similar reviews in the broader public sector (Annex III).



In view of the uncertainties surrounding the baseline, automatic stabilizers should be allowed
to operate fully if growth disappoints while budget windfalls should be used to further
reduce the borrowing needs and build fiscal buffers.

17.
Reforms of SOEs are progressing, but risks remain. The state electricity provider,
Enemalta, has improved its financial standing following internal restructuring and a partial
privatization, and posted a profit in 2015 after a prolonged period of losses. Meanwhile, the
restructuring of Air Malta, the national carrier, continues to lag behind and, although financial
performance has improved recently, the company continues to generate losses.7 To this end, a
faster restructuring of Air Malta is needed to contain fiscal risks. At the same time, Enemalta’s
elevated level of government guaranteed debt (about 6 percent of GDP in 2015) calls for
continued close monitoring of its operations.

period would further mitigate the associated long-term fiscal risks. Increasing the administrative
efficiency in the health sector and strengthening the primary care should also help contain age
related spending growth and support the pension reform.
Authorities’ views

19.
The authorities confirmed their commitment to continue with fiscal consolidation.
They expressed confidence in meeting their 2017 deficit target on the back of continued
favorable economic conditions, and prudent macro and revenue forecasts. They agreed that
measures to support fiscal consolidation should build on containting current spending, including
through the implementation of in-depth spending reviews, though noted that the ongoing
public sector wage negotiations with the unions pose uncertainty. They also pointed to
continued efforts to enhance tax collection efficiency, including by better use of technology and
more efficient risk-based tax audits. They recognized risks from contingent liabilities, but stressed
7

that the impact of these risks on public debt is contained, also given the ongoing reforms in
SOEs. Finally, they agreed with the need to continue addressing long-term spending pressures
from ageing and committed to review the effectiveness of the recent measures periodically.

22.
Strengthening the macroprudential framework further would enhance resilience to
possible property market swings. Staff’s analysis does not point to a significant misalignment
of property prices (see accompanying SIP). However, persistent demand pressures in the housing
market could eventually lead to imbalances, particularly given the lagged supply response. With
high exposure of core domestic banks to the housing market, a sharp turnaround in housing
prices could weaken banks’ financial health—particularly if accompanied by broader economic
slowdown and an increase in unemployment—possibly resulting in a negative spiral of low

lending and investment. While households default rate is currently low and financial wealth is
high, their elevated debt, high concentration of assets in real estate, and the prevalence of
variable rate mortgages could increase vulnerabilities. Sustained efforts are therefore needed to
ensure that imbalances in the housing market will not emerge, including by ensuring that fiscal
measures related to the housing market do not amplify the cycle, and by adopting targeted
macroprudential measures such as limits on loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios. Closing
data gaps, including on borrower characteristics, is critical for the calibration of the
macroprudential measures and for identifying risks in a timely manner.
23.
The non-financial corporates, particularly SMEs, remain vulnerable to shocks. Staff’s
analysis suggests that the financial health of medium and large firms has improved in recent
years, but the financial position of smaller enterprises and firms in the construction sector
remained generally weak. Furthermore, a decline in profitability and an increase in interest rates
would push many firms into a vulnerable state and thus likely result in new defaults and
underinvestment (see accompanying SIP).

24.
A faster cleanup of banks and firms’ balance sheets would improve the credit
channel and support investment. High legacy NPLs continue to weigh on banks’ balance
sheets. Moreover, they have contributed to high borrowing costs, thus weakening the monetary
policy transmission mechanism and undermining investment activity, particularly by SMEs that
lack sufficient internal funding. In this regard, the recent regulatory changes, which require banks
to submit plans to reduce their NPLs ratios to below 6 percent within five years, are steps in the
right direction, given the elevated NPLs ratios for some smaller banks, while efforts to streamline
the insolvency framework will help support the resolution process. 9 A further increase in loanloss provisions would minimize uncertainty regarding future losses and also assist with faster
cleanup of banks’ balance sheets.

Banks that will deviate from their NPL resolution plans would have to accumulate a “Reserve for Excessive

will result in new credit extension to creditworthy SMEs rather than ever-greening existing bank
exposures to distressed borrowers is welcome. Robust governance structure, prudent risk
assessment, and adequate supervision, are also needed to mitigate contingent liability risks to
public finances.
26.
On-going vigilance is needed to contain risks to the integrity of the financial
system. Additional resources were made available for AML/CFT supervision, resulting in an
increase in intensity and frequency of onsite inspections of obliged entities by the Financial
Intelligence Analysis Unit and with the support of the Malta Financial Services Authority as
regards to supervision of financial institutions. In light of the growing size of the financial sector,
expansion of online gaming activities, and increased demand for IIP, sustained efforts are needed
to ensure a robust implementation of the AML/CFT framework in line with international
standards, and that the institutions involved have adequate resources for capacity building and
operations.
Authorities’ views
27.
The authorities concurred with staff on the need to enhance the financial sector’s
resilience and improve access to finance. They underscored that the banking sector is resilient
to various shocks, including from house prices. Nevertheless, they noted that granular financial
data are being collected to improve the monitoring of risks related to mortgage lending, and
that consideration is being given to the introduction of macroprudential limits as precautionary
measures. The authorities highlighted that recent regulatory changes and ongoing
improvements to the insolvency framework are likely to expedite private sector balance sheet
repair. This, together with the establishment of the MDB and introduction of the credit register,
would also help ease SMEs access to finance. They reiterated their commitment to maintain a
rigorous compliance with AML/CFT regulations.

Box 3. The Modalities of the Proposed Malta Development Bank
The Maltese authorities are actively working to establish a Development Bank (MDB), which is
expected to be fully operational in mid-2017. It aims to address the SMEs' financing gap that has
emerged in the Maltese economy mainly due to their high risk, insufficient collateral, and required loan
duration. The MDB will also co-finance large infrastructure development projects, which otherwise could not
be financed entirely by the private sector due to their large size and long maturity. The proposed MDB will
be 100 percent government-owned, and, in line with EU State Aid obligations, seeks to complement
commercial banks operations where their lending facilities are lacking or insufficient, rather than competing
with them. The MDB will be subject to a supervisory board, which is expected to gradually align the MDB
with the bank regulatory framework.
Funding: The MDB’s funding would be a combination of local issuance of bonds (up to 480 million euros by
the fifth year), and direct bilateral loans from international institutions such as the EIB, the CoE Development
Bank, and the EBRD. Consideration will be given to private placement of bonds to foreign financial
institutions. The government is expected to gradually inject €100 million of equity in the first five years.
Lending: The MDB is expected to provide up to €780 million (equivalent to about 8 percent of the projected
2016 GDP) in its first five years. About 75 percent of the MDB’s lending will be allocated, via commercial
banks, to viable SMEs that experienced difficulties in accessing credit. These loans will be restricted for new
lending and mainly directed for both

C. Sustaining High Growth and Increasing Inclusiveness
28.
Steady implementation of structural reforms would improve competitiveness, and
strengthen the foundations for a high and more inclusive long-term growth. Recent
reforms and large-scale infrastructure investment have boosted Malta’s medium-term potential
growth (see 2015 Article IV’s Selected Issues). Nevertheless, Malta’s income gap remains sizable,
while social exclusion––although below the euro area average—remains elevated compared to
the pre-crisis period (Figure 6). Addressing the remaining structural weaknesses, including the
quantity and quality of labor, would help improve competitiveness and support high and more
inclusive medium-term growth. In particular, sustained efforts are needed to:



Increase labor market participation and reduce skill mismatch. Malta’s labor force
participation, particularly of women, continues to lag behind the EU average (Figure 6). Beyond
cultural factors, this reflects lack of skills needed to meet the changing labor demand.11 Malta’s
high job vacancy rate, which is one of the highest in the euro area, and the low education
attainment also highlight the skill mismatch problem. The recently completed in-depth review of
education is timely and its recommendations to better align education and vocational trainings
with labor demand are steps in the right direction. Strengthening labor activation policies,
reducing early school leavers, and broadening the incentives to delay retirement would also
support higher labor force participation.



Enhance SMEs research and innovation. Although increasing in recent years, Malta’s gross
domestic R&D expenditures remained low due to low innovation activities of both business and
public sectors. Firm-level data indicates that innovation is significantly lower among SMEs,
reflecting in part their weak financial health (see accompanying SIP). Strengthening the balance
sheets of weak, but viable, firms, while expanding SMEs’ non-bank and equity financing options
would help easing financing constraints for R&D activities. Furthermore, enhanced collaboration
with the academia, higher internationalization of SMEs, and greater direct public sector’s support
would encourage innovation, particularly given that existing tax incentives are less effective for
small firms that lack sufficient funds to invest in R&D.

A recent study indicates that around three out of four firms consider skill shortage as a relevant obstacle
to hiring new workers.

Authorities’ views
29.

The authorities concurred with the need to advance structural reforms. They agreed

that further strengthening productivity is of utmost importance given the demographic
challenges. In this regard, they highlighted that recent and ongoing measures to expand the
labor supply and reduce skill mismatches together with adjustments in the pension system have
already led to significant labor force participation gains. The authorities also reiterated their
commitment to increase the R&D intensity in the economy and highlighted several initiatives to
support innovation by smaller firms. Efforts are also underway to improve the overall business
environment, notably by expediting the processes to establish or close a business, shortening the
length of legal proceedings and increasing out-of-court resolutions. In addition, they stressed
that the amendments to the Companies Act, expected to be adopted in early 2017, should
enhance the insolvency framework.

STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
Robust economic activity is set to continue, albeit a more moderate pace. Sound
policies and favorable macroeconomic conditions have supported Malta’s exceptionally strong
growth and contributed to a reduction in unemployment to record-lows and an improvement in
public finances. Domestic demand-led growth is projected to remain solid and stabilize at
potential rate of about 3 percent over the medium term. Strong job creation is expected to
continue, keeping unemployment low, while inflation is likely to increase modestly as import
prices recover. The external position, which is expected to remain strong, remains broadly in line
with fundamentals.
31.
However, downside risks predominate. Malta’s high openness makes it vulnerable to a
weaker external environment and rising anti-globalization sentiment. Uncertainties surrounding
the Brexit negotiations could weigh on economic activity through both direct and indirect
exposures while EU-wide corporate tax reform may impact Malta unfavorably. Domestically,
recent structural reforms could have a stronger-than-expected positive effect on growth. While
data do not point to a misalignment of house prices, persistent strength in mortgage lending
and the housing market may lead to imbalances, amplifying risks to the financial system and the
broader economy.
32.
The authorities’ medium-term consolidation plan is appropriate, but measures need
to be better specified. Achieving the medium-term objective of a structural fiscal balance will
put public debt on a firmly downward path while sustaining the growth momentum. Measures
beyond 2017 need to be better specified. Priority should be given to containing the fast-growing
wage bill and intermediate consumption, including by building on the recommendations of the
recent in-depth spending reviews and conducting similar reviews for the broader public sector.
Ongoing efforts to enhance tax collection efficiency would support the adjustment while creating
space for growth-enhancing policies. Improving the financial health of SOEs, and containing
long-term spending pressures would help reducing fiscal risks.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

33.
The banking system appears sound and resilient, but faces a number of challenges.
Domestic banks report adequate capitalization and liquidity, and profitability above levels seen in
peers. However, headwinds from protracted low interest rates, weak credit growth, and legacy
corporate NPLs pose challenges. Future regulatory changes and uncertain external environment
may affect banks’ profitability prospects and capacity to support growth. High and increasing
banks’ exposure to the property market may increase financial stability risks.
34.
The resilience of the private sector needs to be bolstered further. Deployment of
targeted macro-prudential tools linked to mortgage lending would enhance banks’ and
households’ resilience to possible property market swings. Closing data gaps is critical to
calibrate such measures. A careful review of the fiscal incentives related to property market
together with measures to address housing supply bottlenecks would help prevent housing
market imbalances. A faster resolution of legacy NPLs would strengthen private sector balance
sheets and unlock resources for growth. In this regard, the recent regulatory changes, requiring
banks to submit time-bound plans to reduce their NPL ratios and efforts to streamline legal
proceedings, are steps in the right direction.
35.
The planned development bank could support the economy but fiscal risks should
be contained. The establishment of the MDB could help alleviate financing constraints faced by
SMEs and foster higher development investment. The authorities’ intentions to ensure that
MDB’s operations will lead to new credit origination by banks to viable firms would reduce the
risk of evergreening existing exposures to distressed borrowers. Robust governance structure,
prudent risk assessment, adequate supervision, and well-designed origination rules are also
needed to mitigate contingent liability risk to public finances.
36.
Ongoing vigilance is needed to contain financial system’s integrity risks. Continued
efforts should be pursued to effectively implement the AML/CFT framework, including by
ensuring that the competent authorities are adequately resourced and coordinate closely in
supervising compliance.
37.
Steady reform implementation will support high and inclusive long-term growth.
Continued reform momentum—consistent with the government’s national strategy—would help
address the remaining structural impediments, close the income gap, and ensure a more
equitable distribution of growth dividends. In particular, sustained efforts are needed to (i)
increase the labor force participation, particularly of women, and reduce skill mismatch in the
face of the changing labor demand; (ii) enhance SMEs’ innovation, including by strengthening
their balance sheets and broadening financing options, increasing public R&D spending, and
fostering close partnerships with education institutions; and (iii) further streamline the legal
process and address the shortcomings of insolvency and bankruptcy frameworks.
38.
Staff proposes that the next Article IV consultation with Malta follow the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ Banks’ total assets amounted to about 500 percent of GDP (about €48 billion) at 2016H1. Half of these assets are owned by international banks, which have limited or no linkages to the domestic economy. Core domestic banks, which account for 44 percent of the banking sector’s total assets, are tightly
linked to domestic activity as they rely mainly on domestic deposits and provide the bulk of lending to residents. Non-core domestic banks, which account for about 5 percent of the banking system’s assets, maintain small exposure to residents.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative
likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between
10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of
discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly. “Short term” and “medium term” are meant to indicate that the risk could
materialize within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

Annex III. In-Depth Spending Reviews
To enhance efficiencies and support fiscal consolidation, the government is adopting the
recommendations of several in-depth spending reviews that were conducted in recent years.


Social benefits. The first in-depth spending review on social security benefits, completed in
September 2014, provided a number of recommendations that were included in the
subsequent budgets. The main recommendations included tapering of benefits to enhance
the incentives for unemployed to search for employment, in-work benefits to incentivize lowincome workers with children to stay in employment, and the youth guarantee scheme to
improve the employability and further educational prospects of youths who are not in
employment, education, and training.



Health. The in-depth health spending review, completed in September 2015, focused on the
State Hospital, given its importance for the health financial resources. The review
recommended better scrutiny of the payroll system, overtime, sick leave and allowances,
reducing spending on medicines and medical supplies, and improving procurement process.
The ongoing budget decentralization at the department level and the notional billing
introduced between departments is enhancing transparency of decision making process and
enables departments to become more aware of their staffing costs.



Education. The in-depth review in education, initiated in January 2016, includes series of
initiatives, such as: (i) free child care for all to ensure school readiness; (ii) a breakfast club
state schools, allowing children to attend school before the start of official school hours; (iii)
The 3 to 16 club, allowing children to do homework and other extra-curricular activities after
school. In addition, the ongoing review aims to use the existing resources more efficiently by
consolidating schools, improving teaching and learning, and reducing early school leavers
from 20 to 10 percent.

Annex IV. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Malta’s public debt has moderated in recent years on the back of deficit reduction, strong growth,
and favorable financing conditions. The debt dynamics are robust to most shocks, though under a
contingent liability shock that is combined with a low growth scenario, the public debt ratio would
increase considerably and remain elevated throughout the projection horizon. The moderate gross
financing needs and the low share of debt held by non-residents limit potential vulnerabilities. With
large external assets that comfortably cover external liabilities, Malta’s external position appears
resilient to various types of shocks.
Public debt sustainability
1.
The public debt is set to remain on a downward trajectory. Strong nominal GDP
growth (9.8 percent) and a higher primary fiscal balance lowered the public debt to 60.8 percent
of GDP in 2015 from 64.3 percent of GDP in 2014. Going forward, favorable growth prospects,
further fiscal consolidation, and improved financing conditions are expected to support a
continued moderation of public debt to about 52 percent of GDP by 2021.
2.
The stock of government guaranteed debt to non-financial SOEs modestly
decreased, but remains high. Government guaranteed debt declined to 15.2 percent of GDP in
2015 from 15.8 percent of GDP in 2014. The partial privatization of Enemalta and improvement of
its financial health, alongside continued restructuring of Air Malta, are likely to reduce risks
emanating from SOEs.
3.
In order to assess the sustainability of government debt, a number of adverse
scenarios are considered. These scenarios include low growth, high borrowing costs, a
deterioration in the primary balance, and materialization of contingent liabilities. The results
indicate that public debt-to-GDP ratio remains vulnerable to a number of shocks. In particular:


Under a growth shock, which envisages a reduction of output by 3.0 percentage points in
2017 and 2018 relative to the baseline (equivalent to one standard deviation of growth over
the past 10 years) and a decline in inflation by 0.8 percentage points in 2017 and 0.7
percentage points in 2018 relative to the baseline, debt would peak at 65.4 percent of GDP in
2018, 8.8 percentage points higher than in the baseline and decline to 61.1 percent of GDP in
2021.



A sustained interest rate shock of 200bps would slow down the moderation of the public
debt ratio such that by 2021 it would reach 53.5 percent of GDP, which is 1.2 percentage
points higher with respect to the baseline.



A primary fiscal balance shock of 0.4 percentage points in 2017 and 0.3 percentage points in
2018 relative to the baseline would bring public debt to 53.0 percent of GDP in 2021, which is
0.7 percentage points higher relative to the baseline.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

37

MALTA



A combined macro-fiscal shock including growth, interest rate and primary balance shock
above would result in debt peaking at 65.6 percent of GDP in 2018, 9.0 percentage points
higher relative to the baseline, and decline to 62.4 percent of GDP in 2021.



A contingent liability shock envisages a one-time increase in non-interest expenditures
equivalent to 5 percent of the domestic banks’ total assets. This shock is accompanied by a
real GDP growth shock as the one above (with growth declining by one standard deviation
over 2017–2018) while revenue-to-GDP ratio remaining the same as in the baseline. The
deterioration of the primary balance leads to higher interest rates while the slowdown in GDP
growth lowers the inflation rate. Overall, this shock would increase public debt to
75.0 percent of GDP in 2018, 18.4 percentage points higher relative to the baseline. At the
end of the projection horizon, public debt would moderate to 71.0 percent of GDP.



The government guaranteed shock reflects a contingent liability risk from SOEs. It includes a
one-time increase in non-interest expenditures equivalent to 50 percent of government
guaranteed debt, accompanied by a transitory negative confidence impact on Malta’s spread.
Under this shock the debt ratio would peak at 66.6 percent of GDP in 2017, 7.6 percentage
points higher than in the baseline, and decline to 60.0 percent in 2021.

Overall, the key risk to public debt is assessed to be originating from contingent liabilities,
and low growth.
External debt sustainability
4.
Malta’s gross external debt is very large but ample external assets appear to
comfortably cover its external liabilities. The net short term debt is relatively high (176 percent
of GDP), and largely held by international deposit taking corporations, which have limited links to
the domestic economy. Limited currency risks and substantial inter-company lending help to
reduce potential vulnerabilities. External asset accumulation is likely to continue over the
medium-term, on the back of steady service-led current account surpluses. Overall, Malta’s
external position is likely to remain robust and resilient to various types of shocks.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Figures in the boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the baseline and scenario being
presented. Ten-year historical average for the variable is also shown.
2/ For historical scenarios, the historical averages are calculated over the ten-year period, and the information is
used to project debt dynamics five years ahead.
3/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and current account
balance.
4/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent occurs in 2017.

STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
(As of January 31, 2017)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance purposes. Significant progress in improving
macroeconomic statistics has been made in close cooperation with the European Central Bank (ECB)
and Eurostat while upgrading statistical systems to meet the euro area standards. Most
macroeconomic statistics can now be accessed through Eurostat and Haver Analytics. The country has
subscribed to the SDDS since December 1, 2009, with the metadata posted on the IMF’s Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board.
National Accounts: Malta compiles its national accounts in accordance with the guidelines of ESA
2010 since October 2014. The effect of the conceptual differences from ESA 1995 on the
estimated level of GDP in 2010 was a relative small upward revision of 0.5 percent. Data on retail
and consumer prices, labor market indicators, and tourism arrivals are released monthly, usually
with a short lag. A harmonized index of consumer prices has been published since May 2004.
These data are available through Eurostat and Haver Analytics as well as via the Internet at the
Central Bank of Malta (CBM) and the National Statistical Office (NSO) websites. The NSO releases
quarterly national accounts data in current and constant prices with a lag of about two months,
annual nonfinancial sectoral accounts in current prices with a lag of about 10 months, and a
monthly index of industrial production with a lag of just over a month. However, national
accounts data have been subject to substantial revisions, often affecting several years. The
reasons for revisions include large statistical discrepancies (captured under changes in inventory
stocks), particularly on the first release and revisions of deflators. Furthermore, supply-side GDP
estimates by type of economic activity are only available at current prices and compilation of
volume measures is currently progressing. Volume estimates of expenditure GDP are obtained
using annual-chain linking with 2010 as the reference year. The monthly producer price index for
total industry has been published, but that for services sector is still under discussion. National
accounts imports and exports data are not disaggregated into goods and services. Annual
Financial balance sheets and transactions by sectors are published on the Eurostat website.
However, data on household savings are not available.
Price Statistics: Data on retail and consumer prices are released monthly, usually with a short lag. A
harmonized index of consumer prices has been published since May 2004. These data are available
through Eurostat and Haver Analytics and via the Internet at the Central Bank of Malta (CBM) and the
National Statistical Office (NSO) websites. The monthly producer price index for total industry has been
published, but that for services sector is still under discussion.
Government finance statistics: Fiscal statistics meet requirements, with quarterly accrual-based data
on general government operations compiled in accordance with the ESA2010 methodology and

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALTA

disseminated with a one-quarter lag. The general government comprises data from the consolidated
fund of government adjusted to include other accounts of government, the accruals elements, and the
financial performance of the Extra Budgetary Units and of the Local Councils. The NSO also publishes
monthly statistics on the cash operations of the central government with a lag of one month, for which
the authorities plan to utilize the targeted timeliness flexibility option in light of additional time
required for the final month of the fiscal year.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Monetary statistics are timely and of good quality. Since the entry
into the euro area in January 2008, monetary data for IMF statistical publications have been obtained
through a gateway arrangement with the ECB, thus reducing the reporting burden of the country.
Financial Sector Surveillance: Malta has reported Financial Soundness Indicators beginning from
2005 along with metadata, which are available on the IMF’s website (http://fsi.imf.org).
External sector statistics: Summary data (merchandise trade, current account balance, and selected
financial account data) are released by the NSO on a quarterly basis with a lag of about three months.
More detailed BOP and IIP data are released quarterly, the latter with a lag sometimes of about one
year. Summary trade statistics are released monthly with a lag of about 40 days. The CBM publishes
the external debt templates in line with requirements of the SDDS, including both gross and net
external debt. In line with the European regulation, Malta has transitioned to BPM6 and has revised the
estimates back to 2008. In line with the BPM6 requirements, the new data include estimates for the
SPEs and other coverage improvements, affecting in particular the primary incomes and the financial
account (direct and portfolio investments), as well as position data (IIP). The BPM6 implementation and
data back casting entailed a series of data revisions recently.
II. Data Standards and Quality
The country has subscribed to the SDDS since
December 1, 2009, with the metadata posted
on the IMF’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin
Board.

A data ROSC was published in 2006.

Statement by Carlo Cottarelli, Executive Director for Malta and Antonio Bassanetti,
Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
February 17, 2017
The authorities of Malta express their appreciation to the Fund staff for very constructive
consultations, based on open dialogue, mutual trust and careful consideration of each other’s
point of view. Pursuing such an approach over the years allowed the Fund to be considered
as a trusted advisor in Malta, as testified by the very high degree of implementation of the
policy recommendations made in previous Article IV consultations.
The authorities of Malta are in broad agreement with the thrust of the 2016 Article IV
Report, and would like to provide the following comments.
Macroeconomic outlook
As clearly described in the Report, over the last few years Malta has experienced strong
growth, low unemployment, contained inflation, and a buoyant external position. Such a
performance is neither the result of a post-crisis rebound – Malta weathered well both the
global financial crisis and the euro area sovereign crisis – nor of an unbalanced growth
model. Rather it reflects the continued strengthening of fundamentals through a proactive
approach to macroeconomic, structural, and financial policies. Beyond being beneficial per
se, the authorities’ policy strategy allowed the country to take full advantage also of the
improving external environment.
Since joining the euro in 2008, Malta has halved its per capita GDP gap with respect to both
the EU and the euro area average, with the latter gap closing from around 74 to 87 percent (in
purchasing power standards). Malta is thus a leading example of European integration. Going
forward, the authorities’ assessment of the outlook is broadly in line with that of the IMF
staff, though they see risks as being more balanced, rather than tilted to the downside.
Regarding external risks, Malta has already demonstrated its resilience in recent years,
despite the severe negative shocks that hit its regional context. Malta is well placed to
respond to future shocks by relying on an even stronger set of fundamentals, including and
increasingly attractive business environment, a well-diversified economy, and sounder public
finances. On the domestic side, there is broad consensus that the capacity to deliver on sound
policies and relevant structural reforms is a critical competitive advantage of the country, and
that – as proven by the recent performance – there is a premium in ‘staying ahead of the
curve’ when tackling potential vulnerabilities.
The Maltese authorities agree that the main challenge now facing Malta is consolidating the
recent achievements, which would then form the basis for further leveraging its development
prospects. This requires addressing the main bottlenecks in the country’s production
capacity: labor supply should rise faster, skill mismatches should be overcome, innovative

2
capability should be improved, and infrastructure should be strengthened – particularly in the
transport sector. The authorities are determined to pursue these objectives, while persevering
with a sound, balanced and cautious approach to macroeconomic policies.
Economic structure
All available estimates point to a sharp increase of Malta’s potential output growth since the
global financial crisis. It is now time to push for a further breakthrough in each single
component – labor, capital, productivity – in order to ensure continued progress.
Labor supply. Since 2010, the labor market participation in Malta has increased by around 7
percentage points, to 67.6 percent, mainly on the back of the steep positive trend in female
participation. The measures introduced in recent years – like free childcare for working
parents, tax deductions for the use of private child care centers, free early and after school
opening, and fiscal incentives for females returning to the labor market – have thus proven to
be very effective. Yet, both the remaining gap with the European average – though more than
halved in the last five years – and the labor shortages that are being experienced, point to the
need for further improvements in labor supply.
The authorities rank this among the highest priorities and are confident that many recent
measures undertaken on several fronts will deliver results in the coming years. Such
measures include, among others, the 2016 pension reform which provides incentives for
remaining active in the labor market beyond the statutory retirement age; the tapering of
some social benefits to stimulate the search for employment; the in-work benefit scheme to
help low-income working parents staying employed; the progressive reduction of personal
income tax spread over 2013-2015 and the raising of the tax-free income tax thresholds.
The Maltese authorities also recognize the need to enhance the quality of labor supply. The
goal is for educational attainments and vocational training to be better attuned to the rapidly
changing structure of the Maltese economy. Reflections are ongoing on ways to enhance both
teaching and learning, including through the recently concluded in-depth review of the
education system. Vocational training is also being pursued through the Youth Guarantee
Scheme – in place since a few years – and the educational grants for unemployed single
parents.
Capital stock. In recent years the capital stock has been boosted by the implementation of
some large projects, particularly in the energy sector (building of new gas plants, realization
of an interconnector with Sicily, among others). A substantial contribution came also from
strong government investment, which in turn benefitted from the authorities’ capacity to
ensure full absorption of the country’s entitlements to EU structural funds.

3
However, like in the case of the labor supply, the infrastructure development is not matching
the pace of a fast growing economy, particularly when it comes to the transport sector.
Tackling these bottlenecks inevitably takes some time. The very small dimension of the
island and its morphology add complexity to the issue. However, apart from substantial
infrastructural investments in major road arteries to ease traffic flows, the authorities have
increased substantially the subsidy contribution to the Public Transport operator, a measure
that has contributed to enhance the service leading to greater use. This year those turning 18
years old have been granted free entitlement to unlimited public transport use to get them
used to it before buying a private car, 18 being the legal driving age. There are also plans for
expansion of the Airport terminal by the private operator and the construction of a
breakwater to Valletta’s second harbor is being considered for financing under the EFSI
Junker Plan.
Productivity. The authorities are aware that there is significant room for improving
productivity. Besides the focus on the education and vocational systems, measures are being
taken to facilitate access to finance, particularly for SMEs, as a precondition to foster
investment and innovations; particular care is also taken to assist firms to internationalize and
to ensure continued improvements in the business environment. More specifically:
‐

As for SMEs: (i) the so-called Microinvest scheme – which proved very effective in
recent years by envisaging a tax rebate for investment activity – has been extended to
2020; (ii) in 2016 the B-Start scheme has been launched to support innovative startups; (iii) since a couple of years, Malta Enterprise – the national development
corporation – is offering a microguarantee scheme for loans to SMEs; (iv) the recent
launch of the Credit Register will reduce asymmetries of information; (v) the
Development Bank should become operational this year with the objective of
facilitating access to credit for SMEs and financing infrastructure investments; (vi)
finally Trade Malta will provide support to SMEs in their internationalization efforts.

‐

As for the business environment, Malta Enterprise has recently overhauled the
procedures for setting up a business, thereby reducing the required days from 32 to
just 2 or 3 by filling out a short electronic form on an online portal following a twosteps procedure. A similarly sharp decrease in the costs of setting up a business has
also been achieved (down to around €100 from more than €1,000). Self-employed
could start operations by following a simple and free one step procedure which can be
completed in one day. The time needed to open up the utilities accounts (electricity,
water, etc.) decreased by around 60 percent. For the coming years, Malta Enterprise is
working on further simplification of the procedures for both running and closing a
business.

‐

In order to favor a healthier corporate sector, the amendment to the Companies’ Act –
envisaging substantial modifications to the insolvency regime – is being discussed by
Parliament. Among the proposed changes, the new regime foresees a short period of

4
time – just four months – to complete the insolvency procedures (extendable to
twelve months only under exceptional circumstances). An out-of-court mediation
mechanism is also envisaged under specific circumstances. Finally, a “second
chance” principle would be introduced. These measures should contribute to a quick
repair of businesses’ balance sheets, thereby saving jobs and enhancing recovery
ratios.
‐

As reported by staff, many measures have been adopted in recent years to improve
the judicial systems. Efficiency indicators are providing some encouraging evidence.
The average disposition time has decreased from 834 days in 2013 to 668 in 2015; at
the same time, the clearance rate has substantially increased and, by standing above
100 percent since a couple of years, allows the gradual reduction of the backlog.
Measures are also being considered to hasten contract enforcement by licensed credit
and financial institutions as this will help reducing their NPL levels.

Fiscal policy
The strengthening of fiscal accounts achieved in recent years has been notable. The primary
surplus improved and is estimated to have reached 1.5 percent of GDP in 2016. The overall
deficit is estimated to have declined to 0.7 percent of GDP, well below the original target,
and the public debt-to-GDP ratio fell from the peak of 69 percent in 2013 to an estimated 60
percent in 2016. Going forward, the authorities are determined to continue building fiscal
buffers. They plan reaching a surplus of 0.1 percent of GDP by 2019, corresponding to an
improvement of 1.5 percentage points in structural terms, thereby reaching the MTO of a
balanced budget as planned. This would imply a further sharp decrease of the debt ratio, to
close to 55 percent of GDP.
The authorities take note that – in the absence of a full specification of measures – staff
projects a slower adjustment pace. At the same time, they would like to reiterate the
credibility of their commitment – won by delivering on the sizeable adjustment of recent
years – and would recall the strong and broad political support for further enhancing fiscal
fundamentals. Their intention is to continue intervening on both sides of the budget, in the
context of prudent revenue projections.
On the revenue side, and as reported by staff, the authorities have been adopting measures to
improve the efficiency of revenue administration. On the expenditure side, they will further
pursue expenditure control and rationalization, relying – among other things – on the
evidence provided by the in-depth spending reviews conducted in the last three years in the
critical areas of social benefits, health, and education.
The authorities agree with staff’s suggestion to restrain current spending growth. This said,
Malta’s current expenditure as a ratio to GDP decreased from 38.4 to 37.1 percent in the last

5
three years and is significantly lower than the average for the euro area (44.4 percent). As for
the risk of spending overruns, in recent years expenditure in priority areas such as health and
education was adjusted only in so far as revenues exceeded expectations. In any case, the
authorities agree on the need to exercise restraint.
Aging-related pressures are also on their radar screen. The pension reform adopted in 2016 –
inspired by the principle of enhancing both adequacy and sustainability – aimed at balancing
contributions and benefits through a number of initiatives, mainly through an increase in the
contributory period from 40 to 41 years for persons born after 1968, and including an
increase in minimum pensions, as well as measures and incentives to delay retirement and
increase voluntary savings. The envisaged 5-year monitoring of the results will allow a
calibration of the system, if needed, with a view to maintain a stable proportion between the
contribution periods and the periods of time during which it is expected that the pension will
be paid.
Financial system
As reported by staff, the Maltese financial system is strongly capitalized, highly liquid,
profitable, well supervised, and represents one of the points of strength of Malta’s economy.
These features apply to all the segments of the system, including the core domestic banks,
which have the strongest linkages to the domestic economy. The authorities are traditionally
taking a proactive approach to further strengthen resilience.
While on a decreasing trend – which is expected to continue on the back of improved creditworthiness of both NFCs and households – NPLs of core domestic banks (5.6 percent as at
September 2016, down from the peak of 9.0 percent in 2013) continue to be closely
monitored. The authorities believe that – besides the continued increase of provisions and the
significant collateral coverage – building up further buffers is warranted. Thus, they (i)
suggest restraint in dividend distribution; (ii) introduced the Other Systemically Important
Institutions capital buffers to preserve a strong capital position in the most systemically
important banks for the domestic economy; (iii) launched the Countercyclical Capital Buffer
to be activated in case of excessive credit growth; and (iv) proposed a change in Banking
Rule 9 aimed at establishing concrete plans for banks with NPLs higher than 6 percent to
reduce such stock over a 5 year period (in case of failure to deliver on the plans, banks will
be required to accumulate additional reserves).
The staff Report points to the high exposure of the banking sector to the real estate industry,
which is somehow a structural feature of the Maltese system given the small dimension of
the country and the prevailing social and cultural preferences. Bank lending to other sectors
is constrained by the extent of foreign direct investment, particularly in manufacturing, where
reliance on domestic bank financing is more limited. Furthermore, the shift of the economy
towards services, which is less capital intensive, tends to magnify the share of real estate

6
lending. Given the very high home ownership culture, banks’ exposure to the real estate
sector is mostly through retail mortgages, where the NPL performance is quite positive.
Lending to developers is much more guarded and restrained.
Relatedly, the authorities agree with staff that currently there are no misalignments in
property prices. Concerning household debt, the authorities would take a more nuanced view
compared to staff, as most of the rise of the debt as a ratio of disposable income occurred
prior to 2009-10, with the ratio being broadly stable ever since (as shown also by the chart in
the main Report and in the SIP). In other words, in the last six years, mortgage growth has
been broadly in line with growth in household disposable income. Furthermore, some
mitigating factors further reduce risks, as acknowledged also by staff, such as the sizeable
households’ financial wealth and their very low default rate. Also, while mortgage loans are
concentrated in a small fraction of highly exposed households, the latter mostly belong to
younger cohorts, with a relatively high level of education and – thus – favorable perspectives
in terms of disposable income. In any case, the authorities are monitoring the situation
closely – for example by enhancing data collection on banks’ exposure to the real estate
sector and on credit standards (which remain prudent with low loan-to-value and debtservicing-to-income ratios), or by running stress tests assuming sharp drops in housing prices
(in the order of 20 to 30 percent). They stand ready to intervene through macro-prudential
measures, if needed. In this respect, the European Systemic Risk Board has recently
concluded that no further measures are currently needed in Malta.
