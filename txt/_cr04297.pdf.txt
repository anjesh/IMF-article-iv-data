Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2004 Consultation with Zimbabwe
Approved by Michael Nowak and Juha Kähkönen
June 10, 2004

•

Discussions were held in Harare during March 16–31, 2004. The staff met with the Ministers of
Finance and Economic Development; Land, Land Reform and Resettlement; Anti-Corruption and
Anti-Monopoly Policy; Industry and International Trade; Health; the Governor of the Reserve Bank of
Zimbabwe, and other senior government officials. It also met with representatives of NGOs, the
business and financial sector, political parties, trade unions, and the diplomatic community.

•

The team consisted of D.C. Ross (head), F. Ahmed, J-F. Dauphin, A. Jayaratnam (all AFR),
H. Treichel (FIN), D. Rozhkov (MFD), and P. Khandelwal (PDR). J. Mafararikwa, Advisor to the
Executive Director for Zimbabwe, and World Bank staff participated in some of the discussions.

•

Zimbabwe is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. At the conclusion of the 2003 Article IV
consultation on June 6, 2003, Executive Directors expressed deep concern about the continued sharp
decline in economic activity and per capita income, the rise in poverty and human suffering, the
repeated shortages of food, the acceleration of inflation, and the accumulation of external payments
arrears. They noted that the deteriorating situation was the result of inappropriate economic policies,
aggravated by violence and disruptions to productive activity related to the government’s fast-track
land reform program. They urged the authorities to implement policy changes to prevent a worsening
of the situation.

•

Zimbabwe has accumulated overdue financial obligations to the Fund since February 2001; these
arrears totaled SDR198 million as of end-May 2004. Following a decision by the Executive Board on
December 3, 2003, the Managing Director issued a complaint on February 6, 2004 that initiated the
procedure on Zimbabwe’s compulsory withdrawal from the Fund.

•

Zimbabwe accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, but maintains exchange
restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to Fund approval. In the absence of a timetable to
remove the restrictions, the staff does not recommend their approval by the Fund. In addition, it has
incurred external payments arrears on official debt.

•

Zimbabwe’s economic data suffer increasingly from poor coverage, time lags, and worsening
reliability of reporting units, all of which hamper Fund surveillance.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Zimbabwe’s overall economic and social situation has continued to deteriorate.
Real GDP fell by some 30 percent over the last 5 years, and another decline of 45 percent is projected this year. Structural changes have weakened the economic base;
in particular, the disorderly implementation of the land reform program has sharply
reduced agricultural production and contributed to widespread food shortages.
Concerns about economic and political governance have discouraged productive
investment and promoted capital flight and emigration. Inflation reached 600 percent
in November 2003, but has eased in recent months. Real wages and formal sector
employment have fallen sharply, and social conditions are dire. The food security
situation remains difficult, but sizable donor assistance has helped meet food and
other humanitarian needs over the last two years. Poverty levels continue to rise and
the HIV/AIDS pandemic remains largely unchecked.

•

Economic policies lack consistency and have not adequately dealt with these
challenges. Loose monetary policy in 2003 provided credit to the private sector at
very low nominal interest rates and accommodated inflationary pressures. The
Reserve Bank (RBZ) has made inflation reduction its prime target since December
2003 and has tightened monetary policy, but not consistently and without support
from fiscal policy. The managed foreign exchange tender introduced in January 2004
led to an appreciation of the average exchange rate as the parallel market was sharply
curtailed and driven underground. Reflecting the impact of higher-than-budgeted
inflation, fiscal operations were almost balanced in 2003, but the 2004 budget is
expansionary. Progress was made in 2003 in reducing price controls, but corruption is
widespread and the monopoly of the Grain Marketing Board (GMB) remains in place.

•

The policy discussions focused on arresting the economic decline and restarting
growth. The mission welcomed some of the steps taken since late 2003, including
strengthened supervision of financial institutions, but urged more action on fiscal,
monetary and exchange rate policies. It advised to monitor closely the impact of
tighter monetary conditions on the banking sector and to preserve social spending
from the fiscal tightening. It also recommended the implementation of necessary
structural reforms to increase productivity throughout the economy, particularly in
agriculture, where problems relating to the land reform program and property rights
have continued to hamper production. The authorities broadly agreed with the thrust
of the mission’s assessment, but differed on the timing and some of the specifics of
the recommendations on financial policies and especially on structural issues. They
felt that in the short run export incentives should be provided through ad-hoc support
schemes rather than full exchange rate adjustment, and that the dual interest rate
policy was still needed to support production. They indicated no immediate intention
to revise the 2004 budget, nor to dismantle the GMB monopoly, and have yet to
fundamentally address the problems that resulted from the implementation of the land
reform.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Zimbabwe’s economy has continued to deteriorate. Real GDP declined by
30 percent in the last 5 years and a further decline of 4-5 percent is expected this year.
Inflation doubled in each of the last 3 years and reached 600 percent at end-2003. While this
is in part the result of shocks, such as inclement weather, it mainly reflects the inadequacy of
economic policies. Moreover, structural changes weakened the economic base. In particular,
the disorderly implementation of the land reform program has sharply reduced agricultural
production. Concerns about governance, the rule of law and human rights, and continued lack
of clarity about property rights have severely damaged confidence, discouraged investment,
and promoted capital flight and emigration.
2.
The economic decline has had dire social consequences. Unemployment is very
high and increasing, social indicators have worsened, and the HIV/AIDS pandemic remains
largely unchecked, with one in four adults being HIV-positive (Appendix I). Severe food
shortages have necessitated massive food imports and donor assistance (Box 1)—and a
vicious cycle of malnourishment and disease has developed. Prices have risen much faster
than incomes, especially among low-income earners. Financial savings have been eroded by
inflation and low nominal interest rates. Public services have deteriorated and are unable to
cope with demands.
3.
The political situation has become increasingly difficult. Attempts by diplomatic
channels to broker talks between the ruling party Zanu-PF and the opposition party
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) have not yielded results. Zanu-PF recently won
local elections amidst reports of fraud and political violence. In several cities with elected
MDC mayors, centrally appointed governors were imposed. The treason trial of MDC leader
Tsvangirai continues, and the only daily independent newspaper was shut down in September
2003. Amendments to the electoral act in March 2004 granted greater powers to the registrar
general and provided compulsory “voter education”, and the authorities rejected a UNDP
proposal to help finance and monitor the March 2005 general elections.
4.
International relations have further deteriorated. The international community
has expressed grave concern over a lack of respect for basic democratic principles, human
rights, good governance and the rule of law. The US and the European Union have renewed
and extended their targeted sanctions against President Mugabe’s regime. In December 2003,
Zimbabwe withdrew from the Commonwealth when it was indefinitely suspended. Donor
support is limited to humanitarian assistance.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
5.
Real GDP declined by 9.3 percent in 2003 with agriculture, mining, manufacturing,
and tourism being the most affected sectors (Table 1). On the supply side, shortages of
domestic and imported inputs, and rising production costs contributed to the drop in
production. Furthermore, the decline in productivity and shortages of labor brought about by
the HIV/AIDS pandemic, combined with the poor maintenance of infrastructure, have

-6-

Box 1. Food Security
Zimbabwe’s population continues to face food shortages. While cereal production, especially maize, rose by
1/3 in the crop year ending in 2003, it was still less than half of average production during 1997/98-2001/02.
Contributing factors to the low production levels include unfavorable weather conditions, the disruption of
large-scale farming by the government’s fast track land reform, and input shortages.
Over 6 million people (½ of the total population) were in need of food assistance in early 2004. The
majority live in rural areas, mainly unemployed former commercial farm workers. The World Food Program
(WFP) and its partners have not been able to provide food aid to all in need because the donor response to its
appeal for food assistance has been insufficient. Urban food security has become a growing problem; the WFP
does not target urban households and there are few government support programs in these areas.
Most observers expect the cereal gap to persist beyond March 2004 owing to poor prospects for any
increase in production above last year’s level. In contrast, the Ministry of Agriculture estimates the current
cereal crop at 2.8 million tons in—more than double last year’s result—and in May 2004 cancelled the joint
crop assessment undertaken in previous years with WFP/FAO. At the same time, the government is reportedly
making preparations for large-scale grain imports (600,000-700,000 tons) from mid-2004.

reduced Zimbabwe’s growth potential. On the demand side, real consumption has contracted
and investment remains at very low levels, reflecting weak investor confidence, excess
capacity in major industries, and the lack of foreign exchange for imports. Recorded exports
and imports declined in 2003.
6.
Fiscal operations shifted from a deficit of 3 percent of GDP in 2002 to virtual
balance in 2003, with a good result in the last quarter dominating the outcome for the
whole year (Figure 1 and Table 2). Revenue declined by 1.5 percentage point of GDP, as
real corporate tax revenue, which is collected with a one-year lag, was further eroded by
inflation and customs duties were affected by the drop in recorded imports. However,
collections were relatively strong late in the year, mainly due to bracket creep on personal
income taxes. Expenditure remained within the supplementary budget ceiling
notwithstanding higher-than-budgeted inflation, thus registering a significant fall relative to
GDP.1 Domestic interest payments dropped as interest rates were kept artificially low,
spending on goods and capital projects was reduced owing to the foreign exchange shortage
and weakening administrative capacity, and government wages fell in real terms.
Government domestic debt fell by 2/3 to 10 percent of GDP at end-2003, reflecting highly
negative real interest rates on Treasury bills. Quasi-fiscal operations, which had been large in
2002, were limited in 2003 to exchange rate subsidies for government operations amounting
to 0.6 percent of GDP. Several public enterprises ran large deficits in 2003, including the
Grain Marketing Board (GMB), but little data are available.

7.
Compared to the 2003 outcome, the 2004 budget appears expansionary, with a
deficit target of over 7 percent of GDP. However, the authorities did not plan any major
change in revenue, spending or the overall fiscal stance when the 2004 budget was drafted in
September 2003, as they still expected to incur a large deficit in 2003.2 The 2004 budget
contains only few policy measures, including the introduction in January of the VAT (which
was remarkably smooth) and of a new levy on petroleum products to assist in reducing the
debt of NOCZIM, the national oil company. The February decision to move customs
valuation to the tender exchange rate is expected to provide a windfall gain of about
1 percentage point of GDP. The level and composition of expenditure in the 2004 budget
shows little change relative to the supplementary budget for 2003, but all spending categories
related to GDP are higher than the 2003 outcome.3 The budget includes various measures to
strengthen expenditure control and auditing, including the extension of the coverage of the
computerized financial management system and the setting up of a new ex-post auditing unit
in the MFED. In addition, it envisages that all enterprises are to be put on a commercial
footing in 2004, without specific indications on how this is to be achieved. Budget execution
during the first quarter of 2004 resulted in a deficit of 13.4 percent of quarterly GDP, with
the front-loading of the budgeted wage increase (220 percent) in January, and a high level of
non-wage outlays. An arbitrator awarded another 50 percent wage increase to the public
sector in May, retroactive to January.
8.
Loose monetary policy fueled high inflation and a depreciation of the
Zimbabwean dollar in the parallel market in 2003 (Figure 2 and Table 3). Broad money
growth accelerated throughout 2003 spearheaded by an expansion in private sector credit.
This was facilitated by the continuation of a dual-interest rate policy under which credit to
“productive sectors” was allocated at highly negative real interest rates, while other credit
(especially for consumption and real estate purchases) was at market-determined rates. The
availability of cheap credit and inflation-hedging behavior led to a sharp rise in stock and real
estate prices. At the same time, the exchange rate in the parallel market, which was illegal,
but tolerated, depreciated at a fast pace.

2

The 2004 budget was based on the assumption that year-on-year inflation would decline to
175 percent by December 2004, with average inflation increasing to 580 percent.

3

The expenditure side of the budget is difficult to analyze as a large contingency reserve
accounts for 15 percent of total expenditure.

Monetary policy was tightened in late 2003, but this policy was not sustained.
The new Reserve Bank (RBZ) Governor Gono announced measures in December 2003 to
tighten monetary conditions (Box 2) that curtailed access by banks to RBZ liquidity support.
The measures drove up interbank rates, causing stock and real estate prices to plummet and
putting significant stress on the banking system. In response, in early 2004, the RBZ
loosened its stance and started to inject massive liquidity into the financial system through
(i) a Productive Sector Finance Facility (PSFF) at a concessional rate of 30 percent, and (ii) a
Troubled Bank Fund (TBF) with interest rates ranging from 800 to 1,150 percent in effective
terms. The RBZ then began to mop up excess liquidity thus created with new RBZ paper at
effective interest rates of over 900 percent, but at the same time continued to provide cheap
credit through the PSFF. Despite difficulties encountered by a few mostly small institutions
in late 2003-early 2004, the banking system as a whole weathered the economic crisis well
(Box 3).
10.
The introduction of new foreign exchange regulations and a clamp down on
parallel market activities led to a currency appreciation in early 2004 (see Box 2). The
RBZ introduced in early 2004 a managed foreign exchange tender to carry out all foreign
exchange transactions, except for 25 percent of export earnings that have to be surrendered at
a more appreciated rate of Z$824/US$ for the use of the government. At the same time, the
authorities clamped down on the parallel market, notably in the context of a new anticorruption campaign, which led to a sharp reduction of transactions in this market. This

Box 2. Monetary Policy Statements
The authorities target a reduction in inflation (end of year) from 600 percent in 2003 to 200 percent in 2004.
December 2003 statement:
•

Tightened access to RBZ liquidity support and higher reserve requirements effective January 2004
(reserve requirements were increased from 20 to 30 percent for commercial and merchant banks and
from 5 to 15 percent for finance houses).

•

Strengthened prudential supervision by assessing the liquidity position of financial institutions and
imposing stringent conditions before providing liquidity support and/or access to electronic clearing.
Bank licensing authority was transferred from the MFED to the RBZ.

•

Expanded dual interest rate policy: a “Productive Sector Finance Facility” (PSFF) provides credit at
30 percent interest to encourage economic growth, while other credit (for consumption, and real estate)
is at market-related rates.

•

New heavily managed foreign exchange tender (“auction”) since mid-January 2004: foreign
exchange from surrender requirements, liquidation of FCAs and other sources is auctioned twice weekly
by the RBZ. Bids are scanned and bids for non-priority purposes are rejected. Allocations are made at
the bidding price starting from the highest accepted bid. Suppliers receive the average rate paid by
bidders. Bids are reportedly strongly influenced through moral suasion.

•

New surrender requirements for exporters: beginning in early 2004, exporters have to surrender
25 percent of their gross export receipts to the RBZ at the official rate of Z$824/US$1 and another
25 percent to the “auction.” The remaining 50 percent can be retained in foreign currency accounts
(FCAs) for up to 21 days, after which unused foreign exchange has to be surrendered for tender.

•

New capital requirements (based on Basel II) for financial institutions as of September 30, 2004:
the minimum capital requirement was increased from Z$500 million to Z$10 billion (about
US$1.6 million at the end-03 parallel market rate).

April 2004 statement:
•

New export incentives: (i) a guaranteed floor rate of Z$5,200/US$ for exporters at the foreign exchange
tender; (ii) enhanced tax credits for 15 percent of exports; and (iii) a new concessional credit facility for
90-day “post shipment foreign currency bills” at LIBOR+5 percent.

•

Transfers from Zimbabweans abroad to official channels: money transfers through licensed Money
Transfer Agencies were guaranteed the higher of the prevailing tender rate or the floor rate of
Z$5,200/US$1.

•

Marginal amendments to the dual interest rate policy: the PSFF is to be capped at Z$1.5 trillion,
extended from mid- to end-2004 (mid-2005 for exporters who account for about one-third of the
facility), and the interest rate will be raised to 50 percent in mid-year. A new concessional facility
(Z$165 billion) will be offered to parastatals and local government. The RBZ will offer overnight
accommodation at an effective interest rate of “10-20 percent above inflation.”

•

New subsidy schemes for gold and tobacco: A gold support price of Z$71,000/g is available to all
producers. A subsidy of Z$750/kg will be paid for all tobacco delivered to the auction floors.

•

Strengthened regulation of the financial sector: (i) boards of banking institutions need to have a
majority of independent non-executive directors; (ii) shareholders with a stake over 10 percent cannot
be part of the management of a bank or chair the board; and (iii) the ratio of fixed assets to total assets
cannot exceed 25 percent.

- 11 -

resulted in exporters receiving a blend rate (¼ at the surrender rate, ¾ at the tender rate) that
in April was some 40 percent appreciated from the (parallel market) rate at which most
foreign transactions took place in late 2003. After the RBZ’s April Monetary Policy
Statement, the tender rate depreciated somewhat through early May (Figure 3, Appendix II).
Inflows of foreign exchange into official channels have strengthened considerably since late
2003.

Inflation declined in early 2004 as a result of the monetary tightening in 2003
and exchange rates developments. The monthly inflation rate declined to 5 percent in April
2004, from a peak of 34 percent in November 2003, while year-on-year inflation decreased to
505 percent.
12.
The external current account deficit narrowed from nearly 8 percent of GDP in
2002 to 6 percent in 2003. An overvalued official exchange rate, onerous surrender
requirements, and the decline in agricultural production contributed to a 12 percent decline in
recorded exports. At the same time, a critical shortage of foreign exchange in official
channels led to a 15 percent decline in imports.4 In the absence of foreign financing or usable
reserves, the current account deficit was financed by a further accumulation of arrears,
which reached US$2.1 billion, or 44 percent of external debt by year’s end.

4

While food imports were mostly financed by the World Food Program, a sharp decline in
fuel imports occurred due to NOCZIM’s limited access to foreign exchange.

- 12 -

13.
The authorities have made modest moves to liberalize the trade regime. In
conjunction with the introduction of the VAT in January 2004, the authorities abolished the
import duty but retained customs duties and an import surtax on finished goods. As a result,
the Fund’s trade restrictiveness index rating for Zimbabwe has dropped from 8 to 6,
indicating a trade regime only moderately restrictive.5 Intra-regional tariffs were reduced by
5-10 percent in January 2004 for about 3,000 tariff lines with the implementation of Phase II
of the liberalization under the Southern African Development Community (SADC) protocol.6
Discussions on the rationalization of the customs duties are also ongoing in the contex of the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA); the authorities are conducting
an impact assessment study for the setting up of a customs union, which is expected to be
completed by October 2004. Zimbabwe’s commitment under COMESA and SADC are in
conflict since both regional arrangements aim to become customs unions; it is not clear at
this time how this will be resolved.
14.
Progress has been limited in implementing other structural reforms. Most price
controls were removed after May 2003, and the fuel market was partially liberalized in
August. However, civil service reform, enterprise privatizations, and most reforms under the
National Economic Revival Program have stalled. The monopoly of the GMB remains,
which has led to price distortions and made food shortages worse by discouraging
production, preventing private sector imports, and hampering humanitarian assistance. The
government announced a major anti-corruption drive in early 2004, mainly targeting
individuals who transacted in the parallel market in 2003, but this is seen by most observers
as predominantly politically motivated.
15.
Problems relating to the land reform continue to have disruptive effects.7 A
Presidential Review Committee report of October 2003 implicitly acknowledged the failure
to meet the objectives of the fast-track land reform program (FTLRP) launched in 2000, the
difficulties encountered in its implementation, and the economic disruption it created. Actual
resettlement has fallen significantly short of the government’s target and large areas of
productive land lay idle.8 In addition, the weak know-how of new farmers, the destruction of
infrastructure, uncertainty about property rights, and input shortages have lowered
productivity, compounding the impact on agricultural production. Moreover, despite the

reportedly continued, and the government’s powers to take over remaining privately-owned
land as well as farm equipment were expanded in late 2003/early 2004. Independent reports
estimate unemployed former farm workers and their families at 1 million people (8-9 percent
of the population).
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
16.
The policy discussions focused on stabilizing the economy and restarting growth.
The mission urged the authorities to proceed with a sustained tightening of financial policies
and more determined action on the exchange system. While welcoming some of the policy
steps taken since late 2003, including the RBZ’s efforts to strengthen its supervision of
financial institutions, the mission indicated that stronger policies and better cooperation
between the MFED and RBZ were necessary to improve the economic situation.
Furthermore, tackling Zimbabwe’s difficult underlying structural issues, most notably those
related to property rights in agriculture, was essential to improve agricultural production,
food supply and exports, and to restore investor confidence.
A.

Fiscal Policy

17.
Fiscal policy needs to be strengthened urgently to assist in bringing down
inflation, while protecting social spending. The mission argued that, in order to support the
RBZ’s efforts to lower monetary growth, the fiscal stance for 2004 should be tightened to the
extent possible, given the remaining timeframe and the need to address social needs. The
budget implied a deterioration in the primary balance by 4 percentage points of GDP from
the small surplus achieved in 2003. In staff’s view, the authorities should instead make
efforts to increase the primary surplus to allow room for the increase in interest payments
that would result from higher, market-determined, interest rates on government debt
consistent with a tighter monetary policy.
18.
Determined efforts should be made to enhance fiscal revenue. The mission argued
that the unification of the exchange system would facilitate a return of activities to the formal
economy, thereby strengthening the tax base, while the exchange rate devaluation would
increase customs duties. It also recommended an early move to contemporaneous taxation of
profits, and the removal of a number of ad hoc tax exemptions throughout the tax system. At
the same time, the mission suggested to review more frequently income tax brackets to avoid
bracket creep. While the authorities agreed with the need to strengthen revenue, they thought
that time would be needed to reform profit taxation; they also indicated that the surrender
exchange rate could not be abolished because of political considerations.
19.
On the expenditure side, the mission urged the authorities to contain
expenditure while protecting the social sectors. Cost-savings should be considered by
rationalizing government services, including through further outsourcing, and limiting nonessential spending. In addition, the authorities should resist the pressures to award wage
increases beyond what is envisaged in the budget if inflation developments are in line with
budget projections. Furthermore, the mission recommended that the authorities seek early

- 14 -

international assistance to avert large-scale demands on the budget if the 2004 harvest fell
short of food requirements. The staff welcomed the introduction of enhanced expenditure
monitoring and control mechanisms. The authorities appreciated these suggestions, but
indicated that they had no immediate intention to revise the 2004 budget and had no specific
comments on social spending. Regarding the food situation, the government in May canceled
a joint crop assessment with international partners and is reportedly making arrangements for
grain imports.
B.

Monetary Policy

20.
The current dual interest rate policy has resulted in serious distortions in the
economy. Low interest lending has contributed to unduly high rates of monetary growth and
inflation, and there is no evidence that such lending has stimulated production in the
aggregate. Negative real interest rates have eroded savings and undermined the health of the
financial system, especially of institutional investors required to hold government paper with
an effective yield of 150 percent.
21.
Monetary policy should focus more consistently on taming inflation. The mission
stressed the need to review the structure of interest rates to avoid an excessive toll on the
banking system and bring prospective borrowing costs for the government to more realistic
levels. In addition, the mission noted that sharply expanded lending through the concessional
facilities in early 2004 had eroded monetary control.9 The authorities acknowledged this and
indicated their intention to cap the concessional facilities at their end-March level of about
Z$1.5 trillion (equivalent to two-thirds of outstanding bank credit to the private sector) and to
abolish them by the end of the year. Subsequently, the authorities raised the interest rate on
these loans from 30 to 50 percent (from July 2004) but, at the same time, they extended the
loans made to exporters (about ⅓ of the concessional facilities) through mid-2005 and
created new concessional facilities.
22.
The mission welcomed the RBZ’s efforts to strengthen its supervision of
financial institutions, in particular the transfer of bank licensing authority from the MFED
to the RBZ. Higher interest rates have begun to put a strain on the banking system, and loan
performance is likely to deteriorate in the future as financial policies are tightened (Box 3).
The mission and the authorities agreed on the need to monitor provisioning and capital
adequacy on a continuous basis, and to enforce prudential norms. In this regard, the mission
supported some decisive steps taken by the RBZ in recent months (Box 2) and urged the
RBZ to resolve the situation of nonviable institutions. The RBZ indicated a need for
technical assistance in these areas.

9

About half of the PSFF was financed by a drawdown in statutory reserves, the other half
through direct loans from the RBZ to the banking sector.

- 15 -

Box 3. Banking System Vulnerabilities
The size of Zimbabwe’s banking system in real terms has declined significantly in the last few
years (assets fell by 40 percent in real terms in 2003). At end-2003, total assets and deposits of the
banking system amounted to roughly 50 and 23 percent of GDP, respectively. Most banks are in local
private hands, but some of the largest and oldest banks are foreign owned.
Zimbabwean banks continue to show remarkable resilience in the face of adverse
macroeconomic developments (Table 4). Nonperforming loan (NPL) ratios are low (less than
5 percent at end-2003) reflecting largely the negative real interest rates, and most banks report capital
adequacy ratios exceeding the 10 percent requirement. Cost-to-income ratios are low by international
standards, and most banks reported profits in 2003. Profitability mainly reflects high interest margins,
as most banks continue to pay low interest rates on deposits.
The tightening of monetary policy in December 2003 caused some liquidity problems. In early
2004, the RBZ took some decisive steps to deal with a few small insolvent financial institutions by
closing them or placing them under curatorship. However, the liquidity support provided was large
and dear, weakening monetary control and potentially worsening the underlying problems. A few
other banks continue to have liquidity problems, and appropriate mechanisms need to be put in place
to deal with them through recapitalization or closure.
Systemic problems in the banking sector in the next 6-12 months cannot be ruled out. Loan
performance is likely to deteriorate if the concessional facilities are curtailed and the general interest
rate structure is rationalized. These pressures will need to be monitored carefully, and the RBZ should
be ready to deal with possible failures of individual institutions and avoid systemic risks. In
particular, it is essential that provisioning and capital adequacy be monitored on a continuous basis,
and prudential norms enforced.
Corporate governance problems in the banking sector are severe. The RBZ indicated that lending
tends to be concentrated to a few insiders and associated groups of companies, and that interference
of large shareholders with management is common. Some steps were taken by the RBZ in recent
months to address these problems, which are detailed in Box 2. However, further actions are needed.
Moreover, the staffing of the Banking Supervision Department of the RBZ is not sufficient, and
supervisors need better training.
Stress tests indicate that the Zimbabwean banking system is most vulnerable to credit risk (Table 5)
but is practically immune to changes in the exchange rate, as net open positions in foreign exchange
are small.

- 16 -

C.

Exchange Regime, Price Controls and Regulation

23.
Decisive exchange rate action is necessary to reinvigorate exports and contain
import demand. The mission welcomed the move of customs valuation to the tender rate,
but argued that keeping the surrender requirement at an artificially low exchange rate
imposed a heavy tax on exporters. As interim steps to a unified and market-determined
exchange rate, the mission suggested to use the tender mechanism more vigorously, abolish
the surrender requirement, the preferential price granted to small gold miners, and the 21-day
limit on the use of foreign currency accounts,10 and allow the parallel foreign exchange
market to function as a pressure valve. The authorities agreed with the thrust of the staff’s
recommendations for the medium term, but felt that in the short run export incentives should
be provided through ad-hoc support schemes. In April, they implemented some of the staff’s
suggestions (unification of gold price, extension of FCA retention period, and some
depreciation of the tender exchange rate); at the same time, however, they introduced a new
subsidy for tobacco growers and increased tax credits for exports.
24.
The new tender system has added two multiple currency practices (MCP) to the
two existing ones. This is because (i) the rates at which successful bidders are sold foreign
exchange at the same tender can differ by more than two percent, and (ii) the rate used to pay
exporters for tendered foreign exchange (weighted average rate at the tender) can also differ
from the successful bids rates by more than two percent at any tender. The authorities do not
intend to remove these MCPs.
25.
The mission welcomed the elimination of most price controls in mid-2003, which
increased supplies in the official market and enhanced fiscal revenue. It argued that
rolling back remaining price controls, unduly restrictive regulations, and government
intervention in the economy would limit the scope for rent-seeking behavior and corruption.
The authorities stated they were determined to vigorously pursue the new anti-corruption
drive, mainly by pursuing individuals who have dealt in the parallel market. While they
agreed with the mission on the need to focus on the underlying causes rather than the
symptoms of corruption, they indicated no intention to ease the excessive regulations and
economic distortions that have given rise to the parallel market.
D.

Other Structural Policies

26.
Structural reforms are needed to raise productivity throughout the economy.
The mission argued that the government’s intention to promote indigenization throughout the
economy should be based on market mechanisms and implemented in an equitable and fully
transparent manner and within a clear and stable legal framework. The mission shared the
government’s intention to proceed with public enterprise commercialization to reduce the
10

See appendix II for details on the foreign currency retention system.

- 17 -

fiscal burden arising from enterprises’ losses; but it also recommended to resume
privatization, supported by appropriate regulatory changes. As in the past, the staff urged the
removal of the monopoly of the GMB, which has given rise to serious distortions in the grain
market, and recommended better targeting of basic food subsidies to limit their cost and
improve their effectiveness. The authorities were of the view that the monopoly of the GMB
was instrumental in achieving food security and should be maintained.
27.
Problems relating to the land reform should be addressed to halt their disruptive
effect on the economy. The new Land Ministry is preparing a computerized cadastre of
current occupants of agricultural land to detect unwarranted multiple farm ownerships and
correct farm sizes that would be considered excessive. Moreover, the authorities plan to offer
99-year leases or user-permits to farmers, with no provisions for subletting. The authorities
indicated their intention to eventually nationalize all the land, including that protected by
bilateral investment agreements. In the short run, they intend to implement a “Designated
Farm Scheme” through centrally-supported production of wheat and tobacco. The mission
noted that continued uncertainty regarding property rights and poor infrastructure will likely
to limit the effectiveness of such schemes; also, the non-transferability of land leases/user
permits will likely stifle credit access by farmers. More broadly, staff stressed the importance
of addressing the issue of property rights in a way that would restore investor confidence,
including by observing commitments under bilateral agreements.
28.
The mission stressed that rekindling international support and rebuilding
investor confidence would require sound economic policies, strengthening the rule of
law, addressing governance issues, and reducing corruption. While the authorities
accepted the relevance of these suggestions, they argued that Zimbabwe was an economy
under siege and international sanctions limited their room for maneuver.
E.

Relations with the Fund

29.
The Executive Board will be considering the issue of compulsory withdrawal of
Zimbabwe from the Fund. The mission explained to the authorities that Zimbabwe’s
arrears preclude access to IMF resources. The mission urged the authorities to demonstrate
strengthened cooperation by pursuing sound economic policies to address Zimbabwe’s
serious difficulties and lay the basis for regularizing its overdue obligations. The mission
welcomed the authorities’ payments of US$9 million to date in 2004 and their renewed
undertaking to make further small payments of US$1.5 million to the Fund on a quarterly
basis, or more frequently if possible, even though this would not stabilize the stock of arrears.
F.

Statistical Issues

30.
Zimbabwe’s statistical system presents several deficiencies that hamper policy
implementation and the surveillance of economic developments (Appendix IV). The
authorities agreed that it was important to strengthen the coverage, accuracy and timeliness
of economic statistics, which have been adversely affected by insufficient resources devoted
to data collection and analysis and high staff turn over. They indicated their intention to

- 18 -

strengthen the statistical office and set up a working group between MFED and RBZ to
address these issues.
G.

Medium-Term Outlook

31.
The staff has prepared two illustrative scenarios for 2004. The baseline scenario
assumes some further policy adjustments in 2004, but without the rigor of a sustainable antiinflation strategy. In contrast, the adjustment scenario assumes a tightening of policies
consistent with the staff’s proposals from May 2004 onwards, as described above. In both
scenarios inflation would fall from the record high levels of 2003, mostly on account of the
better results achieved so far in 2004, and only temporarily in the baseline scenario as pentup import demand eventually will need to be released.
32.
The medium-term projections are built on the baseline scenario (Table 7). They
assume that after the March 2005 elections the government would undertake a more
determined anti-inflation policy, adopting policies similar to those underlying the adjustment
scenario projections for 2004. Loose fiscal policy before the elections and the release of pentup pressures in the adjustment period would lead to a depreciation of the exchange rate and
would initially push inflation up again in 2005. However, determined financial tightening
through higher interest rates and the achievement of fiscal primary surpluses would bring it
down steadily to the double-digit range by 2007. The associated period of high real interest
rates would not significantly increase the domestic debt (equivalent to 10 percent of GDP in
2003), as long as new domestic financing requirements would remain modest. 11 Credit to the
private sector, however, would contract significantly in real terms during the first year of the
adjustment effort, reflecting the impact of high real interest rates.
33.
The medium-term scenario envisages the vigorous implementation of structural
reforms, particularly the clarification of property rights in agriculture. With normal
weather patterns and a market-determined exchange rate, real GDP growth of at least 45 percent a year could be achieved over the medium term, reflecting a recovery in
agriculture, mining and manufacturing. Assuming that progress is made in cooperating with
international partners, international support could be restored and external debt, including
arrears, restructured in late 2006 under a Paris Club flow rescheduling. The improved policy
framework would unlock the external support that is needed to gradually rebuild foreign
exchange reserves and to tackle pressing social needs by allowing a gradual loosening of the
fiscal stance once inflation is getting under control. The external debt burden would remain
high over the medium term because exports would recover only gradually (Tables 8-9).
34.
There are significant risks in the short to medium term. Political constraints could
lead to a less comprehensive policy adjustment, thus prolonging the economic collapse and
11

The projections do not take into account the possible need for state-funded recapitalization
of banks in case of systemic banking crisis (Box 3).

- 19 -

re-igniting the acceleration of inflation. Even if the authorities were to adopt a
comprehensive policy package, substantial resources will be needed to tackle structural
issues, particularly rebuilding agricultural production and dealing with the HIV/AIDS
pandemic and the poor state of the health and education system. It will likely take
considerable time to rebuild confidence domestically and abroad, and to return the economy
to a path of low inflation and sustained growth.
35.
The staff has also undertaken an illustrative debt assessment exercise
(Appendix V). On the basis of projected end-2005 data, staff has simulated the hypothetical
full use of Paris Club traditional debt relief mechanisms. 12 Zimbabwe’s remaining external
debt would far exceed the thresholds that apply under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.
IV.

STAFF APPRAISAL

36.
The sharp economic decline that Zimbabwe has experienced in recent years
reflects mainly poor policies, including weak financial management, the imposition of
controls, and the adverse effects of the government’s land reform program. Inclement
weather initially also had a negative impact on agricultural production and food security.
These problems have been compounded by concerns over governance, respect for the rule of
law, and corruption. As a result, business confidence has been seriously undermined, leading
to capital flight and emigration. Spillover effects continue to be felt in neighboring countries.
The social consequences have been severe, with a sharp deterioration in many social
indicators that had been among the best in Africa.
37.
The government did not address these problems in 2003. To the contrary, loose
financial policies in 2003 led to a rapid increase in inflation to record high levels and put
pressure on the parallel market exchange rate. The good budget outcome reflected the
beneficial impact of inflation on revenue, while expenditure was held within the nominal
budget authorization despite higher-than-budgeted inflation, reducing public spending in real
terms. Monetary policy accommodated excessive credit demand at artificially low interest
rates, feeding inflation. The parallel foreign exchange market served increasingly as a
pressure valve, allowing exporters to remain competitive and allocating foreign exchange
among competing import demands.
38.
The government’s efforts since late 2003 have focused on tightening the
monetary stance. The measures have been successful in bringing down inflation, at least
temporarily. However, the social dialogue that started in early 2003 has not been continued,
and the government has yet to work out a consistent overall macroeconomic framework that
would help guide policy making.

12

See Table 38 of the statistical appendix for a presentation of Zimbabwe’s external debt by
creditor.

- 20 -

39.
A decisive fiscal effort is required to help reduce inflation on a sustained basis.
Prompt unification of the exchange system and removal of ad hoc tax exemptions would
strengthen revenue mobilization. In addition, the government should exercise strict control
over the wage bill and non-essential spending, while allowing Treasury bill interest rates to
rise and protecting social and infrastructure outlays, including food imports, if necessary.
40.
Monetary policy should be tightened on a more sustained basis to consolidate the
gains made to date in lowering inflation. At the same time, there is an urgent need to
rationalize the interest rate structure and phase out concessional lending in order to contain
credit demand and provide a positive real return to savers. This would help contain the
impact on prices of a market-based exchange rate unification and of removing remaining
price controls. There is also a need to improve the preparation of short-term liquidity
forecasts.
41.
Efforts should be continued to strengthen financial sector supervision,
particularly with regard to provisioning and capital adequacy. The RBZ should be
prepared to deal with weak and unsound banks, and reduce systemic risks. Stronger
supervision, in particular with regard to provisioning and capital adequacy, will help contain
the effects of tighter financial policies and re-instill confidence in the domestic banking
system.
42.
The foreign exchange system should be unified to reduce distortions and
improve external competitiveness. The new foreign exchange tender mechanism has been
heavily managed to date. Instead, the exchange rate should be allowed to respond to market
forces.
43.
Zimbabwe’s trade regime should be further liberalized and exchange
restrictions removed. Zimbabwe maintains a number of exchange restrictions on the making
of payments and transfers for current international transactions and has increased the number
of its multiple currency practices subject to approval under Article VIII. In the absence of a
timetable for their removal, staff does not recommend their approval.
44.
The authorities should urgently address structural impediments to improve food
security. The GMB monopoly should be removed and well-targeted basic food subsidies put
in place. The government’s decision in early May to abort the joint crop assessment was
disappointing and left the authorities without a basis for a timely appeal for food aid.
45.
Structural policy reforms focusing on increasing production and raising
productivity throughout the economy are critical to restart economic growth. Restrictive
regulations should be removed to bring more activities into the formal economy, and the
government’s promotion of indigenization should be based on market principles and
implemented in an equitable and fully transparent manner. In addition, the prompt
commercialization and eventual privatization of public enterprises, supported by appropriate
regulatory changes, would help reduce the fiscal burden on the government and improve
service delivery.

- 21 -

46.
Consistent with the aims of their anti-corruption campaign, the authorities
should focus more on the root causes of corruption rather than its symptoms. Price
distortions, numerous sector-specific incentive programs, and preferential access of a few to
cheap foreign exchange distracts from productive activities and provides significant
opportunities for rent-seeking behavior.
47.
Problems relating to the land reform should be addressed to halt their disruptive
effects on the economy. In particular, the clarification of ownership rights is crucial to
raising agricultural production and facilitating access to credit for farmers.
48.
A successful implementation of the reforms described above requires a
resumption of external support, which is currently limited to humanitarian assistance.
In this regard, the authorities should seek to normalize relations with external creditors and
formulate a plan for the elimination of external payments arrears. Restoring international
assistance, attracting foreign investment, and dealing with Zimbabwe’s mounting external
debt will require, inter alia, the adoption of sound economic policies, stronger governance,
and improvements in the rule of law.
49.
Efforts should be intensified to address deficiencies in the statistical system that
hamper policy implementation and the surveillance of economic developments.
50.
It is proposed that the next Article IV Consultation with Zimbabwe be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ Ratings refer to CAMEL ratings by the RBZ.
2/ ROA and ROE are calculated as a ratio of profit for 2003 to assets and equity, respectively, for end-2003.
Given the rate of inflation in 2003, they are likely to be overestimates of the true ROA and ROE by roughly a
factor of 2.

4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments devided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Nominal U.S. dollar GDP adjusted for real growth and international inflation (1996 base year).
7/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

APPENDIX I

HIV/AIDS Pandemic

Incidence. Zimbabwe has one of the highest HIV/AIDS prevalence rates in the world, currently
estimated at 24.6 percent of the adult population (aged 15 to 49 years) and reaching 35 percent in
some areas. The 2003 HIV/AIDS report, prepared jointly by the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare
(MOHCW) and the United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), estimates that some
1.8 million Zimbabweans were living with HIV, over half of them women. Zimbabwe had around
800,000 AIDS orphans in 2003. Some 206,000 new HIV infections and 174,000 new AIDS cases
were reported in 2003. The total number of AIDS-related deaths during 2003 was estimated to reach
171,300, close to 500 each day. Life expectancy has declined from around 60 years in 1997 to below
40 years since 2001.
Impact on the health sector. The overall macroeconomic decline and the emigration of health
professionals have severely constrained health sector operations. In addition, the HIV/AIDS
pandemic has exerted an unbearable pressure on hospitals and other health centers. About 80 percent
of the hospital beds are occupied for AIDS-related illnesses. The MOHCW estimates the annual cost
of anti-retro viral (ARV) treatment, excluding equipment and other overheads, at US$260-300. The
shortage of foreign currency, however, is constraining the availability of ARV drugs. Currently 5,000
AIDS patients receive ARV treatment, while estimates of people in need of such treatment vary from
260,000 to 500,000. Under the WHO’s 3 by 5 program, the plan is to provide ARV treatment to
200,000 patients within the next 2 years. Given the current state of the health sector and the financing
constraints, it is not clear how the target can be achieved.
HIV/AIDS and the food situation. Chronic food shortages and inadequate nutritional standards
continue to have an adverse impact on the health of AIDS patients and have created a vicious cycle of
malnourishment and disease. Land reform has displaced more than a million commercial farm
workers and consequently worsened food security and the traditional home-based health care services
provided on farms. As the pandemic has significantly affected the agriculture sector, food insecurity,
HIV/AIDS, and low labor productivity are reinforcing each other.
Government strategy to combat HIV/AIDS. The government has adopted a multi-sector strategy
headed by the National Aids Council (NAC), which coordinates all government treatment,
prevention, and impact mitigation efforts. Each ministry has assigned focal persons for AIDS to
ensure effective communication with the NAC. At present, the government runs 21 voluntary
counseling and testing (VCT) centers. An ARV program started with two centers in Harare and
Bulawayo. The AIDS levy, a 3 percent surcharge on taxable income, was introduced in 2000 and
serves as the main source of funding for the NAC; collections amounted to Z$15 billion in 2003. The
NAC allocates its fund through 87 District AIDS Councils (DAC) based on their delivery capacities
and previous track records. The government is also expecting US$14 million from the UN Global
Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, and has applied for another tranche of US$80 million. The
Global Fund allocation will be used to strengthen education, home-based care, and ARV treatment.
However, transparent guidelines need to be put in place to ensure that the criteria for receiving the
ARV treatment are not driven by political considerations. The effectiveness of the government’s
strategy to combat HIV/AIDS is constrained by a lack of health professionals and limited.

APPENDIX II

Zimbabwe has been in continuous arrears to the Fund since February 2001. On September
24, 2001 the Executive Board declared the country ineligible to use the general resources of
the Fund and removed it from the list of PRGF-eligible countries. On June 13, 2002, the
Board issued a declaration of non-cooperation with respect to Zimbabwe and suspended all
technical assistance to the country. On June 6, 2003, the Board suspended Zimbabwe’s
voting and related rights in the Fund. On December 3, 2003, the Board noted that it was
intended to initiate the procedure on compulsory withdrawal with respect to Zimbabwe.
Subsequently, the Managing Director issued a complaint regarding Zimbabwe’s persistent
failure to fulfill its obligations on February 6, 2004, and the Board decided to place the
complaint on its agenda for substantive consideration on July 7, 2004.
VIII.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

The authorities maintained a fixed exchange rate regime and surrender requirements during
2003 in the face of rising domestic inflation and declining exports. As the currency became
increasingly overvalued, a vibrant parallel market developed that was illegal but tolerated,
and inflows into the official market virtually dried up. Ad-hoc measures were implemented
during the year to compensate and to provide incentives to exporters.
•

The official exchange rate for government transactions remained at Z$55/US$, but
that for non-state entities was devalued to Z$824/US$ in March 2003.

•

Exporters were required to surrender 50 percent of proceeds (net of debt service on
foreign loans) at the exchange rate of Z$824/US$; they were allowed to retain the
remainder in foreign currency accounts (FCAs) for a maximum period of 60 days.
From July 2003, exporters were exempted from surrender requirements on
incremental exports.

•

Tobacco farmers were paid at the official exchange rate of Z$824/US$. Initially, they
were not allowed any retention but later in the year a retention amount of 20 percent
was introduced through the Tobacco Growers Trust.

•

The 50 percent that exporters were allowed to retain had to be deposited with the
RBZ and its utilization was limited to a priority list of imports and subject to RBZ
approval.

•

As the overvaluation in the official market grew, so did the parallel market. Towards
the end of 2003, the currency was trading at Z$6,000/US$ in this market.

In recognition of the onerous nature of the surrender requirements and to increase foreign
exchange inflows in official channels, the authorities announced a new exchange regime in
December 2003 and made further minor changes in April 2004. The new exchange regime
allows the exchange rate to be determined through a heavily managed tender system
(“auction”). Surrender requirements were eased, but the parallel market was sharply curtailed
and driven underground. Key features of the new regime are:
•

A tender system operated by the RBZ to sell foreign exchange twice a week.
Authorized dealers submit detailed bids on behalf of customers, including such

- 42 -

APPENDIX II

transaction information as intended use of foreign exchange and approval number by
the RBZ. An RBZ committee scans the bids and eliminates those that are for nonpriority purposes. The rest of the bids are admitted to the tender system and allocated
foreign exchange on the basis of price. The tender system is price discriminatory in
nature in that successful bidders actually pay the price they bid for the foreign
exchange and not a uniform price.
•

A floor exchange rate of Z$5,200/US$ is guaranteed to exporters and transfers from
the diaspora since late-April 2004.

•

A carrot and stick retention scheme has been introduced. This scheme reduced
surrender requirements to 25 percent of gross export proceeds at the rate of
Z$824/US$ and provided incentives for export prepayments. Exporters also surrender
a percentage of their gross proceeds to supply the tender; the percentage varies
largely according to the time lag between export and receipt of payment.

•

The RBZ uses foreign currency surrendered at Z$824/US$ for government and
NOCZIM imports. Other parastatals source their foreign exchange needs from the
tender system (or payments in foreign exchange in the case of ZESA).

•

Retention period in FCAs is reduced to 30 days from 60 days. The priority list for the
use of FCA deposits has been abolished and procedures for obtaining RBZ approval
for imports have been simplified.

•

A whistleblower fund has been instituted to punish those that engage in parallel
market dealing. Several arrests have been made.

After an initial appreciation of the tender rate from Z$4,197/US$ in mid-January to
Z$3,520/US$ in early February, the tender rate depreciated to Z$5,272/US$ at end-April.
However, there has been a substantial appreciation of the average exchange rate since late
last year because of the clamp down on the parallel market. The authorities have welcomed
the dampening impact this has had on inflation. They are managing the tender system in a
way that does not allow the tender rate to fully reflect market forces.
As a result of this system, Zimbabwe currently has restrictions on the making of transfers and
payments for current international transactions, and multiple currency practices, inconsistent,
respectively, with Article VIII Sections 2(a) and 3 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement.
Zimbabwe maintains multiple currency practices (MCP) arising from the lack of a
mechanism to prevent a divergence of more than 2 percent between (i) the exchange rates in
the official and parallel markets, (ii) the exchange rates applicable for private sector imports
and government imports, (iii) the exchange rates paid by successful bidders in the same
tender, and (iv) the exchange rate used for surrender of export receipts (weighted average
rate from each auction) and the other rates in the exchange market. Zimbabwe also maintains
exchange restrictions arising from (i) limitations on the availability of foreign exchange, in
the form of priority lists that limit the provision of foreign exchange for certain specified
transactions which are subject to the approval of the RBZ, and (ii) the existence of private

- 43 -

APPENDIX II

sector external payment arrears inconsistent with Article VIII Section 2(a). These restrictions
and MCPs have not been approved by the Board.
Staff was informed of the existence of bilateral payments arrangements with Fund members,
which may raise issues of compliance by Zimbabwe with Article VIII obligations. Staff was
unable to obtain relevant materials, but is continuing to seek information from the authorities
in order to reach a conclusion on these issues. Exchange restrictions arising from certain
outstanding contracts under a discontinued RBZ scheme for foreign exchange cover have
been discontinued.
IX.

Article IV Consultation:

Zimbabwe is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation
was concluded on June 6, 2003 (EBM/03/53).
X.

Technical Assistance:

The Executive Board suspended Fund technical assistance to Zimbabwe in June 2002. Past
Fund technical assistance to Zimbabwe is summarized in the attached table. A long-term
advisor sponsored by MFD provided assistance in the area of banking supervision between
August 1996 and October 1999. Another MFD expert on monetary operations provided
advice to the RBZ and trained staff in the implementation of open market operations and the
use of repurchase agreements during October 1998 – October 2000. A third MFD expert on
the payments system, who also advised the RBZ on the array of monetary instruments to be
used to monitor and manage liquidity in the financial sector, completed a one-year
assignment in October 1999.
XI.

Resident Representative:

A resident representative office was opened in July 1993. Mr. G. G. Johnson’s term as Senior
Resident Representative expired at end-September 2003. The office has remained open with
local staff, and there are plans to close the office at end-September 2004.

APPENDIX III

Zimbabwe: Relations with the World Bank Group14
Zimbabwe went on nonaccrual (i.e. disbursements are suspended) status in October 2000. Arrears to
the Bank as of April 27, 2004 amounted to US$275.6 million. A resumption of lending would be
contingent upon clearance of arrears. The scale of the Bank’s subsequent reengagement will depend
on progress on governance and macroeconomic stability. Currently, the Bank engagement in
Zimbabwe is limited to technical assistance and analytical work, primarily on macroeconomic policy,
agriculture policy, social sector expenditure and social service delivery mechanisms, and HIV/AIDS.
At the present time, the Bank is preparing an Interim Strategy Note to outline the Bank’s role in
Zimbabwe over the next 12-month period. The Strategy will focus on knowledge building, enhancing
partnerships with in-country stakeholders including responsive parts of government, civil society and
donor community, and facilitation of in-country dialogue on priority policy issues all in preparation
for “re-engagement”. Zimbabwe will have access to grant funds through a Trust Fund designated for
countries in nonaccrual to support activities discussed in the Interim Strategy Note expected to be
presented to the Bank Board of Executive Directors in September 2004.
The Bank continues to be active in maintaining a dialogue with donors, including (i) co-chairing
quarterly donor coordinating meetings in Harare; (ii) contributing to UN thematic teams (chairing the
Economic and Poverty Reduction Thematic Group); and (iii) providing technical advice to various
UN initiatives, such as agriculture sector development, food security, and others.
Currently, the Bank does not have any active projects in Zimbabwe.
Zimbabwe had historically been one of the IFC’s largest portfolios in Africa and hosted a strong
private sector, with promising indigenous entrepreneurs complementing an established business
community. The IFC’s portfolio totals US$24.9 million disbursed as of October 2003, with a
concentration in the financial sector. IFC’s current priorities are closely monitoring the existing
portfolio and assisting companies with IFC investment in managing the current economic crisis. The
IFC has provisioned investments substantially in Zimbabwe, in anticipation of losses.

APPENDIX IV

Zimbabwe: Statistical Issues
The economic and financial statistics database in Zimbabwe is inadequate, its quality is
deteriorating, and data provision to the Fund is not timely. While some monetary data are
of adequate quality, foreign reserves are not reported in a meaningful fashion by the Reserve
Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), data on external arrears are not reported systematically, and
budgetary and monetary data are reported to the staff with a substantial lag. The Central
Statistical Office (CSO) conducts several sectoral surveys, but GDP data are reported with a
substantial lag and harbor major inconsistencies. There are also shortcomings in external
trade and finance data, and no information is available about unemployment and wages.
Zimbabwe participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) project for
Anglophone African countries. Metadata for Zimbabwe (posted on the Fund’s Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board in November 2002) indicate the country’s plans for improvements
in macroeconomic, financial, and sociodemographic statistics. However, in the absence of
technical assistance, and funding, progress in improving the quality, coverage, and timeliness
of Zimbabwe’s statistical base is likely to be slow.
Real sector
National accounts. The CSO benefited from substantial technical assistance from the Fund,
the World Bank, and the United Kingdom in 1996-97. This allowed the CSO to publish
revised national accounts in late 1997, covering the period 1985-96, with 1990 as the base
year for constant price estimates. STA provided a peripatetic advisor to assist with the
improvement of real sector statistics in 2001, but these efforts were discontinued because of
the deteriorating security situation. While the revised national accounts are a significant
improvement over the previous estimates, the coverage of economic activity in the informal
sector remains poor. National accounts data for 2001 were not published until March 2004,
and had inconsistencies between sectoral developments and other activity indicators, which
are currently being considered.
Prices, production, labor. The CSO produces a monthly consumer price index. In 2001, the
base year was changed from 1990 to 1995, using new weights based on a 1995-96 household
survey. A manufacturing index is reported with a 1990 base, but with a significant lag. Data
on employment and wages, which had very limited coverage, are no longer published. A
comprehensive labor market survey is long overdue. No information is available on
unemployment.
Fiscal sector
Key weaknesses continue to impair the analysis of fiscal developments and the formulation
of appropriate adjustment policies. Monthly revenue and expenditure data for the central
government are available with a lag of 6 to 8 weeks. There are discrepancies between the
budget financing need (computed from the income/expenditure side) and financing data from

- 47 -

APPENDIX IV

banking and other sources. In addition, a significant part of donor-financed development
expenditure is off budget, the economic classification of expenditure is insufficiently
disaggregated, and a functional classification of expenditure is not available. Large quasifiscal operations by the RBZ and significant contingent liabilities, including in the form of
loan guarantees, are not systematically reported.
The authorities do not provide Fund staff with budget data according to organizational
classification on a regular basis. They also provide limited access to source data, so staff has
to rely on aggregated data of unverifiable quality. Also, the operations of the social security
fund and several self-financing funds under the purview of the central government are not
included in reported data. Furthermore, although operating targets for public enterprises are
provided occasionally, it is still not possible to compile reliable consolidated accounts for the
nonfinancial public sector, since financial operations of public enterprises are neither
reported nor audited regularly, the accounts of local governments become available only with
a lag of several years, and consolidated general government accounts are not compiled.
The latest published data in the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) Yearbook are for 1997.
No more recent fiscal data have been provided for publication in International Financial
Statistics (IFS).
Financial sector
Significant progress has been made in developing a unified system for reporting monetary
statistics to the Fund based on international standards of data classification, and in improving
the collection and reporting of financial data. However, there continues to be some difficulty
in reconciling the balance sheet of the RBZ provided in the monetary control program with
the monetary survey. More recently, an issue has emerged with respect to the accounting for
financial bills issued by the RBZ in the monetary data. The monetary control program used to
be available within two weeks of the end of each month, and the monetary survey was
produced within six-eight weeks of the end of each month; recently, delays in submitting
these data have increased to 2-3 months. In addition, serious deficiencies were found in the
data reported to STA. Specifically, in the central bank accounts, negative figures are recorded
for gold (May 2003) and SDR holdings (May, June, and September 2003). In the commercial
banks accounts, negative figures are recorded for commercial bank bills payable (OctoberDecember 2003).
External sector
There is a pressing need for the authorities to compile and provide comprehensive external
sector data on a more timely basis.
The trade balance in goods is still being reported with lags of more than four-five months,
even though, following the installation of the new Automated System for Customs Data
(ASYCUDA) at the customs department, data are being provided by customs to the CSO
within seven days of the end of each month. Private remittance inflows have become

- 48 -

APPENDIX IV

significant in recent years, but the authorities report only the remittances received through
official channels, which are miniscule.
Compilation of capital and financial account transactions suffers from considerable delays,
and there is a significant lag in reporting balance of payments data to the Fund. The RBZ
provides estimates of the balance of payments for surveillance purposes, but these require
substantial adjustments. Measures are also needed to improve the estimates and shorten the
lag in the compilation and reporting of such data. Balance of payments data published in the
IFS and Balance of Payments Yearbook are even less timely—the latest data are for 1994, as
annual data through 2001 provided for publication are of questionable quality. Data on shortterm external debt are reported to the Fund by the RBZ with a one- to two-month lag.
External debt data (by debtor/creditor) are forthcoming only with a considerable lag and
information on the terms and maturity profile of the external debt is not systematically
available from the authorities. The authorities have provided staff only with partial
information on the extent of their collateralized external borrowing.
There are no data available on Zimbabwe’s international investment position.
Because of encumbrances on reserves, official reserve data are not reported to the Fund in a
meaningful manner. From time to time, the RBZ provides data on “usable reserves.”
Sociodemographic data
The CSO produces various sociodemographic statistics, offering information on population,
the provision of health and education services, and indicators of poverty. However, since the
data are usually collected through infrequent surveys and population censuses, the
information provided in these statistics is often outdated.

APPENDIX V

Illustration of Zimbabwe’s External Debt Situation
With Zimbabwe’s economic collapse, the debt situation has worsened. Foreign exchange
shortages have led to a cessation of external debt repayments beginning in 2000. External
arrears are estimated to amount to US$1.8 billion, or 44 percent of the total debt by end2003. Exports have fallen by a cumulative 45 percent since their 2000 peak. The outlook is
expected to worsen in 2004, and any subsequent recovery in exports will likely be gradual.
The bleak debt outlook indicates a need for future debt relief. For illustrative purposes,
staff estimated the potential effect of full use of traditional debt relief mechanisms on
Zimbabwe’s debt, simulating a hypothetical stock treatment on Naples terms by bilateral and
commercial creditors at end-2005 (a rescheduling of all ODA debt and a two-thirds reduction
in the stock of non-ODA debt). The simulation assumed policy adjustments in 2005 and a
recovery in exports. The NPV-to-exports ratio would be reduced from a projected
322 percent of exports before debt relief at end-2005 to 215 percent after the simulated relief.

Broad money grew by 400 percent in the year to May 2004, largely driven by credit
to the private sector (Figure 2). Credit was boosted by very large increases in credit from the
Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) to domestic money banks under the highly concessional
productive sector finance facility. Regarding liquidity management, at end-March 2003 the
RBZ stopped issuing the 900-percent effective interest rate paper that it had used to mop up
liquidity. When large amounts of the RBZ paper started falling due in mid-June 2003, the
RBZ introduced a new liquidity management policy. Contrary to the staff’s advice to move
to market-based policies, the RBZ now compulsorily converts any surplus in the money
market at the close of each day into new “open market” treasury bills with much longer
maturities (up to 2 years) than that of the bulk of outstanding treasury bill (90 days) and at
negative real interest rates (nominal effective rates of 70-100 percent).
4.
Usable gross official reserves increased from US$18 million at end-2003 to
US$76 million at end-May 2004, in response to the clampdown on the parallel market, which
brought back foreign transactions into official channels, and with the beginning of the
tobacco season in April. Reflecting the heavy management of the tender system, the tender
rate, which had depreciated somewhat in March and April 2004, has remained largely
unchanged since then at around Z$5,350/US$, even though demand has increased (Figure 3).

-2-

The exchange rate in the parallel market reportedly depreciated to over Z$6,000 in mid-June
2004, probably as a response to the widening gap between supply and demand of foreign
exchange at the tender (Figures 2 and 3).

The fiscal deficit widened through April 2004, as an increase in revenue collection
was more than offset by higher expenditure. This resulted in a cumulative deficit over the
first four months of the year of 18 percent of GDP, up from a revised deficit of 17 percent of
GDP in the first quarter. Little additional detail is available.
6.
In early June 2004, Zimbabwe made payments of US$1.5 million to the World Bank
and US$1.2 million to the African Development Bank, in line with the RBZ’s recent policy
to begin making some payments on arrears to multilateral creditors other than the IMF.
7.
In other developments, on June 10, 2004, the government closed down an
independent weekly newspaper. Ahead of the general elections in March 2005, the
government has reportedly accepted the election guidelines drawn up by the South African
Development Community (SADC) which recommend that voting take place in a single day,
under the supervision of a new electoral commission.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Zimbabwe
On July 7, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Zimbabwe.1
Background
Zimbabwe’s social and economic conditions have continued to deteriorate, mainly reflecting
inadequate economic policies and structural changes that weakened the economic base.
In particular, the disorderly implementation of the land reform program has contributed to a sharp
reduction in agricultural production. Concerns about governance, the rule of law and human rights,
and the continued lack of clarity about property rights have severely damaged confidence,
discouraged investment, and promoted capital flight and emigration, thus contributing to the
economic decline. Unemployment is very high and increasing, social indicators have worsened,
and the widespread HIV/AIDS pandemic remains largely unchecked. Severe food shortages
have necessitated massive food imports and donor assistance.

Real GDP declined by 9.3 percent in 2003 and another broad-based decline is projected this
year. Year-on-year inflation reached 600 percent during November 2003-February 2004.
However, monthly inflation, which had reached 34 percent in November 2003, fell to 5 percent
in April 2004 following a tightening of monetary policy and an appreciation of the exchange rate.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during
the July 7, 2004 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

-2Monetary policy was loose and fueled high inflation in 2003, but it has been tightened in recent
months, albeit not consistently. Broad money growth increased to 400 percent in December
2003, spearheaded by an expansion in private sector credit of above 520 percent. During the
first two months of 2004, the Reserve Bank injected the equivalent of two-and-a-half times the
money stock at end-2003 through liquidity support to some banks and a concessional facility at
a highly negative interest rate aiming to support “productive” sectors. Soon after, however, it
began to mop up at high interest rates the excess liquidity that was created that way.
Fiscal operations were almost balanced in 2003, but the 2004 budget is expansionary, with a
deficit target of 7.3 percent of GDP. Expenditure fell sharply in real terms in 2003 as wages
were eroded by inflation, the domestic interest bill declined owing to negative real interest
rates, and other government spending was constrained by shortages of foreign exchange and
the weakening administrative capacity. The budget deficit rose to 13.4 percent of quarterly GDP
in the first quarter of 2004, following a 220 percent wage increase in January and a catch up in
current and capital spending.
The external current account deficit narrowed to 6.0 percent in 2003, from 7.3 percent in 2002.
In the absence of foreign financing, arrears continued to accumulate to reach US$2.1 billion, or
44 percent of external debt. The average exchange rate in the economy strongly appreciated in
early 2004. This resulted from the introduction of a heavily managed foreign exchange tender
system in January and the clamping down on the parallel market, where the bulk of foreign
exchange transactions took place in 2003. In April 2004, the average exchange rate was some
40 percent appreciated relative to the parallel exchange rate at end-2003. The tender rate
depreciated somewhat in early May.
Progress has been limited on structural reforms. Most price controls were removed after
May 2003 and the fuel market was partially liberalized. However, other reforms, including civil
service reform and privatization, have stalled, and problems relating to the land reform program
and property rights continued to affect adversely economic activity.
Zimbabwe has incurred overdue financial obligations to the Fund since February 2001. Arrears
to the Fund totaled SDR 197 million as of end-April 2004.
Executive Board Assessment
They expressed grave concern over the continued sharp economic decline and high inflation in
Zimbabwe, which are having dire consequences for the country’s population―notably rising
unemployment and the rapid deterioration of social indicators―that in the past were among the
best in Africa. They regretted that a cycle of malnourishment and disease has developed, and
that the sharp fall in agricultural production has led to continued food insecurity, while one in
four adults is HIV-positive.
Directors saw the crisis as resulting mainly from inappropriate macroeconomic and structural
policies, including weak financial management, distortionary controls and regulations, and the
disorderly implementation of the fast-track land reform. External factors have compounded the

-3effects of these policies. More broadly, Directors regretted that weak governance, corruption
and the lack of respect for the rule of law have undermined confidence and led to capital flight
and emigration, with negative spillover effects on neighboring countries.
Directors noted the government’s efforts in 2003 to tighten the monetary stance. However, most
Directors considered that the policies implemented to tackle the crisis have been inadequate
and unsustainable. They strongly urged the authorities to adopt a comprehensive policy
package aimed at halting the deterioration of the socio-economic situation, restoring confidence
and donor support, and restarting growth on a sustainable basis.
Directors expressed concern about the expansionary budget for 2004 as well as the recent
deterioration of the fiscal situation, and stressed that a decisive fiscal effort is needed urgently
to help ease inflationary pressures. They advised the government to exercise strict control over
the wage bill and non-essential spending and, at the same time, to do their utmost to protect
social and infrastructure outlays and food imports if necessary. It will also be important to
reduce quasi-fiscal activities, better target subsidies, and eliminate ad hoc tax exemptions in
order to strengthen revenues.
Directors considered that reducing inflation should be the authorities’ main priority and called for
a sustained tightening of monetary policy. In this context, they stressed the urgent need to
contain the growth of credit—in particular, credit at preferential, non-market interest rates—and
to improve short-term liquidity management. Directors emphasized the importance of
eliminating the current system of dual interest rates, which has led to serious distortions in the
financial system, including disincentives to savings. They urged that market forces be permitted
to determine interest rates and that concessional lending to selected borrowers be phased out.
Directors encouraged the authorities to step up their efforts to strengthen financial sector
supervision, particularly with regard to provisioning and capital adequacy. They advised the
Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe to prepare for the restructuring of weak and unsound banks, and to
reduce systemic risks, including those associated with the concentration of lending among few
firms. Directors considered that stronger supervision will be essential to help contain the effects
of tighter financial policies and instill confidence in the domestic banking system.
Directors observed that the foreign exchange system continues to be affected by distortions
caused by government intervention and burdensome surrender requirements. They called for a
unification of the exchange rate to fully reflect market factors and improve external
competitiveness, as well as for the removal of surrender requirements.
Directors encouraged the authorities to further liberalize the trade regime. They regretted that
Zimbabwe maintains exchange restrictions on payments and transfers for current international
transactions as well as multiple currency practices. They urged the authorities to establish a
timetable for the removal of the restrictions and the elimination of the multiple currency
practices.

-4Directors strongly recommended that the authorities address the impediments to improving food
security, including by replacing the monopoly of the Grain Marketing Board with well-targeted
basic food subsidies. They expressed concern over the food security outlook for the coming
year and noted the government’s decision in early May to abort the crop assessment prepared
together with the World Food Program. They regretted that this decision leaves Zimbabwe
without a basis for a timely appeal for food aid, with serious humanitarian consequences should
the crop fall short of the government’s ambitious estimates.
Directors regretted that there has been little progress in the area of structural reform.
They emphasized that reforms focusing on increasing production and raising productivity and
restoring respect for the rule of law remain critical for helping instill confidence and restarting
economic growth. Directors recommended the removal of restrictive regulations to bring more
activities into the formal economy, and the eventual privatization of public enterprises to reduce
the fiscal burden and improve service delivery. They also advised the authorities to pursue anticorruption efforts more vigorously by focusing closely on the roots of corruption, namely the
numerous economic distortions that provided rent-seeking opportunities, rather than on its
symptoms.
Directors urged the authorities to address in a transparent and orderly manner problems relating
to land reform. They stressed that the clarification of tenure rights will be crucial for raising
agricultural production and facilitating access to credit for farmers.
Directors took note of the authorities’ request for resumption of technical assistance, which was
suspended by the Executive Board in 2002. Staff will continue to provide policy advice to help
the authorities formulate and implement a comprehensive and consistent package of measures
in the context of the Article IV consultation discussions.
Directors stressed the need to address growing deficiencies in the statistical system that
hampered the analysis of economic developments, policy formulation and implementation.
Directors also reviewed Zimbabwe’s overdue obligations to the Fund. They considered the
resumption of partial payments by Zimbabwe to the Fund in 2004 as a positive step, but
regretted that this will be insufficient to stabilize arrears. They called on the authorities to take
more decisive actions to improve cooperation with the Fund by adopting economic policies to
address Zimbabwe’s serious economic problems, and by significantly increasing payments to
the Fund. They agreed to consider again the Managing Director’s complaint regarding
Zimbabwe’s compulsory withdrawal from the Fund within six months.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries)
concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member
countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex
post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after
Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in
a particular case. The Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation with the Zimbabwe is also available.
