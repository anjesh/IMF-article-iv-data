IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation Discussions with People’s
Republic of China—Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
On January 6, 2017, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation discussions1 with Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR),
and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal without a meeting on a lapse-of-time basis.2
With a soft global trade environment and a downturn in tourism arrivals from Mainland China,
Hong Kong SAR’s growth rate is expected to have slowed to 1.5 percent in 2016. Growth is
likely to pick up modestly to about 2 percent in 2017, with private consumption continuing to be
a main driver supported by a steady labor market. The current account surplus remained below 3
percent of GDP, and is projected to improve to around 3.5 percent over the medium term as the
global economy recovers.
With a more challenging external environment, with the U.S. rate cycle moving up, global trade
growth tepid and Mainland China rebalancing, the growth recovery may be gradual. Over the
longer term aging pressures may weaken the structural fiscal position, requiring fiscal planning
to alleviate the decline; and a housing supply shortage also needs to be tackled.
Prudent fiscal policy and intensive supervision of the financial system have built buffers that can
be drawn on to weather a less favorable environment. Fiscal reserves amount to 35 percent of
GDP or 23 months of expenditures and the net international investment position is positive at
355 percent of GDP. The banks are capitalized well above Basel III levels; liquidity cover and
the use of stable funding have increased. The Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) provides a
credible anchor for a small open economy with a large globally integrated financial services
industry exposed to cross-border flows.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A
staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic
developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board.
2 The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse-of-time procedure when the Board agrees that a proposal can be considered
without convening formal discussions.

Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2016 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR), Executive Directors endorsed staff’s appraisal, as follows:
Growth and outlook. Growth has slowed since 2015 and the external outlook is more challenging
with the U.S. rate cycle is edging up, global trade growth tepid and mainland China rebalancing.
With soft external conditions, the growth recovery is likely to be gradual with the output gap closing
slowly. Over the medium term population aging pressures may affect potential growth and weaken
the structural fiscal position. On the upside, the economy is highly flexible and large potential can
be tapped from the further development of Hong Kong SAR as a global financial center. Strong
policy frameworks and ample buffers are in place to weather a less favorable environment. Prudent
fiscal policy and intensive supervision of the financial system have built buffers that can be drawn
on when needed. The Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), provides a credible anchor for a small
open economy with a large globally integrated financial services industry.
There are three main risks. Growing economic linkages mean that changes in mainland China’s
growth prospects spill over to Hong Kong SAR’s financial and real sectors. With a large globally
integrated financial sector and a currency board arrangement, the economy is exposed to U.S.
developments and global market volatility. The property market is also a source of downside risk.
With strong buffers in place these risks are manageable and should not adversely affect the
economy provided that, as anticipated, interest rates rise at a moderate pace and mainland China’s
transition to a more sustainable growth path remains orderly.
Fiscal policy. As the main demand management lever, fiscal policy needs to strike a balance
between supporting aggregate demand and preserving a buffer for the longer-run challenge posed
by aging. In the near term with a significant and persistent output gap, a difficult external
environment, and weak automatic stabilizers, there is a case for further fiscal impetus which can be
removed as the economy recovers. The planned impulse in the 2016–17 Budget is appropriate but if
it undershoots and growth remains weak, additional stimulus will be needed in fiscal year 2017–18.
Aligning short-term fiscal measures to long-term goals and shifting spending forward would help
ensure that cyclical support does not exacerbate the long-term fiscal trend.
Long-term fiscal challenges. Early follow-through on the recommendations of the 2014 Report on
Long-Term Fiscal Planning—reviewing and reprioritizing expenditures to measures that boost labor
participation and support growth, raising revenues and managing assets would help alleviate the
fiscal impact of aging. Measures to broaden the tax base may also be needed. The aim for balance
and keeping overall government expenditure growth in line with GDP growth over the medium
term is appropriate, while taking early action to alleviate the structural deficit problem. A drawdown
of the fiscal reserves could be accommodated as the economy adjusts, but a positive fiscal buffer is
desirable to cope with adverse shocks, provide room for countercyclical fiscal policy, and sustain
confidence.

Property market measures. With renewed signs of overheating in the property market, the three
pronged approach to limiting risks—boosting housing supply, macroprudential measures to limit
stability risks, and stamp duties to contain speculative activity and external demand— is well
placed. Current macroprudential settings have done their job of limiting financial system exposure
to the asset price boom and LTV and DSR settings should remain unchanged. Stamp duties can be
an effective part of the toolkit to stem excessive price increases and speculation in the real estate
market. As the distorting costs of duties become more significant the higher they are, they should be
rolled back once the trend has shifted toward reduced price and speculative pressures.
Housing supply. The Long-Term Housing Strategy and Hong Kong 2030+ are aimed at addressing
the housing shortage in an integrated manner by guiding land, planning and infrastructure
development. Accelerating plans to increase supply, speeding up processes, making land available,
bringing forward public investment would be a double win—tackling the housing problem and
supporting the economy at a time of soft growth.
Financial sector policies. The robust regulatory and supervisory framework should help limit the
buildup of systemic vulnerabilities. The authorities have a track record as a global standard setter in
regulation and supervision and in addressing data gaps. Substantial progress has been made on
implementing the 2014 FSAP recommendations. An independent insurance authority has been
established, strengthened standards for securities listing have been implemented, and legislation has
been put in place for a resolution framework for financial institutions which is designed to
implement the Financial Stability Board’s Key Attributes. There is substantial coordination among
government and regulators domestically, there are close links with mainland regulators and the
authorities are active in international fora, including in supervisory colleges for cross border
banking and insurance groups, on global systemically important financial institutions, and in crisis
management groups. Areas for continued attention include further enhancing stress testing and
reviewing financial institutions’ plans in response to stress events.
Exchange rate regime and external position. The LERS remains the best arrangement for Hong
Kong SAR backed by the credibility built up over three decades and tested through crises. The
LERS is underpinned by the flexible economy, ample reserves buffers and strong financial
regulation and supervision. Wage and price flexibility allows the economy to adapt quickly to
cyclical conditions and structural change. The external position is broadly in line with medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policies.
Contingency planning. As a trading hub and global financial center, the economy is inevitably
exposed to global external shocks. In the event of an adverse shock, a comprehensive and
coordinated policy approach similar to the 2008/9 response would be appropriate: including large
fiscal stimulus, loosening of macroprudential policies, expanded credit guarantees, emergency
liquidity provision and close international supervisory coordination. The recently introduced crisis
resolution framework is strengthening the ability to respond to strains in the banking, corporate and
household sectors

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
DISCUSSIONS

KEY ISSUES


Overview. The vibrant Hong Kong SAR economy has been supported by low interest rates
and mainland China’s economic development over the past decade. But the external outlook
is now more challenging. Long-term issues such as aging and a housing supply shortage also
loom. Strong policy frameworks and ample buffers are in place to weather a less
favorable environment. Prudent fiscal policy and intensive supervision of the financial
system have built buffers that can be drawn on when needed.



Policies. To address the challenges and provide a platform for sustained growth:
 Fiscal position. A fiscal impulse broadly in line with the 2016/17 budget, and some
additional next year, to support the economy through subdued conditions.
 Long-term fiscal challenges. Early follow-through on the recommendations of the
2014 Report on Long-Term Fiscal Planning—reviewing and reprioritizing
expenditures to measures that boost labor participation and support growth,
raising revenues and managing assets to help alleviate the fiscal impact of aging.
 Exchange rate regime. The strong policy framework of the Linked Exchange Rate
System, together with flexibility and ample buffers, should be preserved.
 Property market. The three-pronged strategy to the property market (boosting
supply, macroprudential policies to manage risks, and stamp duties to contain
speculative activity and external demand) should remain in place.
 Financial sector policies. The robust regulatory and supervisory framework should
help limit the build-up of systemic vulnerabilities. Exposures to mainland China and
rapid growth of the asset management industry continue to merit close supervisory
attention. Enhancing stress testing and reviewing financial institutions’ plans in
response to stress events are crucial for maintaining financial stability.
 Potential. There are opportunities to further develop Hong Kong SAR’s role as a global
financial center building on its comparative advantages.

services, tourism, trading and logistics, and
professional and other producer services—account for over half of GDP and employ just under half
of the workforce. Financial services accounts for around 18 percent of value added but just 7 percent
of employment.
2.
Prolonged low interest rates and mainland China’s economic development have
supported growth and credit over the past decade. With positive spillovers from mainland China,
growth has averaged 4.1 percent between 2005 and 2013 and unemployment has remained low.
Credit grew rapidly, house prices nearly tripled between 2008 and 2015 for the mass market and
doubled for the luxury segment.
3.
But growth has slowed since 2015 and the outlook is more challenging. The U.S. rate
cycle has turned up, global trade growth is tepid and mainland China is rebalancing. Post-election
uncertainty about U.S. economic policies has been accompanied by market volatility which may also
weigh on trade and financial conditions. Domestically, the tide also appears to be turning with the
financial cycle past its peak and swings in the housing market—with a price correction in the early
part of the year followed by resurgent demand. In a longer perspective (though no less urgent), the
economy needs to adapt to population aging and mainland China’s move up the value chain and a
shortage of housing supply relative to demand needs to be addressed.
4.
Strong policy frameworks and ample buffers are in place to weather a less favorable
environment. Prudent fiscal policy and intensive supervision of the financial system have built
buffers that can be drawn on when needed. The Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) provides a
credible anchor for a small open economy with a large globally-integrated financial services industry
that is exposed to cross-border portfolio shifts. Fiscal buffers and a positive net international
investment position (35 percent and 315 percent of GDP, respectively) enable the economy to
navigate shocks. Wage and price flexibility allows the economy to adapt quickly to cyclical
conditions and structural changes. The strong regulatory and supervisory framework is aimed at
limiting the build-up of systemic vulnerabilities.

The real economy has been operating below trend:



Subpar growth. Growth has been below potential since the beginning of 2015 and is expected to be
around 1.5 percent in 2016. An anemic global trade environment and a sharp downturn in tourism
arrivals from mainland China over the past two years have depressed retail spending, private investment
and exports. The decline in tourism has shown signs of bottoming out since the middle of the year and
consumption has turned around alongside rebounding house prices. Nonetheless, business activity
indicators, retail sales, and consumer confidence continue to point to a slow recovery (Figure 1).



Labor market steady. Labor market quantity
indicators have been resilient to slower growth.
The unemployment rate stayed at 3.4 percent in
Q3 and employment has remained robust, though
vacancies have declined. Public construction
investment appears to have supported
employment. Earnings growth has adjusted,
slowing to 3.8 percent in 2016:H1 from 4.3
percent in 2015:H1. CPI inflation has remained
contained at 2.1 percent (y/y) in October.



Subdued external sector. The real exchange rate has appreciated at a more moderate pace in 2016, in
line with the U.S. dollar. After January’s volatile external financial conditions, market sentiment improved
and the Hong Kong dollar returned to the strong side of the convertibility undertaking. The current
account surplus narrowed to around 2.6 percent of GDP in 2016:H1, and goods trade remained subdued
in Q3.



Equity markets. The Hang Seng index fell to a four-year low in February 2016 following concerns about
China’s growth outlook. More recently, Brexit, post-U.S. election volatility and December’s Fed rate hike,
and the imposition of higher property stamp duties also triggered brief market declines, but equities are
currently 20 percent higher than February’s trough.



Capital flows moved with market volatility.
Portfolio investment outflows increased substantially
in 2015 as residents and nonresidents reduced their
equity and investment fund holdings following the
stock market decline. This reversed in 2016:H1 as
markets stabilized, and equity and bond inflows have
increased since August. However, the shift in
expectations from RMB appreciation to depreciation
has continued to lead to a sharp reduction in offshore
RMB liquidity with deposits down by about 35
percent from the 2014 peak.

Fiscal position. With a softer economic outlook, the 2016/17 Budget included measures to support small
and medium-sized enterprises, incentives for the tourism industry, tax cuts and an increase in social security
allowances. A fiscal impulse of 1.6 percent of GDP is projected by the authorities for 2016/17, although the
actual impulse may fall short of this, as revenues usually out-perform forecasts.
Signals from the financial cycle are mixed (Figure 2):



Credit growth has slowed. Lending for use outside
Hong Kong SAR fell back in 2016:H1 as mainland
Chinese residents repaid external debt, but has since
recovered. Domestic lending for wholesale, retail and
manufacturing contracted while mortgages and
personal loan growth was relatively subdued until the
summer. Measures of the credit cycle point to a still
positive but narrower credit gap. And respondents to
the HKMA Opinion Survey expect a further decline in
loan demand.



But the property market has rebounded. Residential house prices fell by more than 10 percent in the
early part of the year following the first Fed rate hike and amid uncertainty about mainland China’s growth
prospects. But prices have since recovered and were just 3.3 percent off the peak in September. Transactions
also bounced back with the monthly average in August to October almost doubling compared to the first
seven months of this year (Figure 3). The rebound followed growing market conviction, post Brexit, that the
pace of U.S. rate tightening would be gradual. House price valuations still look over stretched—with staff
models and user cost measures pointing to overvaluation of around 10–20 percent. To contain speculation,
in November, the authorities sharply raised the ad valorem stamp duty for residential property transactions
to a flat rate of 15 percent from a scale of 1.5–8.5 percent, affecting all nonresidents and residents owning
more than one property (see Appendix IV). This took steam out of the market, with shares in property
developers falling on the news.



The cost of credit is compressed. Price indicators are liquid and competition among mortgage lenders
has resulted in mortgage rates being lowered in 2016 and are currently about 2 percent.

Strict macroprudential measures have contained bank exposure to the property boom.
Since 2009 limits on loan-to-value ratios, debt service-to-income ratios, higher risk weight floors on
property loans, and interest rate buffer stress tests have helped contain exposures. Banks continue
to maintain healthy liquidity profiles (the liquidity cover ratio rose to 158 percent in 2016:Q2) and
high capital buffers with a CET1 ratio of 15.8 percent. In line with Basel III, The HKMA will raise the
countercyclical capital buffer (CCYB) to 1.25 percent of total risk weighted assets from January 2017.
The HKMA’s assessment is that indicators still point to a positive credit gap and a need to continue
to raise the CCYB towards the Basel III maximum of 2.5 percent.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK
8.
With soft external conditions, the growth recovery is likely to be gradual. Private
consumption will remain the main driver in the near term, accounting for more than a half of overall
growth, supported by a steady labor market. Overall growth is projected to pick up from 1.5 percent in
2016 to 1.9 percent in 2017; the output gap closes slowly.


Interest rates rise in line with a gradual U.S. rate tightening cycle.



World trade picks up with global growth, but is unlikely to achieve pre-crisis rates.



Growth in mainland China in the near term is steady but moderates over the medium term.



Credit growth remains moderate and following the increase in stamp duties, house prices ease back
in an orderly manner, steadily reducing the overvaluation gap. With a small correction in house prices
in 2017, credit growth is likely to remain at around 4 percent in 2017.



Consumption is supported by a steady labor market, but is partly offset by falling house prices as the
overvaluation gap erodes. Investment is supported by public infrastructure though the private
investment outlook is subdued.



Based on the 2016/17 Budget, and adjusting for revenue performance in line with past trends,
little additional fiscal support is projected for this year and next (Table 3, Appendix I). However,
further fiscal measures and support may be needed in the 2017/2018 Budget if growth remains
soft and the global external environment remains difficult (paragraph 28).

Authorities’ Views
10.
Outlook. The authorities generally agreed with the staff's assessment that the economy
could attain further moderate growth next year, notwithstanding an outlook clouded by
uncertainties. Fiscal stimulus in the last few budgets was able to provide relief to those at the lower
end of the income scale and support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) thereby alleviating
uncertainty and creating a stable environment. Looking ahead, private consumption and ongoing
infrastructure spending would help maintain momentum and support employment. In addition, the
resilience of the economy, marked by highly efficient and flexible markets, robust regulatory
framework, and sound macroeconomic policy, would enable Hong Kong SAR to sail through the
challenges. The authorities were confident that the continuous rebalancing of the Mainland would
lend further opportunities and stability to Hong Kong SAR's economy. Over the medium-term, an
aging population could impinge on growth, but continued development of Hong Kong SAR as a
global financial center, investment in infrastructure and fiscal buffers would help offset the effects.

RISKS TO THE OUTLOOK
11.
There are three main risks. Growing economic linkages mean that changes in mainland
China’s growth prospects inevitably spillover to Hong Kong SAR’s financial and real sectors. With a
large globally-integrated financial sector and a currency board, the economy is also exposed to U.S.
developments and global market volatility. The property market is the main domestic source of
downside risk. On the upside, the economy is highly flexible and large potential can be tapped from
the further development as a global financial center (see Risk Assessment Matrix, Appendix II).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—HONG KONG SAR

Mainland China’s Bumpy Transition or Slow Reform
12.
Connections with mainland China’s economy and the financial sector are important for
future growth but also add risk transmission channels. A bumpy mainland China transition to
sustainable growth would feed through the tourism, trade and financial channels.
13.
Tourism and trade contribute significantly to activity and employment. A further slowdown
in tourism and trade would dent retail sales, logistics and wholesale warehousing. SME links to mainland
China are high, and a downturn in profitability combined with higher interest rates could stretch their debt
servicing capacity.
14.
Financial linkages have intensified over the past decade. Bank lending to mainland China plus
trade finance account for around half of Hong Kong SAR banks’ lending. RMB internationalization,
equities market linkages, securities issuance by mainland corporates and asset management activity have
all grown.


Banking system exposure to mainland banks. External claims on onshore Chinese banks remain
sizeable at HK$1.5trillion (62 percent of GDP) (Figure 4). The mainland is the largest systemically
important source of potential shock to interbank markets. Banking sector exposure through lending
and bond markets expanded rapidly over 2010–2014 as the offshore renminbi market developed and
activity was spurred in part by steady gains from RMB appreciation plus the limited options for RMB
investments. From late 2014, the change in RMB outlook, lower funding costs onshore, and a fall in
RMB deposit pool offshore, led to a scale back in lending to mainland banks. However, the position
stabilized in 2016:Q2 and more recent data points to modest pickup in lending to onshore banks
once again.



Banking system exposure to mainland nonfinancial corporates. Hong Kong SAR banks’ nonbank
China exposure—a broad measure including lending, off-balance sheet items and trade finance to
mainland Chinese firms and overseas firms operating there—remains close to its historically-high level
of HK$4.6 trillion (187 percent of GDP). After increasing rapidly since 2010, the rate of growth has
eased since 2015 as mainland companies began to repay foreign currency debt, but the level of
exposure is still high. HKMA analysis suggests that leverage has been increasing for nonlocal
corporates (i.e., mainland China and overseas) since the Global Financial Crisis, and debt at risk is
higher than for domestic firms. Still, the HKMA’s stress tests suggest that the potential credit loss for
Hong Kong SAR banks from a China growth slowdown remains manageable. Staff’s analysis (Selected
Issues Paper 1) provides support for this view, though banks should remain alert to rising credit risk.1,2,
o

Hong Kong SAR banks currently have less direct exposure to riskier mainland corporates than the
average of A shares. Based on staff's analysis, debt at risk could amount to 9 percent of Hong



The HKMA has required banks to maintain
prudent lending standards. Hong Kong
SAR banks' focus on large state-owned
enterprises (SOEs), multinationals
operating in mainland China and Hong
Kong SAR-based conglomerates suggests
that they are also not lending to the
weakest listed corporates. A significant
proportion of the loan book is also
backed by bank guarantees or secured by
collateral.
However, continued caution and
monitoring remain warranted. Conditions
across banks vary. Some banks are more
exposed to mainland SOEs and others to the
private sector. While SOEs may enjoy an
implicit government guarantee, this may
not always be available—for example, as
a result of SOE reform in the mainland.
The analysis is based on current rather
than stressed conditions. If the global
environment deteriorated, nonlocal
corporates’ earnings would be hit and the
impact on the real economy could be
sizeable, with second-round knock-on
effects on the banks.

Offshore RMB market. Hong Kong SAR is the
premier offshore RMB center and the net
provider of liquidity to other markets (Figure 5).
Around 70 percent of the global value of RMB
settlement is handled by banks in Hong Kong
SAR. This has been facilitated by market
infrastructure including an RMB real time gross
settlement system, the provision of liquidity
facilities, and CNH-HIBOR fixing. This market
should continue to grow further over the
medium term as RMB internationalization
continues and mainland China opens up. However, RMB activity has contracted since August
2015 following the shift in expectations from RMB appreciation to depreciation and with lower
cross-border trade settlement. Spikes in the CNH-HIBOR rates in January, September, and
December 2016 illustrate the potential for volatility and pressures to emerge with thin liquidity
or changes in mainland management of capital outflows.

The asset management industry has expanded rapidly with total assets under management almost
tripling over the past seven years, although values steadied in 2015. Combined fund management
business amounted to HK$17.4 trillion in 2015 and the proportion of assets managed in Hong Kong
SAR rose to 55.7 percent of the total, or equivalent to about 50 percent of total banking assets. The
authorities are promoting the development of Hong Kong SAR as a global full-service asset
management center to enable investors to manage complex risks—including from mainland onshore
activity—through risk management products, hedging and derivatives. Legal and tax changes have
been made to encourage global corporate treasuries, the private equity industry and open ended
funds to domicile in Hong Kong SAR. Continued development of asset management is important for
future growth (paragraph 46) but it will also heighten the sensitivity of capital flows to global shocks
or shifts in Chinese investor sentiment.

Authorities’ views
15.
Bank exposures to mainland China banks and corporates. The authorities viewed the
mainland China-related risks as manageable. Their heightened attention to the risks introduced four years
ago spurred the monitoring of a broad range of exposure indicators to capture all the mainland-related
linkages, and had required banks to maintain prudent lending standards. Frequent credit reviews had
allowed HKMA to remain attuned to possible vulnerabilities. They agreed that the downturn in the credit
cycle and slowing in mainland China’s growth could prove to be a test over the next two years. Thus far,
the classified loan ratio of mainland-related lending had remained low (less than 1 percent in June 2016).

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—HONG KONG SAR

Mainland lending exposures were typically directed to large SOEs and multinational corporates whose
income streams tended to be diversified and balance sheets more insulated from specific mainland Chinarelated factors. Moreover, the introduction of the stable funding requirement and countercyclical buffers
meant the banks were well positioned to absorb materializing risks.
16.
RMB offshore business. The authorities attributed the decline in RMB activity to a temporary
cyclical shift in expectations from RMB appreciation to depreciation. This resulted in a tightening of
liquidity which had led to occasional temporary spikes in the CNH-HIBOR rates. While the episode in
January was pronounced and related to uncertainty about the Mainland's growth prospects, September
and December's spikes were more contained. In fact, the Hong Kong SAR market remained a net provider
of liquidity in the offshore RMB market as a whole, lending RMB to banks in other centers such as
Singapore and London. To facilitate the smooth and efficient operation of the offshore RMB money
market in Hong Kong SAR, the HKMA had recently expanded the number of primary liquidity providers in
the RMB offshore market and its scale; and had introduced disclosure of the usage of intraday and
overnight RMB liquidity facilities. Over the longer term asset allocation to the RMB would continue to rise
as mainland China continued to open up, and inclusion of the RMB in the SDR basket had been an
important step in carrying this forward.
17.
Asset management industry. The authorities viewed the orderly functioning of markets through
episodes of turbulence in mainland China's markets as an indication of the resilience of Hong Kong SAR's
financial system. More broadly, Hong Kong SAR's economy would benefit by continuing to play its pivotal
role as the financial hub and intermediary between mainland China and the rest of the world, as a place to
manage onshore China risks, and as an international asset management and offshore RMB center. To
make this a success, the authorities were focused on ensuring that the regulatory regime keeps pace and
is resilient to fast moving and challenging market conditions. Work was underway to enhance asset
management regulation in respect of securities lending and repurchase agreements, custody of fund
assets, liquidity risk management and disclosure of leverage by fund managers.

U.S. Rate Cycle and Global Market Volatility
18.
Rising U.S. interest rates. A gradual,
anticipated rise in U.S. interest rates should not unduly
dampen domestic demand; and the steepening of the
U.S. yield curve following the presidential election has
not affected confidence thus far, Hong Kong SAR
interbank rates and major trading partner bilateral
exchange rates have been broadly stable. Following
Fed rate hikes, consumption typically grows at an
orderly but slower pace. However, an unanticipated
tightening of stance could have a bigger-than-usual
adverse impact on consumption and domestic
demand given the high level of household debt and low income growth. The leverage and debt service
ratio of nonfinancial corporates in Hong Kong SAR has also been rising since 2010, and prolonged low
interest rates may have encouraged them to take on excessive foreign exchange risk, with external debt
by nonfinancial corporations rising from 30 percent of GDP in 2010 to 80 percent in 2015. U.S. rate hikes

Property Market
20.
With a persistent housing supply shortage and high levels of demand, the property market
has faced a number of boom bust cycles. The rebound in the housing market since the summer has
further stretched valuations. Relatively high household debt levels (66 percent of GDP) and high income
gearing heighten the risk of an accelerated house price adjustment should interest rates rise faster than
expected. Sensitivity to interest rate changes is also likely to be high with over 90 percent of new
mortgage loans on floating interest rates. While the debt service index eased to 44 percent in 2016:Q2,
sensitivity tests show it would rise sharply to around 60 percent in response to a 300 basis point interest
rate shock. Although the buffers built up following macroprudential tightening is likely to ensure that the
financial system would be resilient to a sharp house price adjustment, there is a risk to the real economy
from an adverse spiral of negative wealth effects, lower collateral values, slower credit growth and weaker
household spending.
Authorities’ Views
21.
Global financial conditions. While expecting a gradual pace of monetary policy tightening by
the U.S. Fed, the authorities viewed the possibility of a faster-than-expected rise in Hong Kong SAR long
yields as a material risk. If this resulted in capital flows out of emerging markets and a heightening in
financial market volatility, it would have further knock-on effects to Hong Kong SAR’s domestic economy.
In aggregate, banks’ liquidity coverage ratios were at a high level and had increased over time. Recent
stress tests also showed that banks typically were holding highly liquid instruments, suggesting that they
could withstand a sudden capital outflow. Banks’ asset quality was healthy and banking sector capital
remained well above minimum international standards.
22.
Property market risks. The authorities agreed that the financial sector was relatively well
insulated from shocks to the housing market, following seven rounds of macroprudential measures and
the use of stamp duties to curb speculative and external demand. A correction in the property market
would have effects on the real economy but such effects would differ across economic and property

market cycles and would be difficult to measure.
23.
Spillovers from the U.K or Europe. Although the banking system had not been much affected
by the Brexit vote, the role of the U.K. banking system in distributing international banking flows and the
linkages between the financial systems of Hong Kong SAR and the United Kingdom meant that
developments were being closely monitored in case of international spillover risks. Similarly, the
authorities were monitoring developments in European banks.

Amplification of Risks

Under a severe low-probability scenario growth would fall sharply. In a low-probability
scenario, heightened policy uncertainty in the U.S., Europe, and the United Kingdom could reduce global
growth and be accompanied by a hard landing in mainland China.

would also hit fiscal outturns, as they are relatively dependent on property-related revenues.

-6

25.
While vulnerability to shocks is high, there are large buffers to cope with adverse events.
Fiscal reserves are 35 percent of GDP and foreign exchange reserves cover seven times currency in
circulation and around 48 percent of Hong Kong dollar money supply. Banks’ liquidity and high capital
buffers should help contain the exposure of the financial system to adverse shocks—although they do not
neutralize the effect on the real economy. The IMF’s FSAP stress tests (2014) found that the banking sector
was sufficiently capitalized and liquidity risks were low.
Authorities’ views
26.
The authorities considered an adverse scenario a low probability event. Substantial buffers
were in place to weather a severe shock. As a small open economy with a large financial sector, they had
in place contingency planning to ensure crisis preparedness and they were well placed to coordinate both

domestically and internationally (see paragraph 43). The financial system was significantly better placed to
cope with external shocks than it was at the time of the Asian Financial Crisis, although overall economic
activity would inevitably slow.

POLICIES TO SUPPORT THE RECOVERY
Fiscal Policy: Near-Term Space, Longer-Run Challenge
27.
Context. Fiscal policy is the main demand management tool, since monetary policy is determined
through the direct link to U.S. interest rates through the currency board (LERS). Fiscal policy therefore needs to
support economic stabilization, when there is a sizeable output gap and when external demand is weak. With
a comfortable level of fiscal reserves, there is scope for near-term support which can be removed as the
economy recovers (Figure 6). However, over the longer run the structural fiscal position will weaken as the
economy faces rapid population aging with one in six people currently 65 or above rising to one in three by
2034. Pensioner poverty and inequality are also issues that the government is tackling. Fiscal policy needs to
balance near-term needs against the longer-term weakening of the structural fiscal position and the
commitment, enshrined in the Basic Law, to preserve low taxes and fiscal prudence. This can be achieved by
aligning short-term fiscal measures to long-term goals and shifting spending forward to help ensure that
cyclical support does not exacerbate the long-term fiscal trend.
Near-Term Fiscal Policy
28.
There is a case for a fiscal stimulus given the soft economic outlook, sizeable output
gap, and difficult external environment. The planned fiscal impulse of around 1.6 percent of GDP in the
2016‒17 Budget is therefore appropriate and there would be room for further easing in 2017/18, possibly to
total a cumulative 2 percent of GDP over the two fiscal years. However, based on past conservative
performance, staff’s baseline projection is that the actual fiscal impulse will turn out to be lower than this and
close to zero in 2016/17 as a result of both overachievement of revenues (which has been a persistent trend,
given conservative forecasts) and underachievement of expenditures. If growth remains weak, additional
discretionary stimulus would be needed in 2017–18. A fiscal package in line with staff’s proposal would still
leave fiscal reserves at a comfortable level of around 30 percent of GDP in 2021 and public debt close to zero.
Measures could comprise:


support to vulnerable households, and the elderly, in the lower income deciles, for example through
allowances, rental relief and measures to help keep women and elderly workers connected to the
workforce (which would also help the long-run position);



support for small businesses which has been effective in previous Budgets; and



bringing forward capital spending to boost housing supply and accelerate urban renewal, to the extent
feasible.

Long-Term Fiscal Challenge
29.
An aging population could lead to structural
fiscal deficits within a decade. The labor force will start
declining after 2018 and population aging is most marked
through to 2045. Rapid population aging will create rising
demands for social expenditure and could potentially
lower growth and fiscal revenues. Without policy changes,
the structural fiscal balance is likely to weaken and
deplete the fiscal reserves buffer. These challenging
demographics set in against a backdrop of already
slowing potential growth in a maturing economy that is
close to the knowledge frontier.

Efforts should concentrate on tackling the
impending structural deficits. Under current policies,
structural deficits could set in soon and remain in place
beyond the end of the demographic transition. Recurrent
spending tied to aging could represent an additional cost
of 155 percent of GDP over the next 85 years, or 1.9 percent
of GDP in constant equivalent flow per year.

implementation should start as soon as possible since the demographic transition will be frontloaded.
Moreover, early measures will have the largest cushioning effect as they rein in spending at lower levels.

tied to labor participation such as tax deductions for child bearing and education.
32.
Long-run fiscal anchor. The aim for fiscal balance and keeping overall government expenditure
growth in line with GDP growth over the medium term is appropriate, while taking early action to alleviate
the structural deficit problem. A drawdown of fiscal reserves could be accommodated as the economy
adjusts, but a positive fiscal buffer is desirable to cope with adverse shocks, provide room for
countercyclical fiscal policy, and sustain confidence in fiscal strength, the Hong Kong dollar and monetary
stability.
33.
Measures to boost GDP growth can also help stem the deterioration in the fiscal position. A
recommendation of the WGLTFP was to set up a Future Fund, to allow a portion of fiscal reserves to be
directed to longer-dated, higher-return investments. Rather than conducting purely financial investments,
the Future Fund could also be channeled to local real investments in physical and human capital. Tax
policies to encourage labor participation, particularly among women and the elderly and to promote active
aging are also key. Sustaining a flexible economy and continuing to have an “open doors” policy and
integrate foreign workers are also important. Directing more resources towards the provision of land for
construction could have a large impact on growth, although current constraints are often not financial but
at the regulatory, procedural and planning stages.
34.
Monitoring and communication of the long-term fiscal challenge should be stepped up.
Producing an independent report every three to five years that updates projections, takes stock of
measures undertaken and discusses options, would help demonstrate progress and educate the public on
the long run fiscal challenge. It would also illustrate how the authorities balance out long-term concerns
against the justified short-term concerns of providing support to the economy and helping those at the
bottom of the income distribution. The report could follow the model of Australia’s intergenerational
reports or the European Union’s Aging Report.
Authorities’ Views
35.
The authorities agreed that fiscal policy must balance short-term needs with longer-term
structural headwinds from population aging.


Near term. The last few budgets had featured considerable supporting measures—in particular,
infrastructure investment and transfers to households in particular—that successfully shielded the
economy from growing uncertainty and helped to sustain high employment, while inflation remained
contained. The fiscal impulse in the current budget was seen as appropriate, but further easing could
be considered in the forthcoming 2017/2018 Budget if external conditions remained challenging.



Longer term. The authorities were considering policy options to address population aging, while
adhering to the principles for fiscal policy set out in the Basic Law. The establishment of the Future
Fund would also help generate higher returns on investment. An important part of the policy response
to aging would be to maintain economic flexibility and open to foreign workers and to creating
incentives to encourage higher labor participation. With respect to fiscal policy, they had already
initiated a program within the government to contain the growth of government expenditure and
would proceed with expenditure reviews and a reprioritization of spending. Measures to broaden the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—HONG KONG SAR

tax base could also be considered. Maintaining a positive fiscal reserve position was important to retain
the credibility needed to operate countercyclical fiscal policy. They were open to the idea of periodic
reporting on long-run fiscal sustainability but noted that this would be an intensive exercise and they
would need to consider the resource costs, frequency and the scale.

Preserving Strengths
36.
The exchange rate regime has been supported by coherent and strong policy frameworks
that help the economy adapt to changing global conditions. The LERS is underpinned by the flexible
economy, ample fiscal and reserve buffers and strong financial regulation and supervision. These features
anchor the stability of Hong Kong SAR’s small open economy and its large, globally integrated financial
services industry.


Exchange rate regime. The LERS has been in place for thirty-three years, has been tested through
crises, and remains the best arrangement for Hong Kong SAR. The supporting institutional and policy
frameworks, including the preservation of fiscal and reserves buffers, ensure the smooth functioning of
the currency board. The link to the U.S. dollar is appropriate, given that Hong Kong SAR is most
affected by trade and financial flows between advanced economies and mainland China rather than just
the fluctuations of the Mainland economy.



Flexibility—through labor, product and asset markets—is critical to the successful operation of the
LERS, enabling speedy adjustment through relative prices in the absence of the nominal exchange rate
channel. This is important given that U.S. dollar appreciation may initially reduce Hong Kong SAR’s
competitiveness. Staff’s study shows that at an aggregate level Hong Kong SAR’s prices and wages
adjust more strongly than in either the United States or the United Kingdom (selected Issues Paper 2).3
The industry level evidence also points to flexible adjustment with downward wage rigidity less binding
in Hong Kong SAR than in the United States.

External sector assessment. The structure of Hong Kong SAR’s trade has been adapting to the
shift in China’s trade patterns and capital account liberalization, with the trade-in-goods surplus switching
to a deficit and the trade-in-services deficit to a surplus (Figure 7). The structural current account surplus is
now significantly lower (a current account surplus norm of around 1–4 percent of GDP), and the current

account surplus is projected to remain in the 2–4 percent of GDP range over the medium term (Selected
Issues Paper 3).4 The July 2016 External Sector Report concluded that the external position was broadly in
line with medium term fundamentals and desirable policy settings. Since then the real effective
exchange rate has remained broadly stable, and analysis through October 2016 delivers the same
results (see Appendix III).
Authorities’ Views
38.
The authorities emphasized that the LERS remained the cornerstone of the financial system
and the best monetary arrangement for Hong Kong SAR. Stability played an important role in
supporting Hong Kong SAR’s role as a trading and financial center. The credibility of the LERS had
stood the test of time through a number of global crises and was supported by a sizable net international
investment position, prudent fiscal policy and a flexible economy. The anchor to the U.S. dollar remained
most appropriate as it is the most commonly used currency in international trade and for cross border
financial transactions, and given the depth, breadth and liquidity of U.S. dollar denominated transactions
and low inflation track record. They viewed the exchange rate as being in line with fundamentals. They
noted that the current account surplus had narrowed since the GFC not because of a loss in
competitiveness arising from the currency board but because of several structural factors including
subdued global trade flows and the external rebalancing of mainland China. The authorities concurred with
staff’s work which showed that wages and prices were flexible when compared with international peers.
Following the introduction of the statutory minimum wage in May 2011 the labor market had still remained
broadly stable. Wage and price flexibility had enabled the reallocation of resources across sectors without
costly disruptions to activity.

PROTECTING FINANCIAL SYSTEM RESILIENCE
Financial System
39.
The robust regulatory and supervisory framework should help limit the build-up of
systemic vulnerabilities. The authorities have a track record as a global standard setter in
regulation and supervision and in addressing data gaps. Substantial progress has been made on
implementing the 2014 FSAP recommendations (see Appendix V). An independent insurance
authority has been established and the new risk-based capital regime for insurance companies is
being put in place which will take two to three years to complete. The process of strengthening
standards for securities listing is underway. Legislation has been put in place for a resolution
framework for financial institutions which is designed to implement the Financial Stability Board’s
Key Attributes—an impressive step forward. The HKMA has stepped up guidance and monitoring of
bank lending activities, including to mainland China and for property-related activities; is closely
checking liquidity risks; and is encouraging banks to reinforce cyber security. Coordination among
Government and regulators in the Financial Stability Committee promotes discussion of risks that
could transmit across the financial system. The authorities have close links with mainland regulators

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—HONG KONG SAR

and are active in international fora, including supervisory colleges for cross-border banking and insurance
groups, for global systemically important financial institutions, and in crisis management groups.
40.
Countercyclical prudential policy. Although credit growth has slowed, there is still a positive
credit gap. Risks from high corporate leverage and the housing market have not subsided but may
actually increase as U.S. interest rates rise. Thus the authorities’ plan to raise the countercyclical buffer
(CCYB) to 1.25 percent from January 2017 and up to the Basel III maximum appears appropriate. The
CCYB could be paused or reversed only once the credit gap is eliminated and it becomes apparent that
there has been a clearly established change of trend and financial cycle downturn.
41.
While the financial system is resilient and prudential policy settings are appropriate, with
an uncertain external setting, heightened attention is advisable in several areas:


Completing the strengthening of the nonbank oversight regime.



Further enhancing stress testing and risk analysis across the financial system. This could include
complementing the individual risk analyses of the HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission and
the Insurance Authority, with coordinated work in line with emerging best practices.



Continuing to increase coordination among regulators, especially on liquidity monitoring, as new
markets grow.



Reviewing financial institutions’ plans in response to stress events globally or in mainland China.



Continued efforts to enhance transparency related to legal persons and trusts and effective
implementation of anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism controls in line
with the 2012 Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance (AMLO) and international standards underpin Hong
Kong SAR’s reputation as a premier global financial center.

42.
Contingency planning. In the event of a large adverse shock, a comprehensive and coordinated
policy approach similar to the 2008/9 response would be appropriate, combining fiscal stimulus,
loosening of macroprudential policies, expanded credit guarantees and HKMA emergency liquidity
assistance. Strong collaboration among regulators and counterparts in other jurisdictions would be
needed to monitor cross-border risks and provide liquidity support and backstopping of liabilities. The
recently introduced crisis resolution framework is strengthening the availability of tools and ability to
respond to strains in the banking, corporate and household sectors.
Authorities’ Views
43.
The authorities’ welcomed the positive assessment of the progress made on implementing
the 2014 FSAP recommendations. Approaches to the risk-based capital regime for insurance companies
were being put in place and would take two to three years to complete formulating the regulatory
framework—mainly due to establishing detailed capital requirements and carrying out quantitative impact
studies for each company based on its risk exposure. Coordination among the regulators and government
in the Financial Stability Committee promoted discussion of risks that could transmit across the financial

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

27

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—HONG KONG SAR

system, closely following the emergence of best practices on stress testing and risk analysis emerging
from leading central banks, the FSB and IOSCO.

Property Market Related Measures
44.
With renewed signs of overheating in the property market, the three-pronged approach to
limiting risks is as important as ever. This involves boosting housing supply to match demand,
macroprudential measures to limit stability risks, and stamp duties to contain speculative activity and
external demand.

Macroprudential measures for housing. Current settings have done their job of limiting financial
system exposure to the asset price boom. With house prices rising once more, and valuations
stretched, a further orderly house-price adjustment would be helpful. Loan to value (LTV) or debt
service to income (DSI) ratio settings should remain fixed. Only once it is clear that the trend has firmly
turned down, the overvaluation gap is eliminated, credit conditions tighten and an undervaluation
gap opens up together with lower new housing transactions, would there be a case to ease LTV and

Tackling housing supply shortage. The Long-Term Housing Strategy and Hong Kong 2030+ are
aimed at addressing the housing shortage in an integrated manner by guiding land, planning and
infrastructure development (see Box 1). Beyond the ten-year rolling target, continued efforts are
needed over a longer horizon to keep pace with household formation and the need for urban
renewal. Accelerating plans to increase supply faces a number of obstacles—such as the lack of ready
projects, planning restrictions and legal and community objections. Nonetheless, to the extent
possible, speeding up processes, making land available, and bringing forward public investment
would be a double win—tackling the housing problem and supporting the economy at a time of soft
growth.

Box 1. Housing and Land Supply, and the Development Strategy 1/
Housing supply dropped sharply in the 2000s, leading to an acute housing shortage which the authorities
are now seeking to address.
Household formation increased by 40 percent over the past twenty years but the supply of
housing was cut sharply following the early 2000s-housing market downturn. New public housing
was cut from an average of about 50,000 a year in the early 2000s to less than 15,000 in recent years
and private housing was cut from 25,000 to 10-15,000. The private domestic vacancy rate almost halved.
Land reclamation and site formation also slowed. This led to a growing demand supply imbalance.
Projections point to a further expansion of households by 20 percent through to 2044. Compounding
this, the housing stock is aging with close to 20 percent of it expected to reach aged 70 or above by
2046.
Tackling the housing shortage is now an important goal of government policy:



The Long-Term Housing Strategy plans to build 460,000 units over the next ten years from
2017/18 to 2026/27 with a public/private split of 60:40. The strategy includes building more
public rental units; expanding subsidized home ownership; and steady provision of land
supply for private residential properties and tenancy, keeping supply in sync with demand.



The longer-term development strategy is being revised in Hong Kong 2030+. It has been issued for
public consultation and is expected to be finalized in 2018. It contains a vision to become a livable,
high-density city in an environmentally friendly way.

Development of Hong Kong SAR’s land area is challenging with only a quarter of the land supply
already developed. Up to 30 percent of the land area is planned or under study for development, other
areas face major development, environmental or geographical constraints or are country parks or
special areas. Land development typically takes 11–14 years from the preliminary stage to final
construction and requires the development of ancillary transport and community services.
To push forward a pipeline of land supply the authorities adopted a multi-pronged strategy:



Near and medium term. (i) increasing development density if the traffic and environment conditions
permit, (ii) changing land use if the provision of public/community facilities and open space is
adequate, and (iii) reviewing land use of currently vacant government land and green belt sites

Authorities’ Views: Property Market


Raising housing supply. This was a central focus for policy and supply was being increased as quickly as
possible without compromising planning principles. The authorities were skeptical that there was much
scope to bring forward investment given long time lags for development. The long-term housing
strategy aims to gradually avert the supply-demand imbalance in housing, while Hong Kong 2030+
would address the need to step up urban regeneration efforts and result in sustained economic
development and better quality living.



Macroprudential measures. The authorities viewed the current settings of macroprudential policies as
appropriate. Since macroprudential measures were first introduced, at an early stage in 2009, the average
LTV on new loans had fallen back from 64 percent immediately before the imposition of tightening
measures to around 52 percent in 2016. The measures ensured that banks had sufficient buffers to
handle potential shocks matching the worst cycles of the past.



Stamp duties. Alongside the HKMA’s imposition of macroprudential measures, the government had
used stamp duties to contain speculative and external demand for property. The recent increase in the ad
valorem stamp duty rate for residential property transactions had been necessary to manage demand,
particularly from investors, in an overheated market.

SECURING LONG-TERM POTENTIAL
45.
Opportunities and challenges. In addition to the long-term fiscal challenge, the economy will need
to adapt to mainland China’s rebalancing and move up the value added chain. This will bring vast
opportunities but also requires the same adept flexibility that has helped Hong Kong SAR to successfully
navigate change over the course of its history. Reducing inequality (especially from aging and pensioner
poverty) and supporting labor participation will also be important for an aging population.
46.
Building on Hong Kong’s role as a global financial center will be critical for growth. Hong Kong
SAR has comparative advantages of geographical location, skilled and well educated workforce, high legal
standards and a common language with its main trading partners. Leveraging its strong position as a regional
financial hub, opportunities can be tapped from mainland China’s growth, global integration and capital
account liberalization. As well as maintaining its position as the leading RMB offshore center, the authorities
have a strategy of developing the asset management industry, encouraging corporate treasury centers to
domicile in Hong Kong SAR and enabling healthy development of Fintech without compromising consumer
and investor protection. There will be opportunities for global companies to conduct business through Hong
Kong SAR, both to continue to establish Hong Kong SAR as a financial center for mainland China but also to
become more of a global center for finance broadening international activity. The HKMA’s Infrastructure
Financing Facilitation Office should help facilitate Hong Kong SAR’s role as a financing center for regional
infrastructure investment, and mainland China’s “One Belt One Road initiative” will help expand activity. There
is also scope to further develop professional services exports. Innovation should continue to be accompanied
by strong regulation and supervision over the whole financial system.
47.
Inequality, aging, and labor force participation. A number of the authorities’ policies are targeted
to supporting those at the bottom end of the income deciles (Box 2) including through increasing the supply
of public housing and increasing labor force participation. The low income Working Family

Box 2. Inequality in Hong Kong SAR 1/
Hong Kong’s income inequality as measured by the Gini index appears high in international comparisons, but may
have declined recently as the authorities targeted policies at supporting the bottom of the income distribution.
Hong Kong SAR’s inequality looks high when
comparing Gini indices across economies. The market
Gini index measures inequality in market outcomes prior

Regional Comparison: Income Inequality Level
(Net Gini Index; in Gini points; year of 2011; average across
the region)

to taxes and transfers, while the net Gini index measures
inequality in post-tax and post-transfers outcomes. Hong
Kong SAR’s market index and net index of 54 and 44,
respectively, in 2011 look relatively high when compared
with other economies.
However, comparisons of Gini indices across
economies are not straightforward. National statistics
offices compute different concepts of the Gini, for
example, based on market or net basis, on full income or
just wage income, on consumption or income, adjusting for
household size or not, and other ad hoc adjustments. When
comparing across economies, one needs to use the same
concept, which at times may not be possible. Beyond that,
comparing Hong Kong’s Gini index to large countries with
different urban and economic structures may not be
appropriate. For example, Hong Kong SAR’s market Gini
index seems in line with that of other cities with a sizable
financial sector.
Inequality has declined recently as the authorities implemented policies targeted at the bottom of the
income distribution. The net Gini index has come down from above 50 in 2002–03 to 44 in 2011, the last year for
which data are available. 2/ It has likely declined further as income has grown more rapidly at the bottom of the
income distribution compared to the top since 2010. The authorities have implemented targeted policies like the
introduction of a statutory minimum wage in 2011 and subsequent increases, the implementation of the LowIncome Working Family and Old-Age Living Allowances, transport subsidy, and expanding the supply of public
rental housing. They also established a Commission on Poverty that devised Hong Kong SAR’s first official poverty
line. These policies and increased scrutiny explain why Hong Kong SAR has a larger degree of redistribution
compared to the Asia region.

Public housing provision will continue to be a major policy priority to alleviate inequality. Public
housing provision has long been a policy priority in Hong Kong SAR, as illustrated by the fact that almost
half of all households lived in public housing. The 2014 Long-Term Housing strategy renews and reinforces
this long-standing effort, by setting a supply target of completing 460,000 units in the next 10 years, more
than 60 percent of which public. 3/ Public expenditure in housing has increased steadily and reached about
7 percent of total public expenditure in 2015/16. These efforts are essential to curb the supply-demand
imbalance as well as allow access to affordable housing to lower income households.

Box 2. Inequality in Hong Kong SAR (concluded)
Going forward, structural changes in the economy may not lead necessarily to higher inequality because of
offsetting shifts in the labor force…
The pattern of wage growth across industries varies
widely: while some have seen high growth in pay per
worker, others have not. The latter are mostly tied to the
“old” economy and thus have underperformed due to the
ongoing structural rebalance. At face value this could be
driving income inequality, given that industries that have
had low pay growth still account for more than half of the
labor force in the private sector. However, at the same
time, the labor force has shifted away from some these
industries, likely a reflection of the flexible labor market.
These patterns are expected to continue as the economy

flexibility in the labor market is therefore crucial.
…but a low growth environment has been
accompanied by an increase in inequality in the past.

Periods of Faster Economic Growth Have Been Associated
with Stable or Declining Inequality
350

Hong Kong SAR’s recent economic history can be divided

300

into three main periods. From the 1960s to early 1990s,

250

income per capita grew rapidly while inequality,
measured by the net Gini index, remained stable.
Between the early nineties and early 2000s, Hong Kong
SAR’s per capita income growth declined and inequality
increased rapidly. Since the early 2000s, income growth
has picked markedly up and inequality has declined
significantly. Income growth is slowing once more, which

raises the concern that inequality may also rise.

Allowance Scheme provides supplementary income to individuals and families with income and
assets under a certain threshold and is targeted to encourage those on low incomes to stay in or
reconnect to the workforce. The statutory minimum wage has helped boost labor supply without
damaging wage flexibility and a further moderate increase could be accommodated. Working hours
and overtime pay policy could also help encourage participation by those at the lower end of the
income and skills distribution, but would need to take into account other pressures on the labor
market. Policies that encourage active aging can also improve the fiscal position and help reduce
health spending relative to a counterfactual.

STAFF APPRAISAL
48.
Growth and outlook. Growth has slowed since 2015 and the external outlook is more
challenging with the U.S. rate cycle is edging up, global trade growth tepid and mainland China
rebalancing. With soft external conditions, the growth recovery is likely to be gradual with the
output gap closing slowly. Over the medium-term population aging pressures may affect potential
growth and weaken the structural fiscal position. On the upside, the economy is highly flexible and
large potential can be tapped from the further development of Hong Kong SAR as a global financial
center. Strong policy frameworks and ample buffers are in place to weather a less favorable
environment. Prudent fiscal policy and intensive supervision of the financial system have built
buffers that can be drawn on when needed. The Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), provides a
credible anchor for a small open economy with a large globally integrated financial services industry.
49.
There are three main risks. Growing economic linkages mean that changes in mainland
China’s growth prospects spill over to Hong Kong SAR’s financial and real sectors. With a large
globally-integrated financial sector and a currency board arrangement, the economy is exposed to
U.S. developments and global market volatility. The property market is also a source of downside
risk. With strong buffers in place these risks are manageable and should not adversely affect the
economy provided that, as anticipated, interest rates rise at a moderate pace and mainland China’s
transition to a more sustainable growth path remains orderly.
50.
Fiscal policy. As the main demand management lever, fiscal policy needs to strike a balance
between supporting aggregate demand and preserving a buffer for the longer-run challenge posed
by aging. In the near term with a significant and persistent output gap, a difficult external
environment, and weak automatic stabilizers, there is a case for further fiscal impetus which can be
removed as the economy recovers. The planned impulse in the 2016–17 Budget is appropriate but if
it undershoots and growth remains weak, additional stimulus will be needed in fiscal year 2017–18.
Aligning short-term fiscal measures to long-term goals and shifting spending forward would help
ensure that cyclical support does not exacerbate the long-term fiscal trend.
51.
Long-term fiscal challenges. Early follow-through on the recommendations of the 2014
Report on Long-Term Fiscal Planning—reviewing and reprioritizing expenditures to measures that
boost labor participation and support growth, raising revenues and managing assets—would help
alleviate the fiscal impact of aging. Measures to broaden the tax base may also be needed. The aim
for balance and keeping overall government expenditure growth in line with GDP growth over the
medium term is appropriate, while taking early action to alleviate the structural deficit problem. A
drawdown of the fiscal reserves could be accommodated as the economy adjusts, but a positive
fiscal buffer is desirable to cope with adverse shocks, provide room for countercyclical fiscal policy,
and sustain confidence.
52.
Property market measures. With renewed signs of overheating in the property market, the
three-pronged approach to limiting risks—boosting housing supply, macroprudential measures to
limit stability risks, and stamp duties to contain speculative activity and external demand—is well
placed. Current macroprudential settings have done their job of limiting financial system exposure

34

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—HONG KONG SAR

to the asset price boom and LTV and DSI settings should remain unchanged. Stamp duties can be
an effective part of the toolkit to stem excessive price increases and speculation in the real estate
market. As the distorting costs of duties become more significant the higher they are, they should
be rolled back once the trend has shifted toward reduced price and speculative pressures.
53.
Housing supply. The Long-Term Housing Strategy and Hong Kong 2030+ are aimed at
addressing the housing shortage in an integrated manner by guiding land, planning and
infrastructure development. Accelerating plans to increase supply, speeding up processes, making
land available, bringing forward public investment would be a double win—tackling the housing
problem and supporting the economy at a time of soft growth.
54.
Financial sector policies. The robust regulatory and supervisory framework should help
limit the build-up of systemic vulnerabilities. The authorities have a track record as a global standard
setter in regulation and supervision and in addressing data gaps. Substantial progress has been
made on implementing the 2014 FSAP recommendations. An independent insurance authority has
been established, strengthened standards for securities listing have been implemented, and
legislation has been put in place for a resolution framework for financial institutions which is
designed to implement the Financial Stability Board’s Key Attributes. There is substantial
coordination among government and regulators domestically, there are close links with mainland
regulators and the authorities are active in international fora, including in supervisory colleges for
cross-border banking and insurance groups, on global systemically important financial institutions,
and in crisis management groups. Areas for continued attention include further enhancing stress
testing and reviewing financial institutions’ plans in response to stress events.
55.
Exchange rate regime and external position. The LERS remains the best arrangement for
Hong Kong SAR backed by the credibility built up over three decades and tested through crises. The
LERS is underpinned by the flexible economy, ample reserves buffers and strong financial regulation
and supervision. Wage and price flexibility allows the economy to adapt quickly to cyclical
conditions and structural change. The external position is broadly in line with medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policies.
56.
Contingency planning. As a trading hub and global financial center, the economy is
inevitably exposed to global external shocks. In the event of an adverse shock, a comprehensive and
coordinated policy approach similar to the 2008/9 response would be appropriate: including large
fiscal stimulus, loosening of macroprudential policies, expanded credit guarantees, emergency
liquidity provision and close international supervisory coordination. The recently introduced crisis
resolution framework is strengthening the ability to respond to strains in the banking, corporate and
household sectors.
57.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation discussions take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of
the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects
staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly. “Short term” and “medium term” are meant
to indicate that the risk could materialize within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

High/Medium

1. Sharp rise in risk premia with flight to safety. Investors withdraw from specific risk
asset classes as they reassess underlying economic and financial risks in large economies,
or respond to unanticipated Fed tightening and increases in U.S. term premia. The
associated volatility surge prompts globally-active institutions to reduce leverage, maturity
transformation, and holdings of risky assets, resulting in a general tightening of global
financing conditions, amplified by lower market liquidity.
2. Significant China slowdown and its spillovers. A loss of investor confidence,
disorderly corporate defaults, a sharp fall in asset prices, and a quicker fading of the
stimulus impact. Weak domestic demand further suppresses commodity prices, roils global
financial markets, and reduces global growth (Likelihood: low in short-term, medium
thereafter).

High
1. Steadfast implementation of reforms in mainland China. Fast progress on enacting
structural reform (especially SOE reform), curbing credit growth, and improving overall
resource efficiency would lift medium-term growth prospects in mainland China with large
spillover benefits for Hong Kong SAR. Growth potential for Hong Kong SAR would improve
through close trade and financial links, although growth may remain lower in the near term

Current
account

Background. The net international investment position (NIIP) amounted to around 320 percent of GDP as of
end-2015. Both external financial assets (about 1,395 percent of GDP) and liabilities (about 1075 percent of
GDP) are high, reflecting Hong Kong SAR’s status as a major international financial center with considerable
cross-territory investment. The GDP share of the NIIP is projected to decline moderately, driven by the
interest-growth differential—as nominal GDP is expected to grow faster than the effective returns on the NIIP.
Given the large gross assets and liabilities, annual fluctuations in the NIIP due to valuation changes have been
sizable.
Assessment. Vulnerabilities are low given the size of NIIP and its favorable composition.
Background. The current account surplus is estimated to be 3.1 percent of GDP in 2015 (2.5 percent of GDP
after cyclical adjustment), which continues to be substantially lower than in the pre-GFC years. From a sectoral
perspective, the gradual decline of private saving (from the peak of 34.4 percent of GDP in 2006 to 24.6
percent of GDP in 2014 and 2015) accounted for most of the drop in the current account surplus. The
favorable terms of trade shock from lower commodity prices improved the current account surplus by about
0.5 percent of GDP in 2015. The current account surplus is projected to be 2.8 percent of GDP in 2016.
Assessment. The current account is broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable
policies. Staff’s quantitative assessment suggests that the difference between the cyclically-adjusted current
account in 2015 and that consistent with fundamentals and desirable policies is between -1½ and 1½ percent
of GDP. The large decline of the current account surplus (relative to pre-2010) is mainly driven structural
changes related to weaker growth and rebalancing in mainland China as well as the opening of the Mainland
capital account. 1/

Background. The REER appreciated by about 9 percent in 2015, relative to the average REER in 2014. The
Real
REER appreciation was mainly driven by the HKD/USD peg and the higher inflation in Hong Kong SAR relative
exchange rate to most other advanced economies. The appreciation trend continued in 2016: as of October 2016, the REER
was about 3 percent stronger than its 2015 average. However, it should be noted that the recent appreciation
in REER came after a decade-long REER depreciation (from 1998 to 2011). The current REER level is broadly
the same as the level in 2006 (when the current account surplus of Hong Kong SAR reached 13 percent of
GDP).
Assessment. The real exchange rate is broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable
policies. Based on empirical EBA-type estimates and factoring in the uncertainties and variability of an offshore
trading and financial center, the exchange rate is assessed by staff to be from -7 to 7 percent different from
the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies.
Capital and
financial
accounts:
flows and
policy
measures

FX
intervention
and reserves
level

Background. As a financial center, Hong Kong SAR has a fully open capital account without capital controls.
Although Hong Kong SAR experienced net private inflows in 2015, overall, the capital flow pattern was volatile
during the year: a sharp increase in portfolio investment and financial derivatives position (in both the asset
and liability side) in the first half of the year and a subsequent sharp decline since Q3. These large movements
are likely associated with financial volatility in the Mainland, transmitted through growing cross-border
financial linkages. 2/
Assessment. Large financial resources and proactive financial supervision and regulation limit the risks from
potentially volatile capital flows. The greater financial exposure to mainland China could pose risks to the
banking sector if mainland growth slows sharply and financial stress emerges in some key sectors in the
Mainland, such as export-oriented manufacturing or real estate. However, given the high origination and
underwriting standards that Hong Kong SAR banks have maintained, the credit risk appears manageable.
Background. Hong Kong SAR has a currency board arrangement. International reserves have been built up in
a nondiscretionary way as a result of a long-standing commitment to the Linked Exchange Rate System. The
stock of reserves is equivalent to around US$383 billion (about 124 percent of 2015 GDP) as of Oct-2016.
Assessment. Currently, reserves are adequate for precautionary purposes and should continue to evolve in
line with the automatic adjustment inherent in the currency board system. Hong Kong SAR also holds
significant fiscal reserves built up through a track record of strong fiscal discipline.

Overall Assessment:
The external position in 2015 was
broadly consistent with
medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policy settings.
Developments through October
2016 do not suggest a change in
this assessment. The current
account surplus has declined
relative to its pre-2010 level on
account of structural factors,
including opening of the Mainland
capital account and changes in
offshore merchandise trade
activities. The recent REER
appreciation is expected to be
offset by Hong Kong SAR’s strong
self-equilibrating economy
stemming from flexible goods,
factor, and asset markets. 3/
Potential policy responses:
Macroeconomic policies are
broadly appropriate. Robust and
proactive financial supervision and
regulation, prudent fiscal
management, flexible markets, and
the Linked Exchange Rate System
have worked well to keep the
external position broadly in
balance. Continuation of these
policies, therefore, will help keep
the external position broadly in
line with medium-term
fundamentals.

Overall Assessment

Technical
Background
Notes

1/ Hong Kong SAR is not in the EBA sample as it is an outlier along many dimensions of EBA analysis, thus one
possibility with obvious drawbacks is to use EBA estimated coefficients and applying them to Hong Kong SAR.
Following that approach, the cyclically-adjusted current account is estimated to be about 11 percent of GDP weaker
than that consistent with fundamentals and desirable policies. The gap was mainly driven by EBA regression residual
(about -12 percent of GDP) and the policy gap is around 1 percent of GDP. The large residual likely reflects a
combination of structural factors which are not captured by EBA. Staff found that two structural factors account for
some of the difference, including the structural decline in the transport services balance tied to a reduction of reexporting activity from and to China and the structural reversal of Hong Kong SAR’s gold trade balance tied to the
opening of the Precious Metals Depository which changed the level of gross imports and exports without a meaningful
change in value added accruing to Hong Kong SAR’s residents. Two additional EBA-specific factors are also of note.
First, EBA’s adjustment for financial centers is likely biased upward because of the large current account of the few
countries deemed financial centers. Second, EBA’s coefficient for NFA to GDP capturing income effects averages out net
returns on assets and liabilities across countries, while in fact Hong Kong SAR has systematically lower net returns
compared to other economies. Adjusting for all of these factors, staff estimate that the current account gap is close to
zero, corresponding to a norm in the range of 1 to 4 percent of GDP.
2/ The financial linkages with the Mainland have deepened in recent years with the increase in cross-border bank
lending, securities issuance in Hong Kong SAR by mainland entities and the internationalization of the RMB. As of 2016:
Q2, the banking system claims on mainland banks and nonbank entities amounted to HK$ 6.1 trillion, or about 250
percent of 2015 GDP, although part of the exposure is accounted by foreign banks.
3/ This is reflected in lower inflation rates in 2015 compared to previous years and relatively slower nominal wage
growth (from 2011 to 2015, nominal wages increased by 20 percent while nominal GDP increased by about 24 percent).

Crisis

and resolution

Establish a fully

resolution, in line with
emerging
international best
practices. Establish
recovery and
resolution plans for all
systemic financial
institutions, including
financial market
infrastructures
(“FMIs”).

Progress
Framework for recovery and resolution
On Track






The Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance (“FIRO”) was enacted by the
Legislative Council in June 2016. The FIRO provides the statutory backing for a
cross-sector resolution regime in Hong Kong that is designed to meet the
standards set by the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”)’s Key Attributes of
Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions. The FIRO will come into
operation on a date to be appointed by the Secretary for Financial Services
and the Treasury, which is expected to be subsequent to the coming into
force of certain key regulations, primarily those relating to the protection of
certain financial arrangements in resolution, to be made as subsidiary
legislation under the FIRO.
The cross-sector regime applies to all banks (authorized institutions (“AIs”),
certain securities firms, insurers and financial market infrastructures, holding
companies and non-regulated operating entities of within scope financial
institutions (“FIs”), and extends to branches of foreign FIs. The Monetary
Authority (“MA”), the Securities and Futures Commission (“SFC”) and the
Insurance Authority are established as resolution authorities under the FIRO
with responsibility for the planning for and execution of resolution in respect
of those within scope FIs operating under their respective purviews (e.g., the
MA is the resolution authority for AIs). A lead resolution authority may be
designated by the Financial Secretary to coordinate and lead resolution
planning, and if necessary execution, for a cross-sectoral group, which
contains more than one within scope FI from more than one sector
(e.g., certain global systemically important bank operations in Hong Kong).
Further work is currently underway to bring the FIRO into force and to make
the regime provided for under it, including the transfer and bail-in stabilization
options, operational from a resolution policy perspective. At the HKMA, a
significant part of this work is to establish a permanent resolution function
within the HKMA with dedicated resources and governance. On resolution
policy, the work includes the development of key regulations to be made
under FIRO such as loss absorbing capacity requirement regulations for within
scope FIs (including AIs), the establishment of resolution planning information
requirements for AIs (expected to be issued within second half of 2016), and
ongoing engagement in international resolution policy development.

Recovery planning for banks [On Track]

48



The supervisory recovery planning framework for AIs is established in the
HKMA’s Supervisory Policy Manual module on Recovery Planning (RE-1),
which was issued in June 2014. Recovery plans for all key locally incorporated
AIs in Hong Kong, including the five domestic systemically important banks,
have been submitted to the HKMA.



The HKMA plans to publish in second half of 2016 a consultation on
amendments to the Banking Ordinance to incorporate new requirements
relating to the production of recovery plans and to the submission of such
plans to the Monetary Authority. This will create a more explicit legal basis for
recovery planning for Hong Kong AIs, primarily to achieve greater certainty
and transparency.

FMIs under the purview of SFC
On Track




The discussion with Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited
(“HKEX”) on some aspects of the recovery planning of three of the four
existing recognised clearing houses (“RCH”) in HKEX Group namely, Hong
Kong Securities Clearing Company Limited (“HKSCC”), HKFE Clearing
Corporation Limited (“HKCC”), The SEHK Options Clearing House Limited
(“SEOCH”), has been ongoing. HKEX has undertaken to submit a proposal
on its approach to develop a recovery plan for these three RCHs and a
draft recovery plan for each of them by end of 2016. The recovery plan will
take into consideration (i) the guidance on development of recovery plans
for FMIs; and (ii) the consultation report on “Resilience and recovery of
central counterparties (“CCPs”): Further guidance on the Principles for
Financial Market Infrastructures (“PFMI”)” (“Further PFMI Guidance 2016”)
jointly published by the Committee on Payments and Market
Infrastructures and the International Organisation of Securities
Commissions (“CPMI-IOSCO”) in October 2014 and August 2016
respectively. HKEX was asked to review the recovery plan for its fourth
RCH, OTC Clearing Hong Kong Limited, to identify any areas for
improvements in light of the Further PFMI Guidance 2016.
The SFC will work with the four RCHs in developing their respective
resolution plans in due course.

Insurance
sector

The authorities
should ensure
implementation of
the independent
Insurance Authority
(“IIA”) as scheduled
in 2015.

For FMIs under the purview of the HKMA, the requirement to establish a
comprehensive framework for recovery and resolution only applies to the
settlement institution and system operator of the three foreign-currency
Real Time Gross Settlement systems, namely the US Dollar Clearing House
Automated Transfer System (“CHATS”), Euro CHATS and renminbi CHATS.
Each of the parties as mentioned above has developed its own recovery
plan based on PFMI requirements. The recovery plans, which will be
updated annually, have been approved by the respective Boards of the
parties concerned.
Other FMIs under the purview of the HKMA, namely the Hong Kong Dollar
CHATS, the Central Moneymarkets Unit, and the Hong Kong Trade
Repository, are FMIs owned and operated by the HKMA. According to a
note issued by CPMI-IOSCO on application of the PFMI to central bank
FMIs, the requirement to develop a recovery and resolution plan does not
apply to central bank-operated FMIs.

The Insurance Companies (Amendment) Ordinance 2015 (“Amendment

enacted on 10 July 2015. It provides that, among other things, IIA should
be independent of the Government and the industry. Members of IIA were
appointed and took office in December 2015. Under the Amendment
Ordinance, IIA is automatically renamed as the Provisional Insurance
Authority, which has administrative power but not regulatory power. It is
undertaking essential preparatory work to take over the regulatory
functions of the existing Insurance Authority (“IA”) in early 2017.

Under the Amendment Ordinance, the appointment of certain individuals
by an insurer, including controllers, directors, key persons in control
functions and appointed actuaries, is subject to the prior approval of IIA.
Control functions currently include risk management; financial control;
compliance; internal audit; actuarial and intermediary management
functions. To provide flexibility to update the regulatory regime in light of
future developments, the Financial Secretary may specify other control
functions through subsidiary legislation. IIA is also empowered under the
Amendment Ordinance to revoke the appointment of such person on
fitness and propriety grounds.
Besides, shareholder controllers will be required to report to the IA the
acquisition or disposal of their shareholding interests for their
appointment or cessation as controllers of insurers. The IA has revised the
existing Guidance Note (“GN”) on Corporate Governance which will,
among other things, enhance the requirements for insurers to implement
contingency plans in their risk management process. The revised GN has
been issued in October 2016 and will take effect from 1 January 2017.

Apart from the current role of IA in (i) leading the supervisory college of a
Hong Kong SAR incorporated insurance group; (ii) co-leading a regional
supervisory college of a Global Systemically Important Insurer with the
home regulator; and (iii) actively participating in supervisory colleges of
other insurance groups, IA has proposed a regulatory regime for
insurance groups and subgroups in the context of developing a
risk-based capital (“RBC”) regime (see (ii) below).
A consultation on the proposed RBC framework was conducted at the
end of 2014. Depending on the structure and size of insurance groups, a
three-tier approach for supervisory measures for group wide supervision
was proposed. After taking into account feedback from stakeholders, IA
has started the development of detailed rules for quantitative
requirements (i.e., Pillar 1 requirements under the RBC framework). After
that, quantitative impact studies will be carried out.
The implementation of the RBC regime will be rolled out in phases.
Subject to further consultation with stakeholders, legislative amendments
will be introduced. The whole process is expected to take about two to
three years from now.
As regards the qualitative and disclosure requirements (i.e., Pillars 2 and
3 requirements under the RBC framework), IA will review the relevant GNs
and make revisions ahead of the legislative process as necessary.

The Amendment Ordinance provides for the establishment of a statutory
licensing regime for insurance intermediaries and provides IIA with express
powers to conduct inspection, initiate investigation, and impose a range of
disciplinary sanctions (including revocation of licence, issuance of reprimand
and imposition of pecuniary penalty of up to HK$10 million) on licensed
insurance intermediaries. The broad principles of conduct requirements on the
part of a licensed insurance intermediary are stipulated in the Amendment
Ordinance. IIA will also be empowered to make rules for insurance
intermediaries to comply with practices and standards relating to conduct
requirements, and issue codes or guidelines to facilitate their compliance with
the conduct requirements.
As regards the conduct of business requirements for insurers, the IA has issued
two GNs for insurers on the underwriting of unit-linked policies and life
insurance policies respectively, which are based on Insurance Core Principle
19 on Conduct of Business promulgated by the International Association of
Insurance Supervisors. Both GNs adopt a “cradle-to-grave” approach by
requiring insurers to meet regulatory requirements on product design,
disclosure of key product features, suitability assessment as well as sales and
post-sale control measures to ensure that the products being recommended
to clients do suit their needs.

On Track


The SFC enhanced its supervisory approach in early 2014 following the
announcement by HKEX in 2013 of its strategic plan which would change its
business model as it expands into new markets, asset classes and
infrastructures. Supervision focused on HKEX’s capability to adequately
identify, assess, and manage conflicts, business and regulatory compliance
risks across the markets in which HKEX operates, and on conducting on-site
inspections of the non-listing operations of HKEX. In this regard–
(i) The SFC has imposed a gearing ratio requirement and financial resources
requirement on HKEX and its subsidiary recognised exchanges (“REC”) and
recognised clearing houses (“RCH”). The financial resources requirement for
RCH was first introduced in the fourth quarter of 2013, when OTC Clearing
Hong Kong Limited was recognised as an RCH. This was followed by the other
three recognised clearing houses in 2014: Hong Kong Securities Clearing
Company Limited (“HKSCC”), HKFE Clearing Corporation Limited (“HKFE”), and
the SEHK Options Clearing House Limited (“SEOCH”).
(ii) HKEX agrees on the need to strengthen its compliance function and has
set up a Regulatory Compliance Unit.
(iii) The SFC completed an on-site inspection on HKEX’s cash trading
operations and activities in September 2015. HKEX accepted all the
recommendations of SFC. In this regard, HKEX has completed actions
(deliverables) to address most of the recommendations from the SFC’s
findings, and has indicated a target delivery time that will be no later than
31 December 2016 for the deliverables on the remaining recommendations.



The SFC has amended its Guidelines for the Regulation of Automated
Trading Services (“ATS Guidelines) to clarify the factors relevant to
considering whether a particular operator is more suited to be regulated
as a recognized exchange company (“REC”) or an authorised ATS
provider. The revised ATS Guidelines came into effect on 1 September
2016. The clarification will facilitate understanding of the regulatory
differences between the REC and ATS regimes (which are reflected in
the Securities and Futures Ordinance “SFO”) and guide potential
applicants who wish to operate a futures market in Hong Kong.



FSTB launched a public consultation to solicit views on proposals to
introduce an independent oversight regime for the regulation of listed
entity auditors in June 2014. The consultation conclusions were issued
in June 2015.
(http://www.fstb.gov.hk/fsb/ppr/consult/doc/conclu_rpirrlea_e.pdf).



With general support from the audit profession and the relevant
stakeholders, the Government is preparing an amendment bill to
implement the reform. The reform will bring Hong Kong SAR in line
with the international standards that auditor regulatory regimes should
be independent of the profession itself and be subject to independent
oversight by bodies acting in the public interest. The Government’s
target is to introduce the amendment bill into the Legislative Council in
the 2016-17 legislative session.



Under the reform proposals, the Financial Reporting Council (“FRC”) will
become the independent auditor oversight body vested with direct
inspection, investigation and disciplinary powers with regard to listed
entity auditors. The enforcement powers to be vested with FRC will also
be stronger as compared with those under the present regime. Without
compromising the independence of the new auditor regulatory regime,
the authorities will leverage on the experience of the Hong Kong
Institute of Certified Public Accountants in handling matters pertaining
to registration, standard-setting and continuing professional
development with regard to listed entity auditors by entrusting the
Institute with these statutory functions while being subject to the
oversight by the FRC.



Since the SFO came into operation in 2003, the enforcement approach
(including imposition of punitive, deterrent sanctions and remediation to
victims) of the SFC has been proven to be effective in ensuring that the
markets that the SFC regulates are safe, fair and efficient. In view of the
ever-evolving market situation, FSTB will continue to work with SFC for
continual improvement to minimise financial crimes and market
misconduct, uphold market integrity and inspire confidence of investors.

A Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) was entered between SFC
and Department of Justice in March 2016 to formalise and further
strengthen cooperation in the handling of criminal cases under the SFO
and other relevant legislation.

FMI under SFC purview
On Track


SFC and HKEX have agreed on a timetable for the recognised clearing
houses in the HKEX Group to comply with the PFMIs in respect of areas
where improvements are required. Most of the areas identified have
been addressed in 2015, while a few will require legislative amendments
or further study for implementation.



OTC Clearing Hong Kong Limited (“OTC Clear”) has completed a
self-assessment against the PFMIs in respect of the proposed cross
currency swap clearing service and concluded that it is in compliance with
the PFMIs. The SFC has reviewed the self-assessment report and has no
particular concern about its analysis or the conclusion reached. However,
in light of the Further PFMI Guidance 2016, the SFC has asked HKEX to
review their self-assessment on OTC Clear and all other recognised
clearing houses in the HKEX Group to consider if there are any further
areas for improvement.1

FMI under HKMA purview
Implemented


The HKMA required the FMIs under its purview to have made changes
to conform with relevant requirements in the PFMI, and be generally
observant of the PFMI by end-December 2015. Such requirement is
stated in the HKMA policy statement on oversight of FMIs, which is
available on the HKMA website.2



As of end-August 2016, the HKMA has completed PFMI assessments on
all the FMIs under its purview, with the assessment summaries published
on the HKMA website.3 The only exception is USD CHATS, for which the
assessment will be finalised by Q3/Q4 2016. All FMIs under the purview
of the HKMA are considered to be generally observant of the PFMI.

1/ The proposed guidance outlined in this consultative report provides further clarity and granularity on several key aspects of
the PFMI to further improve central counterparty (“CCP”) resilience. These are: governance, credit and liquidity stress testing,
margin, a CCP's contribution of its financial resources to losses, and its coverage of credit and liquidity resource requirements.
The report also proposes guidance that is intended to facilitate a CCP's development of its recovery plan.

capacity for systemic
risk analysis at the
SFC and Insurance
Authority (“IA”)
would help ensure
that cross-sectoral
interconnections are
adequately captured
and brought to the
attention of the
Financial Stability
Committee (“FSC”).

The Central Moneymarkets Unit (“CMU”), Hong Kong dollar CHATS and
Trade Repository have all completed a self-assessment on their
compliance with the PFMIs, and the disclosure framework for them was
first published in October 2014, July 2014 and September 2015
respectively.

On Track


The SFC has commenced a review of its long-term risk data strategy
focusing on identifying data that can be collected in a methodological
fashion and that may contribute to the early identification of systemic risk,
as well as to the setting of strategic, policy and supervisory priorities.



To enhance existing macroprudential surveillance and support
policymaking, IA is taking steps to improve its data infrastructure by
requiring insurers to provide IA with additional information on risk
exposures and interconnections, which will facilitate the assessment of the
build-up of risks or vulnerabilities to the industry. For example, with the
G20/FSB recommendations and initiatives on macroprudential oversight
on shadow banking, IA has been working towards the development of
more robust quantitative indicators for assessing the systemic risk of
insurers. In this annual exercise, IA collects from insurers data about their
financial assets by categories and their shadow banking activities. There is
also new data collection for credit exposure conducted by the HKMA, the
SFC and the Mandatory Provident Fund Authority at the same time, with
specific shadow banking indicators pertinent to their respective
businesses.



Life insurers are required to conduct periodic industry-wide standardized
scenario testing as and when required, to enable IA to assess the existence
of any vulnerabilities within the industry. On an annual basis, insurers are
required to submit the results of Dynamic Solvency Testing under adverse
scenarios to IA for ongoing monitoring purpose. IA uses the information
contained in quarterly returns from insurers to perform industry-wide
resilience tests on a quarterly basis. IA also performs analyses on the asset
mix of life insurers to assess their concentration risks and exposure to
different sectors. On the information exchange front, IA provides the
HKMA with statistics of insurers associated with banking groups to enable
the latter to perform its role in macroprudential surveillance.



Besides, IA has been collecting business statistics from insurers and
calculating industry-wide claims ratios for specified lines of business. IA
also collects burning cost data from the industry. Such information would
be used as the reference to test the adequacy of technical provisions for
specific lines of business of individual insurers.
As for the macroprudential surveillance from a cross-sectoral perspective,
IA liaises with other local financial regulators (such as the HKMA and the
SFC) regularly via the Council of Financial Regulators (“CFR”) and FSC on
supervisory and regulatory issues with cross-market implications. CFR and
FSC deliberate on events, issues and developments with possible
cross-market and systemic implications. A review would be taken by the
financial regulators if any significant risk area of the financial markets is
identified.



HKMA continues its active participation in the supervisory colleges for crossborder banking groups including a number of Globally Systemically Important
Banks to discuss the risk profiles, business strategies, and developments of
banking groups, as well as other supervisory concerns and priorities. It also
continues to participate in the Crisis Management Groups of GSIBs to discuss
and oversee the development of recovery and resolution plans for each
banking group in accordance with the Key Attributes established by FSB.



Reflecting the enactment of the FIRO in June 2016, the HKMA’s new permanent
resolution authority function will lead resolution planning and actively
coordinate with banking supervision in cross-border resolution planning.



The HKMA has been maintaining close dialogue with the China Banking
Regulatory Commission (“CBRC”) on supervisory matters relating to the
mainland bank subsidiaries and branches of Hong Kong banks. In addition to
the bilateral meetings held twice a year between the HKMA and the CBRC, the
number of working-level meetings has increased either through scheduled
meetings or whenever the two sides meet as part of the on-site examinations
arranged by either regulator. The secondment program established with CBRC
is currently in place to enhance understanding of banking issues and
supervisory approaches of both places.



The SFC has been maintaining constant dialogue with various mainland
authorities including the China Securities Regulatory Commission (“CSRC”) on
different regulatory matters. For example, the SFC worked closely with different
mainland authorities to launch the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect in
November 2014 and the mutual recognition of funds in July 2015, and to
prepare for the launch of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect which was
announced in August 2016.

The Insurance Authority (“IA”) has been maintaining close dialogue with the
China Insurance Regulatory Commission (“CIRC”) on supervisory matters
relating to mainland insurers’ subsidiaries and branches operating in
Hong Kong SAR, as well as mainland shareholders and business partners
(e.g., reinsurers) of Hong Kong SAR insurers. IA has entered into two MOUs with
CIRC on cooperation of insurance supervision and anti-insurance fraud. There
are regular meetings between IA and CIRC to enhance understanding of the
insurance market of the other side and to enhance regulatory cooperation on
cross-border insurance business activities.



The relevant regulators continue to participate actively in international
regulatory fora including G20, IOSCO, and FSB to ensure that financial regulation
in Hong Kong SAR is on par with the international standards, taking into
account the unique background and needs of the financial sectors.



To meet the G20 commitments on over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives
regulatory reform, Hong Kong SAR has implemented the first phase of
mandatory reporting and mandatory clearing as follows:



(i) the first phase of mandatory reporting was implemented on 10 July 2015,
which requires the reporting of certain interest rate swaps and non-deliverable
forwards to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Trade Repository; and



(ii) the first phase of mandatory clearing was implemented on 1 September
2016, which requires certain standardized interest rate swaps denominated in
Hong Kong dollar or one of the G4 currencies (i.e., USD, EUR, GBP or JPY) to be
centrally cleared through central counterparties designated by the SFC.
Legislation has also been enacted for the next phase of mandatory reporting,
which covers the five main asset classes (namely interest rate derivatives, foreign
exchange derivatives, equity derivatives, credit derivatives and commodity
derivatives) and will commence operation in July 2017.





56

The status of Hong Kong SAR in meeting the requirements of the U.S. and EU
OTC regulatory reforms relating to OTC derivatives that are applicable to central
counterparties (“CCPs”) is as follows:



(i) On 21 December 2015, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(“CFTC”) issued an order of exemption from registration as a derivatives clearing
organisation to OTC Clear which permits it to clear proprietary trades for its U.S.
clearing members or affiliates of such clearing members subject to certain terms
and conditions. The SFC and the CFTC signed an MOU on 21 December
2015 regarding cooperation and the exchange of information in the supervision
and oversight of regulated entities that operate on a cross-border basis in Hong
Kong and the US. The scope of the MOU covers OTC Clear.



(ii) On 30 October 2014, the European Commission adopted an equivalence
decision for the regulatory regime of CCPs in Hong Kong SAR. The SFC then
worked with the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) on an
MOU to establish cooperation arrangements, as it was a pre-condition for the
recognition of a non-EU CCP. The MOU was signed and took effect on
19 December 2014. These steps culminated in the ESMA’s recognising the four
CCPs in Hong Kong SAR (HKSCC, HKFE, OTC Clear and SEOCH) as third country
CCPs to offer services and activities to entities established in the EU in
accordance with the European Market Infrastructure Regulation on 29 April
2015. The recognition was granted without conditions. Another MOU was
entered between the SFC and the ESMA and became effective on 19 November
2015 to facilitate SFC’s indirect access to the EU trade repositories via ESMA.



(iii) There are no outstanding requirements of any other overseas regulators on
the four CCPs in order to continue providing clearing services.

FUND RELATIONS
Membership Status
As a Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong SAR is not a
member of the Fund. However, annual consultation discussions have been held with the
Hong Kong SAR authorities since October 1990, and the staff also holds discussions with the
authorities in connection with the Fund’s Global Financial Stability reports. STA has provided
Hong Kong SAR with technical assistance in the area of balance of payments statistics and
Hong Kong SAR officials have attended IMF Institute courses on balance of payments and monetary
statistics, and financial programming. The latest FSAP was undertaken in 2014 at the request of the
authorities.
Exchange Rate Arrangement
The Hong Kong dollar has been linked to the U.S. dollar under a currency board arrangement, the
Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), since October 1983 at a rate of HK$7.8/US$1. The Hong Kong
Monetary Authority (HKMA) refined the operations of the LERS in May 2005—the first changes since
September 1998. For the first time since the introduction of the LERS in 1983, the HKMA explicitly
committed to sell Hong Kong dollar at a preannounced price (set at HK$7.75/US$), which is referred
to as the strong-side convertibility undertaking. Previously, the HKMA had only committed to buy
Hong Kong dollar at a preannounced rate (the weak-side convertibility undertaking introduced in
October 1998) and could sell Hong Kong dollar at any price. Along with this two-way convertibility
undertaking, the HKMA also introduced a symmetric trading band of 0.6 percent around a central
parity of HK$7.8/US$. There are no restrictions on current or capital account transactions in
Hong Kong SAR, and the Hong Kong dollar is freely convertible. The People’s Republic of China
accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement on
December 1, 1996. The exchange regime is free of restrictions and multiple currency practices.
Resident Representative
The Hong Kong SAR sub-office of the Beijing Resident Representative’s office was opened on

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of December 7, 2016)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: The economic database is generally comprehensive and of high quality, and data provision is
adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: Hong Kong SAR compiles and disseminates GDP statistics under the production, expenditure
and income approaches on an annual basis, while the expenditure approach is deemed to be the most reliable one. The
production and expenditure approaches are also compiled in annual chained volume terms. The statistical discrepancies
are explicit under to the production approach in current terms. Quarterly GDP is available by expenditure components
(current values and volume) as well as by industry value added (in volume only). GDP compilation is largely in
accordance with the 2008 SNA.
Price Statistics: The monthly CPI covers the "expenditure" of all households in Hong Kong SAR and includes 984
items. The weights are based on the Household Expenditure Surveys which is conducted once every five years. The
index is disseminated with a lag no longer than 23 days after the end of the reference month. The national PPI
convers the industrial sector (manufacturing industries and sewerage, waste management and remediation activities),
including about 700 primary products. Weights are updated annual from the Annual Survey of Economic Activities.
The index is compiled quarterly. Both price indices follow international standards.
Government Finance Statistics: Hong Kong SAR reports both cash and accrual-based annual data for the
general government according to the Fund’s Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM 1986 and GFSM 2001,
respectively). No sub-annual data are provided for publication in the IFS.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: The HKMA reports monetary data for the central bank and banking
institutions to STA on a regular monthly basis, which are published in the IFS. In late 2009, the HKMA submitted
quarterly monetary data (test-data) using Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) that present data consistent with the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. However, the SRF data for Hong Kong SAR have not been published in
the IFS, which requires monthly periodicity for monetary data. The HKMA has been encouraged to compile and
submit monthly monetary data using SRFs for dissemination in the IFS.
Financial Sector Surveillance: Hong Kong SAR participates in regular reporting of Financial Soundness
Indicators (FSIs) to the IMF for dissemination on the FSI website. The reported data are quarterly and cover all
core FSIs and 12 additional FSIs for the deposit takers sector.
External sector statistics: Hong Kong SAR publishes comprehensive balance of payments data and international
investment position statistics for 2000 onwards. Hong Kong SAR disseminates the international reserves and
foreign currency liquidity data template, submits quarterly external debt statistics to the Quarterly External Debt
Statistics (QEDS) database, and participates in the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) and the
Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS).
II. Data Standards and Quality
Hong Kong SAR subscribes to the Fund’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard since 1996, and is fully
compliant with its requirements.

A data ROSC was disseminated in 1999
