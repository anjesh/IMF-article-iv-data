Executive Summary
Recent economic developments and policy response: The global economic crisis halved
real GDP growth to 2.7 percent in 2009, compared with 5 percent in 2008. Inflation declined
to an average 2.2 percent, reflecting the unwinding of the 2008 food and fuel crisis. The
current account balance widened to 10.8 percent of GDP on account of weaker exports and in
line with the fiscal deficit. Against the backdrop of lower customs collections, the authorities
sought to provide a strong fiscal stimulus in the first half of 2009, but were forced to tighten
policies thereafter because of financing constraints. As a result, the overall fiscal deficit more
than doubled to 7.3 percent of GDP, financed through additional external donor support,
domestic borrowing, and a large carryover of expenditure commitments to 2010. The
implementation of structural reforms is moving forward, although with some delays.
Article IV Consultation discussions: The main challenge is to contain the impact of the
crisis in the short run while increasing sustainable growth over the medium term to make
progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The authorities shared the
mission’s assessment that maintaining fiscal and debt sustainability and improving external
competitiveness is critical to achieving these objectives. It is essential to increase public
investment in infrastructure, mainly with external concessional financing; contain nonpriority
public expenditure through a global reform of the civil service; and accelerate structural
reforms to enhance the business climate.
Elements of the new Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement: The basic primary
balance will be gradually reduced during 2010–13 to stabilize the public debt-to-GDP ratio.
This adjustment is predicated on further revenue mobilization efforts and a strict limit of
recurrent expenditures, which would safeguard fiscal space for priority social and
infrastructure spending. The authorities’ structural reform agenda will enhance revenue
collection, improve public financial management, reform the civil service, and privatize
public utilities.
Staff appraisal: Staff supports the authorities’ request for a new ECF arrangement. The
fiscal program can be achieved only through a strict limit on the wage bill, which can be
achieved through the new framework for centralized wage bargaining and multiyear wage
contracts. To reach the ambitious growth objectives, speedy implementation of the structural
reform agenda is imperative. The main risks to the program come from lack of a government
majority in parliament and the 2011 presidential and parliamentary election cycle.

5
I. BACKGROUND
1.
The goal of the last ECF arrangement (2005–09) was to support the authorities’
strategy to achieve higher sustainable growth and reduce poverty while preserving
macroeconomic stability and reducing vulnerabilities to external shocks. In pursuit of
these objectives, the authorities’ program worked to expand the fiscal space for public
investment, improve the quality of poverty-reducing spending, and deepen structural reforms
to foster an environment conducive to private sector-led growth.
2.
The program achieved most of its objectives (Figure 1).1 Aided by debt relief under
the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) and the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI), Benin achieved significant improvements in macroeconomic stability.
Inflation was gradually reduced below 3 percent, except for the temporary surge associated
with the food and fuel crisis in 2008. The stock of external debt was cut by 58 percent to
11.5 percent of GDP in 2006 and has since been kept relatively low with a moderate risk of
debt distress. The basic primary balance was kept in surplus throughout the arrangement
period (except in 2009) by strengthening revenue mobilization, while preserving the fiscal
space for enhanced public investment (6.8 percent of GDP on average throughout the
period). The wage bill, however, increased by 67 percent in nominal terms between 2006 and
2009, partly as a result of large increases in wages and other bonuses to civil servants. The
overall fiscal deficit was contained below 4.5 percent of GDP (except in 2009), largely
financed with external concessional resources. The external current account deficits were
large, in part because of the large import component of investment projects. The expected
acceleration of economic growth fell short of program objectives, partly because of
exogenous shocks. Real GDP growth increased steadily from 2.9 percent in 2005 to 5.0
percent in 2008, notwithstanding the food and fuel crisis. The global economic crisis
reversed the growth trend in 2009, when growth was halved to 2.7 percent. Accordingly, the
poverty headcount fell only marginally over the arrangement period, from 37.4 percent in
2006 to 34.4 percent in 2009.
3.
The implementation of the structural reform agenda was mixed. While there was
substantial progress in reforming the cotton sector, the reform of the civil service lagged
behind. A strategy to improve public financial management was adopted in 2008, and key
reforms were implemented in tax and customs administration. Two unmet structural
benchmarks from the last ECF arrangement will be completed by the end of 2010.

4.
At the time of the 2008 Article IV Consultation, Executive Directors called on
the Beninese authorities to invigorate the reform process, particularly in the cotton and
public utility sectors. They also urged the authorities to limit the scope and duration of the
fiscal measures taken to address the food and fuel crisis, and to improve public expenditure
management further. Directors recommended maintaining a prudent borrowing policy and
expressed concerns about excessive borrowing in the regional market.
5.

Most of these recommendations have been implemented:

 The privatization of the cotton and the public utility sectors has moved forward. The
cotton ginning company was privatized in 2008, a new agency was established for the
centralized purchase of fertilizers in March 2009, and a new global strategy to reform the
cotton sector was adopted. The concession for the operation of the container terminal of
the Port of Cotonou and the majority stake in the cement company were awarded to a
strategic private investor in September 2009 and March 2010, respectively. The
privatization of Benin Telecom has been launched and completion is expected in the third
quarter of 2010. The government intervened to strengthen the financial situation of the
state-owned energy company (SBEE) by increasing electricity tariffs twice (in July 2009
and in April 2010) and restructuring SBEE’s debt in March 2010.
 The authorities phased out the temporary fiscal measures adopted in response to the
food and fuel crisis. In July 2008, the government allowed the full pass-through of
international food and fuel prices and introduced more targeted measures to protect lowincome households.
 The reform of public financial management (PFM) is proceeding with some delays.
A new law on public procurement contracts was adopted in 2009, and recourse to
exceptional spending procedures has been reduced. The authorities completed an audit of
the PFM information system and adopted a medium-term PFM reform strategy in 2008.
The completion of improvements in the information systems of the tax and customs
administration has, however, been delayed to the end of 2010, and a one-stop window at
the customs department and the Port of Cotonou will not be completed until 2011.
 Other recommended reforms are moving forward. The private sector is increasingly
involved in the provision of public services, following outsourcing of the operation of the
container terminal at the port and the privatization of the wood and cement companies.
Second-generation reforms are being introduced to strengthen the judicial and land tenure
systems and to expand credit to small and medium enterprises.
 The authorities have maintained a prudent borrowing policy, relying primarily on
external concessional sources. Borrowing on the regional market surged, however, in
2009, reflecting the need to finance the large fiscal deficit associated with the global
economic crisis.

8
II. IMPACT OF THE CRISIS AND POLICY RESPONSE
6.
The global economic crisis reduced
growth by half in 2009, more than in the
other WAEMU countries (Figure 2).
Lower cotton prices, weaker demand for
exports—notably from Nigeria—and lower
inflows of foreign direct investment reduced
real GDP growth from 5.0 percent in 2008 to
2.7 percent in 2009. The deceleration of
activity was aggravated by the decline in
cotton production and floods in the south of
the country, while noncotton agricultural
production and transportation continued to
grow, supported by the fiscal stimulus.
7.
The decline in international food
and fuel prices contributed to easing
inflationary pressures in Benin and the
rest of the WAEMU region (Figure 3).
Despite a 13 percent increase in electricity
tariffs in July 2009, average CPI inflation
declined from 8.0 percent in 2008 to
2.2 percent in 2009, reflecting lower food,
transportation, and gasoline prices.

A sharp decline in transit trade and
weaker cotton exports widened the
current account deficit (Figures 4 and 5).
The terms of trade were unchanged, because
a decline in international food and energy
prices offset the fall in international cotton
prices. These developments, accompanied
by a decline in foreign direct investment and
other flows turned the overall balance of
payments into a deficit of 1.6 percent of GDP
in 2009. The real effective exchange rate in
December 2009 appreciated by 1.1 percent
year-on-year.

Driven by higher liquidity, broad
money expanded in the second half of
2009. Following the reduction in reserve
requirements from 15 to 9 percent in June
2009, banks increased credit to the economy
by 11 percent at the end of 2009.

10.
The authorities responded to the
crisis by enforcing a strong fiscal stimulus
in the first half of 2009, which needed to
be reversed in the second half owing to
lack of financing. The stimulus resulted in a
large increase in public expenditure, even as
revenue declined under weak economic
conditions. Despite a partial reversal in the
second half of the year, fiscal policy was
looser in 2009 compared to 2008; and the
fiscal deficit widened.
11.
Total revenue declined by 1 percent
of GDP in 2009, as the deceleration in
import growth and the increase in
exemptions led to a 7 percent nominal
decline in customs receipts. Domestic taxes
were in line with program projections.
12.
After an unsustainable increase in
public spending, a strong adjustment was
needed in the second half of 2009 to avoid
expenditure arrears. Large bonuses to civil
servants expanded the wage bill by
24 percent in nominal terms. Domestic
capital spending doubled in nominal terms
from 2008 to 2009 as a result of a surge in
investment in the first half of the year,
including the carryover of CFAF 113 billion
(3.8 percent of GDP) of unfunded
expenditure commitments from 2008. This
fiscal stimulus produced strains on the
Treasury, which were addressed in the

second half of the year by strengthening tax collections, freezing expenditure commitments
and new bonuses to civil servants, and enforcing more rigorous controls on expenditure
execution.
13.
The overall fiscal deficit more than doubled to 7.3 percent in 2009. About twothirds of the deficit was financed from external grants and concessional loans, including the
counterpart of the SDR allocation. Additional financing was mobilized on the regional
market and through one-off measures, and about CFAF 50 billion (1.4 percent of GDP) of
expenditure commitments were carried over into 2010.
III. ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION DISCUSSIONS
14.
The Article IV Consultation discussions focused on policies to enhance growth
prospects. The authorities’ main challenge is to contain the impact of the crisis in the short
run and achieve higher sustainable growth in the medium term to progress toward the MDGs.
The authorities agreed the economy could reach its potential growth rate of 6 percent by
2013, provided appropriate policy measures are adopted.2
15.
To achieve this growth, it will be critical to increase investment while
maintaining stable macroeconomic conditions. The mission argued that, if adequate
concessional financing can be secured, an annual level of public investment of about
9 percent of GDP over the medium term would be consistent with the country’s development
needs and absorption capacity constraints. To enhance fiscal and debt sustainability, public
investment should be financed primarily with external concessional funds, while the basic
primary fiscal balance should gradually be brought to a surplus by mobilizing tax revenue
and containing the increase in nonpriority current expenditure. Measures to improve external
competitiveness will support the growth objective. PFM reforms to increase the effectiveness
of public spending, improve the provision of utilities, and enhance the business climate will
increase productivity.
16.
In support of these objectives, the mission discussed with the authorities the
results of the updated debt sustainability analysis (DSA) and of the two background
papers for the Article IV Consultation. The updated DSA confirmed earlier results of a
moderate risk of debt distress. The two background papers analyze the effect of the wage bill
on sustainability of public and external debt and the impact of the composition of
expenditure on economic development.
17.
The authorities agreed with the thrust of the mission’s analysis and noted its
consistency with their Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS). The GPRS,
which is currently being updated for 2010–14, will achieve a higher sustainable growth rate

and expand employment. The authorities also intend to develop sectoral and local
development strategies, encourage the diversification of agriculture, promote female and
youth employment, and strengthen social protection and the legal rights of the poor.
A. The Macroeconomic Impact of Public Wage Policies
18.
The mission presented the results of a study showing that, if the wage bill
continued to increase in line with recent trends, it would compromise debt and fiscal
sustainability by generating excessive deficits or by crowding out growth-enhancing
public investment.3 From 2000 through 2009, the wage bill in Benin grew at an average real
annual rate of 9.6 percent, compared to an average real GDP growth of 4.2 percent. From
2007 to 2009, wage bill growth accelerated to an average real rate of 14.7 percent. This
growth was driven by an increase in allowances and bonuses to civil servants. If these trends
persist and if the growth in the total wage bill were accommodated by a corresponding
increase in total expenditure, the overall fiscal deficit would widen by 6½ percentage points
to 10 percent of GDP by 2015. If instead total spending and the corresponding fiscal deficit
were maintained at the level projected under the authorities’ program, there is a risk that
spending on wages crowds out public investment, with an adverse impact on long-term
growth. In this case, fiscal and debt sustainability would be compromised in the long run.
Taking into account population growth and the intent to make progress toward the MDGs,
there will be limited scope for increasing civil service wages without corresponding increases
in civil service productivity.
19.
The second study by the mission suggests that excessive wage increases for civil
servants could result in lower growth, more unemployment, and larger income
disparities in Benin.4 This study estimates the macroeconomic impact of alternative
decisions in the allocation of public expenditure between wages and public investment under
two scenarios. In the first, the overall expenditure envelope is unchanged compared with the
authorities’ program, and public expenditure is merely reallocated between wages and public
investment. In the second scenario, an increase in expenditure financed by additional external
grants is used either to increase civil servant wages or to increase investment. The study
shows that, under both scenarios, an increase in civil servant wages would depress growth,
increase unemployment, and widen income disparities, reflecting the likely spillovers of
public sector wages onto the private sector. At the root of these effects is the use of civil
service wages as a benchmark for wage negotiations in the formal private sector; a public
wage increase thus increases labor costs in the private sector and thereby reduces private

labor demand and investment. By comparison, an increase in public investment increases
productivity and thereby encourages investment, employment, and growth.
20.
Based on these studies, the mission emphasized that limiting growth of the public
wage bill over the medium term is essential to preserving fiscal and debt sustainability
and improving competitiveness. These objectives could be achieved by following the
mission’s earlier recommendations of implementing a new institutional framework for
centralized wage bargaining and introducing multiyear labor contracts for civil servants.
These measures should reduce pressures on the wage bill by eliminating successive rounds of
wage negotiations and by linking wage increases to available budgetary resources over the
medium term. Increases in public wage bills also reduce unit labor cost competitiveness,
given their influence on private wages.
21.
The authorities acknowledged the importance of containing growth in the wage
bill but underlined that implementing this policy will be difficult politically. They noted
that labor unions are intensifying their wage demands ahead of the 2011 presidential and
legislative elections, with key categories of employees, including teachers and health care
workers, engaging in prolonged strikes. They underscored that the main challenge in this
area is to maintain wage restraint without compromising social peace and to ensure adequate
provision of essential public services. They shared the mission’s view that the move toward
centralized wage bargaining should facilitate progress in this direction by preventing
concessions to one sector from triggering new demands from other sectors. They also noted
that, from now on, civil servants will not be paid for strike days.
22.
The mission encouraged the authorities to undertake a broader reform of the
civil service. Although the need to contain the budgetary costs may be the most pressing
concern, a comprehensive civil service reform is needed to increase efficiency in the
provision of public services and better target the government’s human resources toward
priority sectors. Essential in this respect is the ability to attract, retain, and motivate wellqualified civil servants. The ongoing study of the civil service remuneration system,
commissioned by the authorities, will provide detailed information on the use of the wage
bill and the actual remuneration for different staff categories.
23.
The authorities agreed that a comprehensive civil service reform is needed to
establish a prodevelopment administration. They committed to adopting a comprehensive
reform strategy based on the study recommendations by June 2011.

B. External Sustainability and Competitiveness
24.
Benin’s external sustainability
assessment and survey-based indicators
point to an erosion of competitiveness in
2009. The real effective exchange rate
(REER) is overvalued by 13–22 percent at
the end of 2009 (Figures 9–11). These
results are consistent with the assessment
in the 2010 Article IV Consultation for the
WAEMU region and confirm the
importance of pursuing prudent policies
and accelerating structural reforms.
25.
Business climate indicators also
highlight a loss of competitiveness. In the
last four years, Benin moved down to the
bottom 10th and 20th percentiles of all
countries surveyed by the World Bank and
the World Economic Forum, respectively;
and ranked among the least competitive
countries in the WAEMU region in 2010.
26.
The authorities shared the
mission’s concerns about the erosion of
competitiveness and the overvaluation of
the real exchange rate, which could
jeopardize Benin’s growth potential.
They restated their commitment to improve
external competitiveness and the business
climate. To this effect, fiscal policy is
being tightened, and an ambitious
structural reform agenda is being
implemented aimed at reducing the cost of
doing business in Benin. The authorities
confirmed that Benin had not imposed
measures that could give rise to exchange
restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction.

C. Health of the Financial Sector
27.
Commercial banks’ asset quality has improved. The ratio of nonperforming loans
declined from 9.2 percent in 2008 to 8.1 percent in 2009, and the capital adequacy ratio of
the

15
five largest banks (holding 79 percent of deposits) was constant at about 11.6 percent during
the period. Banks indicated that performance of their loan portfolios had suffered from
government payment delays earlier in 2009, but the situation had recently improved.
28.
The authorities expect the capital of banks to strengthen significantly in 2010, in
line with new WAEMU requirements. Most banks have already submitted plans to comply
with the new own capital requirement of CFAF 5 billion.
29.
The mission urged the authorities to implement prompt corrective actions to
ensure that all banks comply with prudential regulations. Four banks continue to have
negative capital, two of which hold more than 5 percent of bank deposits. The planned
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) mission in the second half of 2010 could help
the authorities strengthen their supervisory framework.
30.
The authorities are closely following banks that do not meet the prudential
requirements. One of these banks, with a severe capital deficiency, has been put under
provisional administration. The authorities have delayed withdrawing the bank’s license and
granted it six months to implement corrective measures. Prudential ratios indicate that the
liquidity condition of the bank is comfortable, and the provisional administrator will shortly
determine the necessary increase in shareholders’ capital and other corrective measures.
31.
The mushrooming of unlicensed microfinance institutions poses potential risks
to the whole sector. The mission learned of a number of unlicensed microfinance
institutions offering unrealistically high deposit rates, possibly amounting to “Ponzi-type”
schemes. These institutions are reportedly attracting deposits away from commercial banks.
The mission alerted the authorities to the risks of these operations and urged the authorities
to ensure that all operating microfinance institutions are licensed and properly supervised.
32.
The authorities reassured the mission that they had informed the judicial system
of certain unauthorized microfinance institutions. They indicated that they would
intervene if and when necessary to protect depositors and would strengthen the licensing and
supervision of all microfinance institutions.
IV. THE NEW ECF ARRANGEMENT
33.
Building on lessons learned from the previous arrangement, the authorities’
proposal for the new three-year ECF arrangement will maintain macroeconomic
stability and accelerate structural reforms to contain the negative impact on Benin of
the global economic crisis in the short run and increase sustainable growth over the
medium term. In this context, the program will:
 Raise annual real GDP growth from 3.2 percent in 2010 to 6 percent by 2013,
 Hold inflation below the WAEMU convergence criterion of 3 percent, and

16
 Reduce the external current account deficit to 7 percent of GDP by 2013.
The pursuit of these objectives will be supported by containment of domestic demand
through a prudent fiscal policy and a moderate WAEMU regional monetary policy under the
fixed peg with the euro (with broad money projected to increase by 5.4 percent in 2010). The
fiscal anchor of the program is to stabilize the total public debt to GDP ratio at around
25 percent of GDP over the medium term.
34.

Fiscal policy will preserve debt sustainability, by:

 Increasing the basic primary fiscal balance through a stronger mobilization of revenue
and a more rigorous management of public expenditure (Memorandum on Economic and
Financial Policies [MEFP], ¶15). Tax revenue will be increased from 16.0 percent of
GDP in 2009 to 19.3 percent of GDP by 2013 through reforms in tax policy and
administration (MEFP ¶16). Public expenditure will be kept at about 26 percent of GDP,
while improving public expenditure management and containing the growth of the public
wage bill (MEFP ¶17–19). The authorities plan to develop a tracking system for priority
expenditures (MEFP ¶28). Staff expects to be able to track priority spending starting with
the 2011 budget.
 Financing the overall fiscal deficit primarily through external concessional sources
(MEFP ¶20). The proposed ECF arrangement is expected to play a catalytic role,
facilitating the mobilization of new budget support. Notwithstanding the new Fund policy
on debt limits for low-income countries, the authorities do not plan to borrow on
nonconcessional terms for the time being.
35.
These measures will create fiscal space for growth-enhancing priority
expenditure (MEFP ¶15). Public investment will be kept at about 9 percent of GDP
annually throughout the period, and its effectiveness will be enhanced by improving the
selection and monitoring of projects, and strengthening transparency and accountability in
public procurement contracts. The use of exceptional payment procedures outside the
expenditure chain will be strictly limited and monitored as an indicative target under the
program.
36.
Monetary policy conducted by the regional central bank will continue to be
consistent with the objective of price stability. The BCEAO will continue to use interest
rate policy to keep inflation under control and maintain a comfortable level of official
international reserves (MEFP ¶35).
37.
The program will be supported by structural reforms to strengthen external
competitiveness and improve the business climate (MEFP ¶21). These reforms will
improve the mobilization of revenue, and the quality and efficiency of public expenditure,
enhancing transparency and accountability in public financial management, widening the
role of the private sector, and modernizing the public administration. The authorities also
plan to introduce “second generation” reforms to improve land registration and property

17
rights and the financial and judiciary systems (MEFP ¶12). Microfinance supervision will be
strengthened, and more resources will be devoted to encouraging youth entrepreneurship in
agriculture and the establishment of small and medium enterprises (MEFP ¶27).
A. Fiscal Policy in 2010
38.
Fiscal policy will support the economic recovery in 2010, while preserving fiscal
and debt sustainability. Economic activity is expected to remain subdued. Real GDP
growth is projected to pick up marginally from 2009 to 3.2 percent of GDP as demand for
exports remains anemic amid persistent uncertainties on the external economic outlook, most
notably from Nigeria.
39.
The 2010 budget, while based on optimistic projections, will have more prudent
assumptions. The authorities cannot muster political support in parliament to adopt a
supplementary budget, but have committed to executing the budget in accordance with the
fiscal projections agreed to with Fund staff. Starting with the 2011 budget, they will present
the draft budget law to parliament in line with the Fund-supported program (MEFP ¶18).
40.
Government revenue is projected to rebound in 2010. Improvements in tax
administration, selected tax increases, and the planned sale of three third-generation Global
System for Mobile (GSM) Communication licenses are projected to boost revenue to
20.6 percent of GDP (MEFP ¶30). Public expenditure will increase as a share of GDP and
thus continue to provide a stimulus to the economy. The increase in the wage bill will be
limited to 7.7 percent in nominal terms, reflecting wage concessions already granted to the
education sector in early 2010. Expenditure on transfers and purchases of goods and services
will increase by 0.5 percent of GDP. Capital spending will be maintained in line with the
2009 level by mobilizing more concessional financing from donors. The domestically
financed portion of capital spending also includes the CFAF 50 billion (1.4 percent of GDP)
in expenditure carryover from 2009, thus ensuring that all expenditure commitments are
financed in 2010 (MEFP ¶32–33).
41.
A smaller deficit will strengthen debt sustainability. The basic primary deficit is
projected to be reduced by 3.5 percentage points to 0.3 percent of GDP. The overall deficit
will decline less (1.4 percent of GDP), reflecting more external financing of investment
(MEFP ¶34). The deficit will be financed primarily with external concessional budget
support. The World Bank approved a $30 million Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC)6 credit in April 2010. In addition, the African Development Bank, the EU, and the French
government have committed CFAF 22.2 billion (0.7 percent of GDP) in additional budget
support. The authorities will cover the remaining financing gap with additional assistance
from multilateral and bilateral donors, and the proposed ECF arrangement. Staff expects the
program to be fully financed.
42.
Privatization proceeds will be saved, pending discussions with Fund staff on
their use (MEFP ¶23). These include CFAF 17.5 billion (0.5 percent of GDP) from the sale

18
of shares of the cement company (Société de Ciments d’Onigbolo) received in March 2010,
and the proceeds from the forthcoming privatization of Benin Telecom. The authorities
agreed on the principle that these resources should be used to finance investment projects
with a high social rate of return.
43.
Preliminary data indicate that fiscal performance through the first quarter of
2010 was broadly in line with program projections. Income tax receipts were
CFAF 1.1 billion higher than targeted and helped offset part of the shortfall in customs
collections (CFAF 6.6 billion). Primary expenditure was in line with program projections,
thus keeping the basic primary balance to a small deficit of CFAF 6.2 billion (0.2 percent of
GDP). The authorities cleared all end-2009 outstanding bills by March 2010, leading to an
overall cash deficit (excluding grants) of CFAF 62.5 billion (1.9 percent of GDP).
B. Structural Reforms
44.
Fiscal reforms in 2010 will improve revenue collection and public financial
management. Legislation will be introduced to establish a personal income tax, which will
expand the tax base. The authorities also intend to introduce a more favorable tax regime for
private savings and small and medium enterprises. Moreover, the tax and customs
administration will be strengthened by coordinating the tax collection agencies, reinforcing
their inspection capacity, refining the targeting of controls, and enhancing the use of
information technologies (MEFP ¶16). The new public procurement code will be fully
implemented (MEFP ¶19). The organic budget law will be revised in line with WAEMU
guidelines. Program budgeting will be extended to all branches of public administration and
controls at all levels of budget implementation will be improved (MEFP ¶18).
45.
The authorities called for bids for the implementation of the one-stop window at
the Port of Cotonou in May 2010. The new system will modernize the clearance process
through the port and increase transparency in port and customs operations. The one-stop
window is expected to be completed by the end of 2010 for the Port of Cotonou and to be
extended to the customs department by June 2011.
46.
The privatization of a majority stake of Benin Telecom to a strategic investor
will be completed by the third quarter of 2010. An additional six percent of the company
will be sold to domestic investors.
47.
A global strategy will be adopted in 2011 to reform the civil service. It will
include a comprehensive revision of the remuneration system. Measures to improve the
actuarial balance of the pension fund will also be implemented (MEFP ¶17, ¶25).
48.
The restructuring of the state-owned electricity company, SBEE, is underway
with a plan to launch its privatization by the end of 2011 (MEFP ¶22). Ahead of the
privatization, the authorities plan to implement a regulatory framework for the electricity
sector, including a transparent system for determining electricity tariffs.

19
C. Access, Disbursements, and Program Monitoring
49.
The proposed access level for the three-year arrangement is 120 percent of
quota, equivalent to SDR 74.28 million. It aligns with the ECF norm for a country like
Benin with less than 100 percent of the quota outstanding (Table 6). The proposed access
would be disbursed in seven equal semiannual disbursements (Table 7). SDR 10.62 million
would become available after Board approval of the arrangement.
50.
The program will be monitored through quantitative performance criteria,
indicative targets, and structural benchmarks (MEFP Tables 1 and 2). The latter are in
areas that are macrocritical and related to the Fund’s area of expertise. The indicative target
on the public wage bill under the previous ECF arrangement has been dropped. Performance
under the program will be monitored with semiannual reviews.
D. Risks and Safeguards
51.
The lack of a government majority in parliament and the 2011 election cycle are
the largest risks to program implementation. Other risks are related to: (1) trade union
pressures for public wage increases, which could endanger fiscal sustainability;
(2) uncertainties about the pace of recovery; and (3) weaker-than-anticipated donor support.
52.
Safeguards are in place to ensure the appropriate use of Fund resources and the
authorities’ capacity to repay. The most recent safeguards assessment of the BCEAO was
completed on March 1, 2010. The 2010 update assessment found that the BCEAO continues
to have controls in place at the operational level. The overall governance framework should
nonetheless be strengthened by the addition of an audit committee to ensure that the Board of
Directors exercises appropriate oversight over the control structure, including the audit
mechanisms and financial statements. The upcoming implementation (2010) of the
Institutional Reform of the WAEMU and the BCEAO should help correct that situation.
Efforts to fully implement the International Financial Reporting Standards reporting
framework should also be pursued. Benin’s capacity to repay the Fund is sound (Table 6).
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
53.
The global economic crisis continues to affect Benin adversely. Following a sharp
deceleration in 2009, growth is projected to be weak in 2010. The medium-term outlook is
more favorable, provided the authorities continue to implement prudent macroeconomic
policies and their ambitious structural reform agenda. Continued support from the
international community in support of the authorities’ objectives will be essential for Benin
to make further progress toward the MDGs.
54.
The main macroeconomic challenge ahead is to mitigate the impact of the crisis
in the short term, while reaching higher sustainable growth over the medium term. For
2010, there is still scope for extending fiscal support to the economy. However, over the
medium-term, a marked fiscal adjustment should be enforced to preserve fiscal and debt

20
sustainability. In particular, the growth of the public wage bill should be limited to preserve
fiscal space for priority spending to support growth and poverty alleviation.
55.
The government’s economic program is geared properly to pursue these
objectives. The planned medium-term fiscal adjustment will strengthen fiscal and debt
sustainability while leaving adequate fiscal space for priority social and investment
expenditure. The structural reform agenda will facilitate this adjustment by strengthening
revenue collection and public financial management, and accelerate growth by improving
external competitiveness and the business climate.
56.
A prudent implementation of the 2010 budget in line with the program is
essential to sustaining the fiscal position. The public wage bill should be limited to the
program projections by adhering to the new framework for centralized wage bargaining and
moving toward multi-year wage contracts. The authorities’ intention to save the privatization
proceeds and use them, after consultation with Fund staff, to finance projects with a high
social rate of return is welcome. Future draft budgets should align with the program in order
to avoid large unfunded expenditure carryovers and to increase budget transparency.
57.
The structural reform agenda is appropriately ambitious. The implementation of
the one-stop window at the Port of Cotonou promises to increase customs collections
significantly and improve transparency in port operations. Civil service reform will provide a
critical contribution to reorienting the public administration in favor of economic
development. In addition, the implementation of a regulatory framework for the electricity
sector, including an automatic tariff adjustment mechanism, will pave the way for the
privatization of the electricity company.
58.
On this basis, and given satisfactory performance under the previous
arrangement, staff supports the authorities’ request for a new ECF arrangement. The
arrangement will provide essential financial support to cover the temporary imbalances
associated with the implementation of the authorities’ economic program by catalyzing
additional concessional assistance from other donors. Risks to program implementation are
sizeable and mainly related to the election cycle. Program conditionality, however, has been
designed to mitigate these risks going forward.
59.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultations with Benin be held on a
24 month cycle, subject to the decision on consultation cycles in program countries.

LETTER OF INTENT
May 27, 2010
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, DC 20431

Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
From 2005 to 2009, we implemented a financial program supported by the IMF that enabled
us to make substantial progress toward macroeconomic stability, with moderate inflation and
a significant resurgence of economic growth. Under the combined effect of fiscal
consolidation, optimal management of the public debt, and debt relief under the HIPC
initiative and MDRI, we have rebalanced public finances and undertaken structural forms to
enhance competitiveness. Real GDP growth accelerated steadily, reaching 5 percent in 2008.
The fallout from the global economic crisis has posed new challenges. Economic growth
slowed considerably in 2009 and projections suggest that it will remain sluggish in 2010
because of the decline in global economic activity, the fall in commodity prices, and the
decline in remittances from Beninese expatriates. This decline in growth has strained the
government's financial position and is hampering our efforts to accelerate economic growth
and reduce poverty in Benin. Stagnation of public revenues in 2009 and increases in
spending on wages and investment during the first half of the year to contain the domestic
impact of the crisis put pressure on the government Treasury. In the second half of the year,
these pressures were eased by fiscal adjustments to control public expenditure and to
mobilize additional concessional budgetary assistance from financial and technical partners
(including BCEAO financing backed by the IMF’s additional SDR allocations in August and
September 2009). These efforts made it possible to avoid a new accumulation of domestic
arrears. However, the 2009 fiscal year ended with an overall fiscal deficit (on a payment
order basis) of 7.3 percent of GDP.
In 2010 and for the medium term, the government will step up its efforts to rebalance public
finances, limit the impact of the global economic crisis on growth and on the most vulnerable
segments of the population, support the economic recovery, and continue to implement the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy to meet the Millennium Development Goals.
The authorities are resolved to implement a macroeconomic and structural reform program
that will support the economic recovery in the short term and place the country on the road to
stronger sustained growth in the medium term, while preserving macroeconomic stability and
debt sustainability. On the macroeconomic policy side, this will mean pursuing a prudent
fiscal policy to maintain macroeconomic stability and preserve the fiscal space needed to
strengthen the social safety nets and support other priority social spending. Although
declining, the financing gaps will remain high (particularly in 2010). They should be covered

30
by additional budgetary assistance from our development partners. The government has
already begun to mobilize these funds.
This policy will be accompanied by structural reforms that will improve competitiveness and
establish a business environment more favorable to investment. These reforms will be
focused on improving fiscal management, strengthening the tax and customs administrations,
increasing the role of the private sector in the management of the public utilities, and
reforming the civil service to improve its efficiency and reduce recurrent fiscal costs for the
government.
The main features of the measures we plan to adopt under the framework of the new program
are outlined in the attached Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP). To
support its policies, the government asks the Executive Board of the IMF to approve a threeyear arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF), with access equivalent to
SDR 74.28 million (120 percent of quota).
The government of Benin will provide the IMF with all information on progress in the
implementation of its economic and financial policies. It believes the policies set out in the
MEFP will achieve the objectives of the program, and the government of Benin will adopt
any other measures needed to achieve the objectives of the program. The government will
consult with the IMF before adopting such additional measures or changing any of the
measures included in the MEFP, in accordance with IMF policies on such consultations.
The government authorizes the IMF to publish its staff report and the attached Memorandum
on Economic and Financial Policies.
Sincerely yours,
/s/

Idriss L. Daouda
Minister of Economy and Finance

APPENDIX I––ATTACHMENT I
MEMORANDUM ON ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
1.
During the past decade, the performance of the Beninese economy has been
satisfactory, with economic growth becoming more sustained in the past three years.
The country has progressed with fiscal consolidation and has kept consumer prices under
control despite the acceleration of inflation in 2008 as international food and fuel prices rose.
These encouraging results are attributable mainly to the fiscal space created by the
cancellation of external debt under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative and
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) as well as the implementation of economic and
financial policies supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under the PRGFsupported program. However, evaluations of policies implemented indicate that poverty has
not been reduced significantly owing to the volatility of economic growth, which has been
led mainly by the tertiary sector, while the majority of the population and labor force works
in the primary sector.
2.
The Beninese economy began its upturn in 2006. Growth was led by the improved
performance of the tertiary sector—transport and commerce in particular—and agriculture.
Nevertheless, the real GDP growth rate remained below the minimum required to achieve the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), partially owing to the limited contribution of the
secondary sector as a result of shortages and high cost of electricity.
3.
However, Benin began to feel the effects of the global economic crisis in 2009.
Preliminary indicators show that GDP growth slowed to 2.7 percent, compared to an initial
projection of 6.1 percent and an average of 4.5 percent during the previous three years.
Cotton production was affected by lower international prices and the tertiary sector suffered
as Nigeria’s imports declined. Agriculture, which has benefited from ample food production
with the implementation of the Emergency Food Security Program and technical and
financial assistance from our development partners, helped to keep economic growth positive
in 2009. Transportation and communications also played an important role.
4.
Inflation has decelerated in recent years. The slowing of price increases observed
since 2006 was reversed temporarily in 2008 because of the sharp rise in international prices
for food and fuel, but inflation declined in 2009 as international prices came down. The
government's efforts to promote food production also contributed to this decline. The
inflation rate (year-on-year) dropped from 9.9 percent in December 2008 to -2.9 percent in
December 2009, yielding an average inflation rate of 2.2 percent in 2009.
5.
Serious social tensions and the global economic crisis had a negative impact on
government finances in 2009. The basic primary deficit declined to 3.8 percent of GDP and
the overall fiscal deficit on a payment order basis fell to 7.3 percent of GDP. Owing to

32
weakening customs revenues, which declined 7 percent from 2008 levels, total revenues
remained almost steady in nominal terms as compared to 2008 despite the rise in domestic
tax revenues and nontax revenues. At the same time, expenditure increased by 16 percent in
2009. The wage bill rose 24 percent owing to increased benefits paid to civil servants and
hiring in the priority sectors of health and education. Domestically financed investments
doubled compared with 2008, partly reflecting the execution of CFAF 113.2 billion of
carryovers. This placed a great deal of pressure on the government's cash flow, which was
offset by the mobilization of more than CFAF 100 billion in additional resources including:
(1) BCEAO financing backed by the SDR allocations of CFAF 32.8 billion; (2) bond
refinancing by the BCEAO of CFAF 36.5 billion; (3) a V-Flex grant from the European
Union of CFAF 16.4 billion; and (4) an African Development Bank loan of
CFAF 7.8 billion.
6.
The government made important decisions in the final months of 2009 to
improve the fiscal situation. As budget execution weakened owing to the fallout of the
international economic and financial crisis, the government prepared, adopted, and
implemented a fiscal consolidation plan that included: (1) a firm limit on bonuses,
allowances, and other benefits paid to civil servants; (2) an acceleration of the process of
regularizing exceptional payment orders (ordres de paiement) dating back to 2006, 2007, and
2008, and a strict limit on the use of such exceptional procedures; (3) a strengthening of
budget monitoring with the involvement of the Treasury committee; (4) an audit of the float;
and (5) an emergency action plan to increase tax revenues. In addition, the government
decided to: (1) halt capital spending commitments as of September 28, 2009; (2) reduce the
end of December 2009 fiscal target for stipends and pensions to CFAF 5.3 billion; (3) reduce
other expenditure and transfers by CFAF 24.5 billion; and (4) postpone CFAF 50 billion in
capital spending to the 2010 fiscal year. These measures, along with the mobilization of
additional budgetary assistance, made it possible to reduce the float by CFAF 27 billion in
2009.
7.
The external current account deficit excluding grants increased. In fact, it
reached 10.8 percent of GDP in 2009 from annual average of 8.8 percent from 2006 to 2008.
This evolution of the external situation is essentially linked to: (i) the decline in net services
and public and private transfers, which were affected by the international economic crisis;
and, to a lesser extent, (ii) the worsening trade balance related to the more pronounced
slowdown in cotton and textile exports. In contrast, the financial and capital accounts
improved significantly with additional flows of public capital from concessional loans and
from allocation of SDRs to deal with the effects of the international economic crisis. In spite
of this, the overall balance registered a deficit of 1.6 percent of GDP.
8.
Monetary policy at the regional level responded to the challenges of the crisis. In
particular, on June 12, 2009, the monetary authorities decided to reduce the intervention rate
from 4.75 percent to 4.25 percent and to reduce the required reserve ratio for Benin from
15 percent to 9 percent. Foreign assets declined as the global economic crisis affected
exports and private transfers. Credit to the private sector increased by 7.5 percent in 2009
owing to rising domestic demand in the second half of the year. The net government position

33
worsened compared to the end of December 2009 as a result of the significant pressure of
expenditure on the government Treasury.
9.
Structural reforms, particularly those of public enterprises, have made good
progress. They were implemented steadily and with determination, reflecting the
government's commitment to transforming economic structures in order to ensure the
competitiveness of the national economy and to establish the conditions for strong economic
growth:


In the cotton sector, the reforms focused on four principal axes: (i) the definition of a
new approach for the comprehensive reform of the cotton sector; (ii) the divestiture of
SONAPRA’s industrial assets and the creation on October 11, 2008, of the Société
pour le Développement du Coton (SODECO), 51 percent of whose capital is now
held by a strategic investor since the sale of shares reserved for the public; (iii) the
establishment in December 2008 of the Agricultural Input Purchasing Pool (CAI)
intended to provide a satisfactory response to the problem of the supply of inputs on
which the success of the agricultural policy depends; and (iv) the ongoing
development of the institutional framework for agricultural policy.



The divestiture of the Hôtel Croix du Sud and the Hôtel de la Plage and the
withdrawal of the government from the Continental Bank–Bénin were completed in
2007 and 2008. In September 2009, the government called for bids to reform the
commercial lumber affiliate, Société du Bois du Bénin. The final decision and the
signing of the legal documents for the transaction took place in December 2009,
finalizing the transfer to the private sector of 65.0 percent of the industrial assets of
the Office National du Bois, and planning its rehabilitation and the development of
the wood processing industry.



With the assistance and advice of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the
outsourcing of construction of the new south container terminal consisting of two
accommodation berths, with Millennium Challenge Account financing, was
organized and carried out in the September 2009 by competitive bidding. This project
was to improve performance of the Autonomous Port of Cotonou.



In March 2010, the government stake in the Société des Ciments d’Onigbolo (SCO),
equivalent to 51 percent of the shares of the company, was sold to a private investor
for an amount of CFAF 20 billion, of which CFAF 17.5 billion have already been
cashed. The balance, namely CFAF 2.5 billion, will be paid once the modalities to
terminate the lease management contract have been finalized by mutual agreement.



The process of opening the capital of Benin Telecom to private investors is on track.
The candidates have been prequalified, and bids were called for in April 2010.



In addition, the new strategy for the civil service pension fund (Fonds national des
retraites du Bénin—FRNB) and the financial audit of the accounts of the electricity
company (SBEE) were completed. Based on the financial audit of the SBEE, the

34
government decided in March 2010 to convert part (CFAF 14.02 billion) of the loans
on-lent to the SBEE in order to replenish the company's capital; to guarantee its debt
service to the West African Asset Management Company (Société Ouest Africaine de
Gestion d’Actifs—SOAGA) in the amount of CFAF 15.7 billion, which was
rescheduled over seven years with a two-year grace period; and to securitize the
SBEE’s debt to the international power utility CEB in the amount of
CFAF 25 billion.


The use of the single tax identification number (TIN) was extended to all importers
and exporters and all large enterprises, and the data interconnection between the tax
department (DGID) and the customs department (DGDDI) became operational.



As regards the one-stop window at the customs and the Port of Cotonou, the Council
of Ministers selected a computerized port operator management system that will be
installed by the end of December 2010 and that should be integrated with a similar
system at customs operations to implement the federation of the various participants.



In addition, the administrative capacity of the revenue agencies has been improved
through more efficient use of the IT system. The tax base has been expanded, and
efforts to combat fraud have been stepped up, as has the tracking of the value of
imports. The government has created a reform management unit (UGR) to improve
the fiscal management system at the Ministry of Economy and Finance; the UGR is
responsible for tracking the implementation of action plans adopted at the beginning
of 2009 and for updating it every year.



To demonstrate its determination to implement the program, the government has (i)
increased, in April 2010, all electricity rates by 10 CFAF per kWh on average, to
improve SBEE’s financial situation; (ii) launched, in May 2010, a call for bids for the
establishment of a one-stop shop for port operations at the Port Autonome de
Cotonou (PAC).



The government will introduce by the end of 2010 the two outstanding reforms from
the last PRGF arrangement. They include (i) the elaboration of an IT master plan for
the tax department (DGID), which will be adopted after its audit to generalize the
TIN; and (ii) the extension of the ASYCUDA++ computer system to 12 additional
regional customs offices.
OBJECTIVES OF THE NEW PROGRAM (2010–13)

10.
In the wake of the international economic crisis, Benin faces deteriorating
external and fiscal positions, making it imperative to (i) accelerate the implementation of
structural measures and (ii) obtain financial and technical support from the development
partners to counteract the adverse effects of the crisis on the economy and to lay the
foundations for a lasting economic recovery. In the short term, Benin should maintain
macroeconomic stability and mitigate the effects of the crisis on economic growth and on the
decline in private investment and migrants’ remittances, which benefit the most vulnerable
segments of the population. The government intends, therefore, to conduct a countercyclical

35
policy, including introducing social safety net arrangements, while preserving debt
sustainability. In the medium term, a more rapid implementation of structural measures
should improve the competitiveness of the economy and promote a sustainable economic
recovery. These objectives aim to support the growth and poverty reduction strategy
currently in the process of being finalized.
Macroeconomic objectives
11.
To consolidate the achievements of previous economic programs, the
government has prepared an economic and financial program for 2010–13. This
program will contain the effects of the international economic and financial crisis, which is
undermining the economic recovery efforts undertaken since 2006, and will lay the
foundation for strong, balanced growth to meet the MDG. The objectives of the financial
program are consistent with the new poverty reduction strategy being prepared for 2010–14,
which will be a framework for technical and financial support from Benin’s development
partners.
12.
Aware of the risks presented by the global crisis for the short- and medium-term
outlook for the Beninese economy, the government intends to address this challenge
through a six-pronged strategy: (i) implement an economic policy focused on accelerating
growth and reducing poverty; (ii) increase competitiveness by improving infrastructure,
particularly through the adoption of an integrated framework for the development of the
transportation infrastructure, by mobilizing private investment in the management of new
port installations and the rehabilitation of the railroads and by opening the one-stop window;
(iii) improve the productivity of the agricultural sector to increase incomes in rural areas
while ensuring stable prices on urban markets; (iv) step up structural reforms by emphasizing
the restructuring of public enterprises; (v) modernize management and expenditure tracking
system of the revenue agencies and improve public financial management; and
(vi) implement the second-generation reforms (justice, land tenure, and financial services)
with the support of Millennium Challenge Account (MCA)-Benin.
13.
The implementation of the program will make it possible to accelerate economic
growth. The objective is to achieve a real GDP growth rate of at least 6 percent in the
medium term. This will be achieved under the framework of an inflation rate under 3 percent,
in line with the WAEMU convergence criteria. Growth will be led by higher public and
private investment and improved productivity as a result of ambitious structural reforms.
14.
Several priority actions have been identified and their implementation should
support improvement in the growth rate. The growth rate for the primary sector should
improve owing to: (i) the increased productivity of the cotton sector as the new sectoral
management framework is implemented and the central purchasing pool for agricultural
inputs starts; (ii) implementation of the diversification strategy through the development of
other targeted agricultural sectors; and (iii) improvement of agricultural research by
increasing the number of research staff and providing training in new technologies,
particularly biotechnology. The secondary sector is expected to achieve a higher level of
growth primarily owing to: (i) an increase in construction activities related to major public

36
works projects (the Godomey highway interchange, public housing, rural roads and tracks,
infrastructure to combat coastal erosion, and so on); (ii) enhanced processing of food
products in response to the expected increase in agricultural output; and (iii) increased
activity in the cement sector with the startup of the new cement factory. In contrast, the
tertiary sector is expected to continue to feel the effects of the financial crisis in the short
term, although these should be mitigated by continued efforts to modernize the Port of
Cotonou through the extension of the breakwater and purchase of a new computer system
integrated with the overall port operation system.
Fiscal policy and public financial management
15.
Fiscal consolidation will be continued to create the fiscal space needed to
increase priority spending in the social sectors while reducing budget deficits. Measures
will include improving mobilization of domestic revenues and more rigorously managing
public expenditure. Total revenues should increase from 19.2 percent of GDP during
2006–08 to 20.8 percent of GDP during 2010–13. Beyond cyclical factors, such as easing the
impact of the international financial crisis, tax revenues should show a significant
improvement, increasing to 8.7 percent of GDP owing to continued efforts to expand the tax
base, strengthen the tax and customs administrations, and combat fraud. Meanwhile, customs
revenues will stay at an average of around 10 percent of GDP during 2010–2013 as a result
of improvements in the customs administration that will offset downward pressure from the
implementation of the Economic Partnership Agreements with the European Union (which
will result in lower duties on European products) and from the transition to the regional tax
regime (that will entail a loss of revenue from the elimination of customs barriers and the
liberalization of intracommunity trade with other WAEMU countries).
16.
To improve tax and customs revenue collection, during the next three years we
plan to accelerate tax reforms, strengthen capacity and synergy between the tax and
customs administrations, and intensify efforts to combat fraud and corruption. The
report of the Task Force on Tax and Development will be used to this purpose. In particular,
there are plans to: (i) implement the personal taxation reform; (ii) expand the tax base;
(iii) tax informal activities; (iv) enhance the dialogue between the customs and tax
administrations and the private sector; (v) strengthen the capacities of the tax and customs
administrations (training, purchase of adequate equipment, and so forth); (vi) implement an
appropriate tax regime for small savers, microcredit, and microenterprises; (vii) broadly and
fully implement the single tax identification number (TIN); (viii) install joint (customs–tax
department) teams to combat commercial fraud; (ix) enhance the capacity of customs
inspectors in financial and accounting investigations and audits; (x) fully computerize the
customs and tax units, establish an interface between the customs and taxation computer
systems, and systematically use reliable interconnections between units in the two
administrations; (xi) improve audit targeting of controls; and (xii) strengthen controls over
transit trade. An action plan will be adopted to implement all of these reforms, which will be
guided by units to be installed in each agency. The UGR will be responsible for monitoring
the implementation of these reforms.

37
17.
Expenditures will be targeted to support growth and poverty reduction. Total
expenditure is expected to represent 25.9 percent of GDP on average during the period
2010–13, an increase of 4 points from 2006–08. This increase will take place in a context of
improved public financial management, enhanced capacity to absorb resources, and
improved quality of expenditure. An overall civil service reform strategy will be adopted,
beginning with a review of the civil service remuneration policy to promote the
establishment of an administration focused on development that works in the general interest
and in service of the private sector. In contrast, capital spending will increase by
3 percentage points of GDP during 2010–13 compared with 2006–08. The increase will be a
result of the implementation of infrastructure programs and projects that should revitalize the
growth pillars identified in “Benin 2025, Agenda for an Emerging Economy”.
18.
The authorities also believe it is essential to advance the budget preparation
process to improve the effectiveness and transparency of public financial management.
The authorities will continue to reform the organic law on the budget to create resultsoriented management in line with WAEMU directives on the subject. The authorities intend
to take advantage of technical assistance from the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department and to
get assistance from other technical and financial partners. Moreover, starting with the 2011
budget law, the draft budgets presented to the National Assembly will be consistent with the
program agreed to with IMF staff.
19.
Capacity-building for those involved in the expenditure process will involve
implementation of the following reforms: (i) effectively implementing the public
procurement code; (ii) implementing an integrated public procurement management system
(SIGMAP); (iii) strengthening public procurement procedures, particularly by limiting the
use of single tendering; (iv) adjusting the government budget and accounting classification in
line with performance-based management, (v) extending performance-based management to
all sectors of public administration through the design of program budgets, and
(vi) improving budget execution procedures. Achievement of these objectives will also be
linked to improvements in expenditure absorption capacity and a sustained level of
investment, particularly in infrastructure. Participants should prepare and apply the budget
appropriations utilization plan and the public procurement plan. Moreover, a harmonized
data and tracking/evaluation system for the public investment program (SHISEPIP) will be
created to monitor the rate of absorption of the capital spending.
20.
The government’s public debt management strategy is based on a consistent,
comprehensive vision of its debt policy. This strategy recommends the implementation of
timely measures to limit public debt to proportions compatible with the country's capacity to
honor its commitments and fully finance its development. The government will ensure that
financing will be grants or highly concessional external loans (with a grant element of at
least 35 percent), and it intends not to exceed an amount consistent with debt sustainability.
Structural reforms
21.
The government is aware that competitiveness is an essential component of
sustainable growth and is determined to implement structural reforms that will enable

38
it to handle the challenges facing it in the medium term. These reforms are part of the
strategy for implementing the vision contained in the “Benin 2025 Agenda,” and they will
serve as the foundation for improving the overall and sectoral competitiveness of the
economy. Reforms of public enterprises thus will open these companies to private-sector
investment or improve their financial viability and productivity so they contribute more to
the competitiveness of the economy. The government will therefore undertake various
reform efforts, particularly in the key sectors of telecommunications, energy, transportation,
and the civil service pension scheme.
22.
In the energy sector, the government in 2007 opted, following the ongoing
financial restructuring of the SBEE, to establish an asset management company on one
side, and a distribution company on the other side. The latter is being analyzed in depth
and its capital will be opened to the private sector, following the review of the
regulatory framework for the sector. Studies on this regulatory framework have already
begun with AFD financing and the results should enable us to adopt the new framework by
June 2011. This framework should lead to private sector investment in the production and
distribution of electricity and should also guarantee transparency in the electricity pricesetting mechanism with the establishment of a regulatory authority. The government also
plans to improve the SBEE’s financial position to reduce subsidies, which are a strain on the
government budget.
23.
In the telecommunications sector, the government plans to sell the majority of its
shares to a strategic partner by the third quarter of 2010. The 2009 audited financial
statements of Benin Telecom are, therefore, being prepared and should be ready by June
2010. Along with the financial statements for 2005–08, which are already available, they will
give investors an accurate picture of the financial position of the company. Sale of the shares
to a strategic partner should be completed during the third quarter of 2010. The government,
in coordination with the staff of the International Monetary Fund, will decide on the use of
the proceeds of the sale and the CFAF 20 billion from the sale of SCO.
24.
In the transportation and port services sector, the government also intends to
continue its privatization policy. The contract for managing the new container terminal
financed by Millennium Challenge Account funds was awarded to an international company.
Also, Benin and Niger have reached an agreement on outsourcing the management of the
OCBN.
25.
The government is continuing its reform of the civil service pension fund
(FNRB). To contain the fiscal impact of the FNRB deficit, it is essential that the pension
fund become more viable. An actuarial audit completed in September 2009 identified several
options for reform. Based on the recommendations of this audit, the government is preparing
a draft law to implement a new strategy that will reduce the actuarial deficit of the FNRB.
The draft law should be studied by the National Standing Commission on Dialogue and
Collective Negotiations between the Government and Union Federations and Groups by the
end of December 2010. The government will review the draft by June 2011 at the latest and
submit it to the National Assembly by December 2011.

39
26.
The government will seek to improve Benin's business environment and raise
Benin to the average level of the emerging countries by 2013. Achieving this objective
will require a reform effort and a significant commitment on the part of the authorities. The
government has therefore established a steering committee for this purpose headed by the
minister of state for development. The government adopted the report of this “Doing
Business” steering committee in June 2009 and decided to promote improvements in the
business environment in the short, medium and long terms by: (i) simplifying procedures and
reducing the cost and time required to set up a business and obtain construction permits;
(ii) improving shareholders’ protection against abuse by strengthening their procedural
rights; (iii) easing burdensome tax procedures and simplifying the payment of taxes by
reducing the number of returns to be filed and proposing a staggered payment option for
enterprises; (iv) simplifying customs clearance procedures by making the one-stop window
operational; and (v) improving the management of commercial disputes by training judges in
the use of simplified procedures that promote negotiated solutions.
27.
To ensure shared prosperity, the microfinance policy will be further enhanced
via the microcredit program for the very poor. In addition, the national program for
entrepreneurship and youth employment will be strengthened, and an agricultural partnership
project will be established with the help of the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) and the Songhai Centre. The resources allocated to these programs will be expanded
to cover a larger number of beneficiaries. As well, the financed projects will focus on
creation of high-performance small- and medium-sized enterprises that are part of the pillars
of growth identified in the "Benin 2025 Agenda."
THIRD-GENERATION GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY
(2010–14)
28.
The Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRSP) expired at the end of
2009 and the government has begun to prepare a new strategy. The new strategy will
focus on local and sectoral strategies and development issues that have not been dealt with in
depth. These issues include the employment of young people and women, the opening up of
agricultural production zones, the promotion of rural economic growth, the enhancement of
the legal capacity of the poor and social protection and solidarity. Similarly, organization of
the rural world and agricultural diversification, demographic changes, trade issues relating to
the ACP-EU Economic Partnership Agreements, and issues regarding climate change should
be examined. The new strategy should be more integrated and consolidate all sectoral
strategies and should be better adapted to all levels of Beninese society. It will also include
an action plan to develop a tracking system for social and priority expenditures. The
government will submit the final version of the strategy to the technical and financial
partners in July 2010.
MACROECONOMIC POLICY IN 2010
Macroeconomic framework
29.
In 2010 economic policy will focus on measures to counteract the international
economic and financial crisis. Growth should reach 3.2 percent in 2010 compared with

40
2.7 percent in 2009, sustained by continued reforms of the agricultural sector, a revitalization
of the construction sector, improved output in the cement sector with the startup of the new
cement factory, and continued modernization of the Port of Cotonou. Inflation should stay
below the community standard of 3 percent, owing in particular to the availability of food
products and easing of prices for imported commodities. The external current account
excluding grants should show a deficit of 9.7 percent of GDP.
Fiscal policy
30.
Total revenue should increase by 18.4 percent in 2010 to CFAF 681.9 billion or
20.6 percent of GDP. Tax revenues are expected to rise by 14.5 percent to
CFAF 275.8 billion, owing to expansion of the tax base, implementation of the urban land
registry, expanded controls by the audit and assessment units, training of audit officials to
use the computerized accounting system, computerization of the new tax centers for
medium-sized enterprises, taxation of informal activities, application of ordinary law to
domestically financed procurement contracts, and adoption of a favorable tax regime for
small savers, microcredit, and the informal sector. Customs revenue is expected to increase
by 15.8 percent to CFAF 299.7 billion in 2010 owing to the resumption of re-exports to
Nigeria. Nonetheless, several reforms are expected in 2010, such as the opening of four new
customs posts on the Nigerian border, further expansion of ASYCUDA++ to 12 new customs
offices, simplification of customs clearance procedures, and enhancement of measures to
combat corruption and fraud. In particular, the government intends to issue personal
identification numbers to all taxpayers and to end the systematic use of nonspecific numbers
by the end of December 2010. A 41.0 percent increase in nontax revenues to
CFAF 106.3 billion is also expected, owing to the sale of 3G GSM licenses and
improvements in collections by the Treasury Administration.
31.
The government will continue to limit recourse to exceptional budget execution
procedures (ordres de paiement) to a strict minimum in 2010. Punitive measures,
therefore, will be applied to recipients of unauthorized ordres de paiement (mandatory
repayment by recipients and/or denied access to SIGFIP for the ministries or institutions
involved).
32.
Total expenditure should stand at CFAF 876 billion, an increase of
approximately 9 percent in 2010. The wage bill is expected to increase by 7.7 percent, as a
result of the increase in the wage scale and grade drift for civil servants. Public investment
should stand at CFAF 320.9 billion in 2010, an increase of approximately 6.1 percent from
2009, based on continuation of infrastructure construction projects and implementation of the
agricultural mechanization program.
33.
The wage bill will be limited to CFAF 243.2 billion in 2010. In its decisions of
August 5, 2009, and October 7, 2009, the government decided not to grant new bonuses,
allowances, or other benefits to civil servants until the study of their remuneration system
was completed. The government stood by these commitments, although it had to agree to
adjust the salaries of employees in the higher education sector, whose remuneration was not
competitive enough to ensure that a disagreement on the salary adjustment timetable would

41
not result in a lost year for the university. This adjustment will take effect in October 2010.
Similarly, after several weeks of strikes, the government had to grant other categories of
teachers an increase in housing allowances, effective in October 2010, and a 25 percent
increase in base salary from January 2011. The total budgetary impact of these measures is
estimated at CFAF 3.4 billion in 2010 and approximately CFAF 20 billion per year during
2011–13. However, the government will take the necessary measures to keep the wage bill to
the aforementioned target of CFAF 243.2 billion in 2010. In this framework, the government
has established a committee of representatives of the government, labor unions, and social
partners to act as a single negotiating framework for salary demands. This should facilitate a
transparent national dialogue, leading to multiyear salary agreements that take account of the
government's financial capacity and its economic and social policy priorities.
34.
The overall deficit on a payment order basis, which stands at 7.3 percent of GDP
in 2009, is expected to remain high in 2010 at 5.9 percent of GDP. As a result, the
government will seek additional financial assistance from the international community in
2010 to cover the financing gap. Should the additional financing not materialize, the
government will cut the equivalent amount in nonpriority spending.
External sector and monetary policy
35.
The monetary policy conducted by the BCEAO will remain consistent with the
objective of price stability. The broad money growth rate, therefore, is forecast at
approximately 5.4 percent, reflecting an increase in credit to the economy and a rise in net
foreign assets. The BCEAO's key intervention instrument will be its interest rate policy,
which will depend on the impact of the economic crisis on the economies of the zone. The
BCEAO will continue to closely monitor inflationary trends and the official exchange
reserves.
36.
Inspection missions to the banks by the WAMU Banking Commission will
continue to monitor the financial system. These missions will make it possible to avoid
crises by identifying potential vulnerabilities. The government has asked for a Financial
Stability Assessment Program (FSAP) mission in 2010 and is committed to implementing
any resulting recommendations. The authorities intend to enhance banking supervision to
improve compliance with the prudential ratios and will also try to strengthen the application
of the regulatory framework to the microfinance sector.
Structural reforms
37.
Structural reforms will be accelerated to create conditions favorable to economic
recovery. The reforms will include, in particular the:
 Adoption by the Council of Ministers of all implementing decrees for the Public
Procurement Code by the end of September 30, 2010 (structural benchmark);
 Submission to the National Assembly of legislation introducing the personal income
tax by the end of October 31, 2010 (structural benchmark);

42
 Extension of the ASYCUDA++ computer system to 12 additional regional customs
offices by the end of December 31, 2010 (structural benchmark);
 Adoption of an IT master plan for the tax department (DGID) (after its audit to
generalize the TIN); development of a complete and integrated information system at
the DGID; modernization of the information system of the customs department
(DGDDI) and its extension to all units by the end of December 31, 2010 (structural
benchmark);
 Generalization of the TIN to all taxpayers and to all the units of the tax and customs
administration by the end of December 31, 2010 (structural benchmark);
 Generalization of the systematic use of the TIN by the DGDDI and the adoption of a
deadline for the abolition of the use of nonspecific numbers at the level of
ASYCUDA++ (0000000000000 and 299999999949) by the end of December 31,
2010 (structural benchmark);
 Adoption by decision of the Council of Ministers by the end of June 30, 2011 of a
comprehensive strategy to reform the civil service (structural benchmark);
 Implementation of the integration and federation of all the agents at customs and at
the Autonomous Port of Cotonou in the one-stop shop by the end of June 30, 2011
(structural benchmark);
 Adoption by decision of the Council of Ministers by the end of June 30, 2011 of a
regulatory framework governing the energy sector that will formally sanction the
opening of electricity distribution to private investors and the establishment of a
regulatory authority and of a system that will guarantee transparency in the electricity
price-setting mechanism (structural benchmark);
 The presentation to the National Assembly of a draft law governing pensions (based
on the final report of the actuarial audit of the FNRB) by the end of December 31,
2011 (structural benchmark).
Program Monitoring
38.
Program monitoring will be based on prior actions, performance criteria, and
structural and quantitative benchmarks (Tables 1 and 2). The definitions of these actions,
criteria, and benchmarks are contained in the attached Technical Memorandum of
Understanding (TMU). The authorities will report the data necessary for program monitoring
to the IMF, in accordance with the TMU. During the program period, the authorities will not:
introduce restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions or intensify any such restrictions without first consulting the Fund; introduce or
modify multicurrency practices; conclude bilateral payments agreements not compatible with
Article VIII of the IMF's Articles of Agreement; nor introduce restrictions on imports for
balance of payments purposes. The program will be subject to semiannual reviews; the first
review will be completed by December 31, 2010, and the second review by June 30, 2011.

APPENDIX I––ATTACHMENT II
TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
May 27, 2010
1.
This technical memorandum of understanding defines the prior actions, quantitative
performance criteria and benchmarks, and structural benchmarks for the Republic of Benin’s
program supported by the Extended Credit Facility (ECF). It also sets out the frequency and
deadlines for data reporting to the staff of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for
program monitoring purposes.
I. DEFINITIONS
2.
Unless otherwise indicated, “government” is understood to mean the central
administration of the Republic of Benin and does not include any political subdivisions (such
as local governments), the central bank, or any other public or government-owned entity with
autonomous legal personality not included in the government flow-of-funds table (TOFE).
3.
The definitions of “debt” and “concessional borrowing” for the purposes of this
memorandum of understanding are as set out in point 9 of Executive Board Decision
No. 6230-(79/140), as subsequently amended, including by Executive Board Decision
No. 14416-(09/91), effective December 1, 2009:
(a)

Debt is understood to mean a direct, that is, not contingent, liability, created under a
contractual agreement through the provision of value in the form of assets (including
currency) or services, which requires the obligor to make one or more payments in
the form of assets (including currency) or services at some future point(s) in time;
these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under
the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows:
(i) loans, that is, advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on
the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the
future (including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans and
buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to
fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the
funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the
buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and official swap
arrangements);
(ii) suppliers’ credits, that is, contracts where the supplier permits the
obligor to defer payments until sometime after the date on which the
goods are delivered or services are provided;

46
(iii) leases, that is, arrangements under which property is provided which the
lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time
that are usually shorter than the total expected service life of the
property, while the lessor retains title to the property. For the purpose of
this guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease)
of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the
agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair or
maintenance of the property; and
(iv) Treasury bills and bonds issued in CFA francs on the West African
Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) regional market, which are
included in domestic debt for the purpose of this Memorandum.
Under the definition of debt set out above, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded
damages arising from failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that
constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not
considered debt under this definition (for example, payment on delivery) will not give
rise to debt.
(b)

A loan is considered concessional if, on the date on which the contract was signed,
the ratio of the present value of the loan, based on the reference interest rates, to the
nominal value of the loan is less than 65 percent (that is, the grant element of the loan
is at least equal to 35 percent of its nominal value). The present value of the loan will
be calculated by discounting future payments of interest and principal using the
commercial interest reference rates (CIRRs) established by the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Specifically, the 10-year average
of CIRRs reported by the OECD will be used for loans with maturities longer
than 15 years while the six-month average of CIRRs will be used for loans with
shorter maturities. To both the 10-year and six-month averages of the reference rate,
the margin for different repayment periods will be added, as established by the OECD
(0.75 percent for repayment periods of less than 15 years; 1 percent for repayment
periods of 15–19 years; 1.15 percent for repayment periods of 20–29 years; and
1.25 percent for repayment periods of 30 years or more).

(c)

"Domestic debt" is defined as debt denominated in CFA francs, while "external debt"
is defined as debt denominated in any currency other than the CFA franc.
II. PRIOR ACTIONS

4.
The government has undertaken with IMF staff to implement the following measures
before presenting the program to the Executive Board of the IMF (MEFP Table 2). The
implementation of these measures will be verified five days before presentation of the
program:


the launch of a call for bids for the establishment by end-December 2010 of a onestop shop for port operations at the Port of Cotonou.

47


the increase by CFAF 10 per kWh on average of all electricity tariffs.
III. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
A. Ceiling on Net Domestic Financing of the Government

Definition
5.
Net domestic financing of the government is defined as the sum of: (i) net bank
credit to the government, defined below; and (ii) net nonbank financing of the government,
including the proceeds of the sale of government assets, which includes proceeds from the
divestiture of parts of public enterprises, that is, privatizations; Treasury bills and other
securitized obligations issued by the government and listed in CFA francs on the WAEMU
regional financial market and any BCEAO credit to the government, including any drawings
on the CFA franc counterpart of the allocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDR).
6.
Net bank credit to the government is defined as the balance between the debts and
claims of the government vis-à-vis the central bank and the national commercial banks. The
scope of net credit to the government is that used by the Central Bank of West African States
(BCEAO) and is in keeping with general Fund practice in this area. It implies a definition of
government that is broader than the one indicated in paragraph 2. Government claims include
the CFA franc cash balance, postal checking accounts, customs duty bills, and all deposits
with the BCEAO and commercial banks of government owned, with the exception of
industrial or commercial public agencies (établissements publics industriaux et commerciaux
- EPICs) and government corporations, which are excluded from the calculation.
Government debt to the banking system includes all debt to the central bank and the national
commercial banks, including Treasury bills and other securitized debt.
7.
The figures deemed valid within the framework of the program will be the figures
for net bank credit to the government and for the net amount of Treasury bills and bonds
issued in CFA francs on the WAEMU regional financial market calculated by the BCEAO
and the figures for nonbank financing calculated by the Benin Treasury.
8.
The government will decide on the use of resources from the divestiture of parts of
corporations, including the use of the proceeds from the sale of Benin Telecom and the
cement company (Société des Ciments d’Onigbolo—SCO), in consultation with the staff of
the International Monitory Fund (IMF). The ceiling on net domestic financing of the
government will be adjusted if disbursements of external budgetary assistance (excluding
IMF financing and assistance under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries [HIPC] Initiative),
net of debt service obligations (excluding repayment obligations to the IMF) and arrears
payments, exceed or fall short of program forecasts. If disbursements exceed the
programmed amounts, the ceiling will be lowered by the amount of budgetary assistance
received in excess of the programmed amount, except if the excess is allocated to the
settlement of domestic arrears. Conversely, if at the end of a quarter disbursements fall short
of the amount programmed for that quarter, the ceiling will be raised by the amount of the
shortfall, up to a maximum of CFAF 10 billion at end-June 2010, CFAF 20 billion at end-

48
September 2010, and CFAF 35 billion at end-December 2010 (cumulative since January 1,
2010). Budgetary assistance is defined as grants, loans, and debt relief operations (excluding
project-related loans and grants, IMF resources, and debt relief under the HIPC and
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiatives). The amount of budgetary assistance provided in the
program is CFAF 10 billion at end-June 2010, CFAF 20.9 billion at end-September and
CFAF 38.3 billion at end-December 2010 (cumulative since January 1, 2010).
Indicative targets and performance criteria
9.
The ceiling on net domestic financing of the government is set at
CFAF 37.0 billion for end-June 2010, CFAF -25.4 billion for end-September 2010, and
CFAF -15.3 billion for end-December 2010. The ceiling is a performance criterion for endJune 2010 and end-December 2010; and an indicative target for end-September 2010.
Reporting deadline
10.
Detailed data on domestic financing of the government will be reported on a
monthly basis, within four weeks of the end of the month. The definitive data will be
provided four additional weeks after reporting of the provisional data.
B. Basic Primary Fiscal Balance
Definition
11.
The basic primary fiscal balance is defined as being equal to the difference between
total fiscal revenue (tax and nontax) and fiscal expenditure (on a payment order basis), minus
the payments of interest on debt and capital expenditure financed by foreign grants and net
lending.
Performance criterion
12.
For 2010, the ceiling on the basic primary fiscal balance (excluding grants) is a
balance of not less than CFAF 37.8 billion at end-June, CFAF 1.9 billion at end-September
and CFAF -10.5.8billion at end-December. It is a performance criterion for end-June 2010
and end-December 2010 and an indicative target for end-September 2010.
Reporting deadline
13.
Provisional data on the basic primary fiscal balance, including data produced by the
automated fiscal management system (SIGFiP), will be reported on a monthly basis, within
four weeks of the end of the month. The definitive data will be reported four additional
weeks after reporting of the provisional data.
C. Accumulation of New Domestic Payments Arrears by the Government
Definition

49
14.
Domestic payments arrears are defined as domestic payments that are due but not
paid after a 90-day grace period, unless the obligation specifies a longer grace period; arrears
in payments on government domestic debt are defined as the stock of debt that is due but not
paid at the end of a 90-day grace period, unless the obligation specifies a longer grace period.
The National Amortization Fund (CAA, Caisse Autonome d’Amortissement) and the
Treasury record and update the accumulation of domestic payments arrears, as well as their
settlement.
Performance criterion
15.
The government undertakes not to accumulate any new payments arrears on
government domestic debt, and not to accumulate further arrears on obligations other than
public debt for periods of more than 90 days. The non-accumulation of domestic payments
arrears will be continuously monitored throughout the program. The definitions of debt
provided in paragraph 3a, of domestic debt in paragraph 3c and of government in paragraph
2 apply here.
Reporting deadline
16.
Data on the balance, accumulation, and repayment of domestic payments arrears on
public debt will be reported on a monthly basis, within eight weeks of the end of the month.
D. Nonaccumulation of External Payments Arrears by the Government
Definition
17.
External public payments arrears are defined as the sum of payments due, and not
paid by the due date specified in the contract, on external debt of or guaranteed by the
government. The definitions of debt provided in paragraph 3a, of external debt in paragraph
3c and of government in paragraph 2 apply here.
Performance criterion
18.
In the context of the program, the Beninese government undertakes not to
accumulate external payments arrears, with the exception of arrears relating to debt that is
the subject of renegotiation or rescheduling. The performance criterion on the
nonaccumulation of external payments arrears will be continuously monitored throughout the
program.
E. Ceiling on the Contracting or Guaranteeing by the Government of New
Nonconcessional External Debt Maturing in a Year or More.
Definition
19.
This performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in point 9 of
Executive Board Decision No. 6230-(79/140), as subsequently amended, including by
Executive Board Decision No. 14416-(09/91), effective December 1, 2009, but also to
commitments contracted or guaranteed (including lease-purchase contracts) for which no

50
value have been received. This criterion also applies to the guaranteeing of private sector
debt by the government, which consequently constitutes a contingent liability of the
government, as defined in paragraph 20. External debt excludes Treasury bills and bonds
issued in CFA francs on the WAEMU regional market.
20.
The concept of “government” used for this performance criterion and for the
performance criterion on the contracting or guaranteeing of short-term debt includes the
government, as defined in paragraph 2, local governments, and all public enterprises,
including administrative public agencies (EPAs), scientific and technical public agencies,
professional public agencies, and enterprises jointly owned by the Beninese government with
the governments of other countries.
Performance criterion
21.
No nonconcessional external borrowing will be contracted or guaranteed by the
government for the duration of the 2010–13 program. Changes to the ceiling to accommodate
nonconcessional external debt can be made during the course of the program after approval
of the IMF Executive Board. Any such changes would be proposed solely for specific
investment projects whose financial viability and profitability have been evaluated and
approved by a recognized institution, and on condition that the loan does not seriously
exacerbate debt vulnerabilities according to the debt sustainability analysis prepared jointly
by the staff of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
22.
The government also undertakes not to contract or guarantee any external loan
during the implementation of the 2010–13 program without first having determined its
concessionality with IMF staff.
Reporting deadline
23.
Data on any debt (terms and creditors) contracted or guaranteed by the government
will be reported each month, within four weeks of the end of the month.
F. Ceiling on the Contracting or Guaranteeing by the Government of New Short-Term
Nonconcessional External Debt
Definition
24.

The definitions in paragraphs 19 and 20 also apply to this performance criterion.

25.
Short-term external debt is debt with a contractual term of less than one year.
Import- and export-related loans, Treasury bills issued in CFA francs on the WAEMU
regional market, normal short-term supplier credits, and debt relief operations are not
covered by this performance criterion.
Performance criterion

51
26.
In the context of the program, the government undertakes not to contract or
guarantee short-term nonconcessional external debt. The definition of nonconcessional in
paragraph 3b applies here.
27.
The government also undertakes not to contract or guarantee any short-term
external debt without having first determined its concessionality with IMF staff.
28.

On December 31, 2009, Benin had no short-term external debt.

Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 20101
Prepared by the Staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association

Approved by Michael Atingi Ego and Thomas Dorsey (IMF) and
Sudarshan Gooptu and Sudhir Shetty (IDA)
May 27, 2010
This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) confirms the result from previous DSAs that Benin’s
risk of debt distress remains moderate. Under baseline projections, all external debt
indicators remain below their indicative thresholds over the long run. However, this assumes
that the fiscal stance is put back onto a sustainable path over the medium term, following the
slippages in 2009. Furthermore, debt ratios move rapidly toward the thresholds or breach
them under a less favorable no reform scenario, assuming slower growth of GDP and
exports, as well as foreign direct investments in line with historical averages. This underlines
the importance of fiscal adjustment and implementation of structural reforms aimed at
enhancing competitiveness and growth, and to finance the fiscal deficit primarily through
external grants and highly concessional loans.

1

Prepared by IMF and IDA staff in collaboration with the Beninese authorities and staff of
the African Development Bank. The fiscal year for Benin is January 1–December 31. The
previous DSA update was performed in June 2009 (IMF Country Report No. 09/87, IDA
Report No. 51780).

2

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Using the debt sustainability framework for low-income countries, this DSA
assumes financing needs to be covered primarily with concessional external financing.
Debt sustainability is assessed in relation to country-specific policy-dependent thresholds for
debt stock and debt service burden.2 This DSA is conducted on a gross basis.3
2.
Benin’s risk of debt distress was classified as moderate in the previous DSA
in June 2009. 4 Under the baseline scenario, all external debt indicators were projected to
remain below their indicative thresholds over the long run. However, it was noted that debt
ratios move rapidly toward the thresholds or breach them under less favorable scenarios.
3.
Following debt relief under the HIPC and MDRI initiative, Benin’s external
debt remains at comfortable levels. Benin reached the completion point under the
Enhanced HIPC initiative in 2003, and benefited from further debt relief under the MDRI
initiative in 2006. As a result, Benin’s external debt stock declined from 43.0 percent of GDP
at end-2002 to 15.1 percent of GDP at end-2009.5 In line with this reduction, external debt
service was reduced from 2.2 percent of GDP to 0.6 percent of GDP over the same period. At
end-2009, 88.5 percent of the external public debt was to multilateral creditors and
11.5 percent to bilateral creditors.

2

Debt sustainability is assessed in relation to policy-dependent thresholds for the present
value of external debt and the external debt service burden. Benin’s CPIA rating for 2006–08
was 3.57. A rating between 3.25 and 3.75 reflects medium performance; a rating below 3.25
corresponds to weak performance, and a rating above 3.75 corresponds to strong
performance. Medium performance implies the following external debt sustainability
thresholds: a net present value (PV) of debt-to-GDP ratio of 40 percent, and PV of debt-toexports ratio of 150 percent, and PV of debt-to-revenue ratio of 250 percent; a debt serviceto-exports ratio of 20 percent and a debt service-to-revenue ratio of 30 percent.
3

The quality of data underlying the DSA remains uneven. The DSA is based primarily on
data provided by the public debt management department of the Ministry of Finance of
Benin (la Caisse Autonome d’Amortissement). Data on private external debt is not available.
In 2010, West AFRITAC is providing technical assistance to improve debt data management.
4
5

IMF Country Report No. 09/87, IDA Report No. 51780

Since no data on private external debt is available, overall external debt stock is here equal
to the public or publicly guaranteed external debt.

3

4.
Government borrowing from the regional market increased significantly
since 2006. Outstanding regional government debt amounted to 11.1 percent of GDP at end2009, compared to 1.5 percent at end-2006. This increase partly reflects the authorities’
interest in promoting the expansion of the regional debt market and, in 2009, the need to
cover the financing gap. Borrowing conditions on this market are, however, nonconcessional
and the authorities are committed to a prudent borrowing strategy. Domestic borrowing is
therefore expected to decrease as share of GDP. Just over 40 percent of the regional public
debt is accounted for by central bank secured bonds, while the remainder comprises treasury
bills and securitized wage arrears.
II. UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS
5.
This updated DSA is affected by the weaker fiscal position in 2009. The
higher deficit was financed both by external resources and increased borrowing on the
regional market. In addition, the authorities have revised upward their estimation of noncotton exports in 2008 and 2009, and recategorized financial inflows, which results in higher
foreign direct investments from 2000 to 2005 compared to the previous DSA.6
6.
Except for an update in the medium-term macroeconomic framework
following the developments in 2009, this DSA maintains the main macroeconomic and
policy assumptions used in the previous DSA (Box 1). In particular, the baseline
projections are anchored on the assumptions that: 1) key structural reforms aimed at
enhancing competitiveness and growth would be adopted over the medium term,7 2) the
authorities would proceed with their plans to improve public infrastructure, and 3) fiscal
policy would aim at maintaining macroeconomic stability. Under these conditions, real GDP
growth is expected to recover after the crisis period 2009–10 to a sustainable annual rate of
6 percent over the medium- to long-term, and average annual inflation would not exceed

6
7

This particular revision gives a more favorable historic scenario in the DSA.

Key structural reforms likely to enhance growth already under way are the restructuring of
public utilities (especially electricity and telecommunications), major investments in the Port
of Cotonou and the introduction of a one stop window in the Port of Cotonou. These reforms
are supported by a new IMF Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement, which envisages
the restructuring of main public utilities and the modernization of customs administration
over the next three years.

4

3 percent in the long run, consistent with the assumptions of the World Bank Global
Economic Prospects 2009 and the Benin Country Economic Memorandum.8
7.
The fiscal deterioration in 2009 is expected to be partly reversed in 2010.
Large expenditure overruns amid a weak revenue performance led to a widening of the
overall fiscal deficit (on a payment-order basis) from 3.5 percent of GDP in 2008 to
7.3 percent in 2009. A strong fiscal adjustment effort, supported by measures aimed at
strengthening revenue collection9 and controlling expenditure execution, are projected to
reduce the overall deficit to 5.9 percent of GDP, and the basic primary deficit to 0.3 percent
of GDP in 2010.
Box 1. Macroeconomic assumptions
Medium term (2011–15): The projections are consistent with the macroeconomic
framework of the IMF Article IV Consultation and reflect (i) the impact of the crisis, and
(ii) fiscal policies aimed at maintaining macroeconomic stability, protecting vulnerable
groups, and enhancing investment in public infrastructure. A key assumption is that
concessional financing from external donors would continue to be available throughout the
projection period. In particular, sufficient concessional funds would be available to fill the
financing gap in 2010, creating a fiscal cushion to contain the impact of the crisis without
compromising debt sustainability. The analysis also assumes the implementation of
structural reforms aimed at increasing efficiency and competitiveness and improving the
business climate. As a result, after slowing down to 2 ½-3 ½ percent in 2009–10, real GDP
growth is projected to recover to its long-term sustainable level of 6 percent, while fiscal
prudence and the anchor of the fixed exchange rate peg are expected to keep inflation to
below 3 percent. After the fiscal deterioration in 2009, the primary fiscal deficit would be
reduced to 0.2 percent of GDP by 2015, reflecting improvements in public fiscal

The authorities will implement a number of measures aimed at improving efficiency in tax
and customs administration and at broadening the tax base. During the next three years, this
will include measures to improve the information systems of the tax and customs
administration, the introduction of a one-stop window in the Port of Cotonou and
generalization of the TIN to all tax payers and services of the tax and customs offices. A
personal income tax will also be introduced.

5

management and efforts to contain recurrent expenditures. The current account deficit is
expected to narrow in the medium term as exports recover and the fiscal adjustment reduces
the demand for imports.
Long term (2015–30): long-term projections reflect the impact of the structural reforms
implemented in previous periods and the continuation of policies aimed at maintaining
macroeconomic stability. Under these assumptions:

Real GDP growth would average 6 percent following its growth potential;

Inflation would remain at or below 3 percent;

The primary fiscal deficit would stabilize at about 1 percent of GDP, following
improvements in revenue collection and continued efforts to contain nonpriority recurrent
expenditures, in particular the wage bill;

The current account deficit would remain at about 5 percent of GDP, reflecting
growing imports associated with economic expansion and foreign direct investment (FDI), as
well as continuing inflows of remittances;

Improved infrastructure and a more favorable business climate would attract net
foreign direct investment equivalent to about 2 percent of GDP per year.

Reflecting continued support from donors for Benin’s infrastructural development
and reform efforts, about 60 percent of total gross financing needs are assumed to be covered
by external grants.

Over the medium- and long-term, the DSA assumes that the authorities will continue
to benefit from concessional borrowing mainly from multilateral donors, with a grant
element equivalent to the average of the last 5 years.10

Reflecting the authorities’ commitment to a prudent borrowing strategy, government
borrowing on the regional market is expected to decrease somewhat from 11.1 percent of
GDP at end-2009 to 4.5 percent of GDP at the end of the period.

The real interest rate on domestic currency debt is expected to average just over
4 percent.

10

Of the current external financing for Benin, the African Development Bank and the World
Bank provide the highest level of concessionality. Since the exact composition of new
multilateral borrowing is unknown, a larger share of multilateral borrowing is assumed to
come from other multilaterals in the long run. This explains the slight decrease in the grant
element in the long term compared with the medium term (figure 1).

6

III. EXTERNAL DSA
8.
Under baseline assumptions, all external debt and debt service ratio remain
well below the policy-dependent thresholds throughout the projection period (Figure 1).
The PV of external debt is projected to decline to just over 9 percent of GDP in the long run,
and debt service payment ratios would remain below 3 percent. The PV of debt-to-exports
ratio would remain well below the 150 percent threshold.
9.
External vulnerability indicators worsen only slightly under standard stress
test conditions. In particular, a shock to exports would lead to a marginal breach over three
years of the threshold for the debt-to-exports ratio. However, all other indicators would stay
under their respective thresholds with a large margin under the different alternative
scenarios.
10.
The risk of debt distress would increase markedly in the absence of
structural reforms. The baseline scenario assumes GDP growth to average 6 percent in the
long run, which is motivated by the continued implementation of structural reforms. Should
these reforms not materialize, a “no reform scenario” characterized by slower real GDP and
exports growth; as well as foreign direct investment and primary fiscal deficits close to
historical averages, would lead to a breach of the debt-to-exports criteria by 2022.11 Also the
debt-to-GDP and the debt-to-revenue ratio would increase markedly over the long term.
11.
This DSA also tests the debt trajectory implication of a limited amount of
nonconcessional borrowing. In August 2009, the IMF Executive Board approved new
guidelines on external debt limits in Fund supported programs.12 The new framework moves
away from a single design for concessionality requirements towards a more flexible
approach, taking into account members’ debt vulnerabilities and their macroeconomic and
public financial management capacity.13

11

In the no reform scenario annual real GDP growth is assumed to average 4.0 percent. FDI
are assumed to be in line with their historical average (1.8 percent of GDP) and exports have
been reduced by 2.0 percent of GDP compared to the baseline scenario (to 15.5 percent of
GDP).
12

This DSA follows the IMF and World Bank Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the
Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries, January 22,
2010 (available at http://www.imf.org/external/pp/longres.aspx?id=4419)

7

12.
In the classification of low-income countries for the purpose of debt limits
conducted in December 2009, Benin was classified as a low capacity country. According
to the new guidelines concessionality requirements for lower capacity countries will continue
to apply on a debt by debt basis with a minimum concessionality requirement of 35 percent.
However, a certain amount of nonconcessional borrowing could be exempted from this
requirement provided that it does not push the country into a higher debt vulnerability
category. Any such borrowing should only be undertaken to finance projects whose financial
viability and profitability have been evaluated and approved by a reputable institution and be
accompanied by continued strengthening of project selection systems and institutions.
13.
Allowing for a limited amount of nonconcessional borrowing does not
significantly alter the debt risk profile. Given the substantial margins from breaching any
of the thresholds, and in line with the new guidelines on external debt limits, this analysis
tests for a limited amount of non-concessional borrowing.14 The addition of
CFAF 150 billion of nonconcessional borrowing during the period 2010–12 does not lead to
any breach of the thresholds and, therefore, does not cause a change of debt vulnerability
category.
IV. PUBLIC DSA
14.
Public debt indicators are projected to decline somewhat over time
(Figure 2). Under the baseline scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio is set to fall to around
14 percent and the debt-to-revenue ratio to under 60 percent. The debt service-to-revenue
ratio is expected to stabilize close to 3 percent in the long term.
15.
Stress tests show a somewhat less favorable development. Under the most
extreme shock scenario15 the debt-to-GDP would increase to 22 percent and the debt-torevenue ratio to 89 percent, while the debt service-to-revenue would decrease somewhat to
4.6 percent by 2030. The stress test therefore shows the largest sensitivity to lower growth of
GDP, which again underlines the importance of continued structural reforms.

14

In this alternative scenario, an amount of non-concessional financing limited to the value
of CFAF 150 billion in present value terms (4.5 percent of GDP) for the period 2010–12 has
been added to the baseline.
15

For the debt-to-GDP ratio and the debt-to-revenue ratio the most extreme shock is
represented by a temporary slowdown in real growth to 3.1 percent in 2011–12, while for the
debt service-to-revenue ratio it is represented by a one-time 30 percent real depreciation
in 2011.

8

V. DEBT DISTRESS CLASSIFICATION AND CONCLUSIONS
16.
Altogether, this DSA confirms that Benin faces a moderate risk of debt
distress, which underlines the importance of proceeding with fiscal adjustment and
structural reforms. The analysis highlights the need to address the fiscal slippages in 2009,
and put the fiscal situation back onto a sustainable path over the medium term. The prompt
implementation of structural reforms will also be critical to enhance growth, expand exports,
attract foreign direct investments and contain the fiscal deficit, thus improving the long-term
debt dynamics. The authorities should also continue to cover their financing needs primarily
with external concessional assistance. However, given a large margin to the debt
sustainability thresholds, a limited amount of nonconcessional borrowing could be
accommodated without risking a marked change in the overall debt risk profile.
17.
The authorities concur with the overall conclusions of the DSA, which is in
line with their own debt sustainability analysis. As in the past, the authorities continue to
be committed to a prudent borrowing strategy according to which financing needs will be
covered primarily through the mobilization of grants and highly concessional borrowing,
with only limited use of regional borrowing as a last source of financing. The authorities also
share the view that a prudent fiscal policy will be necessary to preserve fiscal and debt
sustainability over the medium- to long- term.

2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
It does not include external project grants that are assumed to cover about 60 percent of total gross financing needs.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point. Hence these two amounts can not be added.

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim
period.

The MDRI provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries that qualified for the assistance.
Grant assistance from the MDRI Trust and HIPC resources provide debt relief to cover the full stock of debt

4
owed to the Fund as of end-2004 that remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief.

Decision point - point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a
country qualifies for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of
assistance to be committed.
Interim assistance - amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision
and completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance
committed at the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in
exceptional circumstances).
Completion point - point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its
assistance committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of
interest income as defined in footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is
linked to the implementation of pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating
completion point).
IX. Safeguards Assessments:
The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is a common central bank of the
countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). The most recent
safeguards assessment of the BCEAO was completed on March 1, 2010. The 2010 update
assessment found that the BCEAO continues to have controls in place at the operational
level. The overall governance framework should nonetheless be strengthened by the addition
of an audit committee to ensure that the Board of Directors exercises appropriate oversight
over the control structure, including the audit mechanisms and financial statements. The
upcoming implementation (2010) of the Institutional Reform of the WAEMU and the
BCEAO should help correct that situation. Efforts to implement fully the International
Financial Reporting Standards reporting framework should also be pursued.
X.

Exchange Arrangement:

Benin is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) and has
no separate legal tender. The union’s common currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to the
Euro at a rate of CFAF 655.957 = EUR 1, consistent with the official conversions rate of the
French franc to the Euro and the previous fixed rate of the CFA franc to the French franc of
CFAF 100= F 1. On April 28, 2006, the rate of the CFA franc in terms of SDR was CFAF
769.68 = SDR 1.0. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the WAEMU
countries has been reclassified to the category of conventional pegged arrangement from the
category of exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is
based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was
based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus only reflects a
definitional change, and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change
in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members. The exchange

5
system common to all member countries of the WAEMU is free of restrictions on payments
and transfers for current international transactions subject to Fund jurisdiction.

Article IV Consultations:

The last Article IV consultation discussions were held in Cotonou during March 3–17, 2008.
The staff report (Country Report No. 08/230; 5/30/08) and selected issues paper were
discussed by the Executive Board, and the 2008 Article IV consultation concluded, on June
16, 2008.
XII.

ROSC Assessment:

An FAD mission conducted the fiscal module of a Report on Observance of Standards and
Codes (ROSC) in May 2001. The mission recommended the adoption of a three-year action
plan containing measures to improve expenditure management. The mission also identified a
list of actions to be taken quickly to ensure that the authorities were able to monitor budget
execution. The ROSC fiscal transparency module for Benin was circulated to the Board on
June 6, 2002 (Country Report No. 02/217).

III. Statistical Issues
A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
Weaknesses exist in the areas of national accounts, public finance, monetary statistics, and
balance of payments.

Real sector statistics: Inadequate resources and weaknesses in data documentation and
methodology hamper the accuracy and reliability of the national accounts. Efforts to address
these shortcomings are ongoing. Benin participates in WAEMU’s harmonization of
statistical methodologies and in the GDDS project for AFRITAC West countries to
implement the 1993 SNA. Progress has been slow and the accounts for a few years still need
to be converted. The West AFRITAC missions in 2008 and 2009 sought to accelerate the
process and a forthcoming mission in 2010 will support the compilation of the revised 2007
accounts. A statistical register and an industrial production index are being developed, but
the implementation has been slower than expected. Consumer price data, measured using the
WAEMU harmonized consumer price index, are adequate for surveillance. The methodology
for the WAEMU harmonized consumer price index is in the process of being updated and the
index is being rebased to 2008.
Government finance statistics: The quality of fiscal data is broadly adequate for
surveillance, but has some shortcomings in coverage, periodicity, timeliness, and
accessibility. The authorities report budgetary central government’s “statement of sources
and uses of cash” for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, one year
after the reference year. The October 2008 and July 2009 STA-GFS missions found that the
authorities had yet to compile general government GFS to broaden coverage of nonmarket
activities controlled by the government, disseminate the GFS within one quarter after the
reference quarter, and present the other major GFS reports to facilitate linkages to other
macroeconomic datasets e.g. the balance sheet.

Monetary and financial statistics: Monetary and financial statistics, compiled and
disseminated by the regional Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), are broadly
adequate and their institutional coverage is comprehensive. Accuracy is somewhat hampered
by the use of 1990 sorting coefficients to estimate cross border amounts of banknotes among
BCEAO countries, which in turn, are used to estimate currency in circulation and to adjust
the net foreign assets of each member country.
Balance of payments: External statistics are still affected by shortcomings that prevent an

9
accurate and timely assessment of current account transactions and capital and financial
flows. Recent improvements in applying the guidelines of the Balance of Payments Manual,
Fifth Edition have not solved the problem. In November 2004, a STA technical assistance
mission noted that the human resources devoted to balance of payments statistics by the
national agency of the BCEAO were inadequate, and highlighted a series of methodological
problems including the use of untested hypotheses and reference bases, the limited coverage
of direct investment, and shortcomings in the compilation of net external assets and
international investment position. Balance of payments statistics are also disseminated with
a lag of almost one year and the international investment position data with a lag of 18month. Some progress has been achieved in the reconciliation of regional trade data with
those of regional partners, and the compilation of trade statistics has been enhanced by the
installation of the ASYCUDA customs computer system in all main border customs houses
and of ASYCUDA ++ in the port, airport, and some regional offices. Further improvements
will require the interconnection between the computer systems of the main customs
departments and their integration with the other revenue agencies. Progress is also needed in
improving contacts with reporting bodies, enhancing human and technical resources.
Financial account data can be improved by extending the coverage of foreign assets of the
private non banking sector, expanding the surveys of residents’ foreign assets, and using
other data source such as BIS statistics. The BCEAO has updated the compilation of
commercial bank data on payments involving nonresidents; however these data are not used
to produce annual balance of payments statistics.
External debt data are broadly adequate for surveillance, but are comprehensive only for
public and publicly guaranteed debt. Data are collected by the Caisse Autonome
d'Amortissements (CAA), which is responsible for signing international loan agreements and
servicing the government's external debt obligations. The CAA's database is fairly
comprehensive and up-to-date, and contains accurate stock data, and produces projected
debt-service flows on a loan-by-loan basis, but regular statements are not received from
creditors.
B. Data Standards and Quality
Benin commenced its participation in the

in 2001; but has since then not updated much Standards and Codes (ROSC) in May 2001.

C. Reporting to STA
Standardized Report Forms (in line with the Monetary and Financial Statistical Manual) are
still not regularly used to report monetary data to the IMF.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
June 10, 2010
This statement provides information that has become available since the staff report was
issued to the Executive Board on May 28, 2010. The new information does not alter the
thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
Preliminary data through April 2010 indicate that consumer price inflation rose to
3.0 percent year-on-year, reflecting the government decision to increase electricity tariffs by
10 percent on April 1 and higher food and transport costs. On the fiscal front, revenue
collections were CFAF 36.9 billion (1.1 percent of GDP) lower than projected under the
program on account of weaker tax and non-tax revenue. Nevertheless, government
expenditure was in line with program projections, with lower domestic capital spending
offsetting somewhat higher transfers. In particular, the wage bill was in line with the
program.
2.
The authorities indicated to staff this week that they have taken measures to increase
revenue collections and regulate spending in order to achieve the end-June targets under the
program. In particular, the management of the customs department has been recently
replaced. The authorities have also made the use of the single Tax Identification Number
mandatory for customs declarations, and have intensified customs controls at the borders.
New internal controls at the income tax department have also been introduced. Finally, they
expect to receive CFAF 52 billion (1.7 percent of GDP) in nontax revenue in July 2010 from
the sale of three third-generation GSM licenses.
3.
The authorities have revised their external financing projections upwards for 2010 to
take account of the recent sharp depreciation of the CFA franc against the US dollar and the
SDR. Based on the latest market exchange rates, the revised financing gap is now estimated
at CFAF 19.5 billion, compared with CFAF 24.3 billion in the staff report. They expect to
cover the revised financing gap with the two disbursements under the proposed ECF
arrangement (CFAF 16.9 billion) and additional bilateral support (CFAF 2.6 billion) that
they expect to be committed after the regular annual donors’ review in June 2010. In any
event, the authorities reconfirmed this week their commitment in the memorandum on
economic and financial policies (paragraph 34) to cut the equivalent amount of any residual
financing gap in nonpriority expenditures.
4.
The authorities signed a restructuring agreement on June 3, 2010 with the Belgian
Export Agency for a €10.8 million loan contracted by Benin Telecom in 2003 which had
become overdue.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with Benin
On June 14, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Benin.1
Background
Following a period of strengthening growth in Benin, the global economic crisis halved real gross
domestic product (GDP) growth in Benin in 2009. Weaker demand for exports, a decline in
cotton prices and lower inflows of foreign direct investments reduced real GDP growth to
2.7 percent in 2009, compared with 5 percent in 2008. The deceleration was aggravated by the
decline in cotton production and floods in the south, while non-cotton agriculture production and
transportation continued to grow, as domestic demand was supported by the fiscal stimulus.
Inflation declined to an average 2.2 percent in 2009, from 8.0 percent in 2008, reflecting a good
harvest and the decline in international food and fuel prices. A sharp decline in transit trade and
weaker cotton exports widened the current account deficit excluding grants to 10.8 percent of
GDP in 2009. These developments accompanied by a decline in foreign direct investments
turned the overall balance of payments into a deficit of 1.6 percent in 2009, from a surplus of
1.6 percent the previous year. The real effective exchange rate in December 2009.appreciated
by 1.1 percent year–on–year.
Supported by higher liquidity, broad money expanded at a slightly higher rate than nominal GDP.
Following the reduction in reserve requirements from 15 to 9 percent in June 2009, banks
increased credit to the private sector by 11 percent at end-2009 despite an increase in
government borrowing. At the same time, commercial banks’ asset quality improved, the ratio of

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing ups can be found here:

nonperforming loans declining from 6.5 percent in 2008 to 5.7 percent in 2009. Four banks,
however, continue to have negative capital and further corrective actions are needed to ensure
that all banks comply with prudential regulations.
Against the backdrop of lower customs collections, the authorities sought to provide a strong
fiscal stimulus in the first half of 2009, but were forced to tighten policies thereafter due to
financing constraints. Revenue collections declined by 1 percent of GDP in 2009, as a
consequence of the deceleration of import growth and the increase in exemptions that led to a
7 percent decline in customs receipts. During the first half of the year, expenditures increased
strongly as a result of large awards of bonuses to civil servants and a surge in investment
spending. Despite efforts to redress the situation during the second half of the year, the overall
fiscal deficit (excluding grants) more than doubled from 3.5 percent of GDP in 2008 to
7.3 percent of GDP in 2009. The deficit was financed through additional external donor support,
domestic borrowing, and a carryover of expenditure commitments to 2010.
The implementation of structural reforms is moving forward, albeit with some delays. The
authorities have recently privatized key public enterprises, including awarding the concession of
the container terminal of the Port of Cotonou to a private operator. The sale of a majority stake
in Benin Telecom has been launched and is expected to be completed in the third quarter of
2010. The electricity company is being restructured ahead of its privatization scheduled for end2011. Tax and customs administration and public finance management are being strengthened.
Benin’s short-term prospects remain relatively weak. Real GDP growth is expected to grow by
3.2 percent in 2010, based on a moderate fiscal stimulus to support economic activity. Inflation
should remain below 3 percent—the convergence criterion set by the West African Economic
and Monetary Union. The authorities are committed to pursuing a more prudent fiscal policy in
2010, which will bring about a moderate adjustment in the overall fiscal deficit to 5.9 percent of
GDP. The public wage bill will need to be limited in order to leave adequate fiscal space for
priority social and investment spending. This will be facilitated by the structural reform agenda,
including further measures to strengthen revenue collection and public financial management.
Efforts to further improve external competitiveness and the business climate are continuing,
including improving infrastructure, strengthening customs administration, and modernizing the
public administration; and second generation reforms aimed at improving land registration,
property rights and the financial and judiciary systems.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Benin’s economy has been hit by the global crisis, leading to
sharply lower growth and a large overall fiscal deficit in 2009. Directors also pointed to the
adverse impact on Benin’s economic performance of the large expansion in the public wage bill
and uneven progress on structural reforms. Looking ahead, the key challenges are to contain
the impact of the crisis in the short run, while reducing fiscal and external imbalances and
boosting sustainable growth and poverty reduction over the medium term. Directors encouraged
the authorities to build the necessary support among key stakeholders to ensure successful
implementation of their reform program, particularly in the critical fiscal and structural areas.

3
Directors noted that growth is likely to remain weak in 2010. While there may be some scope for
fiscal policy to support the incipient recovery, they stressed that a prudent implementation of the
2010 budget in line with the Extended Credit Facility-supported program will be essential. Over
the medium term, considerable adjustment is needed to preserve fiscal and debt sustainability.
In particular, the growth of the wage bill needs to be contained, with a view to safeguarding fiscal
space for priority spending, reducing distortions in the labor market, and improving external
competitiveness. Directors encouraged the authorities to resist spending pressures in the run up
to the 2011 elections. They underscored that undertaking the long-delayed comprehensive
reform of the civil service is critical to increased efficiency in public service delivery and keeping
expenditures in line with fiscal sustainability.
Directors were encouraged by the authorities’ commitment to improve tax and customs
administration and broaden the tax base. They noted the delays in public financial management
reforms, and called on the authorities to step up their reform efforts to improve expenditure
administration, including the implementation of the new public procurement code.
Directors underscored the need to reach higher sustainable growth by implementing the
authorities’ structural reform agenda, which will help make progress toward the Millennium
Development Goals. Ambitious reforms will also reduce Benin’s vulnerability to external shocks,
improve the business environment, and reverse the recent erosion of Benin’s external
competitiveness.
Directors welcomed the progress made in privatizing the cotton and public utility sectors. They
encouraged the authorities to proceed with the planned privatization of Benin Telecom and with
the implementation of a regulatory framework for the electricity sector. Directors commended the
authorities’ intention to save the privatization proceeds and use them, after consultation with
Fund staff, to finance projects with a high social rate of return. Second generation reforms to
improve land registration, property rights, and the financial and judiciary systems will also be
essential to improve the business environment.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to enhance banking supervision and improve
compliance with prudential ratios, while strengthening the application of the regulatory
framework of the microfinance sector. They looked forward to the upcoming Financial Sector
Assessment Program review, which should help the authorities further strengthen their
supervisory framework.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Approves US$109 Million ECF for Benin
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a new three-year
arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) for a total amount equivalent to SDR 74.28
million (about US$109 million). The approval will enable the first disbursement of an amount
equivalent to SDR 10.62 million (about US$15.6 million).
The new arrangement is designed to support the authorities’ program to increase economic growth
by boosting investment in infrastructure and implementing structural reforms aimed at increasing
Benin’s economic competitiveness. The program will help create fiscal space for accelerated capital
and social spending by broadening the tax base, containing non-priority spending, and raising
public sector efficiency.
At the conclusion of the Executive Board discussion on Benin, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“The global economic crisis continues to have a negative impact on Benin’s economic
performance, reducing growth by nearly half in 2009. The authorities’ fiscal stimulus could not be
sustained, given the lack of financing, and the overall fiscal deficit more than doubled compared
with 2008.
“Growth is likely to remain weak in 2010. But the medium-term outlook is more favorable,
provided the authorities implement prudent macroeconomic policies and their structural reform
agenda. Continued support from the international community will also be essential for Benin to
make further progress toward the Millennium Development Goals.
“The authorities’ main macroeconomic challenge is to mitigate the impact of the crisis in the short
term, while reaching higher sustainable growth over the medium term. While there is some scope
for fiscal policy to support the economic recovery in 2010, a considerable fiscal adjustment will be
needed over the medium term to maintain fiscal sustainability. In particular, the growth of the wage

2

bill will need to be contained, with a view to safeguarding fiscal space for priority spending,
reducing distortions in the labor market, and improving competitiveness.
“The authorities’ economic program responds to the challenges appropriately. Fiscal policy aims at
maintaining fiscal and debt sustainability. The structural reform agenda will strengthen revenue
collections and public financial management, support the authorities’ divestiture of state enterprises,
and improving the business climate. The new ECF arrangement will provide essential financial
support to cover the temporary imbalances associated with the implementation of the authorities’
economic program by catalyzing additional concessional assistance from donors,” Mr. Portugal
added.
Annex
Recent Economic Developments
The global economic crisis reduced growth in Benin by half in 2009, more than in the other
countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). Lower cotton prices,
weaker demand for exports—notably from Nigeria—and lower inflows of foreign direct investment
reduced real GDP growth from 5 percent in 2008 to 2.7 percent in 2009. The decline in
international food and fuel prices contributed to easing inflationary pressures. Average CPI inflation
declined from 8 percent in 2008 to 2.2 percent in 2009, reflecting lower food, transportation, and
gasoline prices.
A sharp decline in transit trade and weaker cotton exports widened the current account deficit. The
terms of trade were unchanged, because decline in international food and energy prices offset the
fall in international cotton prices. These developments, accompanied by a decline in foreign direct
investment and other flows turned the overall balance of payments into a deficit of 1.6 percent of
GDP in 2009.
The authorities responded to the crisis by enforcing a strong fiscal stimulus in the first half of 2009,
which needed to be reversed in the second half owing to the lack of financing. Fiscal policy was
looser in 2009 compared to 2008. The overall fiscal deficit more than doubled to 7.3 percent in
2009. About two-thirds of the deficit was financed from external grants and concessional loans,
including the counterpart of the SDR allocation.
Program Summary
Under the new ECF-supported program, the government aims to maintain macroeconomic stability
and accelerate structural reforms to contain the negative impact of the global economic crisis on

3

Benin in the short run and increase sustainable growth over the medium term. The macroeconomic
objectives of the government program are to:
• Raise annual real GDP growth to 6 percent by 2013 from 3.2 percent in 2010;
• Maintain inflation below the WAEMU convergence criterion of 3 percent;
• Reduce the external current account deficit (excluding grants) to 7.6 percent of GDP by 2013 from
10.8 percent in 2009;
• Increase the basic primary balance to a surplus of 1.5 percent of GDP by 2013, compared with a
deficit of 3.8 percent of GDP in 2009.
The macroeconomic program will be complemented by structural reforms. In this context, the
program will:
• Enhance the effectiveness of expenditure that induces growth by improving the selection and
monitoring of projects, and strengthening transparency and accountability in public procurement
contracts;
• Implement structural reforms to strengthen external competitiveness and improve the business
climate. These reforms will improve revenue administration, the quality and delivery of public
services, and enhance transparency and accountability in public financial management;
• Introduce “second generation” reforms to improve land registration and property rights and the
financial and judiciary systems; strengthen microfinance supervision, and devote more resources to
youth entrepreneurship.

Statement by Laurean Rutayisire, Executive Director for Benin
June 14, 2010
On behalf of my Beninese authorities, I would like to express my appreciation to
Management and staff for the constructive discussions with my authorities, including the
President, over the past six months, both in Cotonou and Washington. These discussions
contributed to refining my authorities’ medium-term economic and financial program in
support of which a new arrangement is requested. The report before us today makes a good
account of the contents of these exchanges and the elements of the program. I also wish to
express my authorities’ appreciation of the presentations made during staff visit in Cotonou
in March 2010, as they enabled useful exchanges on many issues of interest for the program.
My authorities are particularly very appreciative of the additional assistance received last
year from development and technical partners.
For a long period, Benin performed very well in terms of policy implementation, notably in
the context of Fund-supported programs, including under the last arrangement that expired in
June 2009. However, over the past few years, Benin has experienced a series of shocks,
including the food and fuel crisis and the global economic and financial crisis, which has
seriously complicated the implementation of their poverty reduction and growth program.
Last year, as my authorities strived to mitigate the impact of those shocks on the population
through supportive policies, the emergence of macroeconomic imbalances forced them to
review their economic program, in order to preserve long-term macroeconomic stability.
Going forward, my authorities are still facing the challenges of mitigating the impact of the
crisis, while laying the foundation for a strong, balanced growth to meet the MDGs. They
count on continued external assistance to support their program aimed at addressing these
challenges. In particular, they believe that a Fund’s involvement in Benin through an
arrangement will be helpful in anchoring reforms and provide a framework for external
assistance. Accordingly, my authorities are requesting an Extended Credit Facility
arrangement for SDR 74.28 million (120 percent of the quota) for the period covering 20102013.
I - Recent Developments
The global economic and financial crisis, together with the floods in the south of the country
in July 2009, affected economic activity in Benin last year. As a result, real GDP growth
declined from 5 percent in 2008 to 2.7 percent in 2009. Lower external demand for cotton
and transit trade due to economic slowdown in neighboring countries led to a widening of the
current account. Subsequently, as capital flows also declined, the overall balance of
payments ran into deficit for the first time in years.

2
Policy response to the crisis took the form of a strong fiscal stimulus in the first half of 2009,
consisting of wage increases, and higher capital and social spending amid a sluggish
economic environment affecting downward revenue performance. In light of the weak
prospects for revenue and external funding at the time, my authorities decided to reverse its
fiscal stance in the second half of 2009 through a reduction in nonessential expenditures, and
a freezing of some expenditure commitments, including new bonuses to civil servants, and of
capital spending. Those measures enabled the authorities to limit the widening of fiscal
deficit to 7.3 percent of GDP in 2009, financed mainly from external grants, concessional
loans, bond issuances in the regional market and the use of SDR allocation.
As already discussed at the meeting on the common policies in the West African Economic
and Monetary Union a few months ago, the Banque Centrale des Etats de l’Afrique de
l’Ouest (BCEAO), the regional central bank, responded to the crisis by conducting an
accommodative monetary policy through liquidity injection, a cut in the intervention rate by
50 bps to 4.25 percent and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio for Benin from 16
percent to 9 percent. Credit to the economy in Benin increased by 11 percent on account of
higher domestic demand in the second half of 2009.
In the financial sector, banks’ asset quality improved as the rate of nonperforming loans
declined and capital adequacy ratio remains above the prudential norm. Nevertheless, a few
banks are under strict surveillance and one is under provisional administration for not
complying with some prudential norms.
Despite the difficult economic environment, my authorities made significant progress in the
implementation of structural reforms initiated during the previous arrangement, which aim
at improving the competitiveness of the national economy and establishing the conditions for
strong economic growth. In particular, aware of the country’s steady loss of competitiveness,
as reported in various reports including the World Bank Doing Business report, the
government established in early 2009 a steering committee tasked with promoting
improvements in the regulatory framework with a view to simplifying the procedures for
business creation, tax- and customs-related operations and commercial dispute resolution.
The reform of public enterprises is proceeding well, which has enabled a greater
participation of the private sector in several sectors including agriculture, cement, forestry
and hotel. In the energy sector, the debt of the electricity company (SBEE) was restructured
in March 2010 thanks to the government and all electricity rates were increased by 10 CFAF
per kWh on average in April 2010 to improve its financial situation and reduce its burden on
public finances. The privatization program will reach another milestone with the sale of a
majority stake in the capital of Benin Telecom before the end of this year.
Also noteworthy is the steady progress made in the implementation of the MCA-supported
reform program aimed at improving physical and institutional infrastructure in Benin. An

3
important element of that program is the improvement of the Port of Cotonou, with the
ongoing construction of a new container terminal consisting of two accommodation berths
and the attribution of the terminal management to an international company. A call for bids
for the establishment of a one-stop window for port operations at the Port de Cotonou was
launched in May 2010.
II - Policies for 2010 and the medium-term
My authorities are committed to pursuing implementation of their economic program with
the objective to support economic recovery in the short term, and place the country on the
road to a sustained growth in the medium term. These objectives of the financial program are
consistent with the new poverty reduction strategy being prepared for 2010-14, which will be
a framework for technical and financial support from Benin’s development partners. The
macroeconomic objectives of the program is to increase growth rate from a projected 3.2
percent in 2009 to 6 percent in 2013, contain inflation below the WAEMU convergence
criterion of 3 percent, and reduce the external current account deficit to 7 percent of GDP by
2013. My authorities will adopt any other measures needed to achieve the objectives of the
program.
Fiscal consolidation initiated in the second half of 2009 is the cornerstone of the program. It
will be pursued over the period of the arrangement, with the objective to preserving fiscal
and debt sustainability, while creating fiscal space for needed to strengthen the social safety
nets and support other priority social spending. This will be achieved through greater
revenue mobilization and reduction in recurrent expenditures. The fiscal deficit is expected
to decline from 7.3 percent in 2009 to 5.9 percent of GDP in 2010, as revenue is projected to
rebound following improvements in tax and customs administration. This deficit is expected
to decline further to 3.3 percent of GDP in 2013. It will be financed primarily with external
concessional budget support from both multilateral and bilateral donors. My authorities will
continue their prudent borrowing strategy of securing grants or highly concessional loans to
finance the deficit.
Strengthening the public financial management will remain a priority in the fiscal program.
In particular, my authorities will pursue the reform and modernization of the tax and customs
administrations, with the expectation that this will translate in greater revenue performance.
Important steps in the near term in that area will be the submission to the National Assembly
in October 2010 of a legislation introducing the personal income tax, and the
computerization of all customs offices by end-2010. In addition, the implementing decrees of
Public Procurement Code will be adopted by end-September 2010. My authorities will also
improve budget preparation and execution procedures, in order to better monitor
expenditures and reduce recourse to exceptional payment procedures.

4
My authorities are cognizant of the need to undertake reforms of the wage policy and
pension fund in the civil service, in order to make them more sustainable and ensure longterm fiscal and debt sustainability. Regarding the compensation system, the government has
commissioned a study of the civil service remuneration system and has decided not to grant
new bonuses, allowances, or other benefits to civil servants until that study is completed. The
recommendations will form the basis for developing a civil service reform strategy to be
adopted by June 2011. In addition, recognizing that achieving separate salary agreements
with various segments of the civil service is inefficient, the government established a
committee of representatives of the government, labor unions, and social partners to act as a
single negotiating framework for achieving multiyear salary agreements that take into
account government’s financial capacity and its economic and social policy priorities. In the
same vein, the government intends to make further progress in its reform of the civil service
pension fund, in order to make it more viable. In this regard, they are preparing a draft law to
implement a new strategy based on the recommendations of an actuarial audit concluded in
September 2009. This draft law will be discussed between all parties concerned before it is
submitted to the Parliament by end-2011.
The regional central bank will continue to monitor closely inflationary trends and conduct a
monetary policy consistent with the objective of price stability. Likewise, the WAMU
Banking Commission will continue to monitor the financial system. My authorities have
asked for a FSAP mission in 2010 and are committed to implement any resulting
recommendations. In the meantime, they will continue to enhance banking supervision to
improve compliance with the prudential ratios and strengthen the application of the
regulatory framework of the microfinance sector.
My authorities are determined to advance the implementation of its reform agenda during
the program period, as evidenced by the recent actions (electricity tariff increases and call for
bid for a one-stop window in for port operations) taken prior to this meeting. As indicated in
the MEFP and partially mentioned above, benchmarks for progress during the program
include critical actions in the reforms of the fiscal, agriculture, energy, telecommunications
and transportation sectors. Further progress is also expected in the implementation of the
second-generation reforms (justice, land tenure, and financial services) with the support of
the MCC.
Conclusion
My authorities are requesting a new three-year ECF arrangement in support of their
economic and financial program aimed at mitigating the effects of the global and financial
crisis in the near term, while ensuring sustained growth over the medium-term and making
further strides in reducing poverty. They have demonstrated a strong ownership of their
program with a steady implementation of structural reforms after the expiration of the last
arrangement, despite difficult domestic environment. In light of the strength of the program

5
and the prior actions taken, I will appreciate Board’s support for my Beninese authorities’
request.
