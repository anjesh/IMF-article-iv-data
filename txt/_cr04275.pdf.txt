Discussions on the 2004 Article IV consultation, the sixth and final review under the
arrangement supported by the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), and the ex
post assessment of Niger’s performance under Fund supported programs, were held in
Niamey during April 12 -26, 2004. The Nigerien representatives included Mr. Zeine,
Minister of Finance and Economy, Mr. Soumana, the National Director of the Central Bank
of West African States (BCEAO), other ministers, and senior government officials. The
mission also met with President Tanja and Prime Minister Hama Amadou, and
representatives of the private sector, the donor community, and non governmental
organizations.

On December 14, 2000, the Executive Board approved a three-year PRGF arrangement for
Niger in an amount equivalent to SDR 59.2 million (90 percent of quota), and declared Niger
eligible for debt relief under the Enhanced Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC Initiative). The arrangement was extended to end-June 2004 at the time of the fifth
review on November 24, 2003. On April 12, 2004, the Executive Board approved Niger’s
Enhanced HIPC Initiative completion point and request for topping up. Niger’s outstanding
use of Fund resources at end-April 2004 amounted to SDR 84.6 million (128.5 percent of
quota); SDR 21.6 million of interim and completion point assistance was disbursed through
end-April 2004 under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. The authorities have expressed strong
interest in continued financial and technical support from the Fund after the expiration of the
current PRGF arrangement (Appendix I).

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Niger is on the 24-month consultation cycle for program countries, and the last
Article IV consultation was completed on February 8, 2002. On that occasion, Directors
welcomed a rebound in economic growth following two years of declining output and
encouraged the authorities to pursue structural reforms, particularly the privatization
program, and to restructure the financial sector. In concluding the fifth review under the
PRGF arrangement on November 24, 2003, Directors welcomed the authorities’ continued
efforts to keep the economic program on track and carry out their poverty reduction strategy.
They stressed the need to implement the procurement code, establish a multisector regulatory
agency, move ahead with privatization, and develop a technical assistance program to
strengthen the country’s institutional capacity.
2.
On April 12, 2004, the Executive Board approved Niger’s enhanced
HIPC Initiative completion point and request for topping up. Including topping-up,
Niger will receive debt relief amounting to US$663 million in net present value (NPV) terms,
of which US$42 million is from the Fund. This will bring the ratio of NPV of debt to exports
down from 209 percent to 150 percent at end-2002. On May 12, 2004, Paris Club creditors
cancelled all of Niger’s debt (US$185 million in NPV terms) (Box 1).
Box 1. Niger: External Debt and Enhanced HIPC Initiative Assistance
Debt estimates
Niger’s total outstanding external public debt at end-2002 was estimated at US$1,758 million (about 81 percent
of GDP). Approximately 84½ percent of the debt is owed to multilateral creditors, 15 percent to official
creditors, and the remainder to commercial creditors.
Paris Club
Following Niger reaching the completion point in the context of the Enhanced HIPC Initiative in April 2004,
Paris Club creditors agreed on May 12, 2004 to cancel the country’s entire debt, in line with assistance expected
under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative, topping up relief, and additional bilateral debt cancellation. Participant
creditors included the governments of France, Japan, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
The key terms of the agreement are as follows:
x
x
x
x

Paris Club creditors agreed to cancel US$104 million in NPV terms, which represents their share of
the Completion Point debt relief to Niger under the Enhanced HIPC initiative, including topping up,
as agreed by the Boards of the Fund and the World Bank.
All maturities were cancelled, except for a small share of maturities falling due under the 1996 and
2001 Paris Club rescheduling agreements.
Going beyond their HIPC commitments, participating Paris Club creditors pledged to cancel all of the
remaining maturities, or an additional US$48 million in NPV terms, on a bilateral basis.
As a result, and taking into account the assistance already provided during the interim period (US$33
million in NPV terms), the entire debt of Niger with Paris Club creditors will be cancelled. The
bilateral agreements are to be concluded no later than October 31, 2004.

Non-Paris club creditors are expected to provide debt relief to Niger on at least comparable terms to those
provided multilaterally by the Paris Club creditors.

3.
The political situation remains calm, as Niger settles into a long electoral period.
Local elections will take place in the third quarter of 2004; parliamentary and presidential
elections are scheduled for November 2004. The continuing crisis in Côte d’Ivoire and
possible budgetary slippages during the long election period are a risk to strong program
implementation in 2004.
4.
Relations with the Fund are presented in Table 1 and Appendix II; while those with
the World Bank Group are described in Table 1 and Appendix III. Statistical issues are
reviewed in Appendix IV.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PRGF-SUPPORTED
PROGRAM
A. Economic Developments and Structural Reforms
5.
Niger has continued to make progress toward restoring macroeconomic stability
and putting the economy on a stronger growth path. Real GDP growth rose to 5.3 percent
in 2003 (3 percent in 2002), owing to a bumper crop made possible by favorable rainfall, and
to buoyant activity in the construction and trade sectors (Table 2). Cereal production
increased by an estimated 8.6 percent in 2003, allowing for a large build-up of the strategic
reserves stock. Under these conditions, and against the backdrop of the appreciating CFA
franc vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, price pressures remained subdued, with consumer prices
declining by 1.6 percent during the year.1
6.
Economic activity has remained buoyant in early 2004, with the agriculture and
construction sectors benefiting from continued favorable weather conditions and the
implementation of HIPC-funded investment projects in the social sectors and rural areas.
Consumer prices declined in the 12 months ended in April 2004, as food prices continued
to fall.
7.
Niger made further progress toward fiscal consolidation in 2003. The basic fiscal
2
deficit was contained at 2 percent of GDP, as programmed, and the overall fiscal deficit
(before grants), at 7.5 percent of GDP, was lower than targeted. As revenue was weaker than
envisaged, the fiscal outcome was achieved by keeping spending under strict control. Total
revenue was lower than programmed, owing to smaller transfers from the West African
Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), a decline in customs receipts because of the
repeated closing of the border with Nigeria, and weaknesses in VAT collection. With the
exception of the wage bill (3.6 percent of GDP), all other spending items were kept below the

Excluding food prices, the consumer price index rose by 0.5 percent.

investment projects.

program’s projections. Total spending
on health and education was equivalent
to 5.2 percent of GDP in 2003,
compared with 6.1 percent envisaged in
the program, reflecting mainly
shortfalls in external assistance for
projects in these sectors, owing to
administrative delays on the part of
both the authorities and donors. Taking
into account the reduction in domestic
arrears, the government’s net financing
requirement was more than covered
with external resources, including from
the World Bank and the European
Union. As a result, the government was
able to reduce slightly its domestic debt
(Table 3).

While no indicative targets
were established for end-March 2004
and beyond, government revenue mobilization remained weak in the first quarter of
2004, with revenue collection declining slightly relative to the same period of 2003. At
the same time, expenditures rose by an estimated 0.4 percent of GDP compared to the first
quarter of 2003, with current outlays accounting for most of the increase. As no external
budgetary support was disbursed, the authorities drew heavily on their deposits at the Central
Bank for West African States (BCEAO) to meet the government’s financing requirement
(Box 2).
9.
The external current account deficit (including official transfers) narrowed
slightly to 6.2 percent of GDP in 2003, as an increase in the trade deficit was offset by
lower interest payments and higher official transfers for budgetary assistance (Table 4). The
terms of trade deteriorated in 2003, reflecting increases in prices of food imports. Export
volume rose by 4.0 percent owing to increased shipments of uranium, cowpeas, and onions,
while import volume grew in line with real GDP. The current account deficit was mostly
financed by official foreign assistance. Preliminary balance of payments data show a decline
in Niger’s contribution to the reserves of the regional central bank (BCEAO), as explained in
paragraph 11 below relating to monetary developments.3

At end-2003, Niger’s imputed gross international reserves were equivalent to 2 months of
imports.

The real effective exchange rate
appreciated by 5 percent from end-2001 to
end-2003 (Figure 1),4 consistent with the
strong appreciation of the euro (to which the
CFA franc is pegged) against the U.S. dollar. A
favorable inflation differential dampened the
impact of a strengthening of the nominal
effective exchange rate over the past two years.

have declined by 13½ percent in 2003, owing to a large contraction of currency in
circulation. 5 While net foreign assets (NFA) of the banking system are estimated to have
fallen by 15 of beginning-of-period broad money (M2), net domestic assets rose by 2 percent.
Credit to the private sector and to the government rose by 5 percent and 3 percent of
beginning of period M2, respectively, with most of the credit to the private sector being
allocated to the telecommunications and trade sectors (Table 8). Since July 2003, the
BCEAO reduced the discount rate by 150 basis points to 5 percent, in light of the decline in
inflation and the high level of international reserves in the monetary union. The health of
Niger’s banking system is broadly satisfactory, with the majority of the local banks
effectively complying with most of the Regional Banking Commission’s prudential
regulations (Box 3).

Currency in circulation is reported to have contracted by two thirds during 2003. Against
the backdrop of unexplained erratic swings in currency in circulation in several other
WAEMU countries, this indicates that the BCEAO continues to experience difficulties in
measuring that aggregate for individual countries of the monetary union. The authorities have
noted that steps are being taken to address this problem. The staff has been following up on
this issue in the context of the regional Article IV consultations with the WAEMU.

-9-

12.
In 2003, the authorities continued with their efforts to improve public
expenditure management. The operations of the external debt unit were strengthened
through training and the installation of new software, and two regional treasury offices were
computerized for the implementation of the new charter of public accounts. In
November 2003, the authorities successfully finalized the budget for 2004 using the new
budget nomenclature and charter of public accounts, following extensive training programs.6
The authorities also completed an actuarial audit of the National Retirement Pension Fund
(NRPF) and a financial audit of the wage bill.7 However, the implementation of the new
public procurement code was postponed owing to delays in the provision of technical
assistance.
13.
During 2003 the authorities set up successfully a multisector regulatory agency
(MRA), but the privatization of the State’s electricity and petroleum enterprises
(NIGELEC and SONIDEP) was further delayed. Unable to attract investors to take over
SONIDEP in late 2003, the authorities launched a new tender offer in 2004. The privatization
of NIGELEC has proven difficult owing to the need to mobilize US$60-100 million in
funding for its rehabilitation and expansion, as well as the company’s dependence on the
Nigerian Electrical Power Authority (NEPA), which faces its own financial difficulties.
Discussions are under way with Nigerian and French companies to set up a consortium that
would take a 51 percent stake in NIGELEC (Box 4).
B. Program Implementation in 2003
14.
The implementation of the 2003 PRGF-supported program was broadly
satisfactory. All of the quantitative and structural performance criteria for December 2003
were observed, with the exception of the performance criterion on the reduction of domestic
arrears, owing to the shortfall in revenue and delays in receiving external financial assistance
(Tables 6 and 7).8 Staff reached understandings with the authorities on a revised schedule for

6

At end-2002, the Organic Law was amended by decree to take into account the new budget
nomenclature and charter of public accounts, while ratifying the merger of the capital budget
with the recurrent budget.
7

The actuarial audit of the National Pension Fund was conducted in an effort to determine
the Fund’s financial viability and the effectiveness of its management. The audit revealed
several weaknesses in management practices, including incomplete information on the
documents used for determining payments of benefits and difficulties in determining eligible
pension beneficiaries. The audit of wages and salaries did not uncover evidence of ghost
workers but recommended a physical count of the civil servants.
8

The net reduction in domestic arrears amounted to CFAF 12.2 billion, instead of the
programmed CFAF 18 billion.

Box 4. Niger: Structural Conditionality Under the PRGF Arrangement
Coverage of structural conditionality in the current program
The structural areas covered by conditionality in the 2003 program included the following: (i) continuous
implementation of the petroleum product pricing system; (ii) introduction and use of a new debt-management
and recording software; (iii) completion of an actuarial study of the National Retirement Pension Fund;
(iv) completion of a financial audit of the wage bill; (v) computerization of the regional treasury offices for the
implementation of the new government charter of public accounts; and (vi) preparation of a medium-term
expenditure framework for two key social sectors. The continuous implementation of the petroleum product
pricing system contributes to securing a steady supply of petroleum imports. The strengthening of the External
Debt-Service Unit will allow for improved debt management. The computerization of the regional treasury
offices for the implementation of the new government charter of public accounts allows the government to
record and monitor budgetary operations more efficiently, while the medium-term expenditure framework will
make it possible to improve budget preparation.
Relevant structural measures not included in the current program
Reforms related to the strengthening of the financial sector and the privatization of public enterprises are the
main responsibility of the World Bank and are not included as structural conditions under the current program.
Status of structural conditionality included in earlier programs
Niger’s past track record of structural reform implementation was not very satisfactory as a result of weaknesses
in implementation capacity and several interruptions related to the two coups d’état that took place since 1995.
The main areas of reform in the last program, supported by the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility
(ESAF) arrangement (1996-98), included civil service reform to control the wage bill, the privatization of
public enterprises, the restructuring of the banking sector, and governance measures to strengthen the
transparency of budgetary operations and clear domestic payments arrears. During the current Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement, structural conditionality focused on strengthening the
budgetary execution and reporting processes, as well as improving governance. The track record of reform
implementation has improved.
Structural areas covered by HIPC Initiative completion point conditionality
Key conditions for reaching a floating completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative included the
following measures: (i) ensuring full budgeting of poverty reduction programs financed by HIPC Initiative
assistance, and publishing semiannual reports on the execution of these programs; and (ii) submitting budget
review laws (loi de règlement) to the National Assembly and the corresponding treasury accounts to the
Supreme Court’s Chamber of Accounts and Budgetary Discipline for fiscal years 1998-2000. The authorities
fulfilled these conditions.
Structural areas covered by World Bank lending and conditionality
A two-tranche Public Expenditure Adjustment Credit (PEAC I) was approved by the World Bank Board in
November 2001 to support the fiscal management and structural reform programs in the period 2001-02. The
PEAC I was fully disbursed in amounts of US$30 million in December 2001 and US$40 million in August
2002. The PEAC I focused on the following policy areas: (i) public sector reform, particularly public
expenditure and budget management reforms, procurement reform, and domestic arrears reduction; (ii) social
sector reforms, including key reforms in education and health; (iii) financial sector reform; and (iv) privatization
and regulatory reforms. A follow-up operation, the PEAC II, was approved by the World Bank Board on
October 23, 2003 in an amount of US$65 million, of which US$40 million was disbursed in December 2003,
and the outstanding balance is due to be disbursed before end-June 2004. The financial sector reform program,
which targets the restructuring and consolidation of the commercial banking sector, as well as of the insurance,
pension, and microfinance sectors, will be supported by a forthcoming World Bank financial sector technical
assistance project.

- 11 -

clearing a portion of the unsettled arrears during the 18-month period to end-June 2005. In
addition, as indicated above (paragraph 9), the indicative target on total government revenue
was missed. Regarding structural reforms, the benchmarks on the actuarial audit of the NRPF
and the wage bill audit were observed in November 2003, instead of by end-September 2003;
and the benchmark on the preparation of a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF)
for the education and health sectors was met in May 2004, instead of December 2003. The
authorities have requested a waiver for the nonobservance of the performance criterion on the
reduction of domestic arrears (Appendix 1).
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
15.
Niger’s main challenges are to preserve macroeconomic stability and bring the
economy to a higher and sustainable growth path, with a view to further reducing
poverty. This will require improving competitiveness, raising savings and investment, and
diversifying the economy to reduce its vulnerability to exogenous shocks. Against this
background, discussions focused on the implementation of the PRGF-supported program and
the medium-term policies to consolidate the gains made in the macroeconomic and structural
areas.
16.
In this context, the Article IV consultation discussions revolved around the
following themes: (i) the policies to be pursued during the remainder of 2004 and an
assessment of macroeconomic prospects for the medium term; (ii) the structural reform
agenda, including policy initiatives to promote private sector savings and investment and
improve the competitiveness of the economy; and (iii) the authorities’ capacity to deal with
potential shocks. In addition, the staff discussed with the authorities the preliminary Ex Post
Assessment of Niger’s Performance under Fund-supported Programs, and the recent progress
made in implementing the country’s poverty reduction strategy (PRS). Encouraged by the
positive results over the last three years, the authorities expressed a keen interest in a
successor PRGF arrangement to help implement their unfinished reform agenda.
A. Discussions on Medium-Term Macroeconomic Prospects and Challenges
17.
The authorities target average real GDP growth of slightly over 4 percent a year
during 2004-06, based on substantial increases in investment and a strengthening of
nonmining activities, mostly in the agriculture and services sectors, including tourism. The
medium-term macroeconomic framework also aims to contain inflation below the WAEMU
target of less than 3 percent; narrow the external current account deficit; and increase the
investment-to-GDP ratio to 16½ percent by 2006.
18.
The achievement of Niger’s medium-term macroeconomic objectives is
predicated on the continuation of prudent financial policies, especially fiscal
consolidation, and the acceleration of the structural reform program. The authorities
recognized the need to further strengthen revenue, pursue a prudent public wage policy, and
carry on with the reform of the public enterprise and financial sectors. Government revenue
is projected to rise to 11.5 percent of GDP by 2006, and expenditure will be contained below
19 percent of GDP. As a result, the basic fiscal balance will be brought to near balance and

- 12 -

the current budget deficit will shift to surplus, rising to 1.5 percent of GDP by the latter year
(Table 3).
19.
The staff expects Niger’s balance of payments to remain sustainable over the
medium term, with continued support from the donor community. With the coming on
stream of gold production in 20059 and assuming continuation of strong export performance
for agricultural products, overall export growth is projected to average 7 percent a year
during 2004-06. The growth of imports would be relatively moderate, sustained by demand
for capital and intermediate goods in the public and private sectors. With the terms of trade
remaining broadly stable, the external current account deficit would narrow to below
6 percent of GDP in 2006. The overall balance of payments position would strengthen
steadily during the period, reflecting in part substantial external assistance and private
investment inflows, including in gold mining. As a result, Niger’s contribution to the
international reserves of the BCEAO will improve over the medium term.
20.
The crisis in Côte d’Ivoire has resulted in increased transport costs for some of
Niger’s supply lines and export activities. Coupled with the appreciation of the real
effective exchange rate over the last two years, these developments have eroded Niger’s
competitiveness. The country’s investment performance is further frustrated by difficulties
in attracting foreign direct investment because of high energy and transportation costs, a lowskill labor force and a narrow resource base, as well as a small domestic market. Moreover,
Niger’s attempts to break the heavy dependence of its economic performance on weather
conditions have been hindered by its low savings rate. Over the past five years, gross
domestic savings averaged a mere 4 percent of GDP, with private savings accounting for
about half of the total. Private domestic investment is also constrained by a lack of long-term
funding, as the financial market is undeveloped and commercial banks have a conservative
attitude toward lending.
21.
The authorities agreed that continued strict adherence to ongoing
macroeconomic and structural reforms was essential to addressing Niger’s weak
savings and investment performance (Box 5). In view of the country’s low income and
consumption levels, they stressed the regional dimension of their economic policy within the
WAEMU. They noted that with its more than 60 million inhabitants and open intra-zone
trade regulations, the Union offered significant prospects for investment opportunities in
agriculture and manufacturing. The staff encouraged the authorities to examine the extent to
which the investment potential could also be developed in the context of the U.S.-sponsored
African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA).

Gold production is expected to last for about five years, with a total extraction of the metal
estimated at 23.5 tons over the five-year period.

Box 5. Niger: Efforts at Enhancing Competitiveness
Since the devaluation of the CFA franc in 1994, economic activity and export growth have been led, to a
large extent, by agriculture and livestocks, reflecting prevailing rainfall conditions, a rapid growth of the
labor force in rural areas, and successful price and trade liberalization.
The increase in agricultural exports (mainly cowpeas and onions) has contributed to export
diversification. Nevertheless, Niger’s trade remains heavily concentrated in a few commodities, with
uranium and cattle accounting for about 60 percent of total exports (excluding reexports) in 2002. Given
the secular decline in uranium prices and the moderate growth of cattle production that is expected in the
coming years, the authorities are seeking to capture new market shares and increase those traditional
exports in which Niger has a comparative advantage (cowpeas, onions, and groundnuts). At the same
time, they strive to promote nontraditional exports (including industrial products, meats, and tourism) in
order to sustain growth and reduce Niger’s vulnerability to exogenous shocks. In particular, the
government aims at (i) doubling exports of cowpeas; and (ii) tripling the number of international tourists
by 2005-06. With the starting of gold operations in 2005, the share of uranium and cattle exports is
expected to fall to less than 27 percent over 2006-07.
The government’s goals are ambitious, given the challenges to attract private investment, including poor
institutional, human and physical resources; inadequate property rights and a weak judicial system; and the
high costs of energy, communications and transportation. In addition, the level of financial deepening
remains very low; bank lending is mostly limited to short-term trade finance; and the spread between
lending and deposit rates remains wide, owing to insufficient competition, a high level of nonperforming
loans, difficulties in recovering overdue loans, and high operating costs. In addition, water management
is a major constraint.
To achieve economic diversification and promote growth, the authorities are endeavoring to improve
infrastructure and reduce public utility and transportation costs, notably in the context of the
privatization program (paragraph 31). They are determined to promote private sector investment by
simplifying the regulatory framework, strengthening the judicial system and governance, and deepening
financial intermediation. At the same time, the government is seeking to expand the tax base rather than
increase marginal rates of taxation, and to streamline tax exemptions and subsidies with a view to
curtailing existing distortions and preventing further expansion of the informal sector. The authorities
consider that these reforms are crucial to furthering fiscal consolidation and increasing the level of
resources available for poverty reduction.

22.
The authorities have rightly identified the rural sector as the main source of
growth, given its dominant role in the economy. In close collaboration with the World
Bank, they are developing a strategy for the sector, which seeks to raise the growth of
agricultural output from an average of 2 percent a year to 6 percent. To achieve this
objective, the authorities intend to reduce the dependency of agricultural output on rainfall by
promoting small scale irrigated agriculture and other nonfarm income generating activities.
To dampen the effects of droughts, the government has also created an early warning agency
set up within the Prime Minister’s Office—The Service d’Alerte Precoce (SAP)—which
monitors closely climatic and food conditions and deploys contingency plans for managing

- 14 -

food crises. In addition, the authorities indicated that they will continue to pursue mineral and
oil explorations; so far, results in these areas have been modest (Box 6).
Box 6. Niger: Contribution of Gold to the Economy
In 2003, the Société des Mines du Liptako (SML) was given the rights to exploit Niger’s gold deposits
for export under the Samira project. The SML is jointly owned by a parastatal company (ONAREM),
with a 20 percent minority share, and Canada’s African Geomining Development Corporation (AGDC)
with an 80 percent equity participation. Under the project, which is expected to last five years,
production would amount to 23.5 tons out of the estimated 93.4 tons of Niger’s gold reserves.
The contribution of gold to the economy will be modest, accounting for about 0.6 percent of GDP
during 2005-09 and 9.2 percent of total exports in 2005. Gold export receipts would decline to about
6 percent of total exports earnings per annum thereafter. Because of the exemptions granted under the
mining code, revenue accruing to the government would total US$19.1 million in the form of royalties
and dividends, accounting for less than 1 percent of projected total government revenue during 2005-09

B. Policies for 2004
Macroeconomic policies
23.
Within the macroeconomic framework spelled out above, real GDP is expected
to grow by 4.1 percent in 2004, assuming good rainfall and continuing growth in
agricultural production. Non-agricultural real GDP growth would rise to 4.3 percent,
driven by manufacturing and construction of additional schools, health centers and other
basic infrastructure in the rural areas, in line with the PRSP. Other construction activities will
also be undertaken to revamp sports infrastructure for the 2005 Francophonie games, mostly
with donor financing. Consumer prices are projected to increase moderately in 2004, with
inflation remaining well below the 3 percent WAEMU convergence target.
Fiscal policy
24.
The authorities’ fiscal program for 2004 is consistent with the medium-term
objectives of the PRSP and seeks to continue the process of fiscal consolidation. The
fiscal target is to narrow the basic deficit (on a commitment basis and before grants) from
2 percent of GDP in 2003 to 1.4 percent in 2004. This is to be realized by increasing total
government revenue from 9.9 percent of GDP in 2003 to 10.3 percent in 2004 and limiting
expenditure––other than externally financed investment outlays––to below 12 percent of
GDP (Box 7 and Table 3). In order to increase revenue, the authorities have introduced the
following measures: (i) suspension of tax-free imports of rice for reexport, which had
encouraged tax evasion; (ii) introduction of the value added tax on cooking oil, in addition to
the existing excise tax; and (iii) imposition of a 12 percent excise tax on tea. Consideration is
also been given to increasing the domestic tax on premium gasoline by 5 percent. At the
same time, to strengthen tax administration, the government has appointed a new Deputy
Finance Minister in charge of informal sector taxation issues.

- 15 -

Box 7. Niger: Revenue Measures Proposed by FAD for FY 2004
An FAD mission that visited Niamey in early October 13, 2003 proposed a series of measures
to broaden the tax base, with a total revenue impact estimated at CFAF 5.8 billion
(0.35 percent of GDP). These included: (i) the extension of the VAT on all processed food
products; (ii) elimination of VAT exemptions on water and electricity consumption; and
(iii) imposition of an excise tax on soft drinks and tea. In November 2003, an AFR team urged
the authorities to speedily implement the measures in early 2004, and to initiate the collection
of the license fee that had been instituted earlier in the year on the reexport of tobacco and
cigarettes, with a potential revenue impact of CFAF 0.5-1 billion (0.1 percent of GDP). The
team also reviewed prospects with regard to the return of WAEMU transfers to levels
prevailing before the crisis in Côte d’Ivoire, which would bring CFAF 3-4 billion in additional
revenue (0.2 percent of GDP) in 2004. Finally, the team urged the authorities to begin taxing
imports on the basis of actual values, with technical assistance from the pre-shipment
inspection agency (COTECNA).
Citing the politically sensitive nature of the main revenue measures noted above, the authorities
decided to undertake alternative revenue-enhancing actions, as spelled out in paragraph 24. The
authorities indicated readiness to consider other measures, if needed, to ensure the realization
of the revenue objective for the year.

25.
On the expenditure side, current outlays are programmed to increase by
0.2 percent of GDP in 2004, mainly because of (i) a budgetary allocation for the local,
parliamentary and presidential elections (0.5 percent of GDP); and (ii) a 3.5 percent increase
in the wage bill.10 Over half of the increase in the wage bill is to be allocated to merit pay
raises, against the backdrop of an effective freeze on civil service employment. External
interest payments would decline relative to the 2003 level, following Niger’s reaching the
completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. After stagnating in 2003, capital
expenditure is expected to increase by more than 20 percent in 2004, largely financed by
foreign resources. The authorities expect to reduce domestic payment arrears by an additional
1.1 percentage point of GDP in 2004, including a portion of unsettled claims from FY 2003
(see paragraph 14).11
10

Wage payments would be limited to CFAF 59 billion in 2004, or 36.3 percent of tax
receipts, broadly in line with the relevant WAEMU convergence criterion.
11

Under the current PRGF arrangement, domestic arrears were to be reduced from an initial
stock of CFAF 132.2 billion (10.3 percent of GDP) in 2000 to CFAF 63.8 billion (4 percent
of GDP) at end-2003. It was anticipated that the remaining balance would be cleared over
several years beyond 2003. In the event, the actual stock of domestic arrears outstanding at
end-2003 amounted to CFAF 69.6 billion, or 0.4 percent of GDP higher than programmed;
these arrears are expected be cleared over the five-year period through end-2008 (see
Table 5).

- 16 -

26.
The authorities indicated that the 2004 budget allocations for the social sectors
were consistent with the PRSP objectives in these areas. Spending in education and health
sectors is expected to rise to 5.6 percent of GDP in 2004, from 5.2 percent in 2003, owing to
increased HIPC resources and higher project financing for these sectors (Table 8). This
would contribute to increasing the number of classrooms and teachers as part of the special
volunteer teachers program, the staffing of rural health centers, and national immunization
rates for infants aged 12-14 months.
27.
The financing gap amounting to CFAF 58 billion (3.4 percent of GDP) is
expected to be fully covered in 2004. The authorities have already received financing
assurances from the European Union (CFAF 19.1 billion), the World Bank (CFAF 13.2
billion), the African Development Bank (CFAF 3 billion) and other donors (CFAF 16.4
billion), including France and Belgium. A residual financing gap estimated at CFAF 6.4
billion (0.4 percent of GDP) is expected to be mostly covered with additional bilateral
assistance in the second half of the year.
Monetary policy
28.
Monetary policy in 2004 continues to be conducted at the regional level, and is
aimed at maintaining price stability and strengthening the external position. Net bank
credit to the government is projected to increase moderately, permitting the allocation of
adequate financial resources to the private sector. The authorities will begin complying with
the general guidelines of the monetary authorities requiring the settlement of outstanding
statutory advances to the central bank. They also intend to issue government bonds on the
regional financial market. In consultation with the World Bank, the authorities are
implementing the reform of the financial sector and intensifying consultations with the
BCEAO on the supervision of microfinance institutions. Consistent with the low levels of
foreign interest rates, in January 2004 the rediscount rate was eased by a further 50 basis
points, to 4 percent.
Regional integration
29.
The authorities noted that despite the improvement in Niger’s overall economic
performance, the country will not meet all the convergence criteria set in the
WAEMU’s regional Convergence, Stability, Growth and Solidarity Pact for 2004.12

12

The WAEMU’s 1999 Growth and Solidarity Pact is based on the observance by member
states of 8 convergence indicators pertaining to the public finances, the real sector, the
balance of payments, and the common currency. Indicators viewed as essential are known as
convergence criteria.

The authorities reiterated, however, their commitment to the continued implementation of the
policies required to meet these objectives. In particular, they recognized the need to continue
broadening the tax base to progressively move toward meeting the regional revenue-to-GDP
threshold of 17 percent. Realization of the latter remains, nevertheless, a long-term challenge,
and the authorities noted that improvements in revenue mobilization are bound to be
gradual.13 They also underscored their intention to adhere to prudent demand management
policies and to rely on grant financing in order to reach and maintain the targeted debt-toGDP ratio (Box 8).

Structural reforms
30.
Niger’s structural reform program for 2004 focuses on further improving
budget management, continuing the privatization process in coordination with the
World Bank, and finalizing the restructuring of the financial sector. The government has
13

- 18 -

made major strides over the past several years in budget management reform, with efforts
focusing on modernizing the chain of expenditure, both in terms of management procedures
and the information system. Improvements in budget management will also be consolidated
in 2004 with: (i) an audit of the HIPC-funded poverty reduction program; and (ii) the
implementation of the recommendations of a Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability Review (PEMFAR) recently completed with technical assistance from the
World Bank.
31.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to pursuing their privatization and
financial sector reform programs, with technical assistance from the World Bank and
other donors. However, they expressed concern over the difficult privatization process in
some sub-Saharan African countries and called for steps to avoid similar experiences in
Niger.14 With the recent sale of SONITEL (the telecommunications company), the focus is
on SONIDEP and NIGELEC, as well as on the privatization of the CDN and the
restructuring of the National Post and Savings Institution (ONPE). In early 2004, the World
Bank approved a new credit for US$5.5 million in support of the reform of the latter two
institutions.
32.
The government has been implementing a comprehensive financial sector
reform program since 1999 aimed at rehabilitating and restructuring ailing banking
institutions, restoring confidence in the banking system, and deepening financial
intermediation.15 The authorities have successfully conducted an audit of the national
pension fund and are taking steps toward improving the environment for the operation and
expansion of the financial sector, including the development of microfinance entities.16 The
financial sector reform project is to be financed by a credit from the World Bank.
33.
The restructuring of the banking system has focused on the rehabilitation and/or
liquidation of four banking institutions: the CDN; the Caisse de Prêts aux Collectivités
Territoriales (CPCT); the Banque Commerciale du Niger (BCN); and the Banque Islamique
du Niger pour le Commerce et l’Investissement (BINCI). The CPCT ceased operations in
14

In some well publicized cases, privatization has been accompanied by substantial price
increases, deterioration in the quality of services (including in the form of frequent power
outages), and failure on the part of new private sector operators to commit the resources
needed to modernize and expand capacity. The authorities stressed the need to avoid such
post-privatization difficulties.
15

The financial system in Niger comprises nine institutions, three of which account for
79 percent of total deposits and 77 percent of outstanding credit.
16

Efforts have been made to harmonize the judicial system and the business laws according
to the guidelines of the African Organization for the Harmonization of Business Laws
(OHADA).

1999, and a restructuring plan has been prepared for CDN’s privatization. The BCN and the
BINCI are no longer under the administrative oversight of the monetary authorities, and have
resumed normal operations while continuing implementation of their restructuring plans.
34.
Niger maintains a relatively liberal exchange and trade system. Niger is an
Article VIII country and its exchange system, which is common to all members of WAEMU,
has remained free of restrictions on the making of payments or transfers for current
international transactions. In addition, Niger does not engage in multiple currency practices.
The trade regime is rated as 2 on the ten-point Fund scale of trade restrictiveness. The
country shares a common trade regime with other members of the WAEMU. As a result of
the gradual introduction of the common external tariff (CET) between 1998 and
January 2000, the maximum customs duty rate was set at 20 percent and the number of rates
was reduced to four (0, 5, 10, and 20 percent). Imports to Niger are not subject to quantitative
restrictions.
35.
Niger is a signatory of the Cotonou Convention,17 and as such its exports to the
European Union generally enjoy nonreciprocal preferential treatment in the form of
exemption from import duties. Likewise, Nigerien goods enjoy nonreciprocal preferential
access to the markets of developed countries, other than the European Union member states,
under the Generalized System of Preferences. The country is also eligible for the benefits of
the United States’ AGOA.18
C. Ex Post Assessment and Possible Successor PRGF Arrangement
36.
Niger is still at a relatively early stage of its reform agenda. With the notable
exception of the current PRGF Arrangement, performance under Fund-supported programs
has lacked in perseverance and continuity, due to repeated bouts of political and social
instability, as well as to limited institutional and human capital capacity. Because of the
ensuing stop-go pattern of policy implementation, the extent of effective adjustment has been
moderate, and real GDP growth has remained highly dependent on weather conditions
(Box 9).
37.
The authorities emphasized their commitment to breaking the heavy dependence
of Niger’s economy on rainfall. In their view, setting Niger’s economy on a long-term
17

The convention, signed June 23, 2000 in Cotonou (Benin), regulates relations between the
European Union and the African, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) countries in the areas of
trade cooperation and development aid. The agreement replaces the Lomé Convention, which
had been in effect since 1975 and whose fourth extension expired at the end of
February 2000.

Niger is also a founding member of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS), whose Treaty was revised in 1993 to include the objective of economic and
monetary union.

sustainable growth path would require a modernization of the informal sector and important
investments in infrastructure to ensure a better management of water. This, they stressed, was
critical to significantly enhancing the performance of the agricultural and rural sectors, in
which 80 percent of the population make a living effectively working only four months per
year.19
38.
An area of continuing concern for the authorities is the technical and
institutional weaknesses that hinder program implementation. While the government has
taken steps to improve institutional capacity, much remains to be done, particularly in the
areas of tax and customs administration, debt management, and statistical data management.
Fund technical assistance has focused largely on the fiscal area, especially on strengthening
the tax and treasury administration, as well as the expenditure management process.
Assistance in tax and customs administration remains critical to ensuring that Niger’s
revenue bounces back from the weak performance experienced in 2003. The authorities
called for the posting of new tax and customs resident experts in the country (possibly with
support from France) to replace those that were reassigned last year, notably to AFRITAC
West. The staff indicated that the Fund will continue to assist Niger in developing its
institutional capacity.
39.
Looking forward, the authorities underscored that Niger will remain dependent
on concessional external financing. Indeed, prospects for domestic financing of the poverty
reduction program remain limited, despite the recent progress in improving the public
finances. The authorities concurred that financing needs should be mostly covered with
grants, and only if necessary with highly concessional loans.20 They requested continued
Fund assistance in implementing their reform agenda and securing adequate resources in the
context of a new PRGF arrangement. The staff stressed that Niger’s debt sustainability
analysis should guide the authorities’ borrowing policy in the medium term, and more
importantly, that the level of assistance would continue to depend on the implementation of
sound macroeconomic policies and good governance.

19

Section VI of the ex post assessment report provides a detailed discussion of Niger’s
policy options based on the lessons from the EPA.
20

Even under concessional terms of at least 50 percent, and notwithstanding the assumption
of a smooth pattern of long term exports and GDP growth, the NPV of debt-to-export ratio is
expected to remain above the 150 percent threshold in the long run, despite HIPC Initiative
topping-up assistance. The ratios of the debt service to both exports and government revenue
would, however, remain relatively low (below 7 percent).

- 21 -

Box 9. Niger: Overview of the Ex Post Assessment of Niger’s Performance
Under Fund-Supported Programs
Overall performance under Fund-supported programs
x Performance under Niger's adjustment programs was weak in the early 1990s, became mixed during the
latter part of the decade, and clearly improved during the period 2000-03. With the notable exception of
the three years to 2003, program implementation in the last decade lacked in perseverance and continuity,
owing to political and social instability, as well as limited institutional and human resource capacity.
x Niger’s stop-go pattern of policy implementation has limited the extent of effective adjustment and reform.
Real GDP growth has remained weak and dependent on weather conditions, and the revenue-to-GDP ratio
is the lowest in the WAEMU, making it difficult to considerably reduce the country’s dependence on
external aid.
x Steady trade liberalization under Fund-supported programs has resulted in increased openness of the
economy. Program approach to export promotion progressively shifted away from reforming of specific
sectors toward improving the investment climate, along with attaining macroeconomic stability. While
uranium remains the single most important export, there has been some progress in export diversification.
x The volatility of foreign aid flows presented significant challenges to successive programs. It resulted in
the interruption of projects and programs, and reduced the effectiveness of macroeconomic policies.
x Program projections were sometimes overly optimistic and staff did not always fully take into account in
program design Niger’s weaknesses in capacity implementation, despite extensive provision of technical
assistance over the program period.
The way forward: Niger’s medium-term challenges, objectives, and policies
x The overriding task of the authorities is to place the economy on the path to stronger and sustained growth,
for effective poverty reduction. This will require continued fiscal consolidation and expenditure
reorientation toward increased investment, as well as a further strengthening of Niger’s structural reform
agenda, both of which are essential to ensuring that the economy becomes progressively less dependent on
weather conditions.
x The implementation of the reform agenda will continue to impose a heavy burden on Niger's
administrative resources, requiring extensive technical assistance. The Government needs to develop a
well targeted program for strengthening capacities in many areas of the public administration.
Role of the Fund and collaboration with other donors
x The authorities have indicated their determination to work with the Fund to ensure that the needed external
financing requirements are met, recognizing that the financing needs will have to be covered with grants,
and only if necessary with highly concessional loans. Given the reform challenges that lie ahead,
especially in the fiscal area, the staff is of the view that Niger is not ready to move to a relationship with
the Fund based only on surveillance and technical assistance, and that Fund involvement should continue
in the form of a new PRGF arrangement, possibly with a low level of access. The Fund is also expected to
play a catalytic role in securing financial and technical support from other development partners, with
future conditionality designed to take into account progress in addressing capacity constraints.

D. Poverty Reduction Strategy
40.
Poverty is widespread in Niger. Based on a 1993 household survey, two thirds of
the population lives below the poverty line and one-third is considered extremely poor. The
country’s social indicators are among the weakest in the world. Niger’s first progress report
on the implementation of the

school enrollment rates have increased substantially and medical coverage has expanded in
the rural areas (see IMF Country Report No. 04/161). The authorities have recently initiated
an audit of HIPC-funded programs to improve their effectiveness.
41.
Looking ahead, the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
by 2015 remains a major challenge (Table 13). Under the growth scenario outlined above
(paragraph 16), poverty is expected to be reduced further by 5 percent by 2015. Hence, Niger
would fall short of the MDG goal of halving poverty by 2015 (relative to poverty rate in
1995).21 Measuring progress toward other social objectives has been complicated by the lack
of reliable indicators. Substantive work needs to be done to assess the required financing and
technical assistance, as well as structural and institutional reforms and capacity building to
attain the MDGs.
42.
The authorities expressed their continued commitment to fighting poverty by
using HIPC resources. In reporting on the key issues raised in the Joint Staff Assessment
(EBD/03/94), they indicated that the update of the poverty analysis through a household
survey was delayed owing to lack of funds (an estimated US$3 million). The authorities have
begun a study on the incidence of public spending in the health sector and completed an
analysis of the sources of growth.22 In addition, they are furthering preparations for a

Perspectives, Vol.17, and No.3.

The study underscores the predominant role of agriculture, animal breeding, and tourism in
determining Niger’s growth prospects.

comprehensive population policy. The second annual PRSP progress report is due to be
completed by end-June 2004; work is under way for updating the first PRSP by June 2005.
43.
The staff discussed the authorities’ priorities for conducting Poverty and Social
Impact Analysis (PSIA). The authorities concurred that the recent privatization of the water
company is a key reform warranting a PSIA; however, no funds are presently available for
such an analysis.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
44.
Niger has been implementing satisfactorily the PRGF-supported program.
Especially noteworthy has been the progress accomplished in restoring macroeconomic
stability and putting the economy on a path to stronger growth. Against the backdrop of a
weak overall revenue performance, fiscal consolidation has required expenditure restraint,
especially in 2003. Nonetheless, significant advances have been made in implementing the
government’s poverty reduction strategy, which has resulted in increased school enrollment
rates and improved medical coverage in the rural areas. In recognition of these efforts, in
early April Niger reached the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.
45.
Looking to the medium term, Niger’s main challenge is to sustain and broaden
economic growth in a low inflation environment, in order to achieve a substantial
reduction in poverty. Beyond the pursuit of prudent macroeconomic policies, a vigorous
implementation of the structural reform agenda, especially in the public enterprise and
financial sectors, and the development of a much needed dialogue with the private sector on
economic policy making, constitute important elements for the success of the government’s
growth strategy.
46.
Niger has entered into a long electoral period, with presidential elections
expected to be held in the latter part of 2004. These elections represent a potential risk to
effective budget management. Under these circumstances, strict adherence to the key fiscal
objectives for 2004 would be critical to preserving macroeconomic stability. In particular,
there is a need to ensure that the revenue target is met and that spending is maintained under
strict control, especially the wage bill and election-related outlays.
47.
Niger continues to experience delays in implementing its structural reform
agenda. The authorities are encouraged to move ahead decisively with their privatization and
financial sector reform programs to strengthen competitiveness and improve the quality of
services. In particular, there is a need to complete promptly the privatization of SONIDEP
and NIGELEC, as well as the restructuring of the CDN and the ONPE, with technical
assistance from the World Bank.
48.
The staff welcomes the broadly satisfactory implementation of the PRSP since
the issuance of the first annual progress report in June 2003. Although progress has been
made in addressing some of the issues raised in the JSA, difficulties have also emerged.
Specifically, while preparations for developing a population policy have started, work on the
household survey has been put on hold, owing to lack of resources. Looking ahead, it is

- 24 -

important that the survey be carried out, and that the HIPC Initiative savings be used
effectively to further advance the poverty reduction program. The authorities should be
commended for their efforts to complete the second annual progress report and update the
PRSP.
49.
The authorities agreed with the thrust of the ex post assessment of past Fundsupported programs. They stressed that substantial investments in water management
infrastructure and irrigation systems are essential to reduce the continued dependence of
growth performance on weather conditions. They also concurred with the staff on the
importance of limiting external financing to grants and highly concessional loans to prevent a
deterioration of debt sustainability.
50.
Niger provides adequate data to the Fund, although timeliness, quality, and
coverage need to be improved. In particular, data sources and the methodology employed in
deriving the national accounts and balance of payments data are in need of substantial
improvement. In addition, there are serious weaknesses in the monetary data owing to large
swings in currency in circulation in several WAEMU countries that need to be addressed at
the regional level. Staff will continue to assist the authorities in securing the necessary
technical assistance to help in the overall improvement of the statistics used for policy
formulation and program monitoring.
51.
Finally, the staff encourages the authorities to closely monitor the key potential
risks to effective implementation of their reform agenda. These pertain to Niger’s weak
revenue performance, its dependence on donor support, and the country’s weak institutional
capacity. Addressing these risks requires continued strengthening of revenue mobilization,
securing the timely disbursement of adequate external assistance, and developing and
implementing a well-targeted technical assistance program.
52.
The staff recommends the completion of the sixth and final review under the
PRGF arrangement. Considering the government’s stated commitment to pursuing the
ongoing reform efforts, and in view of the steps taken to preserve Niger’s medium term
objectives with regard to the reduction of domestic payments arrears, the staff supports the
authorities’ request for a waiver for the nonobservance of the missed performance criterion
for end-December 2003.
53.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Niger be held in accordance
with the provisions of the Executive Board Decision No. 12854-(02/96), 9/12/02.

Note: The term "debt" has the meaning set forth in point number 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Regard to Foreign Debt, adopted on August 24, 2000, and also applies to commitments contracted or
guaranteed for which value has not been received.
1/ Performance criteria for program indicators under A and B; indicative targets otherwise. The performance criterion on net bank credit to government is replaced by a performance criterion on domestic financing for December 2003 (N/A = not applicable).
2/ ¥ and X reflect the observance or the nonobservance, respectively, of a performance criterion or indicative target.
3/ The ceiling on net bank credit to government or domestic financing of the budget will be adjusted if the amount of disbursements of external budgetary assistance, as defined in footnote 6, exceeds or falls short of program forecasts.
If disbursements are less than the programmed amounts, the ceiling will be raised pro tanto in line with the observed shortfalls up to a maximum of CFAF 7.5 billion at end-March 2003, CFAF 7.5 billion at end-June 2003, CFAF 15.0 billion at end-September
2003, and CFAF 7.0 billion at end-December 2003. If disbursements of assistance exceed programmed amounts by more than CFAF 3.0 billion, the ceilings will be lowered pro tanto by any additional amount beyond this CFAF 3.0 billion
unless the excess assistance is used for a reduction of domestic payments arrears in excess of the programmed reduction.
4/ Maximum. If external budgetary assistance defined in footnote 6 exceeds the amounts programmed by up to CFAF 3.0 billion , the basic budget balance will be decreased pro tanto by that amount.
5/ Total revenue, excluding grants and revenue from settlement of reciprocal debts, minus total expenditure excluding foreign-financed investment outlays.
6/ Minimum.
7/ External budgetary assistance (including traditional debt relief, but excluding IMF financing and HIPC Initiative interim assistance) net of external debt service (excluding IMF repayment) and payments of external arrears.
8/ Except for ordinary credit for imports or debt relief.
9/ Excluding debt relief obtained in the form of rescheduling or refinancing.
10/ Excluding (i) revenue from the settlement of reciprocal debts between the government and Nigerien enterprises; and (ii) revenue from the privatization of public enterprises that is included in financing.

APPENDIX I

Niamey, June 15, 2004

Mr. Rodrigo Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, DC 20431
Dear Mr. Rato:
1.
The government of Niger has successfully implemented the PRGF-supported program
covering the period 2000-03. During the discussions with the staff on the sixth and last review of
the program held in April 2004, it was concluded that all but one of the quantitative and
structural performance criteria for the end-December 2003 were met, and that one quantitative
indicative target and one structural benchmark were not observed. The missed quantitative
performance criterion pertained to the reduction of domestic payments arrears, with only
CFAF 12.2 billion being cleared, instead of the programmed CFAF 18 billion for the period. The
quantitative indicative target on government revenue mobilization was missed by CFAF 11
billion (0.7 percent of GDP); and the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) for the
health and education sectors was finalized in June 2004, instead of end-December 2003.
2.
The government has reached satisfactory understandings with Fund staff on a revised
schedule for the clearance of domestic payments arrears that preserves Niger’s medium-term
objectives in this area, and would like to ask for a waiver for the nonobservance of the relating
performance criterion. Having fulfilled the conditions agreed upon under the PRGF arrangement,
the government requests, thus, completion of the sixth review and release of the final
disbursement.
3.
Niger achieved strong growth in 2003 driven by the agricultural sector and the
government maintained prudent macroeconomic policies. Early indications are that economic
growth in 2004 is likely to remain relatively strong, mainly due to the continued expansion of the
agricultural sector and strong activity in the construction sector.
4.
The government remains determined to foster growth and reduce poverty, and wishes to
continue to benefit from financial and technical support from the Fund under a new PRGF
arrangement.
5.

The government authorizes the Fund to publish the staff report.

Sincerely yours,
/s/
Ali Lamine Zeine
Minster of Economy and Finance

Safeguards Assessments:

The Central Bank of the West African States (BCEAO) is the common central bank
of the West African states, which includes Niger. An on-site safeguards assessment of
the BCEAO proposed specific remedies to alleviate vulnerabilities that were
identified by staff. Although Fund staff and BCEAO authorities disagreed on the
initial modalities of the recommendations, the following specific understandings were
subsequently reached regarding the key remedies:
Ɣ Financial reporting framework. The Fund staff recommended that the
BCEAO formally adopt International Accounting Standards (IAS) and publish
a complete set of financial statements, including detailed explanatory notes. It
was agreed between the BCEAO and Fund staff that the BCEAO will strive
to improve its financial and accounting reporting by aligning its practices

Decision was approved in principle by the Fund.

2

Net present value (NPV) terms at the decision point under the enhanced framework.

3

Excludes commitment of additional enhanced HIPC assistance of SDR 9.664 million
subject to receipt of satisfactory financial assurances from other creditors.

- 47 -

APPENDIX II

with those recommended by the IAS, as adopted internationally by other
central banks.
Ɣ Internal controls system. The staff noted that the absence of oversight of the
bank’s governance, financial reporting, and internal control practices by an
entity external to the management of the BCEAO represented a significant
risk. It was agreed between the BCEAO and Fund staff that, after seeking the
opinion of the external auditor (commissaire contrôleur), the BCEAO staff
will propose to the BCEAO Board of Directors that it adopt a resolution
whereby the external auditor will be required to apprise the Board of
Directors, during its annual review and approval of the financial
statements, of the state and quality of internal controls within the bank.

Based on the 2002 financial statements, the staff noted that the BCEAO has improved
the explanatory notes to the financial statements and further changes are scheduled
for the next fiscal year, with a view toward a graduate alignment with IAS accounting
to the extent applicable to central banks by 2005. The external auditor has apprised
the Board of Directors of the BCEAO of the quality of internal controls in June 2003,
and the financial statements for the year 2001 were published on the bank's website.
The staff will continue its follow up on the progress of the BCEAO in implementing
the proposed recommendations as part of the ongoing safeguard-monitoring process.
X.

Exchange Arrangements:

Niger is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). The
exchange system, common to all members of the WAEMU, is free of restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. The union's
common currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to the French franc. On January 12, 1994,
the CFA franc was devalued by 50 percent in foreign currency terms, and the exchange
rate was adjusted from CFAF 50 = F 1 to CFAF 100 = F 1. Effective December 31, 1998,
the parity was switched to the euro at a rate of CFAF 655.96 = EUR 1. On December 31,
2003, the rate of the CFA franc in SDR terms was SDR 1 = CFAF 771.76.
Article IV Consultation:

Niger is on the standard 24-month consultation cycle, and the last Article IV consultation
discussions were held in Niamey in April 2004. The staff report will be discussed by the
Executive Board in June 2004.

APPENDIX III

Niger: Relations with the World Bank Group

(As of December 31, 2003)
Partnership in Niger’s development strategy

1.
Niger’s poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP), which was adopted in
January 2002, presents a thorough poverty diagnosis and identifies key development
challenges. The government reconfirmed the main thrust of the PRSP through a progress
report that was validated via a national workshop in July 2003 and will be discussed at the
Bank and Fund Boards in late 2003. The PRSP outlines a sound strategy for poverty
reduction centered around four strategic pillars: (i) a macroeconomic framework ensuring
economic and financial stability while promoting sustained and sustainable economic
growth; (ii) the development of productive sectors, especially in rural areas; (iii) the
development of basic social services; and (iv) the promotion of good governance and the
strengthening of human and institutional capacities. The government has begun using the
PRSP to improve coordination of development efforts in the country, including donorsupported activities. To that end, a donors’ forum was held in Niamey on June 7-8, 2003. At
this forum, donors reaffirmed their endorsement of the PRSP as a strategic anchor for their
assistance, and agreed on a progressive shift from project to program financing, and the need
for further coordination and harmonization of policies and procedures. In this regard, the
signing of a protocol relating to coordination among all donors supporting the education
sector is a positive outcome and a great step forward.
2.
The IMF is in the lead in helping Niger maintain macroeconomic stability through a
three year Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement approved in
December 2000. The PRGF arrangement addresses fiscal imbalances and issues relevant to
macroeconomic stability and economic growth. The PRGF arrangement’s structural
conditionality has addressed areas related to budgetary and debt management, petroleum
pricing, utilization of Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC Initiative)
resources, pension reforms, and transparency in public finances (preparation of budget
review laws).
3.
The Bank leads the policy dialogue on structural reforms relevant to economic growth
and poverty reduction, including privatization and regulatory reforms, education, health and
rural development. The Bank and Fund share joint responsibility in supporting financial
sector and public expenditure reforms. The Bank and the Fund have also jointly assisted the
government in the preparation of the PRSP and the first progress report assessing its
implementation. They have also been providing assistance to Niger for reaching the
completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.
IMF-World Bank collaboration in specific areas

54.
Common objectives and joint support for Niger’s PRSP and HIPC Initiative
processes have increased collaboration between Fund and Bank in recent years. The Bank

- 50-

APPENDIX III

and Fund teams are closely coordinating their policy advice to the authorities and work
closely together in the determination of structural conditionality. In general, the Bank leads
the policy dialogue on key structural aspects of Niger’s reform program while the Fund is in
the lead on policy dialogue on macroeconomic, particularly fiscal elements of the reform (see
Table 1).

Areas in which the Bank leads

4.
Privatization and regulatory reform. Privatization and regulatory reforms in Niger,
supported by a Bank credit, have experienced delays in recent months, after having gained
important momentum in 2000 and 2001. Currently, the Bank is assisting the authorities in the
privatization of SONIDEP (petroleum) and NIGELEC (electricity) and strengthening the
Multi-Sector Regulatory Agency (ARM). The Bank’s policy dialogue with the government
on structural reforms is also being conducted in the context of adjustment operations (Public
Expenditure Adjustment Credit I, PEAC I, and the Second Public Expenditure Adjustment
Credit, PEAC II, approved by the Board in October 2003). The Fund is also a key partner in
this policy dialogue and has included elements of the public enterprise reform agenda, such
as the continuous implementation of a petroleum pricing system, as structural benchmarks
for the PRGF arrangement.
5.
Rural development. The Bank is providing support for developing and
implementing a comprehensive rural development strategy, which aims at mitigating
vulnerability and stimulating income generation, especially in rural areas. A draft rural
development strategy has been recently completed. Bank assistance in this sector is provided
through two ongoing (Private Irrigation and Agro-Pastoral Export Promotion) and one new
(Community Action Program) investment projects. Decreasing the dependence of the vast
majority of Niger’s population on rain-fed subsistence agriculture is a key objective of this
strategy. Bank support in this area emphasizes the promotion of small-scale irrigated
agriculture, livestock, farm and nonfarm income-generating activities and cereal bank
construction. In addition, a prior action for PEAC II ensured an adequate allocation of
budgetary resources to the rural development sector in Niger’s fiscal-year (FY) 04 budget.
The disbursement of the second tranche of this credit is also conditional to the preparation of
a multi-year budget program covering 2005, 2006, and 2007 in the rural development sector
and complying with the MTEF for said fiscal years.
6.
Social sector reforms. Improvement of access for the poor to social services is one
of the strategic pillars in the PRSP. The Bank supports this objective through ongoing and
new lending operations, which combine project assistance with program support, as well as
analytical work, notably on population, gender, and poverty. There has also been close
collaboration between the Bank and the government in the design and implementation of
reforms in the education and health sectors, such as the introduction of decentralized
recruitment of teachers (“volunteer teachers”) and health workers on a contractual basis. This
contractual recruitment program has helped address issues of human resource shortages and
supply-side constraints while keeping payroll costs sustainable. PEAC II supports the
continuation of the contractual recruitment program. The Bank has also assisted the
government in the preparation of a ten-year development plan in the education sector that is
based on the PRSP and includes a medium-term expenditure framework for the basic
education sector. It has also provided assistance and played a key role in Niger’s eligibility
for participation in the Education for All—Fast-Track Initiative. In the health sector, the
Bank has worked with the government on the preparation of the Strategic Orientations for
Health Sector Development for 2001-11. The PEAC II has a specific measure related to the

- 52-

APPENDIX III

allocation of adequate budgetary resources to the education and health sectors in Niger’s
FY 04 budget. In addition, the release of the second tranche of PEAC II is conditional to the
preparation of multi-year budget programs for the Education and Health sectors covering
FY2005-2007 and complying with the MTEF for said fiscal years.
7.
Poverty monitoring. The Bank worked closely with the government in preparing a
poverty profile that served as the basis for the PRSP poverty diagnosis. While this diagnosis
has been judged as thorough and comprehensive by the joint staff assessment (JSA), it is
based on household survey data from 1993. Updating the existing database is therefore an
important concern of the government. A nationwide census has been completed recently, and
preparations for a new household survey are under way. The Bank, together with other
donors, is also advising the authorities on strengthening institutional arrangements for the
monitoring and the evaluation of poverty in the context of the PRSP. In addition, the Bank is
preparing a poverty assessment, as a contribution to the government’s efforts to update and
strengthen the knowledge base on poverty and social development.
Areas where Bank and Fund share the lead

8.
Poverty reduction strategy. Together with other external development partners, the
Bank and Fund have jointly provided assistance to the government in the preparation of the
PRSP. Since its completion, both institutions have jointly advised the authorities on the
refinement and implementation of the strategy. The first progress report on the
implementation of the PRSP has been prepared with the assistance of the Bank and the Fund.
A second progress report is being prepared by the authorities with the assistance of both
institutions.
9.
Debt sustainability. The Bank and Fund have supported the government’s efforts to
reach the HIPC completion point in April 2004. The need to build technical and institutional
capacity for managing Niger’s external debt has been stressed by the Fund and the Bank.
Measures to strengthen the external debt unit have figured as a structural benchmark under
the PRGF.
10.
Budgetary and public expenditure reforms. Strengthening public finances is a
prerequisite for success of Niger’s broader reform agenda. The Bank and Fund share the lead
in this area. Both institutions have played key roles in helping the government reduce
domestic and external arrears. While the Fund is leading the dialogue on revenue-enhancing
measures, the Bank is concentrating its efforts on budgetary reforms, in particular in the area
of public expenditure. The Fund is also making key contributions to improving budgetary
processes: a number of important measures, such as preparation of budget review laws and
computerization of budgetary expenditure, have been included as structural benchmarks in
the PRGF arrangement. The Bank has supported budgetary reforms through PEAC I.
Consolidation and deepening of these reforms are currently supported by PEAC II. Several
measures, such as the issuance of a circular on budget preparation, the establishment of a
cash allocation plan, the closing of budgetary accounts, the preparation of bidding documents
for the privatization of SONIDEP, and the issuance of circulars on the implementation of the

- 53-

APPENDIX III

procurement code are up-front actions undertaken by the government in the context of the
ongoing PEAC II. In addition, the Bank intends to help strengthen Niger’s fiduciary
framework through analytical work on public finance issues, in particular a Public
Expenditure Management and Country Financial Accountability Assessment (PER/CFAA)
and a Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR), both to be completed in FY 04.
11.
Financial sector reform. Key elements of the reform agenda in Niger’s financial
sector are as follows: (i) restructuring of the banks that remain under government control (the
CDN and the CPCT); (ii) restructuring of the Islamic Trade and Investment Bank (BINCI),
(iii) restructuring of the National Postal and Savings Office (ONPE), which involves the
reorganization of the postal branch and the creation of a financial services affiliate of the Post
Office and a National Savings Fund (CNE); (iv) an actuarial audit of the social security fund
(CNSS); (v) reform of the insurance sector; and (vi) promotion and supervision of the
microfinance sector and reforming of the social security system. The Bank has been playing
a lead role in these reforms through its forthcoming financial sector technical assistance
credit. This project, and in particular the studies on CDN and CPCT, have been prepared in
close consultation with the Fund.
12.
Civil service reform and decentralization. The reform and modernization of the
civil service is an important element of Niger’s PRSP, yet there has been little progress in
this area so far. The authorities are currently making an effort to put in place an integrated
civil service database. By allowing a more transparent and effective management of the civil
service, this database should improve control over the wage bill. Controlling the wage bill is
important for maintaining fiscal balance, as recognized by the PRGF arrangement, which has
set quantitative benchmarks for the wage bill. Planning for the implementation of the legal
framework for political decentralization of 1996 has recently gained momentum, and local
elections are scheduled for late 2003. However, important concerns regarding this reform
remain, such as the lack of capacity at the local level and the fiscal implications of
decentralization. To help the government address some of these concerns, the Community
Action Program will help build capacities in rural communities in planning, implementing,
and monitoring micro-development projects.
Areas in which the Fund leads

13.
Macroeconomic management. The main objectives of Niger’s macroeconomic
program, as stated in the PRSP, are to ensure economic and financial stability while
promoting sustainable and robust growth. The Fund is supporting this program through its
PRGF framework by providing financial and technical assistance, as well as through
dialogue on macroeconomic policy reforms. The program has made satisfactory progress
since approval of the PRGF arrangement in 2000 by achieving most of its benchmarks and
overall positive fiscal performance. In the context of the macroeconomic framework
underlying the PRSP, the Bank has provided technical assistance in building capacity in the
Ministry of Finance and Economy to monitor economic performance and macroeconomic
modeling.

- 54-

APPENDIX III

14.
Fiscal policy. Fiscal consolidation is a key objective of the PRGF and is supported by
a number of performance criteria and benchmarks. Increasing budgetary revenue in order to
progressively lower the government’s reliance on external assistance is particularly
important, given Niger’s low level of revenues, compared with regional partners in
WAEMU. In terms of expenditures, the Fund is mainly concerned with overall budget
envelopes, while the Bank focuses on inter- and intrasectoral allocations, in particular in the
key sectors of education, health, and rural development.
15.
Monetary policy. The Fund leads the policy dialogue on monetary policy, which is
set by the regional monetary authorities (BCEAO). The PRGF arrangement includes
quantitative benchmarks for net bank credit to the government.
World Bank Group strategy

16.
The Bank’s new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the period 2003 to 2005 was
approved by the Bank Board in January 2003. Its main objective is to support the
implementation and further refinement of the PRSP. The strategic focus of the CAS is based
on the four pillars of Niger’s poverty reduction strategy. The CAS outlines a lending and
nonlending program that, in line with the Bank’s comparative advantage, will selectively
provide assistance in areas relevant to these PRSP priorities.
17.
As of September 30, 2003, the World Bank lending portfolio in Niger consisted of
eight IDA operations, with a total commitment of US$245 million, out of which
US$187 million was undisbursed. The CAS includes a base-case IDA lending program of
US$238 million for FY 03 to FY 05. The Bank’s nonlending program for the CAS period is
designed with a view to further assisting Niger in refining its Poverty Reduction Strategy and
building capacity for a gradual transition toward programmatic lending.

The CAS outlines the Bank’s Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) for the
coming years. The AAA program will help the government refine the PRSP by designing
policy responses to issues raised in the joint staff assessments of the PRSP and PRSP
progress report, such as poverty analysis, gender, population growth, and sources of growth.
The AAA program also aims at reinforcing public sector capacity in pursuit of the PRSP’s
objectives and in preparing Niger for the transition to consolidated programmatic lending. In
support of these objectives, sector work on population and rural development is being
completed. Others are ongoing, including a Public Expenditure Review/CFAA, a Poverty
Analysis (FY 04), and a CPAR (FY 04) or planned, Development Policy Review (FY 05).
19.
The Bank is committed to enhancing external partnerships in the framework of the
government’s current efforts to mobilize and coordinate donor support for PRSP
implementation. Besides the strong partnership with the Fund, the Bank is collaborating with
a number of donors in different areas, including the European Union, the African
Development Bank (AfDB), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), and key
bilateral donors involved in development issues in Niger.

NIGER
Ex Post Assessment of Performance Under IMF-Supported Programs
Prepared by a Team from AFR, FAD, and PDR
June 15, 2004
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Niger’s economic growth has consistently been lacking in vigor, falling far
short of levels that would make possible substantial improvements in living standards.
The lackluster performance is attributable to several key factors, including recurrent
droughts, deterioration in the terms of trade, social and political disturbances and severance
of external financial assistance in the aftermath of sometimes bloody military coups.
2.
In addressing its deep-seated economic problems over the last decade, Niger
has benefited from support from the IMF. Fund involvement during the period has taken
the form of: a Stand-By Agreement (SBA, 1994-95); an Enhanced Structural Adjustment
Facility (ESAF, 1996-99); and a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF, 2000-03).
This report reviews the country’s economic performance and reform efforts in the ten-year
period to end-20031 (Section II), and makes an overall assessment of Niger’s adjustment
experience and program design (Section III). On the basis of this evaluation, the report looks
at the challenges the authorities face over the medium-term as they strive to move Niger
toward achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (Section IV); finally, the report
draws lessons for future Fund involvement with Niger (Section V) and provides the
authorities’ views on the ex post assessment (VI).
II. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND REFORMS DURING 1994-2003
The devaluation of the CFA franc
3.
In early 1994, in the face of persistent macroeconomic imbalances, the
government put in place a comprehensive Fund supported-adjustment program
involving for the first time ever the use of the exchange rate.2 In addition to Fund
1

The report was prepared by a staff team comprised of Messrs. Matungulu (head) and
Fontaine (AFR), Ms. Simard (FAD) and Mr. Walsh (PDR).
2

On January 12, 1994, the exchange rate was realigned from CFA 50 to CFA 100 per French
franc.

-2-

resources,3 the program benefited from a fast-disbursing World Bank loan and substantive
debt relief from Niger’s Paris Club creditors.
4.
On the macroeconomic front, the program aimed to substantially raise the
revenue-to-GDP ratio, reduce the wage bill in relation to revenue, and increase the
investment-to-GDP ratio. Revenue was to be raised to 9 percent of GDP in 1994, from
7.3 percent a year earlier; while gross domestic investment was expected to increase from
5.7 percent in 1993 to 12 percent of GDP in 1994. Several key revenue measures were
introduced, including a major overhaul of the tariff structure.4 On the structural front, the
program called for restructuring key public enterprises (electricity, water, and
telecommunications), liberalizing the labor market, developing primary school education,
and continuing efforts to restructure the banking system, notably, the liquidation of the
Caisse Nationale de Crédit Agricole (CNCA).
5.
The devaluation of the CFA franc, along with above-average rainfall, brought
about a record agricultural production and a recovery in livestock and agricultural
exports. Real GDP growth reached 4 percent in 1994; consumer prices, on an end-year basis,
increased by 40.5 percent, compared with an inflation objective of 37 percent; and the
external current account deficit (excluding official grants) deteriorated by over 6 percentage
points, to 13.8 percent of GDP. In the budgetary area, the revenue-to-GDP ratio fell from
7.3 percent in 1993 to an all-time-low of 6 percent in 1994, reflecting notably delayed
implementation or postponement of the programmed revenue measures and weaknesses and
fraud in the customs administration; new internal and external payments arrears were
accumulated (due partly to a lack of new donor assistance caused by the absence of a
“legitimate” government) and there was a substantial overrun in the wage bill caused by
recruitment and discretionary merit pay decisions by the outgoing government.5 As a result,
expenditures on health, education and other social services were compressed. In the monetary
area, credit to the private sector remained weak, reflecting a slow pace of activity in the
nonfarm formal economy. Broad money fell sharply in real terms.
6.
On the structural front, important foreign trade and price liberalization
measures were taken. All import and export licensing requirements were eliminated (except
those relating to petroleum products), and existing price control measures lifted. However, no
3

A Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) in an amount equivalent to SDR 18.596 million
(38.5 percent of quota) was approved on March 4, 1994.
4

The number of taxes levied on imports was reduced to two (customs duty and statistical tax)
and the range of taxes brought down to three (10 percent for essential goods, 15 percent for
intermediate and capital goods, and 35 percent for consumer goods; all inclusive of the
statistical tax).
5

The change in government followed a military coup in February 1995.

-3-

progress was made with regard to the reform of the public enterprise sector and the
liberalization of the labor market,6 as Niger experienced a continued lack of political
legitimacy and a consequent power vacuum in central administration.
Economic developments and reforms after the devaluation
7.
Against the backdrop of continuing political and civil unrest, the broad-based
national consensus needed to address Niger’s deep-seated crisis could not be mustered.
As a result, no significant reduction of the macroeconomic imbalances was achieved in the
year following the devaluation (Table 2). In fact, the SBA-supported program went
considerably off-track, and no purchases were made beyond the one effected upon Executive
Board approval of the loan (SDR 11.1 million, or 23 percent of quota).
8.
In a bid to restore macroeconomic stability, the new military authorities
established in early 1995 a dialogue with the labor union and effected personnel
changes at key fiscal agencies. In support of their efforts, the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) approved on June 12, 1996 a new three-year loan under the enhanced structural
adjustment facility (ESAF) equivalent to SDR 57.96 million (about $83 million), for the
period 1996-99.
9.
In the context of a difficult domestic and external environment, program
implementation was mixed under the first and second annual ESAF arrangements.
Important performance criteria and quantitative and structural benchmarks under the 1996-99
program (pertaining to arrears, the wage bill and civil service reform) were not observed.
Economic activity remained generally sluggish, with real GDP increasing in 1996 and 1997
at rates below that of population growth (mainly due to inadequate rainfall in many areas of
the country), rebounding to 10.4 percent in 1998, reflecting favorable weather. Inflation
remained moderate, in part because of food imports. On the fiscal front, the revenue-to-GDP
ratio rose by a yearly average of 0.6 percentage point, reaching 8.9 percent in 1998 due to the
successful implementation of important tax measures included in the program. Against the
backdrop of improved control over spending, this revenue performance helped reduce the
overall budget deficit to an annual average of 7 percent of GDP during 1996-99, down from
9.4 percent in 1994-95. The external current account deficit (on a commitment basis,
excluding official transfers) declined in 1996-98 to an annual average of 6.5 percent of GDP,
from 7.1 percent during 1994-95.
10.
Although some progress was made under the government’s economic program
for 1996-98, Niger’s macroeconomic imbalances were still large. Economic growth
continued to be critically dependent on weather conditions and the availability of external

The Fund actively supported the programmed reforms in the public enterprise and labor
market areas, which were viewed as essential to enhancing the overall competitiveness of the
economy.

-4-

assistance; government revenue as a ratio of GDP remained low, even by regional standards.
These weaknesses were aggravated following a military coup in April 1999 that caused the
country’s major donors to withdraw financial assistance. In 1999, real GDP growth turned
negative (-0.6 percent); inflation declined substantially (-1.9 percent); and some of the gains
made earlier in the fiscal area were reversed, with the revenue-to-GDP ratio receding further,
expenditure picking up somewhat in relation to GDP, and the overall budget deficit edging
up to the equivalent of 9 percent of GDP.
Reform under PRGF-supported programs
11.
Transparent and democratic elections took place at end-1999. With support
from the Fund and World Bank, the newly elected authorities quickly established a new
economic agenda, while maintaining social and political stability. The government
resumed financial relations with its development partners and prepared an interim PRSP7
articulating an explicitly affirmed commitment to fight poverty. In support of the
government's ambitious program of economic reform and poverty reduction and following its
adoption of fundamental prior actions in the fiscal area,8 the Executive Board approved, on
December 14, 2000, a three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) in an amount equivalent to SDR 59.20 million (about US$76 million).
12.
The PRGF program aimed to more directly fight poverty, seeking to invigorate
economic activity in a context of financial stability, and high, sustainable growth. To
this end, real GDP growth was expected to increase to at least 4.5 percent by 2003 and the
investment rate would gradually be increased to about 14 percent of GDP, with a view to
achieving a per capita GDP growth rate of close to 1.5 percent in 2003. Inflation would
remain subdued and kept at less than 3 percent over the period of the program.
13.
In support of these macroeconomic objectives, fiscal policy would seek to
strengthen revenue performance and upgrade the quality of public spending to support
the authorities' interim poverty reduction strategy. The current budget would rebound
from a deficit equivalent to about 4 percent of GDP in 1999 to equilibrium by 2003,
generating thereafter the savings needed to bolster the public sector’s contribution to
investment. In the structural area, the privatization program would continue, but would no

Such as adopting a supplementary budget law for 2000, increasing the price of petroleum
products and liberalizing their transportation, auditing the 1997 Treasury accounts, verifying
whether expenditures undertaken at end-1999 were in conformity with budget procedures,

longer be included in the list of the PRGF program’s explicit structural measures. Also,
progress was expected in the reform of the oil sector, the liberalization of prices of goods and
services still subject to controls, and the finalization of a strategy for rehabilitating and
expanding the financial sector.
14.
Niger’s macroeconomic performance was broadly satisfactory during 2000-03,
largely helped by good weather conditions, which spurred strong growth in the rural sector,
but supported also by improved public finances; increased capital expenditure on
infrastructure; and a broadly satisfactory implementation of programmed structural reform
measures. Per capita real GDP growth averaged close to 1.5 percent per annum during
the 2001-03 period, while end-year inflation declined to -1.5 percent at end-2003. The overall
budget deficit (on a commitment basis, excluding official budgetary grants) which stood at an
annual average of 9 percent in the previous two years, declined to 7.7 percent per annum
between 2001 and 2003. Furthermore, government savings moved closer to becoming
positive, with the current budget deficit declining to an annual average of 0.7 percent of GDP
in 2001-03, from a yearly average deficit equivalent to 3.1 percent of GDP in the previous
two years. The external current account deficit (excluding grants for budgetary assistance)
deteriorated somewhat, to an annual average of 7.8 percent of GDP over the 2001-03 period
from 6.5 percent in 1996-2000, reflecting in part higher investment spending in both the
government and private sectors.
15.
Progress in the structural reform area was mixed. The privatization agenda
encountered delays, while limited progress was achieved in strengthening the financial
sector. Also, the timing of the reform of the petroleum pricing system was revisited several
times. The telecommunications company, SONITEL, was privatized through the sale of
51 percent of its capital and further liberalization of the sector was achieved with the
awarding in November 2000, through an open bidding process, of licenses to two new
cellular telephone networks. In January 2001, a ten-year leasing contract was signed for the
production, transport, and distribution of safe water in the 51 centers previously managed
by the state water utility. The privatization of the petroleum importing firm, SONIDEP, was
initiated, with the company expected to be brought to the point of sale in the second quarter
of 2004. However, the privatization of the electricity company, NIGELEC, proved difficult,
owing to, inter alia, the substantial amount of financing needed for rehabilitation and
expansion9 and the heavy dependence of Niger on the Nigerian Electrical Power Authority
(NEPA).10 Also, several key aspects of the financial sector reform agenda remain pending,
especially concerning the restructuring of the banks that are still under government control

9

The financial requirements for rehabilitation and expansion are estimated at between
US$60 and US$110 million for the low- and high-case scenarios, respectively.
10

NEPA, itself under a privatization plan in Nigeria, is in an extremely weak financial
position; its role in the privatization of NIGELEC has yet to be determined.

-6-

(Crédit du Niger, CDN, and the Caisse des Prêts aux Collectivités Territoriales, CPCT); the
reform of the insurance sector; and the restructuring of the postal financial services.
16.
By and large, transparency and accountability in the awarding of public
contracts improved and efforts were made to ensure equal treatment of bidders and
facilitate sound competition among them. In 2002, a new Code of Public Procurement was
approved, and its implementation begun in late 2003. Against this background, expenditure
tracking has considerably been enhanced.
17.
In the context of its PRGF-supported reform program, Niger has implemented
since 2000, a series of policy initiatives specifically aimed at addressing the widespread
prevalence of poverty. The poverty reduction and social sector policies are articulated in a
full PRSP that was completed in January 2002, using an extensive participatory approach. A
recent joint Bank/Fund staff assessment (JSA) of the PRSP’s first progress report
underscored several substantive achievements made over the last years in the areas of
education and health (see IMF Country Report Nos. 04/61 and 03/387).
III. ASSESSMENT OF NIGER’S ADJUSTMENT EXPERIENCE AND FUND PROGRAM DESIGN
General characteristics
18.
Performance under Niger's adjustment programs was clearly poor in the early
1990s, becoming mixed during the latter part of the decade, before decisively improving
during the period 2000-03. With the notable exception of the three years to 2003, Niger’s
program implementation in the last decade had lacked in perseverance and continuity, due to
political and social instability, as well as to limited institutional and human capital capacity.
Even during the latter period, the authorities were unable to fulfill in a timely manner
program commitments with regard to the reform of the petroleum products pricing system.
19.
The resulting stop-go pattern of policy implementation had limited the extent
of effective adjustment. In fact, successive governments pursuing Fund-supported policies
have not engendered fundamental changes in Niger’s economic prospects. Not surprisingly
therefore:
x
Real GDP growth has remained weak and extremely dependent on
weather conditions;11
11

The primary sector contributes nearly half of GDP; mining (mostly uranium) accounts for
about 7 percent of GDP, compared with a mere 1 percent for manufacturing. Under these
conditions, and in the face of rudimentary irrigation facilities and extension services,
performance in the key sectors of agriculture, livestock breeding, forestry and fishing, which
are the backbone of the economy, has been extremely vulnerable to changes in weather
conditions.

-7-

x
Government revenue mobilization remains weak, making it difficult
for Niger to considerably reduce its dependence on external aid;
x
The external current account situation has remained fragile and
vulnerable, in the face of continued deterioration of the terms of trade linked
to the persistent downward trend of uranium prices; and
x
The overall poverty levels have remained high, while indicators of
access to health, education, material consumption, and environmental
protection have continued to be among the weakest in sub-Saharan Africa.
20.
Until the late 1990s, the authorities’ inability to improve the lot of the average
Nigerien had created adjustment pessimism, limiting the extent of program
ownership. Several general lessons can be drawn from the shortcomings of Niger's
adjustment experience, including:
x

First, successful adjustment requires the existence of a stable government, as well as a
broad-based national consensus in support of reform. The conspicuous absence of
these crucial factors in Niger, especially before the democratization in 1999 of the
state apparatus, considerably limited the extent of program effectiveness. The recent
advent of elected and stable government, together with the adoption of the PRSPinspired participatory approach to program design and implementation, has raised
program ownership and effectiveness.

x

Second, the adjustment process necessarily requires a sustained effort in which
perseverance and continuity are critical. Before the initiation of the current PRGF
program, Niger’s Fund-supported programs went systematically off track before
reaching their intended term; this negatively affected program outcomes.

x

Third, a successful reform effort in Niger requires a major revenue increase, notably
by strengthening tax administration and incorporating the informal economy into the
tax net; it also hinges on a determined expenditure reorientation in favor of the social
services and infrastructure building; as well as a sustained commitment to farreaching structural reforms. Progress in these areas had been painfully slow for far
too long, indicating that much remains to be accomplished, even though prospects
have improved lately.

x

Fourth, program performance has been affected by two main types of shocks in the
last decade, pertaining to weather conditions and disruptions in external aid flows in
the aftermath of military coups. Niger’s policy responses have for the most part failed
to mitigate the negative growth impact of droughts. However, the authorities have
been more successful in preserving their broad fiscal objectives when faced with
external assistance shortfalls. They have done so by effecting consequent spending
cuts, especially during the 2000-03 period.

-8-

x

Fifth, Niger’s limited institutional and human capital capacity contributed to the
delays encountered in the execution of the reform agenda, notwithstanding generous
external technical assistance, including from the Bretton Woods institutions.

x

Sixth, the staffs of the IMF and World Bank have generally complemented each other
well in providing assistance to Niger, and collaboration has been close. In so doing,
they have improved the consistency and effectiveness of the policy advice they offer
to the authorities. Nevertheless, there have been instances where delays in the
intervention of one of the two institutions have led to breaches in the performance
indicators of country programs supported by the other. In 2003, the preparation of the
medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) for health and education (a structural
benchmark under the annual PRGF arrangement) could not be completed in a timely
manner because technical assistance from the World Bank became available only late
in the year.

x

Seventh, the Nigerien experience shows that after new governments took power, the
Fund generally resumed lending before most other donors. In hindsight, in some
instances, the Fund should have taken a more cautious approach in resuming financial
support, especially when the authorities’ political commitment to reform was not fully
established.

Specific lessons from Niger’s adjustment experience and for program design in the fiscal and
external sectors are described more fully below.
Adjustment in the fiscal area
21.
The most problematic areas of Niger’s fiscal adjustment experience pertained
to revenue mobilization, management of the wage bill, and clearance of government
payments arrears. In hindsight, it appears that the setting of stringent indicative targets on
the wage bill may have been inconsistent with the objective of clearing government domestic
expenditure arrears during the 1994-99 period. Indeed, in the absence of sufficient public
expenditure management safeguards, overly aggressive indicative targets on the wage bill
likely resulted in increased wage expenditure arrears. The reduction in civil service
compensation introduced to contain the wage bill may have contributed to social unrest
during the 1994-99 period, further aggravating revenue shortfall potentials and increasing
expenditure payments arrears.
22.
In some instances, especially in 1997, the revenue impact of the reforms was
overestimated. Although they are desirable, reforms in fiscal administration are known not
to generate much revenue in the short term. Revenue projections should therefore not have
attributed a significant quantitative impact to the revenue administration measures introduced
under the program, particularly considering Niger’s weak administrative capacities. Along
the same lines, it was important that the tax revenue impact of reducing civil servants’ wages
be fully accounted for, which was not the case. Like in many other program countries, real
GDP growth projections were sometimes overly optimistic (Table 2).

-9-

23.
Program implementation has consistently suffered from repeated shortfalls in
foreign budgetary support. In many instances, the rationalization for over optimism in
external assistance delivery is far from convincing. For instance, following the military coup
of January 1996, it should have become quickly apparent that foreign budgetary support
would be curtailed, a development that the program failed to anticipate.
24.
The use of prior actions has proven effective in securing expeditious
implementation of potentially difficult reform measures, in particular in the 1999-2000
period preceding the adoption of the current PRGF program. Resort to such measures in the
face of government failure to comply with agreed conditionality has helped prevent
weakening of the reform agenda.
25.
In view of Niger’s limited institutional and human capacities, streamlining of
structural conditionality is essential to effective program implementation. This has not
always been the case, which explains some of the most publicized program failures. In the
context of the 2002 program for instance, the authorities failed to meet all of the structural
conditionalities pertaining to public expenditure management, while successfully
implementing the retained key public expenditure management measures.
26.
Ambitious reform measures often end up being watered down and ultimately
reduced to weakened conditionality if the appropriate safeguards are not in place from
the beginning. Such a development featured prominently in the area of domestic petroleum
products pricing, which underwent successive revisions in 2001 and 2002. The Fund’s
credibility may have been undermined in the process. A better approach could have been for
the Fund to push for a timely implementation of the initial phase of the reform and related
conditionality, ensuring however that its main negative effects are dealt with through
institution of an appropriate social safety net.
Adjustment in the external sector
27.
During much of the last decade, steady trade liberalization under the West
African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) auspices has resulted in increased
openness of the economy. While uranium remains the single most important export, there
has been some progress in export diversification.
28.
The critical problem of dependence on highly concessional external financing
remains. Against this background, the treatment of Niger’s foreign indebtedness received
very high priority in Fund policies after 2000, when the country reached the decision point
under the enhanced HIPC initiative. In this context, Niger’s external payments arrears have,
at long last, been cleared.
Trade policies and export promotion
29.
Although Niger’s trade policies were not highly restrictive in the early 1990s,
liberalization of the sector featured prominently in successive Fund programs during
1994-96, in accordance with WAEMU requirements on harmonization of external

- 10 -

policies. Over the years, program approach to export promotion has progressively shifted
away from reforming of specific sectors toward a focus on improvements in the investment
climate, along with the attainment of macroeconomic stability.
30.
In 1996, the country’s trade openness rating fell to 2 on the IMF’s 10-point
scale.12 However, Niger experienced revenue difficulties in 1998-99 and, more recently, in
2003, at least in part due to the fact that transfers from WAEMU (to compensate for lower
customs revenue linked to lower import barriers) did not materialize. Thus, while WAEMU
support for import-policy liberalization improved the climate for imports in Niger, the
union’s inability to police its membership and ensure revenue transfers to Niger following
these policy shifts later worsened existing fiscal pressures. By 2002, Niger’s rating on the
IMF’s scale of trade openness had declined to 1. This opening led to an increase in intraWAEMU trade, as trade with Africa surpassed that with Europe for the first time in 2001.
31.
Despite generally adverse terms of trade changes, the volume of non-uranium
exports increased substantially between 1994 and 1998. Uranium, which accounted for
61 percent of exports in 1994, declined to 40 percent of total exports by 2000, with export
revenue falling from CFAF 78.4 billion to CFAF 64.2 billion; non-uranium exports grew
from CFAF 47.8 billion in 1994 to CFAF 115.3 billion in 2000. This export growth was led
by goods such as cotton, groundnut products, Arabic gum, and other agricultural products,
which probably benefited from the price advantage afforded by the devaluation and Fundsupported programs. Niger’s success in export diversification over the last decade has
nevertheless been too modest to have a significant impact on poverty.
External debt and arrears
32.
Niger had maintained a large stock of external, as well as domestic, arrears
through the late 1990s. Despite successive programs emphasizing the importance of
external arrears clearance, a stock of CFAF 236 billion (19 percent of GDP) was still
outstanding at end-1999. In the 1990s, most of this performance has been due to poor public
expenditure management (an area in which both the World Bank and Fund were involved),
though much of the arrears were accumulated during periods of political instability and
consequent delays in aid disbursements, including debt relief, from creditors.
33.
The treatment of Niger’s high level of external indebtedness was given high
priority status in the 2000-03 program, just as the country reached the decision point
under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. A performance criterion under the program stipulated
that loans have grant elements in excess of 50 percent, 15 percent higher than the usual
threshold for low-income countries. This performance criterion was generally observed

12

The lower the ranking on the 10-point scale, the higher the level of trade openness.

- 11 -

during the period analyzed.13 During debt negotiations shortly following the decision point,
including a Paris Club meeting in January 2001, Niger’s outstanding external arrears were
rescheduled. The authorities have been diligent since then in honoring their external
commitments, and there are now no outstanding arrears. As arrears during the 1990s
accumulated largely during periods of political uncertainty, this improvement is in some
measure due to the comparatively extended period of political stability since 2000. However,
the authorities also deserve credit for improved debt management.
34.
The variability and unpredictability of foreign aid flows to Niger presented
significant challenges to successive government programs. Reflecting donors’ reaction to
repeated domestic political disturbances and policy slippages, external aid volatility
contributed to program discontinuities and accumulation of payments arrears.This
underscores the need for: (i) strong policy commitment and program implementation to
ensure greater predictability of donor assistance; and (ii) greater flexibility in budget
execution14 to avoid accumulation of large arrears when external assistance falls short of
program projections.
Poverty reduction strategy
35.
Niger’s poverty reduction strategy aims to foster strong and sustainable
economic growth and poverty reduction, as spelled out in the poverty reduction strategy
paper (PRSP). The latter was completed in January 2002 using an extensive participatory
approach that has helped raise understanding and ownership of key government policies.
This undoubtedly contributed to improving policy implementation under the PRGF. Niger’s
poverty reduction program rests on four strategic pillars: (i) the creation of a macroeconomic
environment conducive to economic growth; (ii) the development of the productive sectors,
especially in the rural areas; (iii) improvements in access to quality social services by the
poor; and (iv) the strengthening of human and institutional capacities, governance, and
decentralization. The PRSP remains the overarching instrument of policy making in Niger.
IV. THE WAY FORWARD: NIGER’S MEDIUM-TERM CHALLENGES, OBJECTIVES, AND
POLICIES
Economic policy considerations
36.
The overriding task of the authorities is to place and keep the economy on the
path to strong and sustained growth, for effective poverty reduction. This will require
continued fiscal consolidation and expenditure reorientation towards increased investment, as
well as a further strengthening of Niger’s structural reform agenda, both of which are

draw from the loan until new terms had been agreed.

- 12 -

essential to ensuring that the economy’s aggregate supply response becomes progressively
less dependent on weather conditions. Such a development is especially needed in the rural
sector where the bulk of the population resides and will continue to be employed. If anything,
the successful implementation of the current PRGF-supported program, within the
framework of the Poverty Reduction Strategy,15 has shown these goals can be realized.
37.
Consistent with the above, and as spelled out in its Poverty Reduction Strategy,
Niger should work toward achieving the following key macroeconomic objectives over
the medium term. First, it should strive to maintain real GDP growth at a level higher than
that of population growth, which is estimated at 3.1 percent a year. The potential growth
poles lie in agriculture, stockbreeding, non-uranium exports, and enhanced specialization in
export sectors as favored by the emerging regional WAEMU market, as well as tourism.
Second, efforts should be directed toward maintaining the inflation rate at the existing low
levels. Third, the authorities should aim to progressively reduce the current account deficit of
the balance of payments (excluding official transfers).
38.
In order to achieve these objectives, a significant increase in the investment-toGDP and savings ratios will be needed, requiring a steady rise in public saving. In this
perspective, the government should reinforce the viability of the public finances by achieving
a surplus on the current budget balance starting in 2004; over time, the revenue-to-GDP ratio
will have to be raised to at least the WAEMU threshold of 17 percent. While attainment of
this budgetary outlook would be facilitated by Niger being granted “topping up” at the
enhanced HIPC Initiative completion point,16 realization of the regional revenue target
remains a long-term challenge, especially considering the country’s relatively high tax rates
and its commitments in the area of fiscal legislation under the WAEMU. Against this
background, the planned increase in revenue is bound to be gradual, reflecting a
strengthening of the tax and customs agencies (particularly at the local level) and the reform
of the tax system, with a view to widening the tax base and eliminating exemptions.
39.
In the period ahead, structural and sectoral policies should aim to effectively
minimize direct involvement of the public sector in the economy. It is indeed essential
that commercial and industrial activities that can profitably be carried out by the private
15

Niger’s poverty reduction strategy is built on four pillars: (i) a macroeconomic framework
ensuring economic and financial stability while promoting sustainable and robust growth;
(ii) the development of productive sectors, especially in rural areas; (iii) improvement in the
access for the poor to quality social services; and (iv) the promotion of good governance and
the strengthening of institutional and individual capacity.
16

As a result of the topping up of enhanced HIPC relief granted to Niger, debt service, in
terms of both exports of goods and nonfactor services and government revenue, would
decline to below 10 percent starting in 2004, despite the ratio of NPV of debt-to-GDP
remaining relatively high.

- 13 -

sector are left to the latter. Consequently, the privatization of the electricity and petroleum
importing companies will have to be finalized, which should help improve the overall
competitiveness of the economy.
40.
Beyond state disengagement from industry and commerce, promotion of the
private sector will be achieved through the creation of conditions that motivate
businesses to invest, including a significant strengthening of the financial sector. The
measures to be taken to that effect should aim to facilitate the emergence of a more
predictable and transparent economic environment, as well as higher business profitability.
Against the backdrop of the existing, broadly adequate pricing policies, the focus should be
on continued improvement of the judiciary and increased accountability in public sector
resource management, drawing from progress accomplished in the area over the last years.
The overhaul of the judiciary is to be achieved in the context of the Judicial Reforms Support
Program (PARJ). In the financial sector, priority should be given to: (i) strengthening Niger’s
links to the regional financial market; (ii) effectively restructuring the Credit du Niger and
the Caisse des Prets aux Collectivités Territoriales; and (iii) reforming the insurance sector.
41.
Niger’s PRSP gives special consideration to economic sectors that have a
strong growth potential. In the authorities’ view, such sectors include agriculture, tourism
and mining. In this context, considering the country’s susceptibility to drought, the
government is strengthening the food security program and developing income-generating
activities, notably through credit programs to support rural women-financed initiatives and
IDA-funded projects in the areas of extension services, agricultural research and small-scale
private irrigation projects. Tourism is being revitalized, with the government improving
existing accommodations and beefing up infrastructure. Efforts are also being made to
diversify mining production, beyond uranium and gold, through intensification of
prospecting activities for petroleum and other minerals.
Institutional and political considerations
42.
As noted earlier, political instability and social unrest explain to an important
extent Niger’s past difficulties in realizing a timely and steady implementation of its
reform agenda. Beyond the need to ensure an effective execution of the policy framework
spelled out above, the country’s success in securing a durable revival of the economy and
sustained poverty reduction will hinge on Niger becoming politically more stable. In this
respect, 2004 will be a crucial year, in view of the local and presidential elections that are
scheduled to take place in the third and last quarters, respectively.
43.
The implementation of the reform agenda will continue to impose a heavy
burden on Niger's administrative resources, requiring extensive technical assistance.
With the support of the Bretton Woods institutions and other donors, including France, the
Government will have to introduce a well-targeted program for strengthening capacities in
many areas of public administration, especially for revenue monitoring and collection, and
expenditure management, macroeconomic data collection and management for effective
economic policy implementation.

- 14 -

44.
The Fund’s technical assistance should primarily focus on strengthening
performance in the revenue agencies, including with measures promoting good
governance, so as to make possible the achievement of the government's medium-term
revenue objectives. Niger has made significant progress over the last years in simplifying its
tax system; Fund technical assistance in the fiscal area should henceforth mostly aim at
further strengthening the tax/customs administration, either with direct FAD involvement, or
through the Mali-based regional technical assistance center (AFRITAC West). The Fund
would also be expected to assist in the authorities’ efforts to strengthen their macroeconomic
data management capacity, particularly in the area of national accounts.
V. FUTURE ROLE OF THE FUND AND COLLABORATION WITH OTHER DONORS
45.
Niger is still probably best categorized as an “early stabilizer” under the
Fund’s typology of low-income members. Until very recently, the authorities have often
faced substantial domestic opposition to some of their economic agenda, specifically
privatization. Under the circumstances, with repeated bouts of political instability, Fundsupported programs have for the most part been founded on the need for macroeconomic
stabilization.
46.
Since the 1994 devaluation of the CFA franc, Fund involvement with Niger has
provided a framework for macroeconomic reform, helping to enhance Niger’s
macroeconomic stability. Fund programs focused largely on fiscal issues, particularly
revenue mobilization, throughout the period. Despite the disruptions caused by political
instability and high variability of growth rates, government revenue increased from an
average of 6.6 percent of GDP in 1994-95 to 9.5 percent of GDP during 2000-02, while the
overall budget balance also declined marginally. However, the current account position
deteriorated during the same period, as imports, financed by external loan and grant
disbursements, grew faster than the export base; the increase in external loans has led to high
debt ratios for Niger. The willingness of successive Nigerien governments to engage in Fundsupported programs has unquestionably been a valuable anchor for macroeconomic policy
and external financing.
47.
In the period ahead, Niger will need to make further progress towards
macroeconomic stability and is likely to remain dependent on concessional external
financing. Indeed, despite the recently approved HIPC topping-up assistance, NPV of debtto-export ratios are expected to remain close to or above 150 percent in the long term, due to
new borrowing,17 and notwithstanding an assumed smooth pattern of long-term export and
GDP growth.
17

In these projections, grants are assumed to represent 60 percent of total needed external
financing (including project assistance). The remaining external assistance requirement is
assumed to be covered with loans contracted with a 60 percent grant element (see IMF
Country Report No. 04/161).

- 15 -

48.
The authorities have indicated their determination to work with the Fund to
ensure that needed external financing requirements are met, recognizing that to the
extent possible the financing needs will have to be covered with grants, and only if necessary
with highly concessional loans. Considering the potential financing gaps over the medium
term18 and the need to ensure continued progress on the economic policy front, Niger does
not yet appear ready to move to a relationship with the Fund based on surveillance and
technical assistance. Rather, Fund financial involvement would be expected to continue in
the form of a new PRGF arrangement, most likely with a low level of access. The Fund
would also be expected to play a catalytic role in securing financial and technical support
from other development partners. The authorities have expressed satisfaction with the Fund’s
past performance in this key area, and called for the institution to stay the course over the
medium term. In addition to Fund support, grant-based financing must necessarily also
involve such key multilateral agencies as IDA and the AfDF that are among Niger’s largest
creditors. With continued political and macroeconomic stability, access to more diversified
sources of financing will eventually be facilitated. In this perspective, the broadly effective
Bank-Fund collaborative approach to providing policy advice to Niger should not only
continue over the medium term, it should be extended to other donors as well, in the context
of the post-Monterrey Enhanced Donor Harmonization Initiatives that are presently being
developed.
VI. THE VIEWS OF THE AUTHORITIES
49.
The authorities prepared their own evaluation of performance under Fundsupported programs, concurring with the thrust of the staff’s ex post assessment of
Fund long-term engagement. They noted the continued dependence of growth performance
on weather conditions despite years of donor support, which they attributed to the
predominant economic role of the rural sector and to a failure to significantly improve water
management infrastructure and irrigation systems in the last decades. They viewed the
realization of substantial investments in these areas as critical to improving Niger’s growth
prospects over time. The authorities also assigned a key role to the private sector in bringing
about stronger and sustained growth in the medium term. They indicated their readiness to
develop a more formal dialogue with the business community on economic policymaking.
50.
Considering Niger as a relatively early stabilizer, the authorities were of the
view that the country would need continued financial and technical backing from the
Fund and its development partners in the period ahead. Prospects for domestic financing
of the poverty reduction program remain indeed limited, despite expected improvements in
the public finances. With a view to preventing a deterioration of debt sustainability, the
authorities indicated they would seek mostly grants and highly concessional loans. They
asked for Fund support in ensuring that the donor community would make such resources
18

The total financing gap is projected at about SDR 120 million (at end-2003 exchange rates)
for the period 2004-06, equivalent to 199 percent of quota.

- 16 -

available to Niger. Beyond helping the country secure donor financial assistance, the Fund, in
the authorities’ views, should continue to contribute to strengthening domestic technical and
institutional capacity for effective policy and program design and implementation. In
addition, the authorities indicated they see the Fund as a key player in further rationalizing
donor interventions, including with respect to the streamlining of program conditionality.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
June 28, 2004
1.
At the last Board meeting on Niger’s enhanced HIPC completion point, several
Directors raised issues pertaining to the freeze of European Union financial assistance
between the decision and completion points. The freeze contributed to a shortfall in grant
disbursements. While the bulk of the shortfall was covered by adjustment, the authorities
contracted external loans not envisaged in the program, resulting in a considerable
deterioration of Niger’s debt sustainability. Specifically, two issues were raised by Directors:
(i) whether the freeze of EU assistance was a cancellation or a postponement of the
disbursement of grants; and (ii) if the shortfall in donor financing was due to circumstances
outside the control of the authorities. This notes provides additional information on the
above-mentioned issues.
2.

The main facts are as follows:
x
Problems in the utilization of EU funds in Côte d’Ivoire (1999 and 2000) led the
EU to tighten its audit practices.
x
Thus, in 2001, the EU hired an auditing firm to audit a sample of EU grants
used to fund education and health outlays in Niger during 1996-2000. In a
preliminary report, the auditors found irregularities and concluded that
CFAF 6.5 billion of expenditures in the sample did not meet requirements for
payments with EU grants. This sample amount was then extrapolated to all bills paid
with EU funds to arrive at an estimated CFAF 14-18 billion of ineligible payments.
x
On the basis of the preliminary report, the EU immediately suspended all
disbursements. According to the EU, irregularities reflected violation of spending
procedures and poor record keeping. The staff is unaware of a misuse of funds.

3.
In response to the above developments, the EU offered two options to the government
to redress the violation:
x
One, the authorities could pay the estimated amount of ineligible payments
into the EU counterpart account and agree with the EU on how those funds would be
spent.
x
Two, the EU could reduce future grants for budgetary support by the same
amount.
4.
The authorities contested both the estimated amount of ineligible payments and the
extrapolation methodology used by the auditors. To resolve the alleged irregularities, the
authorities initiated negotiations with the EU in the fall of 2001, and the two parties agreed

-2-

(in early 2002) that ineligible payments amounted to the initial estimate of CFAF 6.5 billion,
and that the EU would reduce future assistance accordingly.1
5.

The authorities did not choose the first option proposed by the EU because:
x
The government did not have the resources to do so. In particular, as a
member of the CFA franc zone with the BCEAO as the common central bank, the
authorities could not borrow such an amount from the central bank, and Niger’s
creditworthiness did not permit it to issue bonds on the regional capital market.
x
The Minister of Finance was concerned that repayments of EU funds would
be interpreted as a sanction of the government’s management of public resources, a
responsibility he was unwilling to accept since the irregularities occurred under the
regime of the former President.

6.
The result was that the EU curtailed disbursements. Budgetary assistance from the
EU was resumed in the last quarter of 2002 after the Nigerien authorities implemented a set
of measures to strengthen public finance management. However, the foregone amount was
no longer available because of the expiration of the EU program.
7.
The issue of the freeze was discussed by the staff with the EU in Brussels in 2001 and
reported in the staff reports for the second and third reviews under the current PRGF
arrangement and in the completion point document (EBS/03/170, footnote 30). 2 The staffs of
the Fund and World Bank considered that the shortfall in EU assistance was exogenous since
it was not foreseen at the time of the decision point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative in
December 2000, and did not reflect policy slippages or delays in implementing reforms
between the decision and completion points. Also, once the audit was completed, borrowing
was unavoidable given Niger’s particular circumstances; even though, as it turned out, new
loans worsened the country’s debt sustainability. In retrospect, this particular outcome should
have been more fully discussed between the Fund and the EU when the problem emerged in
2001 to determine if an alternative solution was available and whether this episode could
have been avoided.

1

The EU conducted similar audits in several countries, including Guinea, Malawi, Zambia,
and Senegal, where irregularities were also found. However, those countries were able to
deposit funds in counterpart accounts, sometimes with the assistance of disbursements from
the EU.

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Niger
On June 28, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Niger.1
Background
Since the mid-1990s, Niger has been implementing reforms supported by the Fund through
successive Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) and Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) arrangements.2 The last PRGF arrangement with Niger was approved in
December 2000 in support of a program covering the period 2000-03. At the time of the fifth
review in November 2003, the arrangement was extended to June 2004. In early April 2004, the
Executive Boards of the Fund and World Bank concluded that Niger had fulfilled the conditions
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2

On November 22, 1999, the IMF’s concessional facility for low-income countries, the Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Facility, was renamed the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, and its
purposes were redefined. It is intended that PRGF-supported programs will in time be based on
country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory process involving civil society
and development partners, and articulated in a poverty reduction strategy paper. This is intended to
ensure that each PRGF-supported program is consistent with a comprehensive framework for
macroeconomic, structural, and social policies to foster growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans
carry an interest rate of 0.5 percent a year, and are repayable over ten years with a 5½ year grace
period.

-2for reaching the completion point under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative
(HIPC), including topping up, and that the government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP) provided an appropriate analysis of poverty in Niger and of the authorities’ strategy to
alleviate it. On May 12, 2004, Paris Club creditors agreed to cancel Niger’s total external debt
with these creditors, in line with the debt relief expected under the enhanced HIPC, topping up
relief, and additional bilateral debt cancellation. Non-Paris Club creditors are expected to
provide debt relief on comparable terms. Total debt relief is estimated at US$663.1 million in net
present value (NPV) terms, of which the Fund will provide US$42.0 million.
Niger’s macroeconomic performance has been satisfactory in 2002 and 2003, notwithstanding
the adverse impact of the crisis in Côte d’Ivoire and large fluctuations in agricultural output
owing to uneven rainfalls. Real GDP growth is estimated to have increased to 5.3 percent in
2003, from 3.0 percent in 2002, owing to a bumper crop made possible by favorable weather
conditions and increased activity in the construction and trade sectors. The very good foodcrop
recorded during the year contributed to a decline in the consumer price index of 1.6 percent in
2003, compared with an increase of 2.7 percent in 2002. Economic activity has remained
buoyant in early 2004, with the agricultural and construction sectors benefiting from continued
favorable weather conditions and the implementation of HIPC-funded investment projects in the
social sectors and rural areas.
The external current account deficit, after official transfers, narrowed slightly to 6.2 percent of
GDP in 2003, as an increase in the trade deficit was offset by lower interest payments and
higher official transfers for budgetary assistance. Since end-2001, the real effective exchange
rate has appreciated by 5 percent, reflecting the strengthening of the euro (to which the CFA
franc is pegged) against the U.S. dollar. Fiscal performance was broadly satisfactory in 2002
and 2003, although revenue collection weakened in 2003, owing mainly to the impact of the
crisis in Côte d’Ivoire. The overall fiscal deficit, before grants, is estimated to have fallen by
0.2 percentage point of GDP, to 7.5 percent of GDP in 2003.
Monetary policy, which is conducted at the regional level by the Central Bank for West African
States (BCEAO), has remained prudent. The BCEAO reduced the discount rate by 150 basis
points to 5.0 percent between July and October 2003 in response to the fall in inflation, the
decline in interest rates in the euro area, and its high level of international reserves. The health
of Niger’s banking system is broadly satisfactory, with the majority of the local banks effectively
complying with most of the Regional Banking Commission’s prudential regulations.
There has been progress in implementing structural reforms since 2002. Improvements in public
expenditure management have made possible modernization of the chain of expenditure, both
in terms of management procedures and the information system, and have facilitated enhanced
monitoring of the HIPC-funded budget spending that contributes to poverty reduction. At the
same time, the authorities have strengthened medium-term budget programs.
Significant advances have also been made in implementing the government’s poverty reduction
strategy, which has resulted in increased school enrollment rates and improved medical
coverage in the rural areas. There have been some delays, however, in the area of
privatization.

-3The authorities agreed with the thrust of the staff’s assessment of performance under past
Fund-supported programs. Notwithstanding the progress made in restoring macroeconomic
stability and laying the foundations for sustainable growth, Niger faces many challenges and
remains vulnerable to exogenous shocks, especially poor weather conditions, and terms of
trade fluctuations. The authorities have expressed interest in a successor PRGF arrangement to
help them implement their pending reform agenda and mobilize external assistance.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the authorities for the significant strengthening of policy implementation
under Niger’s PRGF-supported program, which resulted in encouraging progress toward
macroeconomic stability, higher economic growth, and poverty reduction. GDP growth is
expected to remain robust in 2004, supported by continuing favorable weather conditions and
strong domestic demand underpinned by investment in the social sectors.
Directors considered Niger’s medium-term economic prospects to be generally favorable,
provided the authorities continue to take strong action to address the considerable economic
and social challenges that Niger still faces. These include: the need to boost economic growth
rates and improve social indicators; a reduction in the economy’s heavy dependence on foreign
aid and vulnerability to exogenous shocks; and a continued lowering of the still-high debt
burden. Accordingly, Directors highlighted the importance of continued progress toward fiscal
consolidation, along with appropriately prioritized reforms to lower production costs, diversify the
production and export base of the economy, and improve competitiveness and the business
climate.
Directors stressed that long-term fiscal sustainability will be crucial to preserve economic growth
and poverty reduction. They commended the authorities’ continued sound fiscal management,
and encouraged them to maintain fiscal prudence, particularly in the run-up to the presidential
elections. Noting Niger’s low tax effort by regional standards, Directors underscored the
importance of deeper and broader tax reform, including efforts to widen the tax base and bring
at least part of the informal sector into the tax system. This will be critical to increasing the
resources available for investment and poverty reduction while reducing the dependence on
foreign aid. Directors also urged strict control over expenditure, including wage restraint, as well
as continued emphasis on priority spending and the provision of an adequate safety net for the
more vulnerable groups. It will also be important that the authorities adhere strictly to the
schedule for clearing arrears over the next five years. Directors looked forward to the audit of
HIPC spending, which will help ensure that HIPC assistance is used effectively.
Directors noted that Niger’s external debt will remain high despite HIPC topping up, and that
Niger will continue to rely on external financing for some time. They therefore supported the
authorities’ prudent debt-management strategy of seeking only grants and — exceptionally—
highly concessional loan financing. Close collaboration with the donor community will remain
key in this regard.
Directors welcomed the continued absence of inflationary pressures, and the prudent easing of
monetary policy by the Central Bank for West African States since 2003. They encouraged the

-4authorities to move ahead with the settlement of outstanding statutory advances to the central
bank.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to their structural reform agenda. Noting the
delays experienced in this area in 2003, they encouraged the authorities to expedite the
privatization of the electricity and petroleum importing companies (NIGELEC and SONIDEP) to
help lower energy costs and boost private investment. Directors acknowledged the importance
of ensuring that the economic and social costs of the privatization process are adequately
addressed. They welcomed the improvement in the overall health of Niger’s financial
institutions, which are generally complying with prudential norms. Going forward, efforts to
improve the competitiveness of the banking sector will enhance financial intermediation, while
the development of microfinance institutions will help improve access to credit country-wide.
Directors encouraged the authorities to press ahead with the privatization of the state-owned
Credit du Niger and the restructuring of the National Post and Saving Institution (ONPE).
They also encouraged the authorities to implement promptly the recommendations of the
recently completed Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review
(PEMFAR) conducted by the World Bank.
Directors welcomed the broadly satisfactory implementation of the PRSP, particularly the
progress in expanding health coverage and improving Niger’s low primary school enrollment
rates, although a further strengthening of efforts in these areas will remain critical.
They underscored the importance of carrying out the household survey, and supported the
authorities’ focus on agricultural and rural development as a vital channel for poverty reduction.
Directors welcomed the ex post assessment of Niger’s performance under Fund-supported
programs. Going forward, they supported the priority emerging from the assessment on the
need to increase investment and savings, including by strengthening public savings through
increased revenue mobilization. They also underscored the importance of minimizing direct
involvement of the public sector in the economy, establishing adequate conditions for private
sector development, and improving infrastructure to ensure a better management of water.
Directors emphasized the need to strengthen institutional capacity, particularly in the areas of
tax and customs administration, debt management, and statistics. Technical assistance will
continue to play a key role to support Niger’s reform efforts in these areas.
Directors encouraged the authorities to improve the timeliness, quality, and coverage of Niger’s
economic data. Particular efforts are needed to strengthen the national accounts and balance of
payments statistics and, at the regional level, to address weaknesses in the monetary data.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries)
concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member
countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex
post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued
after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive
Board in a particular case.

IMF Completes Sixth and Final Review Under Niger's PRGF Arrangement and Approves
US$12.4 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the sixth and final
review of Niger's performance under a three-year, SDR 59.2 million (about US$86.8 million)
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement (see Press Release No. 00/69).
This decision enables Niger to receive the final loan disbursement of SDR 8.44 million
(about US$12.4 million).
In completing the review on June 28, 2004, the Executive Board also waived the nonobservance
of the missed performance criterion for end-December 2003.
The Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income
countries. PRGF-supported programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies
adopted in a participatory process involving civil society and development partners, and
articulated in a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). This is intended to ensure that each
PRGF-supported program is consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic,
structural, and social policies, to foster growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual
interest rate of 0.5 percent, and are repayable over 10 years with a 5 ½-year grace period on
principal payments.
Following the Executive Board's discussion of Niger's economic program, Agustín Carstens,
Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chairman, made the following statement:
“The Nigerien authorities are to be commended for their overall strong policy performance under
their three-year program supported by the Fund. Economic activity continued to be strong
in 2003, with GDP growth benefiting from a good agricultural crop and sustained activity in the
construction and trade sectors, along with improved economic policies. Inflation was below one
percent for the second year in a row, and the external current account deficit was lower than
envisaged in the program. There were some delays, however, in implementing structural and
financial sector reforms.
“Looking ahead, Niger’s main challenge is to sustain broad-based growth in a low inflation
environment, in order to achieve a substantial reduction in poverty. This will require the pursuit
of prudent macroeconomic policies, vigorous implementation of the structural reform agenda—

-2-

especially in the public enterprise and financial sectors—and the development of a close
dialogue with the private sector on economic policymaking.
“Against this background, the authorities’ program for 2004 seeks to preserve macroeconomic
stability and sustain strong growth, with a view to further reducing poverty. Continued fiscal
consolidation is an essential element of the program. Achievement of the fiscal targets will
require determined efforts to strengthen revenue mobilization and to closely monitor
non-essential expenditure, so as to allow for adequate resources for the social sectors.
“The authorities also intend to expedite the privatization of the electricity and petroleum
importing companies (NIGELEC and SONIDEP) and the state-owned Credit du Niger.
Moreover, their structural reform agenda for 2004 includes measures to strengthen fiscal
management, following the completion of a Public Expenditure Management and Financial
Accountability Review with technical assistance from the World Bank. The authorities have
reiterated their strong commitment to using the HIPC savings to further advance their poverty
reduction program,” Mr. Carstens said.

Statement by Damian Ondo Mañe, Executive Director for Niger
June 28, 2004

Niger’s macroeconomic performance under the current PRGF program was satisfactory, due
in part to good weather conditions, but also to sound macroeconomic policies and an
improvement in the country’s structural reforms implementation. Per capita real GDP growth
averaged 1.5 percent per year during the 2001-03 period, while inflation declined.
Progress was also achieved on the structural front despite the delays encountered in the
privatization of the petroleum and the electricity companies. The telecommunications
company was privatized, and further liberalization of the sector was achieved with the
awarding of licenses to two new cellular telephone networks. A ten-year leasing contract was
signed for the production, transport, and distribution of safe water in the 51 centers
previously managed by the state water utility.
With regard to the debt issue, my authorities are thankful to Paris Club creditors for
canceling all of Niger’s bilateral debt, on May 12, 2004. Paris Club’s decision came one
month after Niger reached the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative, and was
granted full topping-up by the Executive Boards of the IMF and the World Bank. My
authorities have reiterated their commitment to use the resources freed by the debt relief, to
fight poverty and to implement the policies outlined in Niger’s Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP).
Nevertheless, Niger faces significant challenges ahead (see below). As such, they are
requesting a new PRGF arrangement, to secure adequate financing that will allow Niger to
satisfactorily implement and strengthen its unfinished reform agenda. My authorities
recognize the need to reinforce macroeconomic stability and reduce the dependency of the
country’s economic performance on weather conditions. The country will also have to reach
higher and sustainable levels of growth to further reduce poverty, as the Millennium
Development Goal of halving poverty by 2015 is not likely to be met. On the fiscal front, and
despite the election year, my authorities will adhere strictly to the fiscal target of reducing the
deficit and improving public expenditure management. But weaknesses in VAT collection
contributed to a weak revenue performance, which in turn, led to the nonobservance of the
performance criterion on the reduction of domestic arrears, for which Niger is requesting a
waiver. Regarding the clearance of these arrears, my authorities have reached satisfactory
understandings with Fund staff on a revised schedule for their reduction that preserves
Niger’s medium term objectives.
Recent Macroeconomic Developments
A combination of sound macroeconomic policies and favorable weather conditions have
contributed to Niger’s strong macroeconomic performance in 2003. Real GDP grew by 5.3
percent, –higher than the 2002 level of 3 percent, and than the projected level of 4 percent.
This strong performance was mainly driven by three sectors, namely, agriculture,
construction, and trade.

-2In the agricultural sector, a good rainfall led to a record cereal harvest in 2003. As a result of
the increased supply of food products, inflation remained low, particularly food prices. But
other factors also contributed to the low level of inflation, i.e., the appreciation of the CFA
franc, and the sound policies conducted by the regional central bank (BCEAO). The
construction sector was boosted by the implementation of HIPC-funded investment projects
in social sectors and rural areas (additional schools were built, along with health centers and
other basic infrastructure in line with the PRSP). These favorable trends continued in the first
quarter of 2004.
By the end of the year, the economy should be further boosted by the rehabilitation of the
road network, along with investments in sports infrastructures, in preparation for the
Francophone games to be held in Niger in 2005.
Challenges
Niger nevertheless faces significant challenges ahead. The authorities recognize the need to
reinforce macroeconomic stability and reduce the dependency of the country’s economic
performance on weather conditions. The country will also have to reach higher and
sustainable levels of growth to further reduce poverty, as the population of Niger is one of
the fastest growing in the region. Addressing these challenges will require, i) improving the
economy’s competitiveness and raising investment, and ii) diversifying the economy.
Raising investment. High energy costs, a low skill labor force and a small domestic market
further constrained investment performance. My authorities intend to increase their
investment substantially by 2006. The bulk of the increase will go to agriculture and tourism.
In the agricultural sector, for example, one objective is to double exports of cowpeas –for
which Niger has a comparative advantage–, and to significantly increase the production of
onions and groundnuts. In tourism, the objective is to triple the number of tourists by 2006.
My authorities have also taken good note of the staff’s suggestion to examine the extent to
which the investment potential could also be developed in the context of AGOA.
Notwithstanding a sound banking sector, my authorities recognize that private domestic
investment is also constrained by a lack of long-term funding. However, efforts are being
made to increase long-term financing. As such, in December 2003, Bank of Africa Niger has
become the first Nigerien company to be listed on the regional stock exchange in Abidjan,
Côte d’Ivoire. Furthermore, a branch of the Sahel-Saharan States Bank for Investment and
Trade also opened in Niger to encourage small and medium enterprises.
Diversification. Niger’s trade is concentrated on a few commodities, –uranium and cattle
mainly–, that are highly vulnerable to exogenous shocks. My authorities are making
considerable efforts to extend and diversify the exports base and promote new exports to
reduce the country’s vulnerability to exogenous shocks. As such, gold production will start in
2005, and mineral and oil exploration are being pursued. But in a country where 86 percent
of the working population is involved in farming, it is in the agriculture that my authorities’
efforts will be concentrated. A scheme to improve the water supply to Niger’s towns is
currently being implemented. The state water company Société de Patrimoine des Eaux du

-3Niger, in charge of Niger’s water resources should complete the installation of 41 bore holes,
ten reservoirs, and 550 supply stations in towns and villages across the country by early
2005. The authorities have also created an agency which monitors closely climatic and food
conditions.
Promoting exports will also require an improvement in the investment climate and efforts
have been made to harmonize the country’s business law in accordance to the guidelines of
the African Organization for the Harmonization of Business Laws (OHADA).
Fiscal Policy
Niger’s overall fiscal deficit was contained at 7.5 percent of GDP in 2003, –lower than the
projected level of 8.2 percent. Exogenous factors explain the weak revenue performance in
2003, including smaller transfers from the WAEMU, and a decline in customs receipts
because of repeated border closure with Nigeria. Weaknesses in VAT collection also
contributed to the weak revenue performance, which in turn, led to the nonobservance of the
performance criterion on the reduction of domestic arrears, for which my authorities are
requesting a waiver. The Nigerien government has reached satisfactory understandings with
Fund staff on a revised schedule for the clearance of domestic payments arrears that
preserves Niger’s medium term objectives in this area.
My authorities recognize that revenue collection is an area of weakness with regard to fiscal
revenue management. A tax revenue of 9.6 percent of GDP is indeed far below the WAEMU
target of 17 percent for member countries. Niger’s government has highlighted revenue
collection as a major area for technical assistance in the future. To increase fiscal
consolidation, my authorities are meanwhile considering a broadening of the tax base, a
streamlining of tax exemptions and subsidies and measures to prevent further expansion of
the informal sector. Niger has introduced concrete measures to increase revenue namely, i) a
suspension of tax-free imports of rice for reexport, which had encouraged tax evasion, ii) an
introduction of the VAT on cooking oil in addition to the existing excise tax, iii) an
imposition of a 12 percent excise tax on tea. But my authorities are willing to consider other
measures to ensure the realization of the revenue objective for the year.
In anticipation of the 2004 elections, current fiscal spending is expected to rise slightly. Such
an increase is justified by the number of elections scheduled during the year (three) and their
significance (local, legislative, and presidential). My authorities consider that after a decade
of social and political instability no effort should be spared to consolidate the democratic
process and to allow the forthcoming elections to pass off peacefully.
As revenue was weaker than envisaged my authorities kept strict control on spending.
Current expenditures were projected to decline from 10.7 of GDP, in 2002 to 10.5 in 2003
but they were actually reduced to 10.1 percent. Capital expenditure was also reduced from
7.7 percent, in 2002, to 7.3 percent, in 2003, –below the projected level of 8.7 percent. All
spending items were kept below the 2002 levels and below the projected levels for 2003
(except for “wages”, which hit the projected target). Health and education spending also
declined, reflecting shortfalls in external assistance for projects in these sectors. But spending

-4on education and health is expected to rise in 2004, in light of the increased HIPC resources
available for priority sectors.
As a result of these developments, revenue is expected to increase to 11.5 percent of GDP by
2006, and expenditure will be contained below 19 percent of GDP. The overall budget
balance will therefore decline from an estimated deficit of 7.5 percent of GDP, to 6.8 percent
by 2006.
Structural Reforms
The authorities initiated the implementation of public expenditure management reforms to
improve institutional weaknesses. These include a strengthening of the operations of the
external debt unit, the finalizing of the budget for 2004, using the new budget nomenclature
and charter of public accounts, the completion of an actuarial audit of the National
Retirement Pension Fund (NRPF), and a financial audit of the wage bill. In 2004, the
authorities have also launched an audit of the HIPC-funded poverty reduction program to
improve its effectiveness, and they will implement the recommendations of a Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR), recently completed with
technical assistance from the World Bank.
My authorities will also continue their efforts to finalize the privatization of the petroleum
company (SONIDEP), and the electricity company (NIGELEC), which were further delayed
due to difficulties with potential investors. For the petroleum company, the privatization is
straightforward and advanced (a new tender offer was initiated in 2004). However, the
privatization of the electricity company should take more time because of the reluctance of
the two potential buyers to take on its planned investment program.
In the financial sector, my authorities are moving ahead with the privatization of the CDN,
and the restructuring of the National Post and Savings Institution (ONPE). The World Bank
recently approved a credit of USD5.5 million for the reform of these two institutions.
Monetary policy and Financial Sector
The authorities have announced that they will begin complying with the general guidelines of
the monetary authorities requiring the settlement of outstanding statutory advances to the
central bank. Monetary policy is in the hands of the regional central bank which follows tight
policy to maintain the CFA franc’s fixed exchange rate with the euro and to control inflation.
The performance and the health of the banking sector is satisfactory. All but one local bank
are complying with the main Regional Banking Commission’s prudential regulations.
In consultation with the World Bank, the authorities are also implementing the reform of the
financial sector (see structural reforms), and intensifying consultations with the regional
central bank on the supervision of microfinance institutions.

-5External Sector
The current account deficit has deteriorated in recent years. However, the trade deficit will
fall gradually because of higher agricultural exports and the coming of stream of gold
production. The import bill is nevertheless expected to increase –though slower than exports–
reflecting the rising demand for imported intermediate and capital goods for Niger’s ongoing
infrastructure projects. The current account balance should decline in 2005, and narrow to
below 6 percent of GDP in 2006, further helped by lower debt service payments (HIPC) and
sustained external assistance.
Conclusion
My authorities are thankful to the international community for their financial support and the
recent debt cancellations, both at the multilateral level, and more recently at the bilateral
level, through the Paris Club meeting. These debt cancellations will contribute to reinforce
the sound policies that my authorities are currently implementing and that are aimed at
preserving macroeconomic stability and attaining higher and sustainable levels of growth,
necessary to reduce poverty. Furthermore, the government of Niger will seek external aid in
the form of grants and loans with high concessional terms whenever possible, in order to
ensure that Niger’s debt remains sustainable.
My authorities are requesting a new PRGF arrangement to secure adequate financing that
will allow Niger to satisfactorily implement its unfinished reform agenda. Niger is still,
indeed, at an early stage of its reform process and the IMF’s financial support will play a
catalytic role in securing financial and technical support from other development partners.
My authorities have the intention to conduct a Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA),
for which the privatization of the water company has been considered a key reform
warranting a PSIA. However, such an analysis will require funding and we call on the
international community to contribute to the realization of the PSIA.
Finally, my authorities would like to call on the development partners to initiate a deeper
analysis of Niger’s sources of growth and to launch an action plan to attract private
investments. It is only through the creation of a strong private sector that Niger will be able
to increase its government revenue on a permanent basis, and reduce its dependency on
foreign aid.
