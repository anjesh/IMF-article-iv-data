IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Kuwait
On January 6, 2017, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Kuwait and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal without
a meeting.2
Economic activity in the nonoil sector has continued to expand, albeit at a slower pace, reflecting
the impact of lower oil prices. Nonhydrocarbon growth slowed from 5 percent to an estimated
3½ percent in 2015, as higher uncertainty weighed on consumption. Notwithstanding an
improvement in project implementation under the five-year Development Plan (DP), available
indicators point to a further modest softening in nonoil growth this year. Inflation, which has
been hovering at around 3 percent, is set for an uptick to about 3½ this year, reflecting the recent
gasoline price increases.
Notwithstanding efforts to contain government spending, the fiscal and external accounts have
deteriorated markedly and budget financing needs have emerged. The authorities’ principal
measure of the fiscal balance—which excludes mandatory transfers to the Future Generations
Fund (FGF) and investment income and better reflects the government’s gross financing
challenge—has swung into a large deficit (17½ percent of GDP in 2016/17). Even when
including investment income and before transfers to the FGF, fiscal surpluses have vanished.
The financial sector has remained sound and credit conditions favorable. As of June 2016, banks
featured high capitalization (capital adequacy ratio of 17.9 percent), robust profitability (return
on assets of 1 percent), low nonperforming loans (ratio of 2.4 percent), and high loan-loss
provisioning (206 percent coverage). Bank liquidity has been comfortable. Credit to the private
sector has been increasing at a solid pace, driven mainly by installment loans.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse-of-time procedure when the Board agrees that a proposal can
be considered without convening formal discussions.

Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2016 Article IV Consultation with Kuwait, Executive Directors endorsed
staff’s appraisal, as follows:
Kuwait is well positioned to mitigate the impact of lower oil prices on the economy. The fiscal
and external positions have deteriorated significantly and nonhydrocarbon growth has
moderated—from 5 percent in 2014 to about 3¼ percent this year—as a result of the drop in oil
prices. However, large financial buffers and low debt provide policy space to implement the
necessary fiscal consolidation gradually while increasing public investment to support growth.
Against this backdrop, the fiscal and external positions are projected to improve as adjustment
proceeds and oil prices recover somewhat, and nonoil growth is projected to regain momentum
to about 4 percent over the medium term supported by a continued improvement in project
implementation under the five-year Development Plan. The main risk to the outlook stems from
a further sustained decline in oil prices. Slow project implementation, more volatile global
financial conditions and spillovers from heightened regional security risks could also affect
economic prospects.
Nonetheless, “lower-for-longer” oil prices call for steadfast implementation of reforms. The
government’s six-pillar reform strategy is rightly focused on reforming public finances and
promoting a greater role for the private sector in generating growth and jobs for nationals. Efforts
to streamline current spending, including the recent gasoline and utility price reforms, and
measures to facilitate business licensing are steps in the right direction. Maintaining consensus in
favor of economic transformation and sustaining the reform momentum is paramount for the
success of the strategy.
Fiscal reforms should focus on addressing underlying fiscal vulnerabilities and be designed so as
to minimize any dampening impact on growth. Gradual removal of fuel and electricity subsidies
and control of the wage bill through a well-designed reform that avoids significant upfront costs
would help reduce budget rigidities, while the introduction of the VAT and business profit tax
and the repricing of government services would go a long way in diversifying revenue away
from oil. These fiscal reforms should be designed and sequenced with a view to striking a
balance between generating fiscal savings in line with intergenerational equity levels and
mitigating the drawbacks of fiscal consolidation on economic activity. A comprehensive
medium-term fiscal framework based on a top-down approach and articulated around
clearly-specified medium-term fiscal objectives would help guide the consolidation plans
and reduce implementation risks.
Fiscal financing options should be assessed within a comprehensive asset/liability management
framework with due consideration to macro-financial linkages. Consistent with the government’s
current approach, a balanced financing mix that combines continued drawdown of assets in the
GRF, measured amounts of domestic bond issuance and some external borrowing would mitigate
potential crowding out of private sector credit while maintaining a high level of liquid buffers.

3
Continued progress toward strengthening the institutional and legal frameworks, including to
support a more comprehensive and longer-term view on asset and liability management,
improving debt issuance processes, and fostering increased transparency would ensure effective
debt management and support the development of domestic fixed income markets.
Steps can be taken to further strengthen financial sector resilience. In light of the potential risks
from a sustained further decline in oil prices and given the financial sector risks inherent to a
largely undiversified economy, the CBK initiatives to enhance financial sector surveillance are
welcome. A formal framework for operationalizing macro-prudential measures, reforms to
facilitate debt recovery, developing a liquidity forecasting framework, and strengthening the
crisis management framework, including by introducing a special resolution regime for banks
and a deposit insurance mechanism, would help further enhance financial sector resilience and
ensure orderly resolution of banks in the event of stress.
The peg to an undisclosed basket of currencies is appropriate and can be further underpinned by
fiscal adjustment. The peg has provided an effective nominal anchor. A moderate current
account gap can be largely closed by increasing fiscal savings as recommended over the medium
term.
Labor market reforms and efforts to promote the role of the private sector are important to foster
diversification and boost job creation for nationals. Better aligning labor market incentives is
necessary to encourage nationals to take on private sector jobs and private firms to create
opportunities for them. Greater use of privatization and partnerships with the private sector will
help boost productivity, private sector investment and job creation for nationals. Relying on
stronger legal and institutional frameworks that foster competition and reduce hidden costs and
contingent liabilities for the government is important for the success of this strategy. This should
be combined with further steps to improve the business environment, including reforms to
facilitate access to land and finance, reduce the burden of administrative procedures and
excessive regulations, foster competition, and facilitate SMEs’ access to finance

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
December 16, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context. With large financial buffers, low debt, and a well-capitalized financial sector,
the country is well positioned to face “lower-for-longer” oil prices. Nonetheless, fiscal
and external balances have weakened and nonoil growth has softened somewhat. The
main policy priorities are to sustain reforms to gradually raise fiscal savings, reduce
susceptibility to oil price cycles, and boost private sector growth and job creation.
Outlook and risks. Nonoil growth is expected to gain momentum over the medium
term, supported by continued improvement in project implementation under the Kuwait
Development Plan. The fiscal position is projected to improve modestly, but financing
needs after transfers to the Future Generation Fund will remain large. The main risk to
the outlook is a further sustained drop in oil prices. Setbacks on fiscal consolidation
measures would lead to higher financing needs. Slower project implementation under
the development plan could weaken growth.
Macroeconomic policies. Building on recent increases in energy prices and spending
restraint, the authorities should advance reforms to underpin gradual fiscal
consolidation. These could include measures to raise nonoil revenues, further energy
price reforms, and continued spending restraint, while allowing for higher growthenhancing capital outlays. Strengthening the fiscal framework would underpin
consolidation and limit implementation risks. Developing a comprehensive asset-liability
management framework would help guide investment and borrowing decisions.
Financial sector. Banks are in a strong position to weather the challenges of lower oil
prices. The Central Bank of Kuwait’s enhanced surveillance is geared toward early
identification of financial stability risks. Possible steps to further strengthen financial
sector resilience include establishing a formal framework for macro-prudential measures,
developing a liquidity forecasting framework, and strengthening the resolution and crisis
management framework.
Private-sector led growth and economic diversification. Advancing labor market,
business climate, and other reforms to foster private sector development and
diversification will be key to boost job creation for nationals.

price cycles and boost private
sector growth and job creation. The government has announced a comprehensive agenda—the
six-pillar reform strategy (Box 1)—to underpin medium-term fiscal adjustment, encourage private
sector development and diversification, and create jobs for the growing national labor force. Initial
steps have been taken, most recently to advance energy pricing reforms and to ease registration
and licensing procedures (Annex I), and several other measures are under preparation. In the wake
of the recent parliamentary elections—which led to a significant turnover of National Assembly
members—the outgoing Prime Minister was reappointed to form a cabinet. The new government
has reaffirmed the authorities’ commitment to reforms. Steady implementation—a must to deliver
concrete results over the next few years—will require building consensus in favor of economic
transformation.

RECENT MACRO-FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Economic activity in the nonoil sector has continued to expand, albeit at a slower pace,
reflecting the impact of lower oil prices. Nonhydrocarbon growth slowed from 5 percent to an
estimated 3½ percent in 2015, as higher uncertainty weighed on consumption. Notwithstanding an
improvement in project implementation under the five-year Development Plan (DP), available
indicators point to a further modest softening in nonoil growth this year. However, with oil
production recovering after three consecutive years of decline,1 overall growth is on track to reach
about 3½ in 2016 (Figure 1). Inflation, which has been hovering at around 3 percent, is set for an
uptick to about 3½ this year, reflecting the recent gasoline price increases.

The drop in hydrocarbon production was mainly due to the temporary closure of a neutral zone oil field and
technical factors.

Box 1. Kuwait’s Six-Pillar Reform Strategy
In early 2016, the government announced a comprehensive reform strategy to underpin medium-term fiscal
adjustment, encourage private sector development and diversification, and create jobs for the growing
national labor force. The strategy is organized around six-pillars:


Rationalizing government expenditure and increasing nonoil revenue to reduce the budget deficit over
the medium term. The authorities plan to raise nonhydrocarbon revenue (by introducing a VAT and a
business profit tax and raising the price of some government services) and curtail expenditure through
rationalization of government agencies’ spending, further advancing subsidy reforms and reforming
the pay structures.



Modernizing the role of the state. The government is to refocus on ensuring a conducive regulatory
and business environment and encouraging market forces.



Promoting private sector development, through privatization of public enterprises, enhanced use of
partnerships with the private sector, and support for small- and medium-sized enterprises.



Encouraging citizens’ participation in privatized enterprises and PPP projects.



Making the labor market and civil service more efficient. Initiatives in these areas will include
reforms of public sector wages and performance evaluation systems and steps to improve labor
force planning and upgrade skills through educational reforms (including enhanced vocational
training).



Promoting supporting legislative and institutional reforms to enhance public financial
management, strengthen tax administration capacity, develop financial markets, and improve the
business climate.

4.
Notwithstanding efforts to contain government spending, the fiscal and external
accounts have deteriorated markedly. As a result of dwindling oil revenues, the authorities’
principal measure of the fiscal balance—which excludes mandatory transfers to the Future
Generations Fund (FGF) and investment income and better reflects the government’s gross financing
challenge—2 has swung into a large deficit (17½ percent of GDP in 2015/16). Even when including
investment income and before transfers to the FGF, fiscal surpluses have vanished (text table). The
underlying (nonoil) fiscal position has nevertheless improved over the past two years, reflecting a
decline in the subsidy bill (Figure 2), non-recurrence of one-off spending, and efforts to curtail
current expenditure. The composition of government expenditure has also improved somewhat in
favor of growth-enhancing capital spending. The external current account surplus has declined
significantly, reaching 5¼ percent of GDP in 2015, and is set to fall to 4½ percent in 2016.

2

A minimum of 10 percent of total revenue is transferred annually to the FGF. Income on FGF investments (mainly
foreign assets) is retained in the Fund.

1/ The sharp decline in the nonoil balance as a share of nonoil GDP in 2015/16 reflected mainly the non-recurrence of one-off transfers
(large increase in foreign aid and recapitalization of the pension fund) in 2014/15, a reduction in the subsidy bill, and cuts in non-essential
spending. The decline in nonoil revenue in relation to nonoil GDP reflects a lower return on foreign assets than nominal nonoil GDP growth.

While financing needs have thus far been met mainly by drawing down financial
buffers, the government has also increased borrowing. The government deficit has been
financed mainly through drawdowns of General Reserve Fund (GRF) assets. The issuance of domestic
bonds has been stepped up this year, contributing to net financing of about KD 1.4 billion between
April and mid-November—over half the targeted amount for FY 2016/17. The government has also
announced its intention to tap international capital markets to raise up to KD 2.9 billion.
6.
The financial sector has remained sound and credit conditions favorable. As of June
2016, banks featured high capitalization (CAR of 17.9 percent), robust profitability (ROA of
1 percent), low nonperforming loans (ratio of 2.4 percent), and high loan-loss provisioning
(206 percent coverage). Bank liquidity has been comfortable—after a modest decline last year, it has
improved, supported by a recovery in deposits of government entities. Credit to the private sector
has been increasing at a solid pace (about 6¾ percent year-over-year in September 2016, broadly in
line with nominal GDP; Figure 4), driven mainly by installment loans.3

Nevertheless, a few sectors to which banks have sizable exposures have shown some
weakening. The real estate sector has been confronted with a further slowdown in the volume and
the value of sales. Nonfinancial corporate earnings have continued to deteriorate, resulting in an
increase in vulnerabilities in some sectors, particularly real estate (Annex II). Stock prices have
registered broad-based declines since mid-2014 and have remained volatile. Banks’ exposure to
Investment Companies (ICs) has been reduced to 3 percent of total assets on average, but the latter
are exposed to real estate and local and regional equities.

OUTLOOK, RISKS, AND SPILLOVERS
8.
Growth is expected to regain momentum over the medium term, supported by
infrastructure investment. Continued improvement in project implementation under the Kuwait
Development Plan (DP) will support a gradual recovery in real nonoil GDP growth to about
3½ percent in 2017 and 4 percent thereafter. Hydrocarbon output is set to increase by 2 percent

annually,4 consistent with investment in the sector. Overall, real GDP growth would reach about
3 percent over the medium term. Inflation is expected to increase to 4½ percent in 2017, reflecting
energy prices increases in 2016–17, before easing gradually. Higher hydrocarbon exports will lift the
current account surplus above 10 percent of GDP by 2021. The authorities were broadly in
agreement with staff’s assessment of the macroeconomic outlook, but noted inflation could be
lower next year based on the experience of other GCC countries.
9.
Kuwait’s fiscal position is projected to improve modestly, but financing needs after
transfers to the FGF will remain large. Staff’s baseline scenario assumes oil prices will gradually
recover to some $60 by 2021. It takes into account the fiscal impact of the measures recently
enacted but does not factor in the government’s planned fiscal reforms that have yet to be
implemented. Under this scenario, the fiscal balance (government definition) is projected to decline
from about 17½ percent of GDP this year to 13 percent of GDP over the medium term, and
cumulative gross financing needs would amount to about KD 35 billion over the next 6 years. These
are assumed to be covered by a continued drawdown of assets in the GRF, measured amounts of
domestic bond issuance to avoid crowding out private sector investment, and some external
borrowing. The overall fiscal balance (before transfers to the FGF and including investment income)
would post surpluses.

This macro-fiscal environment is
expected to remain broadly supportive of

Growth-enhancing capital expenditures will
support bank profitability and internal capital
generation. Although there are downside
risks to asset quality, loss absorption buffers
are high. Staff agreed with the authorities’
view that while credit growth had been
robust, the significant contribution of lowerrisk installment loans mitigates concerns of a
build-up of financial risks.

11.
The main risk to the outlook is a further sustained drop in oil prices, which would lead
to higher financing needs and could set in motion unfavorable macro-financial dynamics.
Large fiscal deficits (Figure 6) would raise the gross financing requirement over the medium term
(text table). Although the government’s strong credit rating (AA) would enable it to tap international
markets, investors’ appetite for GCC bonds could decline in case of large regional financing needs.
Kuwait would, therefore, be faced with the tradeoff of issuing more domestic debt, at the risk of

Implementation of the recent OPEC agreement may lead to slightly lower hydrocarbon output increases than
projected by staff in the short term—as it entails a cut of about 130 thousand mbd in 2017H1 compared to October
levels. However, should the oil price increase of recent weeks be sustained, it would likely result in higher oil
revenues.

squeezing domestic liquidity and crowding out private sector credit, or allowing readily available
buffers to run lower. Staff and the authorities’ banking stress tests indicate that the financial system
is resilient to severe credit and liquidity shocks.5 Nonetheless, a protracted period of lower oil
prices—should it affect deposit growth, nonoil activity, stock market performance or real estate
prices—could also heighten liquidity and credit risks (Box 3) and, in turn, credit and economic
activity.
12.
Kuwait is also exposed to a number of other domestic and external risks (Annex III).
Setbacks on fiscal consolidation measures would lead to higher financing needs. Slower project
implementation under the development plan could weaken growth. While the country is only
moderately exposed to regional spillovers, heightened security risks could affect investor
confidence. More volatile global financial conditions could raise funding and market risks. In
addition to the impact they could have through oil prices and financial markets conditions,
significant changes to the post-election U.S. economic outlook could affect Kuwait through the
exchange rate and interest rates. For example, a stronger U.S. dollar and a more rapid normalization
of policy rates, may entail tighter monetary conditions given the Kuwaiti dinar peg. Outward
spillovers, mainly through Kuwait’s contribution to global oil supply, investments abroad and
remittances, are expected to be limited.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
With the government having laid out its economic vision under the six-pillar reform strategy,
discussions focused on the appropriate pace and design of fiscal reforms, steps to safeguard financial
stability, and reforms to raise growth and promote job creation for nationals. The authorities were
broadly in agreement with the mission’s policy recommendations. They saw fiscal reforms as an
important element of a broader reform effort to boost private sector growth and economic
diversification.

by some 20 percent of nonoil GDP by
2021,7 calling for a significant additional increase in fiscal saving.
14.
At the same time, there was recognition that available fiscal space could be used to
mitigate drawbacks from fiscal adjustment. Large buffers and low debt allow for a gradual
approach to consolidation that supports growth and financial sector stability. A balanced approach
to the composition of adjustment, making space for higher growth-enhancing investment, would
also support macro-financial prospects.
15.
On balance, staff recommended an adjustment path that would allow for achieving
intergenerational equity over a ten-year period. This would entail reducing the government
deficit (government definition) from a projected 17½ percent of GDP in 2015/16 to about 7 percent
by 2021 (equivalent to a surplus of about 9½ percent of GDP before transfer to the FGF and
including investment income) and broadly eliminating this deficit by 2025. This consolidation effort
could be achieved through a combination of the main expenditure and revenue reforms included in
The baseline assumes a continuation of current policies of controlling current spending but does not include
reforms not yet enacted in light of uncertainties on the design and timing.

The intergenerational equity level of the non-oil primary fiscal deficit is derived from the permanent income
hypothesis (PIH) which estimates a constant real per-capita annuity of the sum of discounted values of future oil
revenue receipts and financial assets. The annuity is estimated at 58 percent of nonoil GDP, compared to a projected
nonoil primary balance of 78 percent of nonoil GDP by 2021.

the government’s six-pillar reform plan.8 Assuming implementation of the authorities’ planned
reforms to bolster nonoil revenue, this would require a gradual reduction in government spending
to about 80 percent of nonoil GDP by 2021—a level consistent with that experienced during
2000-10, when oil prices averaged about $50 per barrel. The authorities noted that the fiscal reforms
identified under the government’s reform strategy could potentially lead to more rapid fiscal
consolidation, but agreed that staff’s proposed path would strike an appropriate balance between
higher savings and mitigating the impact of adjustment on growth. The measures listed below (text
table and Annex V), drawn from the authorities’ reform strategy, would have costs for short-run
growth and inflation, but these would ease over time, as dividends from higher investment bear fruit
and confidence strengthens (chart).

growth. Over time, this would help reduce
the wage gap with the private sector and nationals’ reservation wages, enhance private sector
competitiveness, and facilitate economic diversification. While the authorities generally agreed with
staff’s recommendation to limit employment growth going forward and communicate early on
about its objectives to help reset expectations, they stressed this would need to be done while
promoting private sector job creation for nationals.
19.
Further streamlining other current spending would create space for higher growthenhancing investment. Staff highlighted that containing transfers to enterprises and households
and goods and services would contribute to the adjustment effort, while allowing for higher capital
outlays to mitigate the contractionary impact of fiscal adjustment. The authorities concurred and
noted their ongoing efforts to streamline nonessential current expenditure. Indeed, spending on
goods and services and transfers declined by 2 percent in 2015/16, compared to annual growth of
about 13 percent on average in the preceding 5 years. Since public investment management
reforms are key to improve implementation capacity and efficiency, staff welcomed the efforts
underway to better prioritize projects through strengthened appraisal processes, with emphasis on
encouraging diversification and employment opportunities for nationals. Systematic ex-post
evaluation and effective implementation of the anti-corruption framework will also be important.
20.
A medium-term fiscal framework is needed to guide fiscal consolidation and reduce
implementation risks. Staff welcomed the authorities’ ongoing efforts to strengthen budget
planning, including the move from annual incremental budgets to medium-term budgets starting in
FY2017/18 and the planned introduction of three-year expenditure ceilings. It stressed that these
reforms should take place within the context of a comprehensive medium-term framework, guided
by an overarching long-term fiscal policy objective (for example based on intergenerational equity
considerations) and setting a consistent path for an intermediary target (a nonoil fiscal balance

objective would help delink spending from oil revenue volatility). The authorities agreed and noted
that the Ministry of Finance’s macro-fiscal unit was well positioned to help in this regard. In this
context, there was agreement about the importance of developing a top-down approach,
strengthening budget processes—including by reducing the fragmentation of the investment
budget—and expenditure control mechanisms, and developing reporting and accountability
mechanisms.
21.
Borrowing and investment decisions should be guided by a comprehensive assetliability management strategy that takes into account macro-financial implications. The
authorities’ short-term plans entail a combination of (i) domestic and external borrowing; (ii) a
drawdown of GRF assets; and (iii) transfers to the FGF to be invested in higher-yielding assets. At the
moment, higher returns on FGF assets, low borrowing costs, and the need to develop debt markets
provide support for this approach. Staff recommended that, over time, the appropriate mix between
the various borrowing and investment options be guided by a systematic assessment of their
relative costs and benefits, including that of maintaining liquid buffers as insurance against shocks.
The macro-financial impact of these options should also be assessed carefully (Box 2 and
accompanying Selected Issues Paper), taking into consideration the implications of building up debt
and the impact of borrowing on domestic liquidity, credit, and central bank reserves. In this regard,
coordination with the CBK will remain important. Staff encouraged the authorities to sustain their
balanced approach to fiscal financing over the medium-term. The authorities agreed this would help
mitigate potential negative macro-financial implications and support the development of domestic
debt markets.
22.
Staff and the authorities concurred that the debt issuance program would benefit
from a further strengthening of the institutional and legal frameworks and increased
transparency. The establishment of a high-level Debt Management Committee (DMC), backed by
the creation of new debt-management unit (DMU), provides a strong basis for coordination across
relevant government bodies. Further efforts are ongoing to clarify responsibilities and fully
operationalize the DMU. Staff welcomed the authorities’ intention to address legal hurdles that
constrain the amounts and type of instruments that can be issued, including Sukuk, thereby helping
broaden the investor base. It recommended putting in place a medium-term debt strategy and
maintaining a debt ceiling to spur fiscal discipline. The authorities recognized that improved
disclosure of the government’s assets and liabilities, more comprehensive fiscal accounts, and
improved timeliness of intra-year budgetary execution data would help strengthen investor
confidence and reduce borrowing costs. Promoting a deep and liquid government debt market that
facilitates private debt issuance is important to foster capital market and private sector
development. Introducing regular market-based auctions, communicating transparently, and
developing secondary markets—an agenda the authorities intend to tackle over time—would help
in this regard.

Box 2. Budget Financing Options and Potential Macro-Financial Implications1
With a few exceptions, Kuwait has not had to borrow for decades, and its domestic debt markets have
therefore remained underdeveloped. The country has recorded budget surpluses since the early 1980s,
with the exception of first half of the 1990s.
With the emergence of budget deficits and financing needs since 2015/16, the government has had to
reassess its financing strategy. The current plans entail a combination of (i) domestic and external
borrowing; (ii) a drawdown of GRF assets; and (iii) continued mandatory transfers to the FGF to be
invested in higher-yielding assets. The government has also taken initial steps to develop its debt
management capacity by establishing a high level debt management committee, supported by a
newly-created debt management unit (DMU).
Choosing the financing mix in the context of a comprehensive asset and liability management (ALM)
framework is important. This entails basing decisions not only on the cost of borrowing versus return
on assets, but also the financial characteristics of sovereign’s assets and liabilities to limit potential
mismatches and risks, including interest rate and exchange rate risks. The tradeoffs should also be
viewed from a self-insurance perspective, where higher borrowing costs can be seen as an insurance
premium against possible liquidity shocks. Increased formal coordination between the ministry of
finance, the CBK, KIA, and other relevant agencies, and improvements in the timeliness of published
fiscal accounts and the disclosure of government assets would help ensure effective asset and liability
management.
Financing mix decisions should also be guided by a broader set of institutional, financial and
macroeconomic considerations. These include macroeconomic conditions, absorptive capacity and
degree of domestic financial market development, and institutional capacity, including of managing
debt. The potential macro-financial consequences of the various financing options, for example on
banks’ liquidity, private sector credit, and central bank reserves should be carefully assessed. In this
context, external borrowing would help mitigate pressures on domestic liquidity and support central
bank reserves.2 Establishing risk-free government yield curves through domestic and external
borrowing would also help develop the private debt market.
Effective debt management and development of the debt market require sound institutional and legal
frameworks. To this end, a formal debt management strategy with clear objectives and division of
responsibilities among concerned agencies, operationalizing the DMU, developing cash management
capacity, and moving towards a market-based auction system that allows for price discovery would be
important. Other key steps include broadening the investor base (to include Islamic banks, investment
companies, the pension fund and insurance companies), addressing legal constraints to government
borrowing and sukuk issuance, and developing the secondary markets to facilitate the development of
financial markets for corporates.

Financing through drawing assets in the GRF or external borrowing would result in equivalent transfers of foreign exchange to
the government’s account at the CBK.

23.
Staff shared the authorities’ view that the peg to a basket remains appropriate for the
Kuwaiti economy, as it provides an effective nominal anchor. The authorities are fully
committed to the current exchange rate regime. The modest depreciation against the dollar since
mid-2014 (7 percent) on account of having a basket rather than dollar peg has been helpful during a
period of dollar strength. Staff’s external sector assessment (Annex VI) suggests a moderate current
account gap, the bulk of which would be closed by increasing fiscal savings as recommended over
the medium term. Staff noted that over the longer term, as the economy diversifies, the benefits of
greater exchange rate flexibility may increase.

B. Safeguarding financial stability
24.
The CBK has been proactive in strengthening regulatory oversight and mitigating
financial stability risks. Banks are under Basel III regulations for capital, liquidity, and leverage.
Macro-prudential measures—to prevent excessive debt build up by households and limit banks’
exposure to real estate and equities—are being enforced to minimize systemic risks. A new
corporate governance framework has also recently been introduced. In light of the potential risks
from a sustained further decline in oil prices, and given high loan concentrations, common
exposures and interconnectedness of the financial system (Box 3), the CBK’s enhanced surveillance is
well positioned for early identification of financial stability risks. In particular, staff welcomed the
ongoing initiatives to strengthen stress testing techniques, develop early warning indicators, step up
efforts to monitor deposit trends, and identify emerging pressures in corporate and household
balance sheets.
25.
A number of steps would help further strengthen financial sector resilience. The
authorities agreed that a formal framework for operationalizing macro-prudential measures would
help maintain appropriate coverage of risks over time and the balance between preempting the
buildup of excessive risks and alleviating possible liquidity shocks and pro-cyclicality in credit and
asset markets. Reforms to strengthen the insolvency regime are ongoing in collaboration with the
World Bank. Progress on this front, combined with judicial reforms to introduce commercial courts
and expedite enforcement, would help minimize losses-given-default. While the CBK is wellequipped to deal with possible liquidity shortages,11 there was recognition that developing a
liquidity forecasting framework could also help anticipate potential system-wide pressures. The CBK
offers a Shari’ah compliant Lender of Last Resort (LOLR) facility to Islamic banks. The development of
a sovereign Sukuk market would nonetheless help increase the availability of high-quality liquid
assets for banks. There was also agreement that sustaining efforts to streamline noncore bank
activities where corporate structures are complex would facilitate risk identification and effective
supervision.

11

Banks are required to comply with five liquidity indicators: the liquidity coverage ratio, a loan-to-deposit ratio
(LTD), limits on maturity mismatches, a regulatory liquidity ratio and a net stable funding ratio.

Box 3. Low Oil Prices, Macro-Financial Linkages and Banking System Resilience1
Kuwait’s financial sector performance has traditionally been interwoven with the oil price cycle. Given the
country’s high dependence on hydrocarbons and a business model for banks that revolves around the
domestic economy—as they obtain over 90 percent of their funding, and hold 80 percent of assets,
domestically—deposit and asset growth, as well as asset quality, have been highly correlated with oil prices.
The key channel of transmission has been government expenditure, which has been a main driver of nonoil
activity, and has in the past moved in tandem with oil price fluctuations. Price fluctuations can also impact
banks through asset prices—particularly equities and real estate—and regional spillovers.

In recent years, prudent macroeconomic and financial sector policies have reduced the vulnerability of the
banking system to oil price shocks. Large accumulated financial buffers have provided the policy space
to avoid abrupt spending cuts and increase growth-enhancing capital expenditures. An increase in
public sector entities deposits has supported liquidity in the banking system, and the authorities have
been careful in ensuring that domestic financing of the government deficit does not crowd out the
private sector. As a result, the lower oil prices have had a limited impact on nonoil GDP growth and
bank asset quality, and banks have remained profitable and liquid. Strong supervision has also
contributed to banks maintaining large capital buffers and provisions.
Kuwait is, nevertheless, not immune to a protracted period of low oil prices. Reform set-backs, a slow DP
implementation or a further sustained drop in oil prices, if they result in lower growth, can set in
motion adverse macro-financial dynamics. Previous staff analysis found that nonoil GDP, real estate
prices and equity prices drive nonperforming loans.2 Staff’s sensitivity analyses show that the banking
system is on aggregate resilient, but under severe stress scenarios, a few banks may require additional
capital. Loan concentrations to single borrowers present the biggest risk for banks while sectoral
concentrations, particularly to real estate are a risk for selected banks. The banking system also exhibits
significant deposit concentrations, although liquidity risk is mitigated by the large public ownership of
the deposits and the demonstrated willingness to support banking system liquidity.

Continued enhanced surveillance and ongoing efforts to close regulatory gaps are therefore key to
safeguarding financial stability. Enhanced surveillance is critical for the timely identification of risks and
timely policy response. Ongoing efforts to close regulatory gaps related to the insolvency regime and
crisis management will help minimize losses in the event that defaults materialize.

26.
Strengthening the crisis management framework would promote orderly resolution of
banks in the event of stress and safeguard fiscal resources. A special resolution regime for banks
has not yet been put in place. A blanket guarantee covers all banking system deposits. Staff
recommended that consideration be given to establishing frameworks that allow for least-cost and
effective resolution in the event of stress in the banking system. Formalizing arrangements between
key regulatory institutions would also help improve crisis preparedness. The authorities have started
preparatory work on a bank resolution framework, and IMF technical assistance in these areas is
planned in the next few months.
27.
Kuwaiti banks have not faced withdrawal of correspondent banking relationships.
However, to avoid the perception of risk that could prompt global banks to cut relations with them,
several domestic banks have preemptively severed links with some domestic charities and foreign
exchange houses. The CBK has been actively participating in international forums aimed at clarifying
home supervisor requirements and maintaining open channels of communication between domestic
and foreign banks and regulators.
28.
Efforts to implement and further strengthen the AML/CFT and anticorruption
frameworks are ongoing. Consistent with the revised FATF standard, regulators are placing greater
emphasis on risk-based AML/CFT inspections. The results of the ongoing ML/TF national risk
assessment (NRA), conducted with assistance from the World Bank, will inform the development of a
strategic plan for Kuwait. Following revocation of the 2012 decree setting up the Anti-Corruption
Agency (ACA) for procedural reasons, a new law was adopted in January 2016, keeping the mandate,
powers and organizational structure of the ACA broadly unchanged. Given recent adoption of
related bylaws, the new framework is now fully applicable.

C. Private sector-led growth and economic diversification
29.
In a more constrained budgetary environment, creating jobs for the growing young
national population requires headway toward boosting private sector development and
diversification. Under current trends, less

30.
Addressing labor market inefficiencies is critical to bolster private sector employment
of nationals. Labor market and civil service reforms should aim at improving incentives for nationals
to take up jobs in the private sector, including by managing expectations about the limited future
availability of public sector jobs. Sustaining the recent efforts to streamline public sector wages and
benefits would also contribute to making the private sector more attractive and encourage the
hiring of nationals by private-sector firms. The authorities agreed that boosting the private sector
demand for nationals’ labor would also require further progress toward fostering an education
system that reduces skill mismatches.
31.
Staff welcomed the focus of the government’s six-pillar reform plan on privatization
and public and private partnerships. Building on stronger legal and institutional frameworks, the
government aims at greater use of these options to enhance the role of the private sector in the
economy and upgrade infrastructure. While the privatization program is still in its early stages,
several Build-Operate-Transfer projects are in the pipeline. Continued progress toward establishing
clear timetables, advancing preparatory work to strengthen underlying assets, and promoting a
transparent environment that fosters competition and reduces hidden costs and contingent
liabilities for the government will help stimulate private sector investment and boost productivity.
32.
Further improving the business environment is important to foster diversification.
Recent efforts include the opening of the Kuwait Business Center, a one-stop window that will help
streamline registration and licensing procedures, and steps toward digitalizing administrative
procedures. Given the central role SMEs can play in economic diversification and job creation, a
similar initiative is planned for SMEs. Staff emphasized the need to sustain reforms to facilitate
access to land and finance, reduce the burden of administrative procedures and excessive
regulations, and foster competition.12 It welcomed the authorities’ intention to improve the
functioning of the National Fund for SMEs development to free up resources for small businesses
and suggested consideration be given to reviewing the hurdles to SMEs’ access to finance, including
the potential impact of the cap on banks’ lending interest rate spreads.

D. Statistical issues
33.
The authorities are making efforts to further improve Kuwait’s statistical system. Staff
welcomed the authorities’ willingness to work with IMF staff to continue to improve annual national
accounts, and encouraged them to advance ongoing initiatives to produce quarterly national
accounts and to establish a more recent base for the consumer price index.

STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
Kuwait is well positioned to mitigate the impact of lower oil prices on the economy.
The fiscal and external positions have deteriorated significantly and nonhydrocarbon growth has
moderated—from 5 percent in 2014 to about 3¼ percent this year—as a result of the drop in oil
prices. However, large financial buffers and low debt provide policy space to implement the
12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

KUWAIT

necessary fiscal consolidation gradually while increasing public investment to support growth.
Against this backdrop, the fiscal and external positions are projected to improve as adjustment
proceeds and oil prices recover somewhat, and nonoil growth is projected to regain momentum
to about 4 percent over the medium term supported by a continued improvement in project
implementation under the five-year Development Plan. The main risk to the outlook stems from a
further sustained decline in oil prices. Slow project implementation, more volatile global financial
conditions and spillovers from heightened regional security risks could also affect economic
prospects.
35.
Nonetheless, “lower-for-longer” oil prices call for steadfast implementation of
reforms. The government’s six-pillar reform strategy is rightly focused on reforming public finances
and promoting a greater role for the private sector in generating growth and jobs for nationals.
Efforts to streamline current spending, including the recent gasoline and utility price reforms, and
measures to facilitate business licensing are steps in the right direction. Maintaining consensus in
favor of economic transformation and sustaining the reform momentum is paramount for the
success of the strategy.
36.
Fiscal reforms should focus on addressing underlying fiscal vulnerabilities and be
designed so as to minimize any dampening impact on growth. Gradual removal of fuel and
electricity subsidies and control of the wage bill through a well-designed reform that avoids
significant upfront costs would help reduce budget rigidities, while the introduction of the VAT and
business profit tax and the repricing of government services would go a long way in diversifying
revenue away from oil. These fiscal reforms should be designed and sequenced with a view to
striking a balance between generating fiscal savings in line with intergenerational equity levels and
mitigating the drawbacks of fiscal consolidation on economic activity. A comprehensive mediumterm fiscal framework based on a top-down approach and articulated around clearly-specified
medium-term fiscal objectives would help guide the consolidation plans and reduce implementation
risks.
37.
Fiscal financing options should be assessed within a comprehensive asset/liability
management framework with due consideration to macro-financial linkages. Consistent with
the government’s current approach, a balanced financing mix that combines continued drawdown
of assets in the GRF, measured amounts of domestic bond issuance and some external borrowing
would mitigate potential crowding out of private sector credit while maintaining a high level of
liquid buffers. Continued progress toward strengthening the institutional and legal frameworks,
including to support a more comprehensive and longer-term view on asset and liability
management, improving debt issuance processes, and fostering increased transparency would
ensure effective debt management and support the development of domestic fixed income markets.
38.
Steps can be taken to further strengthen financial sector resilience. In light of the
potential risks from a sustained further decline in oil prices and given the financial sector risks
inherent to a largely undiversified economy, the CBK initiatives to enhance financial sector
surveillance are welcome. A formal framework for operationalizing macro-prudential measures,
reforms to facilitate debt recovery, developing a liquidity forecasting framework, and strengthening
20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KUWAIT

the crisis management framework, including by introducing a special resolution regime for banks
and a deposit insurance mechanism, would help further enhance financial sector resilience and
ensure orderly resolution of banks in the event of stress.
39.
The peg to an undisclosed basket of currencies is appropriate and can be further
underpinned by fiscal adjustment. The peg has provided an effective nominal anchor. A moderate
current account gap can be largely closed by increasing fiscal savings as recommended over the
medium term.
40.
Labor market reforms and efforts to promote the role of the private sector are
important to foster diversification and boost job creation for nationals. Better aligning labor
market incentives is necessary to encourage nationals to take on private sector jobs and private
firms to create opportunities for them. Greater use of privatization and partnerships with the private
sector will help boost productivity, private sector investment and job creation for nationals. Relying
on stronger legal and institutional frameworks that foster competition and reduce hidden costs and
contingent liabilities for the government is important for the success of this strategy. This should be
combined with further steps to improve the business environment, including reforms to facilitate
access to land and finance, reduce the burden of administrative procedures and excessive
regulations, foster competition, and facilitate SMEs’ access to finance

contained growth in goods and services and the wage bill, while allowing for
increased capital expenditure. A public wage reform is under study. The 2016/17
budget envisages further restraint in current spending and improvement in
capital expenditure.
Following the partial elimination of diesel and kerosene subsidies effective
January 2015, the government has increased gasoline prices for different grades
by about 70 percent on average. The new prices have been in effect since
September 1, 2016 and will be revised every three months in line with
international prices. The parliament also adopted earlier this year a law that
substantially increased electricity and water tariffs effective May 1, 2017 for all
sectors except residential (effectively protecting Kuwaiti citizens)—depending on
the sector and consumption levels, for electricity, tariff will be increased from a
flat rate of 2 fils up to a range of 5-25 fils per kwh, and for water, from a flat rate
of KD 0.8 up to a range of KD2-4 per 1000 Imperial Gallons.
Legislations under preparation.
The government is preparing for the introduction of expenditure ceilings. The
macro-fiscal unit is being integrated to the budget preparation process. The
government adopted the GFSM 2001 standard starting 2015/16. The
government has embarked on public expenditure management reforms,
strengthened the macro fiscal unit, and established a debt management unit. Tax
administration reforms are ongoing.
The authorities have thus far been relying on a Memorandum of Understanding
between CBK and the Capital Markets Authority.

Annex II. Performance and Vulnerabilities of Kuwait’s
Nonfinancial Corporate Sector1
Non-financial corporate sector activity slowed in 2015, consistent with the moderation in
nonhydrocarbon GDP growth, and corporate earnings have continued to soften. While corporates’ debt
servicing profile has remained strong overall, there are some differences depending on the indicator
selected and across sectors. Vulnerabilities have increased in particular in the real estate sector. Stress
tests indicate vulnerabilities to changes in funding costs and earnings, with the real estate sector
accounting for a significant share of vulnerable debt under the shocks.
To provide insight into corporate sector performance, detailed balance sheet data for
80 Kuwaiti non-financial companies has been assessed.2 The total aggregate revenue of these
companies amounts to $21 billion, or about 34 percent of nonhydrocarbon GDP in 2015 (while their
total aggregate assets represent 85 percent of nonhydrocarbon GDP). The revenue breakdown for
the main sectors of the economy, following Kuwait Stock Exchange categories, is shown in table
below.

Non-financial corporate sector debt is
mostly concentrated in real estate and
telecommunications. As of 2015, 35 and
28 percent of the debt owed by the
sampled 80 firms are held on real estate
and telecommunications firms’ balance
sheet, respectively.
For companies in the sample, the
evolution of the debt servicing profile
has varied depending on the indicator
selected and across sub-groups.

The median interest coverage ratio
(ICR) for the sample as a whole
increased to 4.2 in 2015 (i.e. corporates
have generated enough profits to
cover over four times the interest due),
pointing to an improvement. However,
the median ICR for large firms
decreased to about 2.5 in 2015,
pointing to a deterioration for
that group.4

Debt vulnerabilities also vary significantly by sector, with debt owed by real estate sector
seemingly the most vulnerable. The latter accounts for the most debt-at-risk in the sample in
2015. Moreover, the median ICR for real estate firms is relatively low and has decreased in
2015-although it remains higher than during 2008–11. On the other hand, while telecommunications
account for 28 percent of total debt in the sample, this sector has no debt-at-risk.

Results from the sensitivity analysis indicate that the Kuwaiti non-financial corporate sector is
relatively vulnerable to interest rate and earnings shocks, although with heterogeneity across
sectors. Stress tests are used to assess the resilience of the non-financial corporate sector to a
combination of interest rate and earnings shocks.


The first scenario assumes an increase in the cost of funding by 200 basis points, combined with
a 2-percent worsening in aggregate firms’ earnings.



The second scenario assumes a combination of a decline in earnings by 12 percent (half of the
more severe shock used in the third scenario), and an increase in the average interest rate by
350 basis points.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

41

KUWAIT



The third scenario is more severe, assuming further declines in corporate profitability
(by 25 percent—equivalent to the largest drop in aggregate corporate earnings experienced
in Kuwait over the past 10 years, which was observed in 2010), combined with tighter financial
conditions (500 basis points increase in funding cost).

Indicative of the vulnerabilities to these shocks, debt-at-risk increases significantly to between
45 and 55 percent of debt, while the share of firms with debt-at-risk increases to between 40 and
50 depending on the scenario below. In terms of sectoral results, the significant worsening seen
under the third scenario is driven by higher debt-at-risk in the real estate and industrial sectors.

Recommended Policy Response

The fiscal and external balances
would deteriorate and
government financing needs
would increase. To the extent
these would be funded
domestically, this could crowd
out credit to the private sector.
Private sector confidence would
likely decline and nonoil growth
would soften.

The large financial buffers provide
policy space for gradual fiscal
adjustment.

With economic, credit, and asset
price cycles moving closely with
oil price developments, lower oil
prices affect liquidity in the
banking system and credit
growth. Volatile equity markets
and a further softening in the
real estate markets would also
impact banks’ asset quality.

Financing options should take into
account the need to maintain
adequate liquidity in the banking
system. Central bank liquidity
management capabilities should be
enhanced and supervisory vigilance
is needed to identify emerging
financial stability risks in order to
facilitate a timely response.

Second round effects on growth,
and asset quality and liquidity in
the banking sector, would
depend on the policy response
and in particular the magnitude
of the fiscal adjustment in
response to the shock.

The framework for activation of
macro-prudential policies should be
strengthened.

However, with a further sustained
decline in oil prices, the government
would need to implement a more
ambitious medium-term fiscal
consolidation program.

Medium
This could pose funding, market
and credit risks challenges for
investment companies (ICs) and
banks. Banks’ exposure to the
equity and real estate market
remains considerable. Selected
banks, for which foreign liabilities
are an important source of
funding, could also face funding
tightness.
ICs also have large exposures to
global and regional financial and
real estate markets, and continue
to be dependent on foreign
financing.
The value of Sovereign Wealth
Funds and the CBK’s reserves
could also be eroded.

Monitor the health of ICs and
complete the restructuring of loss
making ICs.
Enhanced surveillance of banking
stability risks including contagion
from ICs.

Though banks have substantial
loss absorption capacity in terms
of capital and loan loss
provisioning, the losses could be
significant in light of high
exposures to the real estate
sector, both directly and
indirectly through collateral and
common exposures.

Recommended Policy Response

Analysis of transmission channels
and impact study to facilitate timely
policy response
Enhanced surveillance of financial
system.

Integrate the DP into a mediumterm fiscal framework to ensure
continued implementation.
Monitor the implementation of
capital expenditure. Improve
performance of the budget through
a public expenditure review to
support prioritization of public
spending and strengthen
anticorruption
efforts.
Correct slippages. Implement
medium-term fiscal framework to
underpin fiscal adjustment and
reduce risks over the medium term.

Macro prudential tools to limit
exposures to real estate should be
supported by improved real estate
statistics to facilitate monitoring of
developments in the sector and
enhanced techniques to capture
banks’ direct and indirect exposures
to the real estate sector to facilitate
risk monitoring and timely
supervisory response.
Strengthen crisis preparedness and
management framework.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in
the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to
indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and
50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the
authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly. “Short term” and “medium term” are meant to indicate
that the risk could materialize within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

Annex V. Kuwait—Baseline and Adjustment Scenario
I. Assumptions
Baseline scenario

The baseline scenario assumes expenditure restraint and is based on the 2016 budget and enacted policies or reforms.


Oil revenues are projected using the WEO oil price assumptions and forecast oil export volumes. Kuwait’s oil
production is assumed to increase by 2 percent annually over the medium-term.



Non-oil revenues, except investment income from the KIA, are assumed to increase broadly in line with nonoil GDP.



Savings from the recent increase in fuel prices (about 0.3 percent of GDP by 2021) and the electricity and water
tariff adjustment (1.1 percent of GDP) that have been approved and will come into effect early next fiscal year have
been included in the baseline. Estimates were provided by the authorities.



The baseline assumes some spending restraint: wages are assumed to grow with inflation, while public employment
expands at a rate of 2 percent annually; transfers are assumed to grow with inflation; goods and services expand in
line with nonoil GDP.



Consistent with recent developments, capital expenditure is assumed to grow at a slightly higher rate than nonoil
GDP.

Adjustment scenario

Staff’s adjustment scenario assumes a gradual reduction of expenditure as a share of non-oil GDP to 80 percent by 2021.
The target is derived from a historical normal level and would result in a gradual reduction of the gap from
intergenerational equity level of the non-oil primary balance. The expenditure target is consistent with the government
objectives in Kuwait’s vision of “reduction of the budget deficit and movement toward sustainable public finance, and
redefining of the government’s role in the national economy:”


Further to the baseline, fuel prices are assumed to gradually increase starting from fiscal year 2017/18 to reach
international or cost recovery levels by 2021 (elimination of fuel subsidy).



Water and electricity tariffs are assumed increase gradually to reduce subsidy by half in 2021.



Compensation for fuel prices changes is assumed to be paid to households. Recent discussions between
parliamentarians and the government indicate that Kuwaiti nationals may be compensated by a capped amount of
75 liters per month.



The wage bill is driven by stable public employment and wages increasing by slightly less than inflation. The wage
reform under consideration is assumed to take effect starting 2017. Staff has assumed that it will lead in the first
year to an increase in the wage bill by KD 350 million due to standardization of the salary structure, and annual
wage increases in line with inflation. Staff has assumed wage increases below inflation under the adjustment
scenario, in which inflation will be higher because of subsidy and VAT reforms—consistent with staff advice to allow
flexibility to increase wage by less than inflation if macroeconomic conditions warrant.



Goods and services, transfers, and other current spending items are projected to increase by a slower rate than in
the baseline (non-oil GDP growth) by 1-2 percent to help achieve the expenditure target and reflect the authorities’
objectives in the Vision to rationalize spending.



The adjustment scenario makes room for additional allocations for capital spending (2-2.5 percent above nominal
non-oil GDP growth).



Non-oil revenue will increase as a result of increasing excise tax on tobacco and sugary drinks starting in second
half of 2017 with full effect in 2018 by KD 200 million, introducing the corporate profit tax on domestic corporates
starting 2020 (estimated additional of 1.6 percent of GDP based on IMF TA estimates), and the VAT at 5 percent
(estimated to generate 1.5 percent of additional revenue) starting 2019.

Annex VI. External Sector Assessment for Kuwait
Staff considers the peg to a basket of currencies appropriate for Kuwait. While the external position in
2015 was weaker than suggested by fundamentals and desirable medium-term policies, the
recommended substantial fiscal adjustment over the medium-term would bring the current account
broadly in line with the level implied by fundamentals.

Kuwait’s current account surplus has declined significantly in 2015, reflecting mainly the oil
price shock. Kuwait’s large current account surplus (over 33 percent of GDP in 2014) declined to

Change in Reserves

Financial outflows also eased substantially
last year. The reduction in oil export receipts and related government revenue has slowed the pace
of foreign assets accumulation on the part of the government. At the same time, non-government
sector foreign assets continued to accumulate. Overall, portfolio outflows declined from
US$62 billion to US$33 billion. On the other hand, other investments turned positive US$28 billion,
as the government drew down foreign deposits to finance the budget deficit. Overall, financial
outflows were somewhat larger than the current account surplus, leading to a decline in CBK foreign
exchange reserves (by US$4 billion to US$28.3 billion).

level is on track to increase to about $31.5 billion in 2016 and reach 106 percent of the ARA metric.
In addition, the Kuwait Investment Authority also holds a large stock of financial buffers
(which staff estimates at about 460 percent of GDP, with about 317 percent in FGF and 144 percent
in GRF) on behalf of the government. The bulk of these financial resources, which are mainly
invested in foreign assets, are held as savings for future generations, but some can also be used for
precautionary motives.
Staff considers the peg to an undisclosed basket of currencies appropriate. This arrangement,
which has been in place since May 2007, has provided an effective nominal anchor. The modest
depreciation against the dollar since mid-2014 (7 percent) on account of having a basket rather than
dollar peg has been helpful during a period of dollar strength. The NEER has remained largely
unchanged since oil prices started falling in mid-2014. The REER has appreciated, but to a lesser
extent than in other GCC countries.

The Fund’s composite metric that measures the adequacy of precautionary reserves (developed for emerging markets)
calculates the relative risk weights for each source of foreign exchange drain based on the 10th percentile of observed
outflows from Emerging Markets (EMs) during exchange market pressure episodes. Reserves in the range of
100-150 percent of the composite metric are considered broadly adequate for precautionary purposes.

The external sustainability approach suggests that the current account surpluses are too low
to equitably support the consumption
Kuwait: Projected and Actual Current Account vs Norms
of future generations.2 The external
(Percent of GDP)
sustainability based on the permanent
income model (PIH) is the preferred
method for Kuwait as the current account
gap reflects suboptimal saving of
hydrocarbon revenues rather than
reflecting traditional competitiveness
issues. The implied current account norm
based on a constant real per-capita
annuity is 13 percent of GDP in 2016,
compared to the baseline current account
surplus of 4 percent of GDP, resulting in an
estimated current account gap of about
9 percent of GDP that is projected to
remain broadly stable over the forecast horizon. Since external imbalances in Kuwait are largely
driven by the public sector, the current account gap could be closed through fiscal consolidation.
Indeed, closing the large PIH fiscal gap (estimated to reach about 12 percent of GDP by 2021) would
largely eliminate the current account gap.

The approach calculates the current account required for the net present value (NPV) of hydrocarbon and
investment income to equal the NPV of imports net of non-hydrocarbon exports. To support intergenerational
equity, the economy would need to choose a path for imports —and hence a current account norm—by
accumulating net foreign assets at an appropriate pace. As with any analytical tool, results are sensitive to the choice
of assumptions made (for instance, oil prices, return of assets, and population growth) as well as the targeted transfer
to future generation (annuity).

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of November 21, 2016)
The World Bank and the Government of Kuwait developed a rolling four-year Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS), which leverages the setup of a World Bank Country Office in Kuwait (inaugurated in
January 2009). The Kuwait program emphasizes implementation of reforms. Hence all activities are
grounded in the Government’s five-year plan, and are developed closely with the line
ministry/agency as well as with the Ministry of Finance, which plays the coordinator role and the
Bank’s central counterpart. The current Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS) program is structured
around the following four strategic themes under the latest 2016-20 Country Partnership Strategy:
(i)
Public sector performance and citizen accountability– Bank support in this area aims at
ensuring that public services are delivered transparently, efficiently and effectively and that citizen
accountability is enhanced. Key activities under this pillar include Bank support in a mix of areas
including technical assistance on a multi-year tax modernization project; strengthening public
expenditure and financial accountability (PEFA) and developing a guidebook for public private
partnerships. Other pipeline engagements focus on providing capacity-building assistance to the
Kuwait National Assembly and the State Audit Bureau, as well as Public Financial Management
(PFM). The latter is designed as a programmatic multi-year engagement to improve the quality of
fiscal policies and the system of procedures governing public financial management in the country.
(ii)
Private sector development - Aiming to support reform efforts geared towards
transforming Kuwait into a commercial and financial hub with diversified economic activities and the
creation of a more conducive business environment for private sector development and foreign
direct investment. Bank activities under this theme include: supporting the design and
implementation of an insolvency and creditors rights framework, support in establishing the new
Competition Protection Authority and the National Fund for SME Development. The last is a flagship
engagement.
(iii)
Human development - major program to support the quality of education. Bank support in
this area also includes social protection, labor and potentially health policy reforms.
(iv)
Infrastructure Development and Urban Management - aiming to make significant
improvements in its infrastructure and urban management sectors including land management and
the environment. Current engagements include a multi-year land management modernization
project with the Ministry of Finance and the State Property Sector and a solid waste management
project with the Kuwait Municipality. Pipeline activities include support to the new Transport
Authority, Tourism Development, and e-government services at the Kuwait Municipality.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of November 21, 2016)
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Despite further
improvements in the current year, there is scope for improved compilation of the national accounts and
balance of payments statistics through better coordination among statistical agencies. Timeliness,
particularly for the national and fiscal accounts, is an area of concern.
National Accounts and Production:
Kuwait’s national accounts are compiled by the Central Statistical Bureau (CSB) and require development
to maintain consistency with international best practice. Annual GDP estimates are derived from a
benchmark year of 2010 and considered broadly adequate for surveillance. The authorities are encouraged
to select and implement a contemporary benchmark to rebase the GDP time series to ensure structural
changes in Kuwait’s economy are reflected in published estimates. The sources and methods used to
estimate individual components of GDP should be publicly disclosed to identify areas where further
improvement is required. Known examples are the inadequate methodology used to construct volume
movements for subsidies on products; and outdated methodology used to aggregate financial services
indirectly measured (FISIM) into GDP, areas for which ongoing discussions are taking place between the
CSB and IMF staff. These are likely to impact the oil and non-oil industry shares of value added until
revised estimates are published towards the end of 2017. A quarterly GDP time series for 2010–17 will be
disseminated during 2018. A technical assistance mission conducted in March 2015 provided other
recommendations to: enhance source data by improving coordination between government agencies;
compile comprehensive estimates of informal activity; and implement methods to consistent with
international standards.
Price statistics
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is published on a monthly basis (last observation for October 2016). The
weights are based on the 2007 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) and are therefore
unlikely to be representative of current expenditure patterns. Changes to the CPI weights are underway
and are expected to be completed by February 2017. The new weights will be updated using the results of
the 2013 HIES. The Producer Price Index (PPI) covers selected Mining and Quarrying and Manufacturing
industries as well as Utilities. The PPI should be further developed by updating the weights from the 2010
base year, by extending coverage to include services and construction and by compiling separate indexes
for the domestic and export markets. Improvements in these dimensions are under consideration in
coordination with other GCC countries.

KUWAIT

Government finance statistics: Annual GFS data are reported for publication in the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook (GFSY). The major components of extrabudgetary revenues (investment income and
transfers of profits of public institutions), extrabudgetary expenditures (interest on foreign debt and
treasury paper), and financing operations conducted by two reserve funds are not reported. Data on
interest on foreign debt and treasury paper are usually provided to Article IV consultation missions, but
the regular provision of data on investment income is lacking.
The authorities have made some progress in fiscal data presentation, but the lack of a suitable
classification of data on the execution of the budget remains a constraint on monitoring effectively fiscal
developments during the year. Progress is being made toward improving compliance with the GFSM 2001
guidance, particularly in terms of creating a new chart of accounts and moving reporting to an accrual
basis.
Data on the operations of the Public Institute for Social Security are not made available. Sharing of
information between various government agencies could be improved. STA has indicated to the authorities
that operations of the two reserve funds should be classified as part of government, as they perform
activities for public policy purposes (management of debt and assets, and financing of the budget). An
additional extension of coverage would be to report GFS in the form of the Statement of Sources and Uses
of Cash for the consolidated central government. The authorities have also been briefed on the IMF’s
ongoing work to enhance the transparency of fiscal accounts and presentations detailed in the “Code of
Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency” and were encouraged to adopt some of the practices
recommended in the Code.
Monetary and financial statistics: The CBK reports monetary data to STA on a regular basis based on the
Standardized Report Forms (SRFs). However, the data submission could be improved as it is not always
reported on a timely basis. CBK needs to work further to distinguish a number of investment companies
that accept deposits from other investment companies that do not accept deposits. Investment companies
that accept deposits should appropriately be classified as part of the depository corporations sector. In the
current SRFs, all investment companies (including those that accept deposits) are classified as other
financial corporations. However, the amount of deposits accepted by investment companies is considered
as not significant. The Capital Markets Authority needs to collate and disseminate information related to
investment companies.
Financial Surveillance: Kuwait is not reporting financial soundness indicators (FSIs) to STA for public
dissemination. The authorities are encouraged to report FSIs for the deposit-taking sectors and other
financial corporations.
Balance of Payments Statistics: From 2009 data, the CBK compiles and disseminates detailed annual
balance of payments and international investment position data, and from 2015 – quarterly balance of
payments data in accordance with the methodology of the BPM6, while trade data estimates are
disseminated quarterly by the Central Statistical Bureau (CSB). However, data on capital flows of the
nonfinancial private sector are limited. To improve coverage for inward foreign direct investment, the CBK
is making efforts to obtain more data by surveying direct investment enterprises. The CSB, working with
the CBK, implemented the IMF’s Coordinated Direct Investment Survey in 2010-12. This initiative should
improve foreign direct investment statistics. Enhancements have been made in the estimation of travel
services and communication services, but further improvements are needed in compilation practices and in
the estimation of data on several service items and private transfers.
The information on IIP data made available to staff is incomplete as it excludes the external assets held by
the general government (with the exception of loans granted by the Kuwaiti Fund for Arab Economic
Development and general government trade credits). This data is expected to be reported to the Fund by
the Executive Director for Kuwait at the time of the upcoming Article IV board meeting.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KUWAIT

The CBK also participates in the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) with data reported for
2003 onwards, and in the recently introduced Coordinated Direct Investment Survey. These data are for the
financial sector acting as end-investors’ or as intermediaries on behalf of residents and do not include
holdings of foreign securities held by government agencies, which comprise the bulk of Kuwait’s
cross-border holdings.
In 2009, STA provided TA on improving external accounts data. The CBK has made good progress since
then, particularly in the substantial revisions to report forms, including the separate reporting of financial
transactions in the BOP and other changes in volume in the international investment position. It has also
made progress in the estimation of remittances data. Yet, delays and data gaps remain. In particular,
coordination among major government entities is needed to provide quarterly data to the CBK in time to
compile timely quarterly statistics. Merchandise trade data are compiled monthly and published quarterly
and annually by the CBK, monthly and annually by the CSB. The response rate for the private nonfinancial
sector is low.
II.

Data Standards and Quality

Kuwait is one of the first GDDS participants. Its
metadata were last updated in 2010 and 2011. The
CBK maintains its own webpage where it provides
the following data to the public: money and
banking statistics; balance of payments statistics;
trade balance statistics; exchange rate; GDP by
sector and expenditure at current and constant
prices; public finance statistics; CPI and WPI; and
security market indicators. Similarly, the Ministry of
Planning has a webpage where the CSO publishes
data on national accounts, prices, and other related
statistics. The Ministry of Finance webpage
includes detailed data for actual and estimated
budget operations. In addition, the Kuwait Stock
Exchange webpage provides data on stock market
indices, volume and value of securities traded, as
well as privatization schedules and other related
information.

No data ROSC is available.
