EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The 2008 Article IV consultation discussions with Libya were held against the backdrop of high oil
revenue and large expenditure plans. The discussions focused on containing public expenditure in
order to reduce inflationary pressures, strengthening the monetary policy framework, and advancing
financial sector reforms.
Economic developments and outlook
Libya’s macroeconomic performance has been strong. GDP growth is broad-based and has
strengthened further. Inflation, however, increased substantially in 2007 and has accelerated further
in 2008. Both the fiscal and external current account positions are in large surpluses, and net foreign
assets are accumulating rapidly. The medium-term outlook is favorable, underpinned by the
expectation of high oil prices and increased infrastructure spending. A Wealth Distribution Program
(WDP) was launched in March 2008 to distribute part of the oil revenue to the population and
downsize public administration. The Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) was established in
March 2007 and its operational framework has been enhanced broadly in line with staff
recommendations.
Authorities’ views
Large public outlays are necessary to upgrade the infrastructure and share the oil wealth with the
population.
•

The acceleration in inflation has been driven mostly by higher import prices. To help reduce its
domestic component, capital expenditure is being rationalized.
•

Implementation of financial sector and other structural reforms will continue to be advanced to
promote private sector development and employment.
•

Staff recommendations
Public expenditure should be further rationalized if inflation does not decline. Prioritization
would also preserve the quality of expenditure, and appropriate sequencing would minimize
bottlenecks and shortages.
•

The scope of the WDP needs to be reduced in order to limit expenditure growth and maintain
intergenerational equity. The restructuring of public administration should be carefully considered in
close consultation with the World Bank.
•

The dinar’s peg to the SDR has served Libya well. An eventual move to greater exchange rate
flexibility would be beneficial, but would need to be gradual and preceded by a switch to marketbased monetary management.
•

The commendable efforts to reform the financial sector and enhance the monetary policy
framework should continue.
•

Staff encourages the authorities to limit any domestic investments by the LIA and to continue to
enhance its operational framework in line with the evolving best practices for sovereign wealth funds.
•

I. BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
A. Introduction
1.
The discussions were held against the backdrop of high oil revenue, robust
growth, rapid increase in public expenditure, and rising inflation. The normalization of
diplomatic relations with the U.S. and the EU in the second half of 2007 has contributed to
increased foreign investors’ interest, particularly in the hydrocarbon, banking, and
infrastructure sectors. A Wealth Distribution Program (WDP) was launched in March 2008
to distribute part of the oil wealth to the population and reduce the size of the government. 1
Disbursements will be in the form of both cash and shares in projects. The initially
announced amount was LD 25–30 billion ($20-25 billion), but only LD 4.6 billion
($3.8 billion) were subsequently approved for this year. The authorities are still considering
the size, form, and modalities of the annual distributions in the years ahead.
2.
Past Fund policy advice has centered on the need to restore fiscal prudence,
strengthen oil revenue management, develop a well-designed strategy to restructure public
commercial banks, and advance structural reforms. The authorities have made good progress
in some of these areas, particularly bank restructuring and privatization, the establishment of
a modern sovereign wealth fund, and the initiation of an ambitious civil service reform.
B. Recent Economic Developments
3.
Macroeconomic performance strengthened further in 2007, notwithstanding an
acceleration in inflation. Real GDP grew by 6.8 percent, supported by an expansion in the
hydrocarbon sector (3.9 percent) and a rapid increase in non-hydrocarbon activities
(10.3 percent). 2 Growth was particularly pronounced in construction, transportation, and
trade. At the same time, average inflation increased substantially to 6.2 percent, largely
driven by higher food prices and a marked increase in public expenditure. 3 Inflation has
accelerated further thus far in 2008, averaging about 12 percent in the first quarter (year-onyear).
4.
Despite higher oil revenues, Libya’s fiscal surplus in 2007 narrowed to 26 percent
of GDP, compared to 35 percent in 2006. This reflected a rapid increase in virtually all
1

This downsizing will be in addition to the large civil service reduction program, which started before the WDP
was launched.

2

Libya is the third largest African oil producer and has the largest proven reserves in the continent (43.7 billion
barrels at end-2007). Libya comes fourth in Africa in terms of natural gas production and reserves (equivalent to
about 0.25 million barrels per day and 9 billion barrels of oil, respectively).

3

The largest contributor to inflation was the rise in food prices (12 percent), followed by dwelling (7 percent).
The increase in the prices of other items was much smaller.

5
expenditure items (45 percent). The wage bill increased by around 50 percent. The raise in
public wages was accompanied by an initiation of a large civil service reform, with about one
third of public employees being transferred to a central labor office for retraining or
retrenchment.

5.
The external current account surplus also narrowed in 2007. It declined to
34 percent of GDP, compared to 46 percent in 2006, due to a marked increase in imports
(33 percent). Continued high oil exports resulted in a further build up of the net foreign assets
of the Central Bank of Libya (CBL) to almost $80 billion. The real effective exchange rate of
the dinar appreciated by 1 percent in 2007, and about 5 percent in the first quarter of 2008
due to the combined effects of the rising inflation and the strengthening of the euro. 4
6.
Broad money growth more than doubled to 41 percent in 2007, reflecting the
substantial increase in net foreign assets and the rapid increase in public expenditure,
including on-lending by specialized credit institutions (SCIs). Credit to the nongovernment
sector extended by these institutions grew by about 36 percent, while that extended by
commercial banks grew by about 15 percent. Interest rates remained low and became largely
negative in real terms with the rise in inflation. 5
7.
Notable progress has been made in banking sector reforms (Box 1). Two of the
three remaining public commercial banks were merged in April 2008. Most regional banks
have also been merged into one bank, and agreement has been reached with financial
institutions from UAE and Qatar to establish two new banks.
8.
Commercial banks are well capitalized, but the quality of their assets needs to be
further improved. Their overall capital adequacy ratio stood at about 15 percent at end2007. However, nonperforming loans (NPLs) constituted 25 percent of total loans. While still
high, this ratio compares favorably to its peak of almost 36 percent in 2004. Provisioning for
these loans has increased to about 67 percent.
9.
The Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) was established in March 2007. The
authorities plan to invest the LIA’s initial $40–50 billion on a commercial basis and ensure
that the LIA will be run by a qualified and independent management. Recent enhancements
of its operational framework are largely in line with staff’s recommendations (Box 2).

The euro area is Libya’s largest trading partner.

The interest rates on CBL’s CDs and on 1-year deposits stood at 2.25 and 4.5 percent, respectively, at endApril 2008.

Box 1. The Libyan Financial Sector
• The Libyan financial system is small. It comprises eleven commercial banks, four SCIs, 48 regional
banks (most of which have already been merged), one exchange bureau, and five insurance
companies. The five largest commercial banks were all state-owned until 2006. Since then, two have
been privatized and two merged. The SCIs are also state-owned and financed by the government.
• Financial intermediation continues to be low in Libya compared to other Maghreb countries.
Commercial banks’ credit has been on a downward trend (reaching 13 percent of GDP in 2007) as it
was being crowded-out by credit from SCIs.

• Bank privatization started in 2007. BNP Paribas acquired 19 percent of Sahara Bank in August
2007, with immediate management control and option to purchase additional shares of up to
51 percent within 3–5 years. Wahda Bank was acquired by Arab Bank in February 2008 under
similar terms.
• Tangible progress has been made in banking supervision, but important shortcomings remain.
In particular, there is a need to strengthen licensing procedures, the reporting of banks’ financial
statements, and on-site inspection. The CBL is implementing a substantial IMF TA program,
including with METAC, to improve capacity in off-site supervision, loan classifications, and capital
adequacy calculation. Furthermore, the authorities reached a technical cooperation agreement with
the Fund to field peripatetic and resident experts in banking supervision and central bank
restructuring.
• The capital and insurance market are in their infancy. The stock exchange was established in
2006. By end-2007, seven companies (mostly banks) were listed with a capitalization of
LD 1.2 billion (1.4 percent of GDP). The insurance sector is small and largely underdeveloped, with
total market premium income at LD 190 million in 2006.

8
Box 2. The Libyan Investment Authority
•
The LIA started operations in June 2007 to manage the financial assets allocated to it by the State,
including the Oil Reserve Fund. The intention is to build a high quality and well-diversified investment
portfolio in order to create a high and sustainable source of revenue, with a view to reducing dependency
on oil. The LIA consolidated pre-existing funds such as the Libya Foreign Investment Company and the
Libyan African Investment Portfolio.
•
The LIA invests its assets on a commercial basis mostly abroad through reputable international
managers. It may, however, make direct investments domestically or internationally with strategic
partners. Its organizational structure is being developed with assistance from international consultants.
Its Board of Trustees is headed by the prime minister and its Board of Directors is advised by a
committee of international financial experts. An international consulting firm is helping the LIA develop
a process for selecting and evaluating reputable investment managers for the different asset classes. The
LIA intends to meet high transparency standards.
•
Staff reviewed the LIA draft law in November 2007 and recommended revisions to remove or limit
the provisions that would allow the LIA to invest domestically, on-lend, and play a developmental role.
Staff also recommended that the LIA’s relationship with the state budget be clarified further, including
by explicitly allowing larger withdrawals from the LIA under exceptional circumstances, and that more
specific transparency requirements be spelled out. A decree was issued in March 2008, broadly
encompassing staff’s recommendations.

hydrocarbon sectors are intended

9
to be completed by the 40th anniversary of the revolution in 2009. The growth of both public
expenditure and imports is, therefore, expected to decelerate to a more moderate pace starting
in 2010. Taking into account the authorities’ intention to continue to prioritize public
expenditure, it is projected to stabilize as a percent of GDP. The fiscal surplus is thus
expected to slightly increase to 37 percent of GDP over the medium term, while the external
current account surplus is projected to moderate to 32 percent. A stabilization of international
food prices and a careful sequencing of investment projects to minimize bottlenecks and
shortages would help put inflation on a downward trend. The authorities broadly agreed with
the outlook described above.
12.
This favorable outlook is subject to downside risks, especially if oil prices turn out
lower than projected or the resolve to limit public expenditure growth (including in the
context of the WDP) wavers. If these risks materialize, the fiscal and external balances could
be considerably weaker than the above projections, with adverse consequences on intergenerational equity, and inflation could further increase beyond its present low double-digit
level. A further acceleration in public expenditure would also likely lead to deterioration in
its quality, with negative implications for the GDP growth outlook.
B. Fiscal Policy
13.
The 2008 budget reflects a continuation of the expansionary fiscal stance as it
entails a large increase in public expenditure. Current expenditure is envisaged to increase
by about 50 percent, compared to 2007, largely on account of transfers related to the WDP.
The total of the wage bill and monthly transfers related to severance payments are projected
to increase by around 15 percent. Capital expenditure would grow by about 38 percent,
compared to the budgeted increase of almost 80 percent, as the authorities intend to
implement about 70 percent of the budgeted amount. All in all, public expenditure would
increase by about 40 percent. Although both the overall and the non-oil balances are
projected to strengthen, the non-oil deficit in percent of non-oil GDP will widen further.
14.
The authorities are taking steps to reduce the impact of the rapid growth of
expenditure on its quality and inflation. They noted that much of the inflationary pressures
are due to the rise in imports prices. Nonetheless, they are concerned about the pace of the
recent acceleration in prices and have formed a ministerial committee to monitor the situation
and take policy actions. In addition to the ongoing rationalization of capital outlays, close
attention is being accorded to sequencing. Some large projects are being postponed and
competition among suppliers is being boosted by enhancing the regulations governing
agency. In addition, in order to enhance efficiency, public-private partnerships (PPPs) are
also being considered for utilities and other projects. Furthermore, on-lending by SCIs is
being curbed by limiting their access to budget financing.

10
15.
The authorities are determined to move ahead with the WDP in order to enhance
equity and the delivery of public services. 6 They were aware of its potential risks for inflation
and, if not implemented carefully, its effectiveness in achieving its intended goals. While
they are still working out its details, they intend to ensure that its design addresses these
risks. Assuming that WDP’s transfers remain (as a percent of GDP) at their approved 2008
level and that the plan to limit the growth of other public outlays continues to be
implemented, Libya’s fiscal position will remain sustainable (Box 3).
16.
The authorities intend to ensure that the LIA’s regulatory framework meets
high transparency and operational standards. The state budget will continue to be based
on conservative oil price assumptions 7 and the realized surpluses will be allocated to the LIA.
Transfers from the LIA to the budget will not exceed its profit. Recent enhancements in the
LIA’s operational framework limited its domestic investments to the oil sector and instated
specific auditing and publication requirements.
C. Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Reform
17.
The CBL has redoubled its efforts to enhance the monetary policy framework
and tighten monetary conditions. It introduced its own certificates of deposit, with Fund
technical assistance, in May 2008. The policy interest rates were raised by 50 basis points,
and the reserves requirement increased from 15 percent to 20 percent. The CBL is also
embarking on a substantial technical cooperation program with the Fund to modernize its
structure and enhance the payments system, with a view to improving its ability to conduct
monetary policy.
18.
Efforts are ongoing to further strengthen bank supervision. In particular, off-site
surveillance techniques are being improved and methodologies to calculate capital adequacy
measures are being modernized. The authorities also intend to strengthen CBL’s supervision
of SCIs. Regarding the AML/CFT, an amended law is being drafted to explicitly criminalize
the financing of terrorism.
19.
The authorities continue to advance financial sector reforms. They indicated that
the recent progress in bank reforms and opening the market to foreign banks have laid the
foundation for a competitive banking system. They intend to privatize the remaining two
public commercial banks through the newly established stock market. They are also
considering contracting international consultants to design an action plan to reform the SCIs.

6

The WDP aims at improving the delivery of public services through replacing several ministries with smaller
administrative bodies and transferring of the ownership and management of a large number of public entities to
the population.

7

These assumptions were $35 and $65 per barrel for 2007 and 2008, respectively.

11

Box 3. Fiscal Sustainability
To assess fiscal sustainability, staff conducted an analysis using a permanent income approach that
aims at ensuring intergenerational equity (Barnett and Ossowski 2002). According to this approach, annual
public expenditure should not exceed the

implicit return on government wealth. This
70
means that the non-hydrocarbon deficit should
60

be smaller than or equal to the returns on the
50
government’s net worth. To maintain

taken into account. The analysis assumes a

The results show that Libya’s fiscal position is
sustainable based on current policies. However,
the analysis is sensitive to changes in oil prices
and to the implicit rate of return. For example, a
drop in oil prices to about $80 per barrel, while
maintaining spending at the same level, would
render the medium-term fiscal position
unsustainable. Fiscal sustainability would also be
challenged should the implicit rate of return
decline by more than one percentage point (from
the baseline assumption of 5 percent).

Given the uncertainty regarding future oil prices and rate of returns, the above analysis calls for
caution. The fiscal position needs to be assessed periodically in line with any significant changes in the
outlook. The fiscal stance also needs to be considered in line with developments in inflation.
Implementation capacity is also an important factor in determining the appropriate pace of expenditure
growth and its sectoral distribution. The World Bank is currently conducting a public expenditure review
that should provide useful guidance in these areas.

12
D. External Sector Issues
20.
Staff’s estimates suggest that the dinar is moderately undervalued (Box 4). The
estimated undervaluation is, however, within the margin of error associated with this type of
analysis. Furthermore, this undervaluation is likely to be transitional in view of the fiscal and
current account projections that are based on current policies. The ongoing appreciation of
the dinar in real effective terms is already capturing part of the improvement in
fundamentals, and the current account surplus is projected to moderate over the medium term
in line with import growth and the projected stabilization in oil prices.
21.
The SDR continues to be an appropriate peg for the Libyan dinar. While most of
Libya’s imports originate in the euro area, oil (which constitutes more than 95 percent of
Libya’s exports) is priced in dollars. Furthermore, the SDR offers the advantage of being a
transparent and straight-forward basket that is not vulnerable to pressure for change based on
short-term developments in the world economy or Libya’s trading pattern.
E. Structural Reforms and Other Issues
22.
Progress has been made on various structural reforms, partly in line with past
Fund TA recommendations and the Medium-Term Reform Strategy (CR/06/137). A sound
framework for the management of the oil wealth has been established through the creation of
the LIA; customs administration has been reformed and a large taxpayer’s office established;
the presentation of the budget has been consolidated and a macrofiscal unit initiated; a large
number of public enterprises have been privatized; and one third of public employees are
being retrenched to the private sector.
23.
Some progress has been made in implementing reforms aimed at achieving
greater regional integration and liberalizing trade. Harmonization of financial
regulations, statistical frameworks, and payment and settlement systems with other Maghreb
countries is ongoing. Certification requirements for trade with these countries have also been
simplified. However, while customs duties on virtually all imports have been eliminated,
imports-specific production and consumption taxes, in addition to a flat 4 percent “service”
fee, are in place. Furthermore, ear-marked fees on imports, albeit small, have been recently
introduced. Nonetheless, the effective rate of import taxation remains very low (less than
3 percent) due to extensive exemptions.
24.
Libya’s debt relief to heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs) continues to be
based on forgiving interest payments and using a combination of swaps and
rescheduling of principal. The authorities indicated that agreements based on these
modalities have already been reached with some HIPCs, and that negotiations are ongoing
with others.

13

Box 4. Exchange Rate Assessment
Staff’s econometric estimates suggest that the dinar is moderately undervalued, but this may
be a transitory phenomenon. Using the equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach,1 the
results indicate an undervaluation in
the range of 15–20 percent at endLibya: Actual and Estimated Equilibrium REER
150
2007. Since then, however, the dinar
has appreciated by about 5 percent in
100

real effective terms. It should be noted
160
50
that this estimated range of
undervaluation could be within the

with these exercises, which is due to
data and methodological shortcomings.

still evolving.
The above results are confirmed by another exercise that estimates the external current
account “norm.”2 The results indicate

that Libya’s external current account

caution. These projections are sensitive to
assumptions on future oil prices and public expenditure (and thus import) growth. Should oil prices
decline below the current high projections or the efforts to rationalize the large expenditure plans
waver, revised current account projections could converge to the norm earlier in the medium term.

“Methodology for CGER Exchange Rate Assessments,” IMF, November 2006
(www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2006/110806.pdf). The equilibrium REER was estimated by a vector errorcorrection model in which the following set of fundamentals were the determining variables: terms of trade, public
consumption as a percent of GDP, per capita income relative to trading partners, and net foreign assets as a percent
of GDP.
2

Data for eight countries (the GCC countries, Algeria, and Libya) were used to estimate the current account norm
based on the following set of fundamentals: the fiscal balance, net foreign assets, the external oil balance, real per
capita GDP growth, and population growth.

14
25.
Progress has been made in improving economic and financial statistics. National
accounts and price statistics have been recently strengthened. The quality and timeliness of
macroeconomic data have also been improved over the past few years. Further enhancing the
compilation and quality of data continues to be hampered by insufficient coordination
between different government agencies and staffing limitations.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
Libya’s economy has performed strongly in recent years, benefiting from a
favorable external environment and ongoing reforms. Growth remained buoyant,
reflecting higher international oil prices and continued strong expansion of the nonhydrocarbon sectors. The fiscal and external current accounts registered large surpluses, and
CBL’s net foreign assets are accumulating rapidly. Inflation has, however, accelerated owing
mainly to the increase in food prices and public expenditure.
27.
Efforts to contain inflation should focus on tightening the fiscal stance by
limiting the rapid increase in public expenditure, which is also posing significant risks for
expenditure quality. While such increase appears affordable under current oil prices, it has
contributed to a substantial rise in the non-oil fiscal deficit in relation to the non-hydrocarbon
GDP. Although upgrading the infrastructure is essential to expand growth potential, it is
important to continue to prioritize public investment. Scaling back more of the planned
projects may be necessary, especially if inflation does not decline. It is also critical to adhere
to the plan to limit any further increases in public wages and complete the civil service
reform. Public financial management also needs to be further improved, including by
unifying the process of budget preparation and implementation under the Ministry of
Finance, and ensuring that the macrofiscal unit is enabled to fully perform its role.
28.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ decision to limit the scope of the WDP in 2008
and urges them to maintain this approach in the period ahead. A less cautious approach
would substantially increase the risk of crowding-out priority spending, encourage rentseeking activities, and significantly contribute to further inflationary pressures. Larger
transfers to the population in the context of a full-fledged WDP would likely be mostly
channeled to consumption or inefficient investments. This would not be the best way to
utilize revenue from exhaustible resources and would jeopardize intergenerational equity.
While revamping public administration in the context of the WDP presents an opportunity to
address inefficiencies, if not done properly, it can pose serious risks for the delivery of
essential public services. Staff, therefore, urges the authorities to carefully consider such
plans in close consultation with the World Bank.
29.
It is encouraging that the LIA has been launched in a transparent fashion and
that its operational framework has been enhanced. In this connection, it would be
important not to grant exceptions to the rules restricting domestic investments by the LIA, as
such investments should be limited to what is envisaged in the state budget. Ensuring that the

15
LIA invests exclusively abroad on a commercial basis would best serve its core objective of
protecting Libya’s savings for present and future generations. This would also avoid
complicating the macroeconomic management of the domestic economy. Staff encourages
the authorities to continue to enhance the operational framework of the LIA in line with the
evolving best practices for sovereign wealth funds.
30.
Staff welcomes CBL’s recent efforts to reduce excess liquidity. While the scope
for monetary policy is limited by the pegged exchange rate regime, there is a clear margin for
further tightening especially in view of the largely negative interest rates. The recent increase
in the CBL policy rates is, therefore, a step in the right direction. The increase in the reserves
requirement will also contribute to these efforts, although greater reliance on indirect
monetary policy instruments would be beneficial. It is also encouraging that lending by SCIs
is being curbed by limiting their access to budget financing.
31.
The recent introduction of CBL’s certificates of deposit is an important step
toward enhancing the monetary policy framework. Ongoing efforts to restructure the
CBL and enhance the payments system would also help improve the effectiveness of indirect
monetary policy instruments. The success of CBL’s efforts to enhance monetary policy
management will, however, remain contingent on close coordination with fiscal policy to
limit the injection of liquidity, including by the SCIs.
32.
Staff welcomes the ongoing strengthening of banking supervision, including by
improving off-site surveillance techniques. Supervision would benefit further from enhanced
coordination between the off-site and on-site units as well as capacity building through
additional staffing and training. It is also crucial to bring the SCIs under CBL’s full
supervision to protect the quality of their assets. The fact that SCIs are currently subject to
less stringent supervision than commercial banks could contribute to the dissemination of
risky lending practices. The rapid pace at which they have been expanding soft loans and
their very low cost of funding have contributed to the depressed lending and deposit rates in
the financial system in general. Unless this situation is addressed, it would lead to a
deterioration in financial intermediation and hinder the development of the banking system.
It would also be important to develop modern regulatory and supervisory frameworks for the
insurance sector and the newly-established stock market.
33.
The steady progress made in bank privatization is encouraging. Ensuring a
leveled playing field between the commercial banks and the SCIs, as well as continuing to
open the market to foreign banks, would help establish a competitive banking sector that can
support non-oil growth and job creation. In this connection, it would be useful to finalize the
plans to privatize the two remaining public commercial banks and to establish an
independent bank restructuring agency that would take over ownership of the SCIs and
oversee their restructuring and privatization.

16
34.
The dinar’s peg to the SDR has served the economy well. This arrangement
provides a strong monetary anchor, while allowing some flexibility in the dinar’s exchange
rate vis-à-vis individual major currencies. The dinar appears to be moderately undervalued,
but this is likely to be a transitory phenomenon in view of the projected decline in the current
account surplus. An eventual move to greater exchange rate flexibility would be beneficial
but would need to be gradual and preceded by a switch to market-based monetary
management and the development of expertise in foreign exchange markets.
35.
Staff encourages the authorities to make further progress in implementing
structural reforms. In this regard, it would be crucial to enhance the regulatory
environment, including to support the ongoing effort to implement part of Libya’s ambitious
investment program in the context of PPP arrangements within adequate safeguards. Building
on the progress achieved in simplifying the customs regime would also be important. In this
connection, the mission encourages the authorities to eliminate the service fee imposed on
imports, as well as import-specific consumption and production taxes and ear-marked fees.
36.
Staff encourages the authorities to provide full debt relief to heavily indebted
poor countries in line with the HIPC Initiative.
37.
While data provision is adequate for surveillance, the authorities are encouraged
to continue to improve economic and financial statistics in order to facilitate better
monitoring and analysis of developments to guide policy formulation.
38.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Libya take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

On January 1, 2002, the authorities adopted a conventional fixed peg to the SDR at a rate of
LD 1 = SDR 0.608. In June 2003, the exchange rate was devalued by 15 percent to
LD 1 = SDR 0.5175. From February 14, 1999 to December 31, 2001, a dual exchange rate
system was in place, with an “official” exchange rate pegged to the SDR, and a “special”
exchange rate pegged to the U.S. dollar.
VIII.

Exchange System:

In June 2003, the authorities eliminated the restrictions that gave rise to multiple currency
practices. Libya accepted its obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 of the
Articles of Agreement in June 2003.
IX.

Article IV Consultation:

Libya is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV staff report (CR/07/149) was
discussed by the Executive Board in April 2007.

ANNEX II. LIBYA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
Prepared by the World Bank staff
(As of June 17, 2008)
1.
Libya has been a member of the World Bank Group since 1958, joining the
International Bank of Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and International Finance
Corporation (IFC) in September 1958, International Development Association (IDA) in
August 1961, and Multilateral International Guarantee Association (MIGA) in April 1993.
There have been no World Bank Group loans made to Libya to date as the development of
the country’s petroleum assets from 1960 placed Libya among capital-surplus oil-producing
countries, and provided resources to build extensive infrastructure and provide social
services.
2.
In 2007, a Technical Cooperation Agreement was signed between the Bank and the
Government of Libya, with a total budget of $1 million contributed jointly by the two parties.
The Agreement funds a Joint Economic Advisory Program, geared to support and further
Libya’s reform process, covering the period of July 1, 2007 to June 30, 2008. Activities were
launched in the areas of an Investment Climate Assessment, Business and Legal
Environment, and support for the development of the Libya Vision 2025. A Public
Expenditure Review (PER) was also launched in August 2007, with the main mission taking
place in November 2007, and the completion of the document scheduled by October 2008.
The PER benefits from inputs provided by IMF staff.
3.
A Bank mission took place in March 2008 to introduce the new Director of the
Maghreb Department to the Libyan authorities, and to discuss the proposed work program
with the country. The authorities communicated their desire to proceed with the PER work,
but that it should take into account recent developments (the March 2, 2008 decision by
Khadafi to reorganize the government).
4.
Two high-level workshops were held in April 2008. The first one was on “Libya in
Transition.” It covered the economic strategy, oil revenue management and social transfers.
The second was on “Topics of Private Sector Development” and had an active participation
from the private sector.
5.
Several activities are planned for FY2009: a) Completion of the Public Expenditure
Review; b) TA support on WTO accession, review of business regulations, and preparation
of an Investment Climate Assessment. A review and update of the 2007–2008 Memorandum
of Understanding (MOU) should also take place. A final new area of proposed collaboration
includes TA on statistical capacity building and surveys.

5
ANNEX III. LIBYA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1. Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
Weaknesses remain in the area of national accounts and the balance of payments, as well as
(i) the conceptual and compilation procedures underpinning the collection of statistics in the
various sectors; (ii) deficiencies in coverage, periodicity, and timeliness; (iii) lack of
consistency of data across sectors; and (iv) with the exception of monetary data, lack of a
reporting system to facilitate updating MCD’s operational database between missions. These
issues are compounded by institutional weaknesses, the lack of interagency cooperation, and
the proliferation of agencies with unclearly demarked and often overlapping responsibilities.
2. A 2005 (June 4–9 and August 27–September 3) multisector mission examined the
conceptual and compilation procedures for national accounts, price indices, foreign trade,
money and banking, and government finance statistics. It developed recommendations for
improvement in these systems, and encouraged Libya to expedite participation in the General
Data Dissemination System (GDDS). The Middle East Regional Technical Assistance Center
(METAC) prepared the metadata for the price and external sector that is needed for the
participation in the GDDS. In February 2006, the authorities communicated their decision to
use the GDDS as a framework for developing the statistical system and appointed a GDDS
coordinator. To participate in the GDDS, the authorities should provide the Fund with the
final metadata and prioritized plans for improving the statistical system.
National accounts
3. Some progress has been made in the compilation of GDP estimates by economic activity
through 2004, based on the 1968 System of National Accounts. However, the compilation
process is hampered by high staff turnover and significant delays in the receipt of basic data
from various sources, particularly other government agencies. In addition, many of the
surveys are outdated. Annual data up to 2002 were reported to STA in 2004 and published in
the International Financial Statistics (IFS); however, the estimates are not fully consistent
with other data sets. A new household survey was finalized in 2003.
4. To improve the national accounts, the 2005 STA mission made several
recommendations including: (i) establishing a National Statistical Agency to produce and
disseminate official statistics and coordinate the national statistical program; (ii) creating a
National Statistical Council as a legally empowered interagency coordination committee to
oversee compilation of national accounts statistics; (iii) transferring responsibility for the
national accounts from the National Planning Council to the Census and Statistical
Department of the National Information and Documentation Agency (NIDA) and creating 6–
10 additional permanent staff positions; (iv) prioritizing implementation of the 1993 System
of National Accounts and outlining entailed data requirements; (v) improving the
questionnaires used for the construction and manufacturing surveys and the establishments
frame; (vi) initiating regular surveys of major services, agricultural output, and public and

6
private construction; and (vii) improving estimates for transport, storage, and communication
companies (by including the three airline companies, shipping establishments, and
telecommunication enterprises in the services sector), and for trade margin (by excluding
margin of goods not channeled through wholesale or retail trade).
5. STA has appointed a resident national accounts statistics advisor to assist in
implementing STA recommendations in particular, and to improve the national accounts in
general. The assignment, which began in June 2006, was for one year and renewed for
another year upon the request of the authorities. The advisor focused on identifying new data
sources and establishing a system to collect the necessary data. He also coordinated the
formation of several technical committees to guarantee that the data obtained by national
accounts compilers are consistent with the data compiled by other agencies. The advisor
concluded his work in June 2008 and the authorities produced revised national accounts
statistics.
Price statistics
6. The CPI index is based on weights derived from the 1992–93 household budget survey,
covers only Tripoli, has 1999 as reference year, and is compiled from 2000 onwards. A new
index based on a 2003 household budget survey is compiled since 2007. Both of these
indexes are available with a one-month lag and published on the Central Bank of Libya
(CBL) website. A new household expenditure survey is being conducted between November
2007 and October 2008. The expenditure data will be used to update the CPI and further
expand its geographic coverage to include eight urban and rural areas – Tripoli, Benghazi,
Sebha, Ghiryan, Sert, El Jabal Al Akhadar, Meserati, and Zawya. The official index is now
based on the 2003 household survey and an updated and expanded CPI is planned to be
released in January 2010.
7. The 2005 STA mission had recommended that compilers should (i) expand the coverage
of the new CPI to include Benghazi and Sabah in addition to Tripoli; (ii) align the
classification system more closely with international standards (particularly by including
services of owner-occupied dwellings and second-hand goods in the CPI); (iii) adjust
seasonal items and temporarily missing items; (iv) revise all item descriptions and specify the
brand name and country of origin to ensure accurate data collection; (v) replace the
administrative data used to estimate rent by a sample of rental units; and (vi) develop the
methodology for compiling a producer price index.
Monetary and financial statistics
8. While the timeliness and quality of monetary data reported for IFS have improved
significantly, some methodological deficiencies remain. To enhance monetary and financial
statistics, the STA missions in 2005 and 2007 made the following recommendations:
(i) reclassify Libyan Foreign Bank (LFB) as a resident financial institution under other
depository corporations and include LFB in the institutional coverage of the monetary

7
survey; (ii) adopt market-based valuation of financial instruments and accrual accounting
procedures for adding accruing interest to the outstanding amount of the instrument;
(iii) revalue CBL’s holdings of monetary gold at end-period market prices; (iv) identify all
Fund-related accounts in the CBL’s balance sheet as per IMF Finance Department
instructions; (v) when specialized credit institutions start issuing deposit liabilities, reclassify
these institutions as other depository corporations and include them in the institutional
coverage of the monetary survey; and (vi) revise/develop report forms for banks that would
contain a breakdown of positions by currency of denomination, financial instrument,
residency and economic sector of counterparty consistent with the structure of the
Standardized Report Forms.
Fiscal data
9. The fiscal information system remains fragmented and inconsistent with international
standards, since it was designed for administrative reporting under the government finance
law, rather than for purposes of providing timely statistical information for economic
planning and analysis. However, there has been significant improvement in this area.
Monthly and quarterly data for key components of revenue and expenditure are being
reported to staff on a regular basis.
10. To improve the fiscal data, the 2005 STA mission recommended: (i) adopting
centralized management of all budgetary central government accounts at the ministry of
finance; (ii) expanding coverage of central government accounts by including extrabudgetary
and local government operations; (iii) developing GFS metadata on concepts, scope,
classifications, basis of recording, data sources, and statistical techniques for posting on the
GDDS website; (iv) adopting the Fund’s 2001 Government Finance Statistics Manual
(GFSM) as a coherent methodological framework for the production and dissemination of
monthly, quarterly, and annual fiscal data. This would promote the recording of all assets and
liabilities on accrual basis and at market values. To this end, STA has trained two CBL staff,
one in 2007 and one in 2008.
Balance of payments
11. Since 2000 annual balance of payments data have been regularly reported to STA in the
BPM5 format. Nonetheless, the balance of payments data suffer from deficiencies, mainly
due to: (i) unclear methodology; (ii) outdated surveys; (iii) lack of component detail; (iv) lack
of comprehensive coverage of trade data; and (v) methodological flaws in the compilation of
the financial account.
12. To improve the balance of payments statistics, the 2005 STA mission made the
following recommendations: (i) include provisions in the Bank Law for mandatory reporting
by all resident sectors of data needed for compilation of balance of payments (with the CBL
as the legally authorized compiling agency and with penalties for noncompliance,
misreporting, breach of confidentiality, etc); (ii) institutionalize regular coordination

8
meetings of the CBL with NIDA, the ministry of finance (customs department), the ministry
of planning and other ministries/agencies, and private sector enterprises that can provide
external sector source data; (iii) urge high-level staff to seek training opportunities, including
IMF courses on balance of payments statistics; and (iv) develop computer programs for
compiling balance of payments statistics in BPM5 format and move to electronic reporting
by reporting agencies. In addition, a number of actions were proposed, aiming at (i) bringing
balance of payments compilation in line with the BPM5 on residency/nonresidency criteria,
recording basis (accrual principle), valuation (market price), coverage, etc; (ii) improving the
source data, including by conducting surveys on foreign direct investment, services, and
transfers and a survey to establish a business registry; (iii) improving the coverage of foreign
direct investment and portfolio investment data by surveying relevant foreign-based oil
companies and companies outside the hydrocarbon sector; (iv) improving the coverage of the
income account by including all transactions of the LFB and the oil companies employing
nonresidents; and (v) compiling foreign trade statistics using internationally accepted
concepts and definitions.
13. A METAC mission visited the CBL, during February 11−22, 2007 to assess progress in
developing the institutional infrastructure for compiling balance of payments statistics;
provide technical advice on improving balance of payments data collection systems; and
identify specific areas for further technical assistance in improving the data compilation
system. Following meetings with various banks and governmental agencies, the mission
drafted agency-specific forms for the CBL’s use in collecting relevant source data. The
mission was informed that an interagency committee was established in 2006 by the ministry
of planning to address the issue of coverage deficiencies in external trade statistics. The
METAC mission that visited Tripoli during January 27 and February 7, 2008 found that the
implementation of most recommendations was pending. The majority of the surveys of the
nonbank sector and the recommendation on the interagency committee on foreign trade
statistics are yet to be implemented. The need for the National Oil Company (NOC) to
provide more detailed information on its import/export transactions, and for customs to
address recording issues on the customs declarations forms are among the critical
recommendations that require decisive action. While recognizing the importance of
introducing provisions in the Bank Law for mandatory reporting by all resident sectors of
data needed for compilation of balance of payments, and for increasing staff resources for
balance of payments compilation, the mission noted that the current staff was equipped with
the basic skills for implementing the work program agreed with METAC.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 9, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with The Socialist People's
Libyan Arab Jamahiriya
On July 18, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. 8
Background
Since the lifting in 2003-04 of the UN sanctions, which lasted more than 10 years, Libya has
launched a series of structural reforms and accelerated its transition to “people’s capitalism.”
The normalization of diplomatic relations with the U.S. and the EU in the second half of 2007
has contributed to increased foreign investors’ interest, particularly in the hydrocarbon,
banking, and infrastructure sectors. However, while progress has been made in recent years
to liberalize the economy, it remains largely state controlled and heavily dependent on
hydrocarbon resources. Crude oil and gas accounted for about 70 percent of GDP, 90 percent
of total government revenues, and 98 percent of total exports in 2007.
A Wealth Distribution Program (WDP) was launched in March 2008 to distribute part of the oil
wealth to the population and reduce the size of the government. Disbursements will be in the
form of both cash and shares in projects. The initially announced amount was
8

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff
prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the
discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors,
and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive
Board as expressed during the July, 18, 2008 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

2
LD 25–30 billion ($20-25 billion), but subsequently only LD 4.6 billion ($3.8 billion) were
approved for this year. The authorities are still considering the size, form, and modalities of
the annual distributions in the years ahead.
Macroeconomic performance strengthened further in 2007, notwithstanding an acceleration in
inflation. Real GDP grew by 6.8 percent, supported by an expansion in the hydrocarbon
sector (3.9 percent) and a rapid increase in nonhydrocarbon activities (10.3 percent). Growth
was particularly strong in construction, transportation, and trade. At the same time, average
inflation increased substantially to 6.2 percent, largely driven by higher food prices and a
marked increase in public expenditure. Inflation accelerated further in the first quarter of 2008,
averaging about 12 percent (year-on-year).
Despite higher oil revenues, Libya’s fiscal surplus in 2007 narrowed to 26 percent of GDP,
compared to 35 percent in 2006. This reflected a rapid increase in virtually all expenditure
items (45 percent), albeit at a slightly slower rate than what was envisaged in the budget. The
decision to raise public wages resulted in an increase in the wage bill of around 50 percent.
Capital expenditure also grew rapidly.
On the external side, The current account surplus declined to 34 percent of GDP, compared to
46 percent in 2006, due to a marked increase in imports (33 percent). Continued high oil
exports resulted in a further build up of the net foreign assets of Central Bank of Libya (CBL) to
almost $80 billion. The real effective exchange rate of the dinar appreciated by 1 percent in
2007, and about 5 percent in the first quarter of 2008 due to the combined effects of the rising
inflation and the strengthening of the euro against the SDR (to which the dinar is pegged).
Broad money growth accelerated to 41 percent in 2007, reflecting the substantial increase in
net foreign assets and the rapid increase in public expenditure, including on-lending by SCIs.
Credit extended to the nongovernment sector by these institutions grew by about 36 percent,
while that extended by commercial banks grew by about 15 percent. Interest rates remained
low and became negative in real terms with the rise in inflation. In an effort to address excess
liquidity, the CBL recently increased its policy interest rate to 2.25 percent and the reserves
requirement to 20 percent. It introduced in May 2008 its own certificates of deposit as part of
its ongoing effort to enhance the monetary policy framework.
The Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) was established in March 2007. The authorities plan to
invest the LIA’s initial $40–50 billion mostly abroad on a commercial basis and ensure that the
LIA will be run by a qualified and independent management. Recent enhancements of its
operational framework are largely in line with staff’s recommendations.
Progress has been made in various structural reforms, partly in line with past Fund TA
recommendations and the Medium-Term Reform Strategy (Country Report 06/137). A sound
framework for the management of the oil wealth has been established through the creation of

3
the LIA. Customs administration has been reformed and a large taxpayer’s office established;
the presentation of the budget has been consolidated and a macrofiscal unit initiated; a large
number of public enterprises have been privatized; and one third of public employees are
being retrenched to the private sector. Two large state-owned banks were privatized in 2007
and 2008, and two of the three remaining public commercial banks were merged in April 2008.
Most regional banks have also been merged into one bank, and agreement has been reached
with financial institutions from UAE and Qatar to establish two new banks.
Libya’s debt relief to heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs) continues to be based on
forgiving interest payments and using a combination of swaps and rescheduling of principal.
The authorities indicated that agreements based on these modalities have already been
reached with some HIPCs, and that negotiations are ongoing with others.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Libya’s continued solid macroeconomic performance, as
reflected in the acceleration in GDP growth—in particular in the non-hydrocarbon sector—and
the large fiscal and external current account surpluses, based on both the favorable external
environment and the authorities’ ongoing economic reforms. Directors agreed that Libya’s
medium-term outlook remains positive, but underscored the need to reverse the recent
acceleration in inflation—caused in particular by the increase in food prices—and to further
advance structural reforms in the period ahead, in support of the authorities’ welcome initiative
to speed up the transition from a state-dominated to a market economy.
Directors stressed that efforts to contain inflation should focus on tightening the fiscal stance
by limiting the rapid increase in public expenditure, which could also pose risks for expenditure
quality. They welcomed the authorities’ plans to limit any further increases in public sector
wages and to complete the civil service reform. While recognizing the need to upgrade the
infrastructure, Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to prioritize public investment
and to stand ready to scale back more of the planned projects if inflationary pressures do not
recede. Public financial management also needs to be strengthened further, including by
unifying the process of budget preparation and implementation under the Ministry of Finance.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ decision to limit the scope of the Wealth Distribution
Program (WDP) in 2008—while maintaining the focus on strengthening human capital—
against the background of the economy’s absorptive capacity constraints and increased
inflation. This conservative approach will need to be maintained in the period ahead in order to
avoid crowding out priority spending, to discourage rent-seeking activities, and to further
reduce inflationary pressures. Directors considered that the planned reform of the public
administration in the context of the WDP could present an opportunity to address
inefficiencies, but care should be taken not to jeopardize the delivery of essential public

4
services. They recommended that the authorities consider the reform plans carefully in
consultation with the World Bank.
Directors commended the authorities for launching the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) in a
transparent fashion, and the recent enhancement of its operational framework. They
emphasized the importance of limiting domestic investments by the LIA. Directors encouraged
the authorities to continue to enhance the operational framework of the LIA in line with the
evolving best practices for sovereign wealth funds.
Directors commended the recent efforts of the Central Bank of Libya (CBL) to tighten monetary
policy by raising both the CBL policy interest rate and the reserves requirement. They noted
that greater reliance on indirect monetary policy instruments would be beneficial, and in this
regard, they welcomed the recent introduction of CBL certificates of deposit.
Directors commended the authorities for the progress made in bank privatization and
restructuring. They encouraged the authorities to finalize the plans to privatize the two
remaining public commercial banks. It would also be important to establish an independent
bank restructuring agency that would take over ownership of the specialized credit institutions
and oversee their restructuring and privatization.
Directors agreed that the dinar’s peg to the SDR has served Libya well as it provides a strong
monetary anchor while allowing some flexibility in the dinar’s exchange rate vis-à-vis individual
major currencies. An eventual move to greater exchange rate flexibility would be beneficial, but
would need to be gradual and preceded by a switch to market-based monetary management
and development of expertise in foreign exchange markets. Directors took note of the staff
assessment that the dinar is moderately undervalued at present, but that this undervaluation is
likely to be transitory given the expected evolution of the fiscal and current account positions
based on current policies.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to continue to improve economic and financial
statistics in order to facilitate better monitoring and analysis of developments to guide policy
formulation. They urged the authorities to establish an AML/CFT framework in line with
international standards.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to provide full debt relief to heavily indebted
poor countries in line with the HIPC Initiative.

Arab Jamahiriya

1.
On behalf of the Libyan authorities, I thank staff for the productive discussions on the 2008
Article IV Consultation mission, and the highly appreciated technical assistance support that the
Fund is providing. The authorities also value the continued constructive engagement of
management and the Board on policy and reform priorities.
Recent Developments
2.
For the fourth consecutive year, economic expansion in Libya continued at a brisk pace in
2007, underpinned by buoyant oil prices and strengthened foreign investor’s interest. At 6.8 percent,
GDP growth was the highest among the Maghreb countries. The expansion was broad based and
driven by a sharp acceleration in non-hydrocarbon activity at over 10 percent. The dominant sources
of non-hydrocarbon growth were construction, transportation, and trade. The fiscal and external
positions continued to post sizable surpluses, and the rapid accumulation of net foreign assets by the
Central Bank of Libya (CBL) further reinforced Libya’s strong net external creditor position. At the
same time, meaningful strides in the implementation of important structural reforms were achieved,
including banking sector, civil service and trade reforms. These accomplishments are testament to
the authorities’ determination to transform Libya from a state-dominated to a market economy.
3.
Not surprisingly, and as commonly observed in many countries, price pressures have lately
emerged, reflecting largely rising world food prices. The authorities, nevertheless, recognize the
important role of fiscal policy in containing inflationary pressures. To this end, they are in the
process of trimming down planned capital outlays in line with the economy’s absorptive and
implementation capacity to safeguard macroeconomic stability. At the same time, close attention is
being accorded to project selectivity, prioritization and sequencing, which will also help preserve
the quality of public spending and minimize bottlenecks. Moreover, access to budget financing by
specialized credit institutions (SCIs) is being restricted. Additionally, they have tightened monetary
conditions recently as part of their proactive response to curb inflation. These measures, along with
the expected stabilization of international food prices, underlie the projected gradual decline in
inflation from 2009 and beyond. Moreover, the authorities have recently established a ministerial
committee to monitor inflation developments and take further policy actions as appropriate.
Outlook and Policies
4.
The authorities share staff’s assessment that Libya’s medium-term outlook remains positive.
Overall GDP growth is expected to remain very strong, owing to favorable oil market outlook and
increased investments in infrastructure and hydrocarbon sectors. These investments are expected to
set the stage for a higher productivity growth and output potential over the medium-to-long term. In
spite of this, the authorities are cognizant of the fact that the country’s favorable prospects are not
without risks. Accordingly, they remain committed to sustaining robust growth, including by further
promoting diversification through greater private sector and foreign-investor participation,
accelerating the implementation of structural reforms, progressing with the execution of necessary
investments in the hydrocarbon sector, and most importantly addressing the country’s infrastructure
bottlenecks.

Fiscal Developments, Policies, and Reforms
5.
Fiscal policy in 2007 continued to aim at achieving a balance between the need to increase
development spending to support solid long-term growth and saving part of the revenue from nonrenewable resources to attain a sustainable source of revenue, with a view to reducing dependency
on oil. The fiscal position remained strong, with the overall fiscal surplus estimated at about 26
percent of GDP, supported by buoyant hydrocarbon revenues. Moreover, improvements in custom
and revenue administration have already started to pay-off, as reflected in the rapid increase in nonhydrocarbon tax revenue. On the expenditure side, the majority of the increase in public expenditure
in 2007 was channeled to much-needed capital outlays. The increase in wages was necessary, given
their low base. More importantly, the rise in public sector wages was accompanied by the
commencement of a large civil service reduction program. Furthermore, substantial progress has
been made on important structural fiscal reforms, including the establishment of a large taxpayer’s
office, the initiation of a macro-fiscal unit, and the consolidation of the budget’s presentation. In
addition, a large number of public enterprises have been privatized, and the authorities are
considering public-private-partnerships for utilities and other projects to enhance efficiency of
public services delivery.
6.
In March 2007, the authorities established the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) to manage
the state’s financial assets, including the Oil Reserve Fund, with a view to ensuring a sound
framework for the management of oil wealth. They plan to invest the LIA’s initial $40-50 billion,
mostly abroad, on a commercial basis through qualified and independent international managers.
Transfers from the LIA to the budget will be limited to its profits. The LIA intends to meet high
transparency and operational standards. The LIA decree issued in March 2008 largely incorporates
staff’s recommendations, and its operational framework was further enhanced.
7.
Fiscal policy in 2008 continues to aim at accommodating Libya’s ongoing investment
program, although the share of capital expenditure in GDP is expected to decline. The 2008 budget
also accommodates the recently initiated Wealth Distribution Program (WDP), as the authorities
underscore the importance of sharing the oil wealth with the population. In addition to its equity
objectives, the WDP aims at reducing the size of the government and encouraging private sector
activity. Only a relatively small amount was approved for distribution in 2008 under the WDP. In
this respect, it is well to note that the resulting increase in transfers is being accompanied by a
stabilization in the wage bill. The authorities are still considering the size, form and modalities of
the annual distributions for the period ahead. They intend to consult with the World Bank on their
public administration reform plans as they emerge.
8.
Looking beyond 2008, the authorities are intent on keeping fiscal policy in line with
maintaining a large fiscal surplus and alleviating inflationary pressures. In addition, they will
preserve with their efforts aimed at boosting non-hydrocarbon revenues. They appreciate the fiscal
sustainability analysis, and share the staff’s assessment that, based on current policies, Libya’s
fiscal position is sustainable. It is well to note that public finances remain resilient to slides in oil
prices as low as $90 per barrel––an unlikely scenario given what is probably a structural shift in
world oil prices. Moreover, the analysis confirms that the current fiscal stance is consistent with
preserving intergenerational equity.

Monetary, Financial Sector, and Exchange rate Issues
9.
Libya continues to implement reforms aimed at modernizing its monetary policy framework
and developing its financial sector. Broad money growth accelerated in 2007, owing to the
substantial increase in net foreign assets and the rapid increase in public spending, including onlending by SCIs. The authorities consider the primary sources of rising CPI inflation to be basically
not monetary, with the rise in food prices being the largest contributor to inflation. Notwithstanding
the limited scope for monetary policy given the exchange rate peg, the CBL intensified its efforts to
tighten monetary conditions to help reduce excess liquidity. In this respect, both interest rates and
reserve requirements were raised in May 2008. Moreover, with Fund TA, the CBL has recently
introduced its own certificates of deposit, which should increase the scope for enhanced liquidity
management through greater reliance on market-based instruments. At the same time, it embarked
on an extensive technical cooperation program with the Fund to modernize its structure and enhance
the payment system, with a view to improving its capacity to conduct a more proactive monetary
policy, going forward.
10.
Commercial banks are well-capitalized, with the overall capital adequacy ratio at about 15
percent at end-2007. Non-performing loans, while still high, continued to decline. The authorities
recognize the importance of a sound financial system to support non-hydrocarbon growth. In this
respect, substantial progress has been made in banking sector reforms, including bank privatization
and restructuring, as well as further strengthening bank supervision. On bank privatization, which
started in 2007, two of the five public commercial banks have already been privatized to reputable
foreign banks, with immediate management control and option to purchase additional shares of up
to 51 percent within 3-5 years. Two of the remaining three banks merged in April 2008, and most
regional banks have been also merged into one bank. Going forward, the authorities plan to
privatize the remaining two public commercial banks through the newly-established stock market.
Moreover, an agreement has been reached with financial institutions from the U.A.E and Qatar to
establish two new banks.
11.
On banking supervision, the CBL, based on Fund TA recommendations, is improving its
off-site surveillance techniques, loan classification, and capital adequacy calculations. Furthermore,
a technical cooperation agreement with the Fund in banking supervision has been reached. The
authorities recognize the risks posed by SCIs to financial intermediation and development. In this
connection, they intend to strengthen CBL’s supervision of SCIs, while consideration is also being
given to contracting international consultants to design an action plan to reform the SCIs. These
reforms, together with the opening up of the market to foreign banks, have laid the basis for a
competitive banking sector.
12.
The dinar’s peg to the SDR has served Libya well by providing a credible monetary anchor,
while allowing some flexibility in the dinar’s exchange rate vis-à-vis individual major currencies. It
is well to note that the high degree of volatility in oil prices and the large degree of dependence on
oil exports compound the serious methodological weaknesses of the CGER methodology for
exchange rate assessment, and highlight the inherent difficulties in the application of the 2007
Surveillance Decision to oil producing countries. Therefore, the authorities agree that the results of
the exchange rate assessment should be treated as indicative and interpreted with caution.

Other Reforms and Issues
13.
Continued progress has been made in trade reforms, including the ongoing harmonization of
financial regulations, statistical frameworks, and payment settlement systems with other Maghreb
countries, as well as the simplification of certification requirements for trade with these countries.
Moreover, custom duties on almost all imports have been abolished. Technical assistance support
from the World Bank on WTO accession is planned for FY 2009.
14.
The Libyan authorities remain committed to further improving the quality, dissemination,
and timeliness of economic and financial data to better guide policy formulation. They have
recently benefited from the expertise of a resident national accounts statistics advisor to assist in
implementing the Fund’s Statistics Department recommendations, and improve national accounts.
Going forward, they intend to enhance coordination between the various levels of government while
addressing capacity and staffing limitations over the medium term.
15.
Following its withdrawal from the HIPC imitative, Libya has developed its own debt relief
plan. It continues to provide generous debt relief to HIPCs who negotiate in good faith, based on
interest payments forgiveness and a combination of swaps and rescheduling of principal. Agreement
based on these modalities have been reached with some HIPCs, while others are still under
negotiations.
