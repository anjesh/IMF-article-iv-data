STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 10, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context. Papua New Guinea’s (PNG) economy is experiencing an important transition,
as new liquefied natural gas (LNG) production and exports commence. While resource
sector activity in 2014–15 will be buoyed by gas production, non-resource sector growth
will remain low in 2014 as LNG production has little knock-on effect on the wider
economy. Meanwhile, the sharp fiscal expansions of the past three years have
significantly reduced fiscal space, and excess demand for foreign exchange has persisted
following a large de facto appreciation of the kina after the introduction in early
June 2014 of a trading band around the official exchange rate and the requirement for
banks to use the band in their transactions with customers.
Outlook and risks. The overall growth outlook in the short run is favorable, but it masks
weakness in the non-resource sector and employment conditions. Risks to the near-term
outlook are increasingly tilted to the downside as global economic weakness could
weigh on external demand and commodity prices, with fiscal stimulus limited by the
need to ensure debt sustainability. The recent exchange rate measure also heightens
risks to the growth outlook as well as to the external position.
Policy assessment. A key challenge facing PNG is to maintain fiscal and debt
sustainability while pursuing development objectives. Continued macroeconomic and
financial stability will also require better management of excess banking system liquidity
and exchange rate policy. To meet these challenges, policies should aim to:


Consolidate the fiscal position in line with the government’s current debt targets
through restraining low-impact expenditure and strengthening revenue collection.



Improve spending quality, through improved composition and public financial
management, and ensure budget integrity in managing public resources.



Withdraw excess liquidity held by banks more fully and allow the exchange rate to
be more determined by market forces in order to eliminate excess demand for
foreign exchange.



Accelerate structural reforms, focusing on lowering the cost of doing business, to
support non-resource sector growth.

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

CONTEXT
1.
Papua New Guinea’s (PNG) economy has entered a transitional growth period, as new
liquefied natural gas (LNG) production and exports commence. The successful completion of
the LNG project, ahead of schedule in May 2014, has demonstrated a new level of capacity to
undertake large-scale commercial development and has increased investor confidence in
developing large projects in the future.
2.
However, spillovers from the LNG project to the rest of the economy are limited, with
structural weaknesses also impeding higher, broad-based growth in the non-resource sector.
Papua New Guinea faces high costs of doing business. At present, job-intensive small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) and agricultural activity are burdened by inadequate infrastructure, high
energy costs, lack of skilled workers, limited access to credit, poor security, and regulatory
weaknesses.
3.
Meanwhile, policy buffers to counter exogenous shocks have shrunk. The sharp fiscal
expansions of the past three years have significantly reduced fiscal space, with large fiscal deficits
and rising public debt. Inflation is moderate, but foreign reserves, while still adequate (at 4 months
of prospective imports at end-September), have fallen substantially from their record levels, and
excess demand in the foreign exchange (FX) market may have worsened following the introduction
in early June 2014 of a trading band around the official exchange rate and the requirement for
banks to use the band in their transactions with customers.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
4.
Economic activity is expected to expand by 5.8 percent in 2014, largely driven by LNG
production. With production reaching full capacity next year, real GDP growth is projected to surge
to around 19.5 percent in 2015 (Table 1).1 However, given modest direct spillovers from the resource
sector, non-resource sector growth is expected to remain weak in 2014 at only 0.5 percent, but rise
in 2015 to 4 percent. Headline inflation is projected to exceed 5 percent in 2014, reflecting the
effects of the kina depreciation in the first part of the year and fiscal stimulus, but moderate slightly
over the medium term consistent with strengthening in the external and fiscal positions and recent
decline in oil prices (Table 5).2 The current account deficit is expected to narrow substantially in 2014
and turn to a surplus in 2015, on account of increasing LNG exports.

1

The GDP numbers cited in this report are based on a methodology using 1998 as the base period of a fixed weight
index. Given the enormous structural change that has since taken place, the authorities are developing a chainlinking methodology to more accurately capture real GDP. Meanwhile, the authorities are extending GDP coverage,
which will result in higher levels of GDP estimates.
2

The recent large increases in minimum wages (up to 40 percent) are unlikely to result in a significant increase in
inflation, as their impact is confined to a few formal sectors, such as plantation activity and retail services.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5.
Risks to the outlook are increasingly tilted toward the downside (Appendix 1). In the
near term, global economic weakness could weigh on external demand and commodity prices, with
room for fiscal stimulus limited by the need to ensure debt sustainability. The recent measure
resulting in the effective appreciation of the exchange rate also heightens risks to the growth
outlook and the external position, as non-resource exports could be adversely affected. Over the
longer term, development of LNG production in Australia and shale gas elsewhere could reduce gas
prices, export earnings, and government revenue. Lower LNG and mineral prices, together with
higher funding costs in a post-quantitative easing era, could also affect foreign direct investment
(FDI). Upside risks include the potential for a second LNG project and further mineral resource
development (Box 1).

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
6.
Overview. The economic transition underway calls for an adjustment of macroeconomic
policies to ensure stability. Fiscal consolidation will need to be anchored by government’s existing
debt targets, with more focus on improving the quality of expenditure. Greater exchange rate
flexibility will be required to cushion the economy from shocks, while more complete withdrawal of
banking system excess liquidity would help strengthen monetary policy transmission and also
alleviate the downward pressure on the kina. These policies should be supported by faster and
deeper structural reforms to create an environment that is conducive for private sector investment,
job creation, and inclusive growth.

A. Fiscal Policy and Resource Revenue Management
7.
The large fiscal expansion of the past three years has reduced PNG’s fiscal space, with
new LNG revenue not sufficient to replenish it and allow for spending to grow at the current
pace. Under staff’s baseline, the overall fiscal deficit is expected to be 7.2 percent of GDP in 2014—a
slight improvement from 8.0 percent of GDP

targets can help overcome. Achieving the 30 percent
debt target in 2015 would imply an NRPB deficit of about 3.6 percent of non-resource GDP (NRGDP)
in 2014 (equivalent to an overall deficit of 1.0 percent of GDP), with a gradual reduction to
2.5 percent of GDP by 2019.4 If such a prudent policy is pursued over the longer term, PNG could
eventually build up net financial wealth of about 20 percent of NRGDP by 2050, providing
considerable resources for macroeconomic stabilization and intergenerational wealth sharing. To
facilitate policy communication, budget documentation could continue to be framed on the basis of
the overall fiscal balance but with policy measures geared toward achieving the underlying NRPB
targets.
9.
To achieve these targets, the bulk of fiscal adjustment will need to come from
expenditure restraint. In the near to medium term,

transferring unused funds stemming from poor

3

Generally speaking, the debt-to-GDP ratio tends to understate PNG’s debt burden due to its large net income
outflows (about 10 percent of GDP).

4

A selected issues paper has been prepared on fiscal adjustment based on a variant of the permanent income
hypothesis.
5

Under PNG’s previous expenditure classification, recurrent expenditure has seen rapid increases over the past two
years. However, with the integration of recurrent and development budgets introduced in 2013 with IMF assistance,
the new classification actually shows only a small increase in recurrent expenditure over the past two years (Table 2).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

10.
Within a more restrained resource envelope, the government should shift its policy
focus towards improving expenditure quality. For 2014, staff advised the postponement of nonessential expenditures in light of an expected revenue shortfall (0.9 percent of GDP) and the recent
spike in long-term government borrowing costs. Over the near to medium term, greater efficiency
of public spending can be achieved through reprioritization of projects to bring planned
infrastructure investments into line with implementation capacity (Appendix 2). The expenditure mix
also needs to be carefully examined to prioritize improvements in the delivery of frontline health
and education services and to allocate sufficient resources for maintenance of existing assets and
other critical recurrent expenditure.
11.
Over the longer term, fiscal space is expected to be created by additional revenue
stemming from an ongoing tax review as well as improved fiscal regimes of extractive
industries. Staff noted that the tax review, which is being undertaken with IMF technical assistance
(TA), presents an important opportunity to improve the efficiency and fairness of the tax system.
Scope also exists to limit income tax holidays for new mining projects given PNG’s comparatively
low collection of extractive industry revenues. Staff also stressed the urgency of conducting mining
industry audits to eliminate potential revenue leakages. Recognition should also be given to the tax
review’s overarching nature in the concurrent reviews of mining and SME policy, with strong
cooperation imperative among relevant agencies. Staff welcomed ongoing efforts to implement IMF
TA recommendations on improving extractive industries fiscal regimes, which so far have focused on
tax progressivity and government equity participation.
12.
Stronger public financial management (PFM) is needed to improve development
outcomes. Progress has been made in operationalizing the Integrated Financial Management
System (IFMS), integrating recurrent and development budgets, and undertaking public expenditure
review and a Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment. Further efforts will
be needed to improve cash management and medium-term budgeting practices, which should help
reduce the use of multiple trust accounts to roll-over project funding. Moreover, debt management
practices will need to be strengthened to minimize funding costs and risks, including through better
fiscal and monetary coordination. Care should be taken in the exercise to lengthen the maturity of
domestic debt in order to reduce rollover risks posed by the government’s heavy reliance on shortterm debt, while being sensitive to long-term borrowing costs. Staff urged that for all governmentcontracted loans, including those obtained via state-owned enterprises (SOEs), established
procedures be observed and the terms and conditions of all loans be published to ensure fiscal
transparency and debt sustainability.
13.
The proposed sovereign wealth fund (SWF) should be brought into operation as soon
as practical. The organic law passed in early 2012 followed the Santiago Principles and established
a sound legislative framework for the SWF. Staff encouraged the authorities to adhere to this
framework in the current review of the legislation. Following protocols set out in the framework,
resource revenue should be channeled through the government’s budget to the greatest extent

possible. At the same time, staff urged strong transparency and governance of the proposed Kumul
Trust, given government plans to channel some resource revenue to this entity.6 Having attained
candidacy for the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) in March 2014, PNG should move
quickly toward full EITI membership to better safeguard public resources.

Authorities’ Views
14.
The authorities agreed that fiscal consolidation will be needed to ensure debt
sustainability.7 They remain committed to achieving legislated debt targets, but noted that
anticipated spending pressures may necessitate a medium-term perspective. The authorities
welcomed staff’s proposal to use the NRPB as the fiscal target while acknowledging the need for
clear communication of fiscal targets. They agreed that capital expenditure implementation needs to
be improved and that priority areas of recurrent expenditure should be protected. For 2014, they will
consider postponement of some lower-priority projects.

B. Monetary, Exchange Rate and Financial Sector Issues
15.
Monetary policy remains accommodative, in the face of weak non-resource activity
and a benign inflation outlook, but policy transmission remains weak given excess liquidity
(Box2). The Bank of PNG (BPNG) raised the cash reserve requirement (CRR) on banks from 9
percent to 10 percent in September 2014. However, to further reduce excess liquidity, staff
recommended that government deposits and trust accounts be moved from commercial banks to
the BPNG and that purchases of government paper by the BPNG at primary auctions be completely
sterilized. A reduction in the liquidity overhang would also help alleviate the depreciation pressure
on the kina by reducing kina supply. Despite a decline in banks’ lending rates, growth of credit to
the private sector slowed and turned negative (y/y) in July 2014, reflecting the weak non-resource
sector. In this environment, the Bank of PNG (BPNG) has kept its policy rate, the Kina Facility Rate
(KFR), unchanged at 6¼ percent since March 2013. Staff recommended that were inflation pressures
to intensify, the BPNG could tighten more aggressively, targeting broad money growth, through
open market operations by issuing additional Central Bank Bills (CBBs) and by further raising the
CRR, as necessary.
16.
However, recent changes in exchange rate policy are likely to exacerbate excess
demand for FX. The foreign exchange market became disorderly in the early part of 2014 when
banks quoted widely diverging rates from the official (interbank) rate in their transactions with
customers. In early June 2014, the BPNG imposed a 150 basis points band on FX buy-sell spreads
around the official rate and require banks to use the band, leading to a de facto kina appreciation of
around 17 percent (Box 3). Staff welcomed the 5-10 basis points depreciation per week

the 2013 staff report.

See Appendix 3 for the authorities’ response to Fund policy advice in the past.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

(6-12 percent per annum) since the introduction of the band, but noted that the pace is insufficient
to meaningfully reduce excess demand for FX, as it incentivizes exporters to delay FX sales while
encouraging importers to demand more FX. Continued FX sales by the BPNG could jeopardize its
foreign reserve position if it is forced to intervene persistently and/or on a large scale.
17.
To mitigate this risk, the kina exchange rate should be allowed to move more quickly
to a market-clearing level. Staff indicated that this could be better achieved if the BPNG
conducted its FX interventions through transparent, competitive auctions rather than through
outright sales, with the resulting exchange rate used as a first approximation of the market-clearing
interbank rate. As market conditions improve, staff noted that the BPNG’s interventions should be
two-sided and aimed only at smoothing short-term volatility. The trading band could also be
removed once steps were taken to increase competition and transparency in the FX retail market in
order to avoid excessive spreads. Such policy intentions should be clearly communicated to the
market. Staff is currently assessing the trading band and tax clearance certificate regime in order to
determine whether they are consistent with PNG’s obligations under Article VIII of the IMF Articles
of Agreement.
18.
Papua New Guinea’s external position is expected to improve over time in line with its
medium-term fundamentals. The exchange rate assessment suggests that the kina is moderately
undervalued and is expected to strengthen over

2015 onward, their current level has limited room
to fall before it becomes inadequate under the de facto crawl-like exchange rate regime effected by
the trading band.
19.
The banking system remains stable, underpinned by strong capital adequacy and
ample liquidity. Banks continue to be profitable and non-performing loans ratios are low (Table 7).
Banks’ high liquidity ratios—with more than half of their assets held in government securities or
cash—partly reflect the structurally low levels of lending. The loan-to-deposit ratio has been

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

consistently below 50 percent, among the lowest in the Pacific Island region. Banks’ direct exposure
to the property sector is limited and their indirect exposure is confined to small liquidity risk arising
from potential withdrawals of deposits by superannuation funds, which have invested heavily in the
property sector. The recent price declines in the high-end property market have had limited impact
on superannuation funds, which have also reduced their exposure to the market.
20.
Papua New Guinea was placed on the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) ‘gray list’ in
early 2014. The authorities have made a high-level political commitment to address anti-money
laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regulatory and operational deficiencies.
They have developed an AML/CFT National Strategic Plan, which is aimed at addressing the action
items within an agreed timeframe with the FATF, with assistance from Australia and the Asian
Development Bank.

Authorities’ Views
21.
The BPNG emphasized their continued commitment to a floating exchange rate
regime. They argued that the trading band was imposed to restore orderly condition in the FX
market by reducing the excessive margins that banks earned on their foreign exchange transactions.
The BPNG dismissed evidence of any increase in excess demand for FX by banks since the
introduction of the trading band and saw the FX market as normalizing under current policies. The
authorities also believed that a slow kina depreciation would help ensure orderly market conditions
in adjusting to FX shortages. To reduce excess liquidity, the BPNG indicated it was actively exploring
options beyond the recent increase in the CRR, including coordinating with the government to move
its deposits to the BPNG.

more efficient use of existing resources will be
needed to realize such gains, including through capacity development, careful evaluation and
planning for investments, and improved expenditure mix to achieve better development outcomes
(Appendix 2). Moreover, to create more jobs and diversify the non-resource sector, PNG should aim
to attract more foreign know-how and capital by easing investor concerns about restrictions on
foreign ownership. While recognizing that the last increase in minimum wages was in 2008, staff

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

noted that the recent large increases could have a negative impact on employment, and that future
increases should take place in a gradual manner in line with productivity improvements. Recent
progress in increasing competition in public utilities and telecommunications has resulted in greater
service coverage and lower prices, an outcome that will not only help improve service delivery for
the poor, but also reduce the cost of doing business. Staff encouraged the authorities to clarify
corporate objectives for SOEs, notably those pertaining to their community services obligations.9
23.
Greater efforts are required to develop the agricultural sector for the benefit of the
vast majority of the population. Within the budget envelope, the strong focus on roads will need
to be maintained given the importance for agricultural products to have access to markets in urban
centers and overseas.10 Staff also noted the need to protect farm crops and property from theft and
welcomed initiatives to expand agricultural extension services. Continued innovations are also being
made in PNG’s drive for financial inclusion, such as rural credit unions/cooperatives targeting
farmers in remote areas. Staff commended rural women’s groups for their active role in capacity
development and social protection at the grassroot levels.

Authorities’ Views
24. The authorities agreed with the need to develop the non-resource sector, as set out in
their Vision 2050. Infrastructure development to support the agricultural sector and rural areas
is also a key part of the Medium-Term Development Plan, but is constrained by limited
implementation capacity as well as resource availability. In addition, they viewed the reform of
poorly performing SOEs as a key priority for improving service delivery and economic efficiency.

D. Statistics
25.
Progress has been made in the production of macroeconomic statistics, but
fundamental reforms are needed for further improvements. Staff welcomed recent data
releases, including the 2011 census data, the household income and expenditure survey, and the
rebased CPI series. However, PNG continues to face challenges in the timely compilation of accurate
macroeconomic statistics, especially data on national accounts, the CPI, and balance of payments.
Strengthening capacity will foremost require a decisive response to institutional weaknesses in the
National Statistics Office (NSO). In this regard, staff welcomed the authorities’ recent initiatives to
reform the NSO and recommended IMF TA in support.

These obligations are related to service delivery on a non-commercial basis and require government subsidies to

Papua New Guinea’s road infrastructure compares unfavorably with most major economies in the Pacific region in
terms of road density and quality. Moreover, only 12 percent of the population has access to electricity.

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

Authorities’ Views
26.
The authorities are firmly committed to statistical improvement. They recognized the
importance of sound macroeconomic statistics for informed policy decisions and Fund surveillance.
The authorities look forward to collaborating with development partners, including the IMF and
Australia, to develop statistical capacity and conduct a review of the NSO, which is expected to
produce an action plan in coming months to be implemented over a three-year period.

STAFF APPRAISAL
27.
Papua New Guinea’s economy is undergoing an important transition. While the
commencement of LNG production will boost overall GDP growth in 2014-15, the slow growth of
the non-resource sector calls for a renewed policy focus on inclusive growth in the post-LNG
construction era. Prudent macroeconomic policies are essential to maintaining debt sustainability
and external and financial stability during the transition.
28.
Following strong government expenditure growth over the past three years, steadfast
fiscal consolidation is now needed to ensure debt sustainability. With modest LNG revenue
expected over the medium term, expenditure restraint will be key to meeting existing government
debt targets and provide an opportunity to align spending levels with absorptive capacity and
improve spending quality.
29.
Better expenditure prioritization and public financial management will be crucial for
improving development outcomes. High priority should be given to implementing high-impact
projects and improving the delivery of frontline health and education services, including through
sufficient allocation of critical recurrent expenditure. Recent progress on strengthening PFM is
welcomed, but greater efforts are needed in improving the management of trust accounts, cash
flows, and public debt, notably transparency in contracting government and SOE loans.
30.
The sovereign wealth fund should be put into operation as soon as practical. The
authorities’ intention to retain the essential features of the original SWF design is welcome, in
particular the strong commitment to ensuring resource revenues are channeled through the budget
to the greatest extent possible. This move would better enable the use of public resources to
achieve development priorities and is consistent with the SWF’s role in macroeconomic stabilization
and wealth sharing.
31.
Greater exchange rate flexibility is needed to safeguard external buffers and eliminate
imbalances in the foreign exchange market. To these ends, the BPNG should allow the exchange
rate to be more market-determined and move quickly to a market-clearing rate through competitive
FX auctions. Over the medium term, PNG’s external position is expected to strengthen on account of
its macroeconomic fundamentals. To improve monetary policy effectiveness, the BPNG should mop
up excess liquidity more fully in the banking system, which would help reduce excess demand for FX
as well as improve monetary policy transmission.

Structural reforms should be accelerated and deepened to create conducive conditions
for broad-based growth. Continued efforts are needed to improve infrastructure, security, and
health and education outcomes, attract more FDI, and accelerate SOE reforms in order to reduce
business costs, create more jobs, and improve service delivery. A revival of agriculture and a
strengthening of the SME sector supported by innovations in financial inclusion will also be vital for
improving the livelihood of the majority of the population.
33.
Notwithstanding the recent progress, determined action is needed to improve
macroeconomic statistics. Some shortcomings in macroeconomic statistics continue to hamper
surveillance and policy making. The authorities’ commitment to reforming the NSO is a strong step
in this direction, with increased IMF TA expected to assist reform efforts and to improve capacity.

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with PNG will be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Box 1. Papua New Guinea: Update on the Mineral Sector
The first liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipment from the PNG LNG project took place in
May 2014, ahead of schedule. The project started in 2010, with a total cost of US$19 billion,
equivalent to 120 percent of 2012 GDP. LNG

production will reach its annual full capacity of
4%
6.9 million tons per annum by 2015, plateauing at
18%
that level for an expected 30 years. This will not only
offset the decline in the country’s matured crude oil
production, but also elevate PNG’s hydrocarbon
sector to a new level. Because of its possible
78%
development cost advantage in the Asia Pacific
region, PNG has potential for new gas projects over
the medium term.
Mining and quarrying
Petroleum and gas
Non-mineral sector
Petroleum output from existing fields has been on a natural decline in recent years as oil
fields mature. Crude oil production commenced in 1991, while the country’s first oil refinery started
operation in 2005. At its peak in 1993, production was close to 130,000 barrels a day, but this has
now fallen to around 28,000 barrels per day, with most now used for domestic refining. Despite the
output decline, Puma Energy Holding’s acquisition this year of Inter Oil’s oil refinery indicates
willingness of foreign investors to continue to operate refining capacity in the PNG market.
On the mining front, aside from the fall in the global prices for gold, copper and silver, a few
legacy mines face operational, environmental and social challenges, which have affected
output. The impact has been particularly pronounced at Ok Tedi, the country’s longest operating
copper and gold mine, which has suffered from

In contrast, a few other mines are expanding processing and production, helping boost
growth in the sector. The Lihir gold and silver mine currently ranks as the world’s third largest gold
producing mine and is a relatively low-cost operation by global standards. After a major expansion
of its processing plant last year, operational capacity is expected to reach one million ounces of gold
per annum. Prior to the LNG Project, the US$2.1 billion Ramu nickel mine represented the single
largest mining investment in PNG in the past decade. The mine is expected to reach full capacity
next year. There are also a number of smaller gold and silver mines that hold considerable promise.

Box 2. Papua New Guinea: The Effects of Excess Liquidity on Monetary Policy Effectiveness
Excess liquidity has accumulated in the financial system as a result of unsterilized purchases of
foreign exchange by the BPNG over the past decade.1 During the period of record-high
commodity prices sizeable export tax receipts were paid to the government in US dollars. These FX
receipts were converted to kina by the BPNG, and the portion of kina revenue which was then
deposited with the commercial banks added to banking system reserves as the BPNG did not
completely sterilize this added liquidity.
The growth in domestic liquidity did not result in excess credit growth or inflation. Excess
reserves added demand for short-dated CBBs and Treasury bills, lowering short-term market interest
rates and driving a wedge between these rates and the KFR policy rate. However while around half of
financial system assets are held in liquid Treasury bills and CBBs, less than half is represented by
loans. Banks attribute this asset composition to the lack of lending opportunities, due to structural
constraints including lack of collateral and limited contract enforceability.
Excess liquidity should be removed to increase the effectiveness of monetary policy. Should a
monetary policy tightening be required in the future, excess liquidity would need to be withdrawn
before the interest rate channel of monetary policy could regain effectiveness. Moreover, large
excess kina reserves raise the risk of a sharp depreciation through the sale of liquid Kina assets when
risk aversion is on.
A number of tools are available for liquidity withdrawal, but an important step will be to
transfer government deposits to the BPNG. While the BPNG can continue to withdraw liquidity
through CBB issuance and increases in the CRR, transfer of government deposits has the added
benefit of improving the government’s cash management (these deposits were around K630 million
at end-September 2013, which exceeds the amount of excess reserves held by banks at end-2013).
As well as contributing to excess liquidity, government deposits held in multiple trust accounts have
resulted in a fragmented system of cash management that reduces transparency and leads to
inefficient use of public resources.

Excess liquidity is defined as bank reserves in excess of required reserves.

Box 3. Papua New Guinea: Exchange Rate Trading Band
Liquidity in PNG’s foreign exchange (FX) market has swung widely in recent years, largely
driven by real sector flows. Between 2010 and 2012, FX supply was abundant due to inflows
associated with the PNG LNG project and strong commodity prices, leading to the rapid appreciation
of the kina. This upswing reversed in 2013, as FDI inflows declined and commodity prices fell and the
kina started to depreciate. The BPNG sought to slow the kina depreciation through its FX sales in the
interbank market, but despite this effort, FX supply continued to tighten over 2013 as major
disruptions to mining operations and cash crop exports reduced FX earnings.
Despite pressures, the official (interbank) rate was held constant from October 2013 to early
June 2014. However, the BPNG’s net FX sales in the interbank market were insufficient to meet the
demand of authorized dealers (mostly banks). As a result, official and market rates diverged,
especially after 2013, as authorized dealers sold the available FX at heavily depreciated rates to their
customers to meet demand. At the same time, the spreads in the retail market widened sharply.
On June 4, 2014 the BPNG imposed a 150 basis point trading band on FX buy-sell spreads of
authorized dealers around the official rate. This forced market exchange rates into line with the
official rate, causing a 17 percent de facto appreciation of the kina vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar at the
time.
Since the introduction of the band, the official rate has depreciated at a rate of 5-10 basis
points per week (6-12 percent per annum) and the BPNG has continued to intervene through
FX sales. Discussions with some exporters suggest that the early June appreciation has reduced their
revenues in kina terms and has at least initially discouraged FX sales by exporters. At the same time,
many importers and other FX users are complaining about increased difficulties in obtaining
adequate amounts of FX at prevailing exchange rates. Banks have also expressed concerns that the
trading band has reduced FX liquidity and added to delays in filling customer orders for FX.

Box 4. Papua New Guinea: External Sector Assessment
The kina has generally been weakening since 2013, as commodity prices softened and capital
inflows associated with the LNG project passed their peak. Between January 2013 and July 2014, the
kina depreciated by 9 percent in nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) terms, 14 percent against the
U.S. dollar, and 4 percent against the Australian dollar. Despite PNG’s higher inflation relative to its
trading partners, the kina depreciated by 7 percent during the same period in real effective exchange rate
(REER) terms, reflecting the large nominal depreciation.
CGER assessments suggest a moderate undervaluation of the kina. The assessment results show a
wide range of 0-21 percent in undervaluation. However, given that (i) most of these results lie in the lower

pressure on the currency in the short term.
4/ Overvaluation is assessed relative to July 2014.

Sensitivity analysis shows the results from the
Macroeconomic Balance (MB) approach are sensitive to some key assumptions. For example, if the
level of commodity export volumes is 20 percent lower than the baseline over the forecast period, the
analysis would indicate an 8 percent overvaluation. While less dramatic, a 20 percent decline in
commodity export prices would result in only marginal overvaluation. Moreover, while maintaining
macroeconomic stability may point to the need for a stronger kina over the medium term, the recent
resource boom has already put considerable pressure on the tradable non-resource sector, suggesting
greater efforts will be needed to improve its competitiveness.

The metrics are based on the specifications in Nkunde Mwase’s IMF Working Paper (WP/12/205). The metric for the
floating regime is 4.7 months of imports, while the one for the fixed regime is 4.9 months of imports. Note that reserve
requirements are reduced by the fact that the mining sector traditionally meets much of its own FX needs, rather than
drawing on official reserves.

1/ As the authorities integrated recurrent and development budgets from 2014, there is discontinuation in the classification.
2/ Discrepancies between the overall balance and financing arise because transactions of trust accounts are not fully accounted for due to data weakness.

Appendix II. Improving the Quality of Public Expenditure
This appendix, prepared by Asian Development Bank and the World Bank staffs, summarizes some
of the key findings on how PNG has managed its public expenditure. These findings suggest that
within the existing resource envelope substantial room exists to improve development outcomes
through better implementation of transport infrastructure projects and more efficient delivery of
health and education services.

A.

Transport Infrastructure

The fiscal expansion undertaken by the PNG government over the last three years has been
heavily focused on transport infrastructure, especially roads. The 2014 Budget appropriated
approximately K1.7 billion for the sector, more than triple the funds allocated in 2011 and a tenfold
increase since 2003. Between 2011 and 2014 the share of budget expenditure allocated to the sector
increased from 4 percent to 12 percent.
Higher funding for transport infrastructure has helped fill financing gaps for a sector that is
vital to enhancing the population’s connectivity to markets and access to essential social
services. However, the scaling up has also amplified existing shortfalls in institutional and technical
capacity. For instance, the Department of Works and Implementation (DWI), which is responsible for
approximately 85 percent of the Government’s 2014 land transport program, disbursed just
52 percent of its original development budget appropriation in 2013 and 38 percent in 2012. While
particularly evident in complex infrastructure projects, which require detailed preparation and
supervision, fiscal expansion has amplified project implementation challenges across the public
sector.

Limited technical and institutional capacities are a major cause of implementation challenges
but other factors also contribute. A lack of alignment between sector agency budget submissions
and the final Cabinet-approved budget has often required agencies to hurriedly prepare and
implement unfamiliar projects. Further, limited feasibility and design work before projects are
financed have frequently led to unrealistic cost estimates, tendering delays, and difficulties in
attracting sufficient private-sector construction capacity.

34

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

Amplifying these challenges has also been an emphasis on funding new capital projects, with
lower priority given to operational and maintenance costs. Between 2009 and 2014, the
proportion of recurrent to total budget allocations fell from 60 percent to 51 percent. Again, this
trend is particularly evident in the transport sector, with recurrent spending comprising just
11 percent of DWI’s expenditure in 2014, down from 33 percent in 2011. This has limited the ability
of sector agencies to expand their human resources in response to growing investment demands,
and jeopardizes the sustainability of investments by limiting routine maintenance.
To address implementation challenges, a period of more moderate funding growth for the
transport sector may be appropriate. This would give sector agencies a chance to ‘catch up’ with
their investment backlog and to focus on building the technical and institutional capacity required
to deliver cost effective and sustainable infrastructure. Efforts by the government to strengthen
infrastructure planning and budgeting should also be supported. This includes ongoing work to
integrate the recurrent and development budgets as a means of reducing the bias towards new
capital investment, as well as efforts to publish accurate five-year forward spending estimates to
strengthen project preparation and planning.

B.

Health and Education

Public expenditure on education has increased substantially over the last decade and is now
closer to international benchmarks, although PNG still lags its peers on performance
indicators such as literacy rates. The growth in the education budget over recent years has been
driven mainly by the expansion of the tuition fee-free subsidies, which are a key component of the
government’s plan to provide universal access to basic education. These subsidies have led to rapid
increases in enrolment rates, which have been accompanied by progress toward reducing
educational imbalances between rural and urban areas and between girls and boys.
However, it appears that growth in total education spending has not kept pace with the rapid
rise in enrolments, highlighting the importance of improving the composition of spending.
Pupil-teacher ratios have risen in most provinces. At the same time, significant discrepancies
between budget appropriations and actual spending have appeared in recent years, with persistent
underspending of recurrent budgets allocated for teacher training coinciding with repeated years of
overspending on school subsidies. Moreover, some budgeted allocations to capital spending have
been overly ambitious given supply-side constraints, with the National Department of Education
(NDE)’s ‘development’ expenditures averaging only around two-thirds of the amount initially
appropriated. Unspent funds are typically transferred to trust accounts and are not easily redirected
to cover recurrent spending needs.
While recent gains in access to education are welcome, equal attention now needs to be
devoted to improving quality. The NDE has made some progress, implementing regular school
performance assessments, investing in updated curricula, and undertaking evaluations of student
learning in early grades. But further efforts will be needed to ensure that teacher training and
deployment keep pace with student enrolments, and that other important recurrent expenditures
(such as classroom materials and books) receive sufficient priority.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

35

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

The government has also increased its spending on health in recent years, although access to
quality health services remains limited. Rates of infant and maternal mortality in PNG are high
compared with other countries at similar levels of income, and health service contact rates remain
relatively low. More funds have been allocated to frontline service providers recently, and the
government has also committed to provide free primary health care and subsidized specialist health
care. However, provincial health spending remains only a fraction of the cost of essential service
delivery in some cases. Moreover, delays in transferring funds from central and provincial
governments mean that in some provinces health function grants fail to reach service providers in a
timely fashion, and hence in these provinces prohibiting user fees may in fact undermine service
delivery.
Efficiency savings can be realized by allocating more resources to primary care, reviewing the
mix of spending on inputs, reforming the procurement and distribution of medical supplies,
and implementing improvements in planning and budgeting. Hospital services currently
account for a disproportionate share of total health spending, even though they are less costeffective than primary care services in many cases. Other aspects of the expenditure mix could also
be reviewed: personnel emoluments have risen to over half of total health expenditure, while budget
provisions for the maintenance of buildings and equipment have at times proven inadequate.
Strengthening public financial management – including by reducing fragmentation in the financing
system and clarifying accountabilities and reporting arrangements – would be an important step
toward reducing leakages and ensuring that allocated funds reach service providers more quickly.

Appendix III. Papua New Guinea: Authorities’ Responses to Fund
Advice
Fund Recommendation

Monetary, Financial, and Exchange Rate
Policies

 Enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy,
with the BPNG taking more aggressive steps
to remove excess liquidity, including through
open market operations, increasing the CRR,
and moving government deposits from
commercial banks to the BPNG.

Policy Actions

Excess liquidity remains sizable, but the BPNG is actively
considering options to withdraw liquidity and discussing
specific measures for implementation. Meanwhile, the CRR
was increased from 9 percent to 10 percent in September
2014.

 Maintain a floating exchange rate regime to
help absorb external shocks.

The official interbank exchange rate remained unchanged
from October 2013 to early June 2014, even though banks
transacted with their customers at more depreciated rates.
The BPNG subsequently introduced a band on FX trading
spreads around the interbank rate, leading to a large de
facto kina appreciation. The interbank rate has since been
depreciating slowly, but FX shortages have persisted.

 Continue to monitor the impact of price
corrections in the heated segments of the real
estate sector buoyed by the LNG project.
Macroprudential policies need to be
considered and stress tests should be
conducted regularly.

The BPNG has been monitoring the exposure of
superannuation funds and banks to the property sector.
Work is underway to establish a separate macroprudential
unit within the BPNG and to improve macroprudential data.

 Implement FATF AML/CFT recommendations.

Following the placement of PNG on the FATF “gray-list” in
early 2014, the authorities have developed an AML/CFT
National Strategic Plan aimed at addressing the action
items within an agreed timeframe with the FATF.

Fiscal Policy

 Adopt a fiscal policy stance consistent with
keeping public debt in line with the
government’s targets and ensuring debt
sustainability. The government should also
pay greater attention to improving the quality
of spending.

The authorities remain committed to achieving legislated
debt targets, but continued fiscal expansion has led to
estimated debt levels above the targets. Progress has been
made in operationalizing the IFMS, integrating recurrent
and development budgets, public expenditure reviews, and
the PEFA assessment.

 Devote greater efforts to revenue collection,
especially through in improving tax
compliance and rationalizing tax exemptions
and concessions.

A series of measures were announced in the 2014 budget,
and revenue administration has improved. Audits of
extractive industries have been initiated and a
comprehensive tax review is under way.

 Safeguard the integrity of the SWF for it to
play a key role in managing PNG’s resource
revenues.

The revision of the SWF law is under way and the SWF is
expected to be operational in 2015. The authorities have
indicated that they intend to follow sound principles in
amending the legislation.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By
David Cowen and Ranil
Salgado (IMF)
Satu Kahkonen (IDA)

Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
and the International Development Association (IDA)1

This Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) indicates that Papua New Guinea’s (PNG) risk of
debt distress remains low based on an assessment of public and publicly-guaranteed
(PPG) external debt, in line with the results of the DSA for the 2013 Article IV
consultation.2 However, factoring in public domestic and private external debt and
contingent liabilities, the overall risk of debt distress has risen since then, and a failure to
consolidate the fiscal position would result in unsustainable debt dynamics. Data on debt
and other liabilities, particularly off-budget and public enterprise debt, need much
improvement.

This DSA was prepared jointly with the World Bank, in accordance with the Debt Sustainability Framework for
low-income countries approved by the Executive Boards of the IMF and the IDA.

Papua New Guinea is rated as a medium performer for its policies and institutions for the purposes of the
IMF-World Bank low-income country DSA framework.

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

BACKGROUND
1.
Papua New Guinea’s (PNG) public and external debt burdens have fallen significantly
over the past decade. Public debt declined from 62 percent of GDP at end-2004 to about
22 percent of GDP in 2011, but rose to around 34 percent in 2013.3 Public and publicly guaranteed
(PPG) external debt also declined sharply, from a peak of over 50 percent of GDP in 2001 to around
9 percent in 2013. Around 70 percent of current public external debt is owed to the Asian
Development Bank and the World Bank. Domestic debt consists of treasury bills (45 percent) and
inscribed stocks (55 percent) with an average maturity of 5 years. The main creditors are resident
banks and superannuation funds.

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
2.
Over the medium term, PNG’s growth prospects and current account will be heavily
influenced by its extractive sector. Box 1 summarizes the medium-term macroeconomic
framework underlying this DSA update. Economic activity is projected to continue to expand
in 2014, with real GDP expected to grow at 5.8 percent in 2014 and 19.6 percent in 2015 when LNG
production reaches full capacity. The current account deficit narrowed in 2013 due to the winding
down of the construction of the LNG project. With LNG exports now coming on stream, the deficit is
expected to continue to decline in 2014 and turn into a surplus in 2015.

EXTERNAL DSA
3.
The baseline scenario indicates that all PPG external debt ratios stay well below the
indicative thresholds. The present value (PV) of the external debt stock is expected to rise in the
near term because of an A$1.2 billion loan (6.8 percent of GDP) that government took in early 2014,
but fall over the medium term as this loan is repaid and with the expectation that new external
borrowing will be moderate.4 Thereafter, the debt stock remains flat over time (Figure 1). The public
external debt service ratios follow a similar profile, with higher debt service initially rising as a result
of this loan but subsequently falling to very low levels, reflecting PNG’s relatively small external debt
stock as well as the fact that most of its public external debt is highly concessional.

3

Gross national income (GNI) may be a better indicator to normalize PNG’s debt burden, given large net outflows of
primary income from the country’s resource sector. In 2013, public debt was 38 percent of GNI, compared to
34 percent of GDP. However, the use of GNI throughout this DSA does not qualitatively change the results reported
here.

4

The government contracted this loan from the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) in March 2014 to finance the
purchase of a 10 percent stake in the Oil Search Limited, an oil and gas exploration company. The terms and
conditions of this loan have not been disclosed. For the purpose of this DSA, staff has assumed a two-year loan
maturity with 8 percent annual interest for the time being and included it as part of publicly guaranteed external
debt—the same as the government’s own accounting. Meanwhile, Abu Dhabi’s International Petroleum Investment
Company (IPIC) turned its A$1.68 billion convertible bond holding into shareholding in Oil Search in March, 2014.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

4.
Papua New Guinea is vulnerable to certain extreme shocks despite the currently low
external debt burden, but these shocks have a low probability of materializing. There is a
protracted breach of the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio under the historical and extreme exports shock
scenarios and a breach of the PV of public external debt-to-exports ratio under the extreme exports
shock scenario.5 All of these scenarios would be tantamount to a major delay or complete failure of
the LNG project. In the historical scenario, for instance, when the current account deficit is fixed at
the ten-year average of 2004–13, the simulation effectively keeps imports at levels elevated by the
LNG project and rules out the expected large increases in LNG exports going forward. Given that
LNG production has already commenced, such an outcome is very unlikely. In a scenario in which
LNG production is assumed to be 50 percent lower than the baseline over the medium term (the
“LNG shock" scenario), the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio would fall more slowly over time but the debt
burden would remain sustainable. While PNG’s current account balance is volatile because of its
dependence on commodity exports, the large current account deficits in recent years have been
exceptional because of the large imports required for the construction of the LNG project. Given
this, stress tests based on the recent current account deficits and volatility tend to overstate the risk
of debt distress.

PUBLIC DSA
5.
The public debt dynamics for PNG remains stable, but there are risks to this outlook.6
The public debt burden is expected to decline continuously over the projection period under the
baseline, namely if the government follows through with fiscal consolidation as committed under its
Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy (Figure 2). A shock to reduce LNG production by 50 percent over the
medium term would slow the decline of the debt burden and keep it at a higher level, but the debt
dynamics remains sustainable. However, a failure to consolidate the fiscal position would result in an
unsustainable debt burden. There are also risks arising from superannuation arrears and public
enterprise liabilities. The former are estimated to be about 6½ percent of GDP at end-2013 and the
latter about 7½ of GDP, although data on public enterprise liabilities are incomplete and not up to
date. Once these liabilities and contingent liabilities are taken into account, there would be a
noticeable increase in the public debt burden over the medium term, as shown in the customized
scenario (“All other liabilities included”) for the public DSA.7

5

These breaches are larger than shown in the previous DSA largely because revised data show higher trade volatility,
which results in larger shocks applied to the analysis based on historical data.

6

Public debt includes domestic central government debt and external public and publicly guaranteed debt.

7

This scenario assumes that the full amount of superannuation arrears is added to the debt stock, and 100 percent
of SOEs debt is realized to become actual liabilities and added to the debt stock. The SOEs debt stock is assumed to
grow in line with nominal GDP.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS
6.
The authorities agreed with the DSA findings, noting that the current risk of debt
distress is low, but fiscal consolidation is crucial for debt sustainability. The authorities remain
committed to achieving the legislated debt targets. They also recognized the importance of more
comprehensive data on debt and other liabilities, in particular, off-budget and public enterprise
debt, in assessing PNG’s overall debt burdens.

CONCLUSION
7.
Papua New Guinea’s PPG external debt remains at low risk of debt stress. However, the
overall risk of public debt distress has increased, given the rising stock of public domestic debt in
recent years. Contingent and non-contingent liabilities significantly increase the public debt burden,
and a failure to consolidate the fiscal position would result in unsustainable debt dynamics. The
government needs to adhere to its existing debt targets while focusing on improving spending
quality to make the most out of a restrained resource envelope in meeting the country’s
development needs.
Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions Underlying the DSA Update
Macroeconomic assumptions for this DSA are generally more conservative than those for the
previous DSA. In particular, projections of GDP growth and inflation are somewhat lower than
those for the 2013 DSA, as are projections of the long-term external current account balance. This
largely reflects a less favorable outlook for the resource sector owing to forecasts of lower
commodity prices and volumes.

4



Real GDP growth is projected at 7 percent on average over the medium term (reflecting
the boost of LNG production), and to slow to 3 percent in the long run.



Inflation is expected to stabilize at about 5 percent over the medium and long term.



The current account (including grants) will remain in deficit until 2014, primarily reflecting
the strong import growth related to the construction phase of the LNG project. It is
expected to turn into a surplus in 2015 as LNG production and exports increase and
imports related to the LNG project wind down. The surplus is projected to be 6 percent of
GDP on average during 2015–25.



The grant element of loans (excluding the UBS loan) is expected to decline gradually. As per
capita income rises, the share of external financing provided on concessional terms is expected to
decline over the projection period.



The primary fiscal balance is estimated to be in deficit of 5.4 percent of GDP in 2014.
During the current medium-term fiscal strategy period (2013–2017), a continuous primary
deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP on average is expected. The primary fiscal balance is
projected to turn into surplus in 2021, averaging 0.5 percent of GDP during 2021–34.

3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after
the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Safeguards Assessments
Under the Fund's Safeguards Assessments policy, the Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) was subject
to a transitional assessment based on its Stand-By Arrangement with the Fund, which was approved
in March 2000 and expired in September 2001. The transitional assessment was completed on
May 4, 2001 and recommendations were made to alleviate identified weaknesses. Currently, the
BPNG is not subject to the Safeguards Assessments policy.
Exchange Rate Arrangement
Papua New Guinea’s de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. From April 2014, the Kina has
reduced its volatility and followed a trend within a 2 percent band against the U.S. dollar.
Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to a crawl-like arrangement,
effective April 11, 2014. Papua New Guinea has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3,
and 4. Staff is currently assessing the trading band and tax clearance certificate regime in order to
determine whether they are consistent with PNG’s obligations under Article VIII of the IMF Articles of
Agreement.
Article IV Consultations
The 2013 Article IV consultation discussions were held during August 20–September 3, 2013. It was
concluded by the Executive Board on November 11, 2013 (IMF Country Report No. 13/339). Papua
New Guinea is on the 12–month cycle.
Technical Assistance from Headquarters
FAD: A joint FAD/PFTAC mission in March 2000 assisted the authorities in preparing a Report on the
Observance of Standards and Codes Fiscal Transparency Module, published in October 2000. A
mission in December 2000 provided advice on the reconciliation of large and volatile differences in
fiscal reporting based on information provided by the Treasury Department and information
reported by the Bank of Papua New Guinea. A mission in February 2002 assessed progress in
improving fiscal transparency. A joint FAD/PFTAC mission visited PNG to provide advice on the
sovereign wealth fund management in May 2011. A mission in March 2013 provided advice on
reform of the extractive industries fiscal regime.
LEG: A mission in November 2005 provided advice on the drafting of a tax administration law. A
mission in July 2006 provided a comprehensive program of assistance in the development of the
AML/CFT regime, including legislative drafting and capacity building. A mission in AugustSeptember 2007 assisted the authorities in finalizing the terms of the Revenue Administration Bill.
MFD/MCM: Technical assistance through peripatetic visits was delivered on bank regulation and
supervision (2001, February–March 2007, July–August 2009, and February 2010), medium-term
monetary policy formulation (October 2004 and September 2005), reserve management (June 2006,
September 2007, March/July–August 2009, January–February 2010), internal audits (2004,
August 2007), accounting (September–October 2006, February 2007, February–March/June–
July/November 2009), liquidity management (January 2009), monetary and forex operations (July–

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

August 2009, February 2010), macroprudential oversight and financial stability (September 2012),
and the sovereign wealth fund (July 2013).
STA: A mission reviewed monetary and financial statistics in April 2005 and a follow-up mission took
place in May 2006. Subsequently, a multisector statistics mission visited in September 2006 followed
by a high-level STA visit in December 2007. Two follow-up missions in balance of payments took
place in June 2008 and November 2009 and three follow-up missions in monetary and financial
statistics took place in April 2008, November 2009, and May 2010. In 2012, three missions provided
advice on GDDS metadata, government finance statistics, and the balance of payments. In MayJune 2013 and February 2014, missions reviewed balance of payments and the international
investment position. To support migration to GFSM 2001, three missions have provided training and
assistance in May 2013, October 2013, and April–May 2014. A joint mission with the Australian
Bureau of Statistics discussed statistical capacity building and in particular reform of the National
Statistical Office in July-August 2014.
Resident Representative:
The Regional Resident Representative Office for Pacific Island Countries based in Suva, Fiji was
opened on September 13, 2010 and the office covers Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Palau,
Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. Mr. Tubagus
Feridhanusetyawan is the current resident representative.

RELATIONS WITH THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE CENTRE
(As of September 2014)
The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) in Suva, Fiji, is a regional technical
assistance institution operated by the IMF with financial support of the Asian Development Bank,
Australia, Korea, the European Union, and New Zealand. The Center’s aim is to build skills and
institutional capacity for effective economic and financial management that can be sustained at the
national level. Member countries are: Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati,
Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste,
Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

A. Public Financial Management
The PFTAC assisted in the preparation of a ROSC, which was published in October 2000. The PFTAC
PFM Advisor has participated in occasional FAD technical assistance missions, and an attachment of
one PNG official to PFTAC was completed in April 2007. PNG participated, with four officials, in the
U.S. Treasury study visit in September 2008. In May 2011, the PFTAC macroeconomic advisor
participated in an FAD mission on advising PNG on the SWF. In July 2013, a PFTAC PFM Advisor
visited PNG at the request of the Treasury Minister to review the budget preparation process, and
discuss with authorities plans for training in the PEFA methodology. In May-June 2014, PFTAC
provided information, communication, and technology (ICT) assessment mission and recommended
comprehensive reform strategy to better support of operation of the Department of Finance.

B. Tax Administration and Policy
PNG is supported by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and has a number of long-term in-country
ATO advisers. The Internal Revenue Commission (IRC) has additional support under the ATO / IRC
twinning program and several other internationally and locally funded international advisers. IMF HQ
has provided strategic advice to the IRC in the Natural Resources area and support will continue in
this area should the authorities wish to undertake reform. PNG will be encouraged to take a
stronger role in supporting regional tax reform and sharing training opportunities provided by the
ATO with fellow PIC tax administrators.

C. Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision.
There is no current PFTAC involvement in this area. In October 2005, the BPNG hosted the annual
meeting of the Association of Financial Supervisors of Pacific Countries, for which PFTAC is the
secretariat. In March 2007, PFTAC funded an attachment for two supervisors from the Bank of Papua
New Guinea to assist the Cook Islands’ supervisory authority to undertake an on-site examination of
a domestic bank. In 2008, PFTAC funded an attachment of one supervisor to assist the Reserve Bank
of Fiji under an on-site examination of a local branch of a PNG-based bank.

D. Economic and Financial Statistics
In February 2006, an Advisor briefly assessed the BOP compilation with a view to improving its
quality, and to assessing progress with regard to recommendations made by previous missions. A
multisector statistics mission in September 2006 assessed the statistical systems (BOP, national
accounts, prices statistics, government finance statistics, and monetary statistics), with the PFTAC
Advisor assessing the national accounts and providing overall coordination. In 2008 and 2009 the
Advisor undertook BOP statistics missions to review statistics prerequisites, progress in improving
compilation methods and source data, as well as to assist BPNG statistics staff in assessing the
feasibility of electronic data collection. In 2013 and 2014, a PFTAC Advisor has provided assistance
three times to the BPNG and the Department of Treasury to improve the methodologies and data
sources used for the compilation of national accounts statistics.

E. Macroeconomic Analysis
Following a request by the BPNG for assistance in building up financial programming capacity,
starting in 2011 a PFTAC work program together with BPNG staff created a number of tools such as
empirical output gap measures and inflation models as inputs into a financial programming
framework, followed by the development of a PNG-specific financial programming framework
in 2012 and 2013. Training in the use and updating of the framework was provided to staffs of both
BPNG and the Department of Treasury, most recently in August 2013. Staffs from both institutions
also benefited from training in financial programming techniques provided jointly by PFTAC and the
Singapore Regional Training Institute during a regional workshop in Fiji in December 2012. A
separate work program with the Department of Treasury and BPNG developed in collaboration with
the APD country team and the IMF’s Research Department modeling tools for exploring the
macroeconomic impact of the surge in natural resource revenues that is expected as the LNG project
enters into production. Two workshops for rolling out the resulting model and providing training in
its use were held in 2011 and 2012 respectively. Results were shared with a broader public through a
seminar organized by a local research institute in 2013.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of August 31, 2014)
Papua New Guinea (PNG) joined the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) in 1971. The AsDB has
approved 79 loans to PNG totaling $1,943.5 million for 56 projects, of which 35 loans
($1.030.1million) have been extended from Ordinary Capital Resources (OCR) and 49 loans
($890.3 million) from the Asian Development Fund (ADF). ADF resources were also used for one
grant amounting to $15 million. In addition, $63.4 million has been provided for 149 technical
assistance projects. AsDB lending to PNG has increased substantially since 2007, and ADB is now
PNG’s second-largest development partner. ADB’s active portfolio totals $1.1 billion, including 22
ongoing loans for 11 projects; 8 grants, including 1 Asian Development Fund (ADF) grant project; 9
technical assistance projects; and2 private sector loan and equity operations.
In August 2010, the AsDB and the Government of PNG agreed on a new country partnership
strategy, 2011–2015. The strategy was developed in close consultation with the government and
other stakeholders, and is well aligned to the government’s Development Strategic Plan (DSP), 2010–
2030 and the Medium-Term Development Plan, 2011–2015. It centers on infrastructure
improvements and other measures to help PNG plan and implement a successful transition through
the conversion of its natural resources wealth into inclusive economic growth.
In 2013, ADB approved a $109 million second tranche of funding for the $400 million Highlands
Region Road Improvement Investment Program. AsDB is financing the reconstruction of 115
kilometers (km) of national roads in the highlands region, which is expected to reduce travel time by
25 percent from communities to service delivery points in PNG’s most populous rural region. AsDB
also approved $130 million in second tranche funding for the $480 million Civil Aviation
Development Investment Program, which will support safe, reliable, sustainable, and affordable
aviation services, and improve the mobility of communities.
The ongoing redevelopment of Lae Port will increase the efficiency of the port system and allow for
an estimated 300 additional ship calls per year. The AsDB-funded Town Electrification Investment
Program and Port Moresby Power Grid Development project will support development of clean,
renewable energy through construction and rehabilitation of hydropower generation.
The AsDB’s lending to PNG for 2015–2017 is expected to remain a blend of OCR and ADF resources.
The AsDB's ADF allocation for PNG for 2015–2017 totals approximately $146 million and OCR
lending is expected to be approximately $508 million. Indicative Nonlending assistance for 2013–
2015 totals $3.2 million.
Creating a conducive environment for private sector development is also a strategic priority. The
AsDB’s Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative (PSDI) is currently working with the Government
of PNG to (i) expand access to finance through branchless banking and the implementation of a
secured transactions framework; (ii) increase the efficiency of services provided by state-owned
enterprises through performance benchmarking, policy reforms, capacity building and advocacy; (iii)
promote greater use of public private partnerships (PPPs) through the development of a legal

framework and associated institutions; and (iv) support the assessment of PPP opportunities for
major infrastructure projects. PSDI has recently been funded for a further six years of operation and
will be expanding its work areas including business law reform, promotion of competition, and
economic empowerment of women.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
PAPUA NEW GUINEA — STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
As of October 20, 2014
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Most affected
areas are: national accounts, fiscal accounts, and balance of payments.
National Accounts: The accuracy and reliability of the statistics are affected by inadequate source data.
The most recent official national accounts statistics were published by the National Statistical Office (NSO)
for National Income, Expenditure and Product, for reference years 1993–98. These estimates were compiled
using the System of National Accounts 1968 (1968 SNA). Subsequently, a preliminary set of national
accounts (NA) estimates using the 1993 SNA for 1994–2004, rebased to 1998 prices, was compiled.
However, as these estimates were still in need of substantial improvements, the 2006 STA multisector
mission recommended against publication of the new GDP statistics until the needed revisions were made.
No further data have been provided by the NSO to STA since that time. In an attempt to fill the vacuum,
the Treasury Department began estimating the NA since reference year 2002. The Bank of Papua New
Guinea also compiles, but does not publish, its own estimates of GDP. Since August 2013, technical
assistance missions have been conducted by PFTAC to start reviewing the methodologies and the data
sources used to compile the national accounts statistics. These missions identified some shortcomings. In
the short term, PFTAC will provide technical assistance (TA) to strengthen capacities and improve
cooperation between compiling organizations. Reforming the NSO will be necessary to resume regular
data collection and compilation of national accounts statistics by the official agency.
Price Statistics: The NSO currently compiles a quarterly wholesale price index (WPI) (which it does not
publish) and a quarterly consumer price index (CPI). In May 2014, the NSO began to publish a new CPI
series based on the data from the 2009-10 Household Income Expenditure Survey, ending 35 years of
the CPI using a consumption basket from the late 1970s.
Government Finance Statistics: Annual government finance statistics (GFS) have not been reported to STA
since 2002. Data received to that point in time suffered from insufficient coverage and timeliness. Central
government tax revenue, nontax revenue, and public expenditure data are deficient. Development budget
expenditures and the utilization of grants and project loans are recorded with long lags, and few records
on the use of trust accounts are available. Tax revenues collected by authorities (extra-budgetary units) are
generally not reflected in the central government’s financial information; this includes the portion of valueadded tax directly transferred to provinces by the revenue agency. While interest payment records are
accurate, there are timing issues regarding the recording of interest on discounted securities. These
weaknesses contribute to discrepancies in domestic financing between estimates from monetary and debt
data and those derived from fiscal records. Currently the Papua New Guinea Government is preparing to
migrate to Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014 (GFSM 2014), with a goal of using this methodology
for budget estimate and outturn presentations in the future. For the migration, the authorities are
participating in the Japan Administered Account (JSA)-funded three-year regional GFS capacity-building
project since 2013.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

Monetary and Financial Statistics: Monetary data are now being produced and reported to STA on a
regular basis. Progress has been achieved by the Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) in many areas in the
collection, compilation, and dissemination of monetary and financial statistics (MFS), leading to the
introduction of the standardized report form (SRF) for the central bank, other depository corporations
(ODCs), and the other financial corporations (OFCs). The 2013 mission introduced general insurance
companies in the institutional coverage of OFCs and an improved SRF for OFCs. Most of the monetary
statistics published in International Financial Statistics (IFS) are currently aligned with the Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM).
Financial sector surveillance: In the area of financial soundness indicators (FSIs), the BPNG has compiled
selected FSIs for deposit takers to support the financial sector assessment. Papua New Guinea is
participating in a three-year (FY2014–FY2016) TA project on FSIs for selected AFR and APD countries funded
by the Government of Japan and is expected to submit FSI data and metadata to STA for posting on the
IMF’s FSI website well before the end of the project.
External Sector Statistics: Annual balance of payments data are derived from the International
Transactions Reporting System (ITRS), which is not tightly monitored despite the BPNG reporting
requirements. There are marked differences between the official data on exports and imports of goods and
those reported by trading partners. The financial accounts data are of poor quality because of major
deficiencies in data collection, especially in the area of private external debt and foreign direct investment.
Quarterly data are also published by the BPNG. Progress is being made in implementing the
recommendations from the PFTAC’s BOP missions in June 2008 and November 2009. PNG has been one of
the beneficiaries of the JSA Project on the improvement of external sector statistics (ESS). Under this
project, two TA missions were provided to improve BOP and international investment position (IIP)
statistics in May-June 2013 and February 2014. These missions made recommendations to improve ESS
compilation framework. The BPNG is largely under-equipped in terms of capacity and collection framework
vis-à-vis the volumes and nature of transactions and positions with nonresidents. Little progress has been
made regarding the implementation of the missions’ recommendations; and overall improvements in the
quality of ESS have been very modest.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Papua New Guinea began to participate in the
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) in 2012.
III. Reporting to STA
Papua New Guinea last reported GFS for publication in Government Finance Statistics Yearbook and IFS for
1999–2002, covering only the budgetary central government. Monetary data are reported to STA for
publication in IFS on a regular monthly basis. BOP data for 2010 were reported to STA for publication in
Balance of Payments Yearbook and IFS. National accounts data for 2004 were reported to STA for publication
in IFS.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION—
November 19, 2014

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Prepared By

Asia and Pacific Department

1.
On November 18, 2014, the Government of Papua New Guinea (PNG)
tabled the 2015 National Budget and a 2014 supplementary budget in
Parliament. Highlights are as follows: The projected fiscal deficit in 2014, at
5.9 percent of GDP, is expected to be 1.3 percentage points of GDP lower than the
staff’s projection (Table 1). Government revenues have been buoyed by higher-thanexpected growth stemming from new liquefied natural gas (LNG) production. The
debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to breach slightly the 35 percent of GDP ceiling in 2014,
but would be lower than staff’s projection.
2.
Meanwhile, the proposed 2015 budget is more expansionary than
expected, with an overall deficit at 4.4 percent of GDP, compared with the
2.5 percent of GDP in the staff report. The debt to GDP ratio is projected to decline
to 27.8 percent in 2015 (lower than the staff report’s projection of 31 percent), with offbudget receipts from the sale of landowners’ equity in the LNG project to be used to
retire debt. This trajectory is consistent with the government’s Medium-Term Fiscal
Strategy, which aims to reduce government debt to below 30 percent of GDP over the
medium term. The 2015 budget and the medium-term strategy continue to give
priority to key development “enablers” including infrastructure, education, health, and
law and order.
3.
The government envisages further fiscal consolidation beyond 2015, with
a deficit target of 2.5 percent of GDP for 2016 and a balanced budget for 2017-19.
Underpinning this more ambitious consolidation than envisaged by staff are further
expenditure prioritization and the planned strengthening of the tax regime.
4.
The proposed 2015 budget does not change the staff assessment as
reported in the staff report.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Papua New Guinea
On November 21, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Papua New Guinea, and considered and endorsed the
staff appraisal without a meeting on lapse-of-time basis.2
Papua New Guinea’s economy is experiencing an important transition, which presents major
challenges in the near term to maintaining macro-financial stability, but also important
opportunities if managed properly. In the face of a winding down of large liquefied natural gas
(LNG) project construction, the government has embarked on a large fiscal expansion starting
in 2013 to accelerate development and cushion the non-resource economy. However, this policy
shift has significantly reduced the country’s fiscal space and led to an increase in government
debt, likely to exceed legislated targets by end 2014.
With LNG production and exports now starting, resource sector growth is projected to surge
in 2015, but spillovers to the rest of the economy may be more limited. Inflation has moderated
from its peaks during the construction boom and is likely to remain reasonably low given the
global outlook for commodity prices. Meanwhile, the external current account deficit has fallen
significantly since 2013, as imports related to the LNG project passed their peak. With LNG
exports now coming on stream, the current account deficit is expected to narrow further in 2014
and turn into a surplus in 2015. Nevertheless, lower commodity prices, weaker mining output,

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

and a reduction in LNG project-related capital inflows have led to depreciation pressure on the
kina since mid-2013. In early June 2014 the Bank of PNG (BPNG) introduced measures to
require authorized dealers to conduct transactions within a trading band of 150 basis points
around the official (interbank) exchange rate. This move caused a large de facto currency
appreciation. Since then, the Kina has been depreciating at the rate of 5-10 basis points per week.
Risks to economic growth are increasingly tilted toward the downside. Weaker-than-expected
growth of the global economy could weigh on external demand and commodity prices. Over the
longer term, LNG and shale gas developments around the world could reduce LNG prices and
government revenue. This might also have implications for future inflows of foreign direct
investment. Domestically, lower growth could weigh on property valuations. On the upside,
potential exists for a second LNG project and new mining operations in the near to medium term.
The ongoing economic transition calls for adjustment of macroeconomic policies to safeguard
macro-financial stability. Foremost, fiscal consolidation, anchored by government’s existing debt
targets, would help achieve this objective. Meanwhile, better expenditure prioritization could
improve development outcomes. Greater exchange rate flexibility is needed to cushion the
country’s economy from shocks during the transition, while more complete withdrawal of
banking system excess liquidity would help strengthen monetary policy transmission and
alleviate the downward pressure on the kina. These macroeconomic policy measures should be
supported by faster, deeper structural reforms to create an enabling environment for sustained,
inclusive growth.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2014 Article IV consultation with Papua New Guinea, Executive Directors
endorsed the staff’s appraisal as follows:
Papua New Guinea’s economy is undergoing an important transition. While the commencement
of LNG production will boost overall GDP growth in 2014-15, the slow growth of the nonresource sector calls for a renewed policy focus on inclusive growth in the post-LNG
construction era. Prudent macroeconomic policies are essential to maintaining debt sustainability
and external and financial stability during the transition.
Following strong government expenditure growth over the past three years, steadfast fiscal
consolidation is now needed to ensure debt sustainability. With modest LNG revenue expected

3
over the medium term, expenditure restraint will be key to meeting existing government debt
targets and provide an opportunity to align spending levels with absorptive capacity and improve
spending quality.
Better expenditure prioritization and public financial management will be crucial for improving
development outcomes. High priority should be given to implementing high-impact projects and
improving the delivery of frontline health and education services, including through sufficient
allocation of critical recurrent expenditure. Recent progress on strengthening public financial
management (PFM) is welcomed, but greater efforts are needed in improving the management of
trust accounts, cash flows, and public debt, notably transparency in contracting government and
State Owned Enterprises (SOE) loans.
The sovereign wealth fund (SWF) should be put into operation as soon as practical. The
authorities’ intention to retain the essential features of the original SWF design is welcome, in
particular the strong commitment to ensuring resource revenues are channeled through the
budget to the greatest extent possible. This move would better enable the use of public resources
to achieve development priorities and is consistent with the SWF’s role in macroeconomic
stabilization and wealth sharing.
Greater exchange rate flexibility is needed to safeguard external buffers and eliminate
imbalances in the foreign exchange market. To these ends, the BPNG should allow the exchange
rate to be more market-determined and move quickly to a market-clearing rate through
competitive foreign exchange auctions. Over the medium term, Papua New Guinea’s external
position is expected to strengthen on account of its macroeconomic fundamentals. To improve
monetary policy effectiveness, the BPNG should mop up excess liquidity more fully in the
banking system, which would help reduce excess demand for foreign exchange as well as
improve monetary policy transmission.
Structural reforms should be accelerated and deepened to create conducive conditions for broadbased growth. Continued efforts are needed to improve infrastructure, security, and health and
education outcomes, attract more foreign direct investment, and accelerate SOE reforms in order
to reduce business costs, create more jobs, and improve service delivery. A revival of agriculture
and a strengthening of the small and medium sized enterprises (SME) sector supported by
innovations in financial inclusion will also be vital for improving the livelihood of the majority
of the population.

4
Notwithstanding the recent progress, determined action is needed to improve macroeconomic
statistics. Some shortcomings in macroeconomic statistics continue to hamper surveillance and
policy making. The authorities’ commitment to reforming the National Statistics Office (NSO) is
a strong step in this direction, with increased IMF technical assistance expected to assist reform
efforts and to improve capacity.
