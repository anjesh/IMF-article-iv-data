U.S. authorities are developing a strategy to respond to an outbreak of an “avian flu” pandemic
that includes preserving the functionality of the financial system. Financial institutions are expected
to develop response plans based on government assumptions, and tests of the authorities’ own
preparedness are set to take place later in the year. Given the heavy reliance on remote computer
access in case of an outbreak, the capacity of the communications infrastructure to provide sufficient
bandwidth remains a critical factor.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The U.S. economy has remained a key engine of global growth, despite devastating
hurricanes, a withdrawal of monetary stimulus, and high energy prices. Activity has
remained robust, supported by strong productivity growth, and buoyant tax revenues seem
likely to keep the FY 2006 federal deficit well below initial budget estimates.
The Federal Reserve will need to steer a delicate course between competing risks. A
cooling housing market, higher energy prices, and an unusally low saving rate could weigh
more heavily on activity than expected. However, given the recent pick up in core inflation
and price expectations, policymakers have appropriately cautioned that some further policy
firming may yet be needed. There would also seem merit in the Fed providing a more explicit
statement of its inflation objective to help further anchor inflation expectations.
The U.S. financial sector has proven innovative and resilient in recent years. There are
important areas where further reform could help enhance the financial system’s strength and
efficiency, including by tightening the supervision of the housing GSEs, moving to
consolidate supervision and regulation of insurance companies, and reforming corporate
pension plans. Publishing a regular Financial Stability Report and undertaking a Fund FSAP
could provide further insights on these challenges.
Firm and vigorous implementation of the cooperative strategy laid out by the IMFC last
April would support an orderly resolution to global imbalances. The United States has a
major role to play in addressing this shared responsibility, and its main task remains to boost
national saving, including by more ambitious fiscal consolidation. Achieving a balanced
budget, excluding the Social Security surplus, within the next five years would set the federal
debt ratio on a firm downward path and reduce the fiscal burden on future generations.
Although controlling outlays should remain central to deficit reduction, revenue measures
should not be ruled out. There would seem merit in re-introducing caps on discretionary
spending, as well as pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirements covering both entitlement
spending and tax measures. On the revenue side, the priority should be on reforms that would
broaden the revenue base by reducing tax preferences, but consideration could also be given
to consumption-based indirect taxes.
It is critically important to re-invigorate the momentum for entitlement reform. Based on
existing proposals, the challenge for policymakers is to form the necessary consensus to
reform Social Security. Moreover, given the much larger financial shortfall of the Medicare
system, fundamental reform of the U.S. health care system seems necessary.
Leadership by the United States remains key to global trade liberalization. Continued U.S.
commitment is needed to ensure sufficient momentum for an ambitious conclusion to the
Doha Round negotiations. Care will also be needed to resist domestic protectionist sentiment
and to ensure that bilateral trade initiatives complement multilateral approaches.

5
I. OUTLOOK AND KEY ISSUES
1.
The U.S. economy has continued to be an engine of global growth despite monetary
tightening and high oil prices (Figure 1). Over the last year, household spending remained
robust, spurred by mortgage borrowing and double-digit house price inflation. However, with
employment and wage growth remaining modest, the household saving ratio dropped into
negative territory. As a result, and notwithstanding strong business saving and an
improvement in the fiscal balance, the current account deficit reached a new record high.
2.
Officials and staff both expect a “soft landing,” with growth easing to potential and
inflation remaining contained (Tables 1 and 2).1 The housing market is likely to cool in
response to high valuations and tightening financial conditions, causing the impetus from
consumption and residential investment to wane, but strong fundamentals should continue to
support business investment. The external deficit is likely to remain wide, but the drag on
activity from net exports will lessen as growth abroad strengthens. On the supply side, solid
productivity growth should accommodate wage gains while containing price pressures.

Staff and officials also concurred on the sources of macroeconomic uncertainties,
but had somewhat different perceptions of the balance of risks (Figure 1 shows fan charts,
whose construction is discussed in Annex I):

Box 1. Fund-U.S. Relations
The United States and the Fund enjoy a close relationship, reflecting a consensus on the fundamental
factors underpinning growth in market-based economies. Chief among those are a commitment to free
trade, the strong role of property rights and sound institutions, flexible labor and product markets, a deep
financial system, a relatively small size of government, and a high degree of transparency of economic
policy decisions.
Within this broader consensus, both sides have taken different views on the amount of U.S. fiscal
adjustment needed to prepare for population aging and the role of tax policy. While both sides agree
that entitlement reform is key to long-term sustainability, the Fund has been advocating a more
determined effort at fiscal consolidation to prepare for population aging. The Administration aims to
reduce the deficit to around its long-term average of 1½-2 percent of GDP, and has ruled out revenue
measures to achieve more ambitious deficit reduction.
The authorities also remain skeptical about the role of U.S. fiscal policy in reducing global current
account imbalances. The authorities commended bilateral surveillance of the United States for
integrating analysis from the Fund’s World Economic Outlook and other sources.1 However, they have
discounted staff arguments that fiscal adjustment in the United States by itself could contribute
significantly to an orderly adjustment of global current account imbalances, presenting their own
analysis to suggest that the U.S. current account deficit is relatively insensitive to U.S. fiscal policy.2
Nevertheless, the United States has been a key voice for strengthening the role of the Fund in
resolving global imbalances. Treasury officials have called on the Fund to strengthen its surveillance
over members’ exchange rate policies and have supported the introduction of multilateral consultations,
reflecting the authorities’ view that the resolution of global current account imbalances is a shared
responsibility.
U.S. legislation has also been seeking to promote sound economic policies internationally through the
work of the Fund. The U.S. Executive Director is obliged to pursue slightly more than 70 legislative
mandates (as of August 2005) prescribing U.S. policy goals at the Fund, ranging from exchange rate
stability to strengthened financial systems, good governance, AML/CFT, and U.S. voting positions on
assistance to individual borrower countries. Progress toward these goals is evaluated in annual reports by
the U.S. Treasury and the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) to Congress.3
The authorities’ agreement to discuss the modalities of a Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) provides a welcome recognition of the Fund’s work on financial sector soundness. The United
States is the last G-7 country yet to agree to an FSAP, which has been a long-standing recommendation
by staff.

•

Staff considered risks to growth to be on the downside. The possibility of a more
abrupt slowdown in the housing market, possible disappointments on the productivity
front, and a disorderly adjustment to global imbalances more than offset the upside
potential for business investment. Further, more difficult to quantify downside risks
stemmed from avian flu and geopolitical events. Officials regarded risks as relatively
balanced as they were more sanguine about the potential impact of the housing
slowdown on spending and placed greater weight on upside potential from business
investment, exports, and productivity.

•

Staff suggested that the risks to inflation were on the upside. These stemmed largely
from supply effects, including the possibility of a larger-than-anticipated productivity
slowdown pushing up unit labor costs and the potential for pass-through of high
commodity prices. Federal Reserve officials acknowledged the risks from commodity
prices but were less concerned about downside risks to productivity growth.

4.
Against this outlook, growing global current account imbalances, and the
imminent retirement of the “baby boom” generation, the discussions focused on:
•

Maintaining noninflationary growth. With policy interest rates having risen to
around neutral, and output and inflation risks somewhat skewed, monetary policy
decisions had become more delicately balanced.

•

Preserving domestic and external financial stability. For example, U.S. policies
could reduce risks from financial market volatility stemming from a disorderly
resolution of global external imbalances.

•

Preparing for an aging population. This involves reforming unsustainable
entitlement programs and potentially pursuing more forceful medium-term public
debt reduction to cope with spending pressures as the baby boom generation retires.
II. MONETARY POLICY: MAINTAINING NONINFLATIONARY GROWTH
A. How Fast Will Household Spending Slow?

5.
Household spending has been the main driver of the expansion, boosted by the
housing boom (Figure 2). With capital gains—particularly on houses—boosting personal
wealth, real consumption and residential investment spending has grown an average
½ percentage point faster than GDP since the 2001 recession. Real disposable income growth
has been held back by rising energy prices and lackluster employment growth, and household
saving turned negative as spending was financed in part through home equity withdrawal
(HEW), which rose to a record 8 percent of U.S. personal income in 2005.
6.
Staff and officials agreed that easy financing conditions and flexible U.S. financial
markets had supported the housing market and contributed to a record housing equity
withdrawal (HEW) ratio (Figure 3). Mortgage securitization had helped channel foreign
savings into the U.S. housing market while allowing mortgage originators greater flexibility

8
to diversify credit exposures and reduce systemic risk. Innovative mortgage instruments, low
refinancing costs, and access to tax-advantaged home equity loans, had also supported HEW.
7.
Staff observed that, while conditions varied across regions, U.S. house prices
seemed overvalued and a correction appeared to have started (Chapter 1 of the Selected
Issues paper suggests house prices are 15–20 percent above equilibrium). Fed officials did
not disagree with this assessment but cautioned that such estimates were subject to
considerable uncertainty and varied considerably across models. Moreover, empirical
evidence suggested that the impact of personal income and employment conditions on house
prices tended to dominate that of long-term interest rates, suggesting that less favorable
financing conditions were unlikely to represent a significant shock to prices.2
8.
Staff and officials agreed that a cooling in the housing market was likely to
dampen consumption and residential investment. The mission suggested that, with real
house price inflation likely to halve to 5 percent in 2006 (yoy)and decelerate further
subsequently, the increasing use of HEW and nontraditional mortgages implied that the
sensitivity of consumption to a change in housing wealth would probably be at the upper end
of the usual estimate of 3–7 cents per dollar. Once the impact on residential investment was
added, this implied a reduction in GDP growth of around ½ percent of GDP over the next
two years (Annex I). Background work, summarized in Annex II.1, illustrates that in the
U.K. and Australia, countries that experienced HEW ratios similar to that in the United States
in recent years, slowing house price inflation led to a manageable rebound in household
saving.
9.
Staff viewed the balance of risks for household spending and residential investment
as being on the downside. A faster deceleration in house prices could further amplify the
impact on consumer and residential spending by eroding confidence and increased the strain
on borrowers. These risks were exacerbated by the negative household saving rate and
continued high energy prices that reduced discretionary spending power. Fed officials
responded that, given the surprising strength of consumption over many years, smaller effects
from slowing house prices and high energy costs were also possible.
B. Will Business Investment Surprise on the Upside?
10.
Fed officials viewed the recent strength of business investment as consistent with
underlying fundamentals. While business investment had been weak in the aftermath of the
IT bubble, officials viewed the trends in the capital/labor ratio and other indicators as
suggesting that any post-IT bubble overhang had been worked off. Continuing declines in
capital goods prices and strong demand had made capital accumulation attractive even as
interest rates had become less stimulative. As a result, purchases of (especially IT) equipment
and software had accelerated to levels not seen since the late-1990s. Real growth in
structures had been less strong and, given high office vacancy rates, officials expected this
trend to continue.
2

Private sector analysts projected a relatively small short-term impact on the ratio of debt payments to income
from upward movements in variable mortgage rates on adjustable rate mortgages and nontraditional mortgages.

9
11.
Officials and staff agreed that business investment could surprise on the upside. In
line with global trends, the corporate sector had used high profits and low interest rates to
strengthen balance sheets—including through equity buybacks—and accumulate large cash
holdings, taking on the unusual position of a net lender (Figure 4).3 Although an expected
weakening in consumption growth could have some dampening effect on business spending,
extremely strong fundamentals—the near-record profit rate, healthy expected earnings
growth, low leverage, and the still low cost of capital—suggested upside risks dominated.
C. Are Price Pressures Building?
12.
Fed officials acknowledged that the recent uptick in core inflation had been
discouraging. The unemployment rate—at 4¾ percent in April—had fallen to the low end of
most estimates of the NAIRU, and capacity utilization was around its long-run average.
Nevertheless, unit labor cost increases had been contained, reflecting solid productivity
growth and modest wage gains. Officials noted that the absence of wage pressures could
indicate a lower level of the NAIRU, although other structural factors, including
globalization, could also have played a role. Staff analysis (summarized in Annex II.2)
suggests that low inflation in recent years has largely reflected a larger-term downward trend.
This has been somewhat reinforced by cyclical factors, including through globalization, that
could reverse as the domestic and global environment evolves.4
13.
Officials expected wage pressures to pick up over the coming year, but did not
anticipate much pass-through to overall inflation. The post-2000 drop in labor market
participation (discussed in Chapter 2 of the Selected Issues paper) was unlikely to be
reversed. Thus, low unemployment could eventually lead to a pick-up in wage growth and
some recovery of the labor share of national income (Figure 5).5 However, this would not
necessarily translate into inflation, given strong productivity growth and room for downward
adjustments to profit margins.
14.
Officials also observed that the boom in commodity prices implied a short-term
inflation risk. Energy prices now seemed to be feeding into inflation expectations, and this
process might not yet be complete even if energy prices remained at their present level.
While the impact of higher oil prices on the economy had been smaller than in the past,
partly reflecting the reductions in oil intensity of production and productivity growth (staff
analysis is contained in Chapter 3 of the Selected Issues paper), there continued to be a risk

infrastructure.6
D. Monetary Policy Discussions
15.
The technical discussions took place before the increase in financial market
volatility of May-June and the associated heightened concerns voiced about inflation,
including by senior Fed officials. The global sell-off of riskier assets—most notably global
equities and emerging market bonds—confirmed incipient evidence that the credit cycle was
turning but has not had a significant impact on private sector assessments of U.S. growth
prospects or financial vulnerabilities.
16.
At the time of the meetings, staff suggested that, at 5 percent, the federal funds rate
was close to most estimates of a neutral level (Figure 6). With inflation risks on the upside,
however, a “risk management” approach to monetary policy—which took into account both
the likely path of the economy and the risks around that path—could suggest the need for
some further tightening, consistent with market expectations of a further rise in the federal
funds rate by 25 basis points in subsequent months.
17.
Officials responded that the direction of future policy decisions had become much
less certain than earlier, when the federal funds rate was well below the neutral range. The
May 10 Federal Market Open Committee (FOMC) statement reflected these considerations,
noting that while “a further policy firming may yet be needed to address inflation risks … the
extent and timing of any such firming will depend importantly on the evolution of the
economic outlook as implied by incoming information.” Reflecting heightened inflation
concerns, the FOMC raised the Fed funds rate to 5¼ percent on June 29 and the
accompanying statement observed that while “some inflation risks remain ... any additional
firming will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth.”
18.
Fed officials noted that policy decisions were complicated by uncertainty about the
factors contributing to low long-term bond yields. If low term premiums reflected a shift in
portfolio preferences toward long-term assets—possibly in response to the “great
moderation” in macroeconomic volatility in recent decades—short-term interest rates would
need to be higher than otherwise to offset the boost to demand from lower long rates.
Conversely, if low term premiums reflected a weakening of global investment demand or
higher global saving that helped contain domestic price pressures, a tightening would not be
warranted.
19.
They observed that the impact of global financial market integration on the
monetary transmission mechanism was equally difficult to assess. Staff suggested that
increased integration of national bond markets could help explain the muted rise in long-term
interest rates and the correspondingly subdued response of demand components to U.S.

on Gulf Coast facilities and slow growth in refinery capacity. There are also increasing signs of strains in the
electricity sector, as discussed in Chapter 4 of the Selected Issues paper.

11
monetary tightening. Officials responded that it was difficult to gauge how the monetary
transmission mechanism had changed in recent years, but they noted that recent movements
in long-term interest rates seemed to reflect a relatively accurate anticipation of the pace and
timing of Fed tightening, and the response of demand to these interest rate movements was
consistent with past trends.
20.
Fed officials did not see rising commodity prices as reflecting broader global
inflationary pressures. Rather than a symptom of abundant global liquidity—including
through easy U.S. monetary policy—officials viewed the commodity price boom as
reflecting a relative price shift in response to rapid growth in commodity intensive countries,
such as China. While the global economy might be hitting some bottlenecks, there was little
sign of generalized pressures on resources. Rather, fast productivity growth in emerging
markets had limited cost increases of their products and the ability of producers elsewhere to
pass through higher commodity prices.
21.
The mission suggested that the present conjuncture seemed propitious for the Fed
to define its inflation objective more explicitly. Fed officials responded that a committee
headed by Vice-Chairman Kohn had been established to examine the Fed’s overall
communication policy, including refining the definition of stable prices. Before such a
refinement could occur, however, it would be necessary to establish a consensus that, by
lowering inflation uncertainty, such a move would also be helpful in achieving the other
objectives defined in the Federal Reserve Act (maximum employment and moderate longterm interest rates). Staff also suggested it could be helpful to increase the frequency and
forward-looking element of the biannual Monetary Policy Report, to which officials
responded that it would be difficult given the size and diversity of the FOMC.
III. PRESERVING DOMESTIC AND EXTERNAL FINANCIAL STABILITY
A. How Long Will Benign Financing Conditions Continue?
22.
Discussions of financial sector developments centered on the implications of the
rapid pace of change in the structure of U.S. financial markets (Figure 7). Officials
observed that low credit spreads partly reflected the effectiveness of securitization and credit
risk transfer techniques for improving the pricing and allocation of credit risk, especially for
asset classes with higher risk profiles.7 The increased activity of hedge funds had enhanced
price discovery and liquidity in many of the new markets. However, they agreed with the
mission that some markets had yet to be fully tested in a less benign financial environment.
23.
Officials observed that banks had been remarkably adept in responding to
changing market conditions. Although banking margins had been squeezed by the flattening
of the yield curve, profitability had been sustained by non-interest income and low charge-off
rates, notwithstanding the impact of Hurricane Katrina and a spike in personal bankruptcies
in late 2005 ahead of changes to the bankruptcy code. While bank revenues remained

12
dependent on the real estate market, even small and regional banks had traded parts of their
loan book against mortgage-backed securities, reducing their vulnerability to regional shocks.
24.
Staff and officials agreed that a range of indicators suggested that systemic risks
were at a low ebb (Figure 8):
•

Distance-to-default measures for “large complex banking groups” (LCBGs,
discussed in more detail in Chapter 5 of the Selected Issues paper), the “big five”
investment banks, and the insurance sector had recovered to levels last seen in the
mid-1990s. Default risks were largely confined to declining industries (the auto and
airline sectors are discussed in Chapter 6 of the Selected Issues paper).

•

Value-at-risk and implied default risk measures were low despite upticks after the
May 2005 automotive industry rating downgrades and a large insurer’s admission of
accounting inaccuracies in late 2004.

•

Capital adequacy remained strong across the banking sector, reflecting high
profitability in recent years.

25.
Staff and officials agreed, however, that increased risk-taking could foreshadow
some deterioration in credit quality. U.S. corporate credit markets remained strong,
supported by sustained brisk earnings growth, and credit spreads were low. However, staff
observed that ample liquidity had begun to facilitate a pickup in mergers and acquisitions as
well as leveraged buyout activity, while easier bank lending conditions had allowed loan
leverage ratios to rise to levels last experienced in 1997. These trends could signal a turn in
the credit cycle, leading to increased market volatility and widening corporate credit spreads.
Subsequent to the discussions, a rise in equity market volatility in May and June was
accompanied by a global sell-off of riskier assets, although the impact on corporate bond
spreads has been modest.
26.
Financial sector risks related to household borrowing appeared relatively
manageable. With bank exposures increasingly concentrated in the household sector,
officials felt that recent regulatory guidance tightening standards for home equity lending and
nontraditional mortgages had already led to tighter credit conditions in those markets.
Moreover, stress tests indicated that borrowers at risk of significant mortgage payment
increases remained a small minority, concentrated mostly among higher-income households
that were aware of the attendant risks. Officials acknowledged, however, that for banks with
high concentrations of commercial real estate and construction loans on their books,
sustaining revenues in the case of a downturn could be difficult. Staff observed that there was
a risk of a significant dent in banking profitability if the housing market slowed abruptly.
27.
Officials acknowledged that regulators were facing a challenge to respond to the
rapid evolution of the financial system. They emphasized that—with markets becoming
more complex and decentralized—supervisors could no longer track risk exposures on a
system-wide basis, but instead needed to ensure that controls and procedures at systemically
important institutions and infrastructure providers were robust. Given the increasingly

13
complex structure of bank’s operations, traditional supervisory activities were being
augmented by a stronger analytical focus on large banks and critical market segments.
28.

Specific regulatory issues covered during the discussions included:

•

Hedge funds. Fed officials noted that leverage and concentration indicators of hedge
funds had moderated, and that their trading strategies were more diverse than in the
period leading up to the LTCM crisis. The mission broadly agreed with their view
that hedge fund market activities were too fluid for direct regulation to be effective,
and that supervisors—both in the United States and abroad—needed to focus instead
on measures to limit counterparty risk to banks acting as prime brokers and to
continue to improve the financial infrastructure.8

•

Government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs). Staff and Treasury officials agreed on
the need for rules to reduce the size of GSEs’ own portfolios given the systemic risks
they posed to the financial system. Officials were cautiously optimistic that the
Administration’s proposals to create a new regulator, establish risk-based capital
requirements, and limit GSEs’ portfolios would gain congressional support in 2006.
Using the Treasury’s ability to limit GSE debt issuance remained a second-best
alternative, as it could encourage these institutions to accept greater risks to maintain
profitability.

•

Basel II. Bank regulators expected some decline in minimum capital requirements
after the shift to Basel II norms in 2009. They acknowledged that the impact on bank
balance sheets was uncertain, in part because the role of the economic cycle would
only become fully evident after the system was implemented. However, capital
adequacy standards could be recalibrated, if necessary, as the transition to the new
framework was to take place over several years.

•

Insurance regulation. Officials observed that the Administration had recently
flagged the need for a stronger federal role in insurance regulation, which was
presently a state responsibility. Staff supported this suggestion given the sector’s
systemic importance, increasing globalization, and the potential for regulatory
arbitrage across jurisdictions. Officials noted that similar considerations could argue
for some consolidation in the regulation of some segments of the financial sector
(including banks), although specific proposals were not under consideration.

•

Industrial Loan Companies (ILCs). Federal Reserve officials reiterated their concern
that large commercial firms owning ILCs—some of which had evolved into
sophisticated financial institutions—were not subject to consolidated supervision
provisions under the Bank Holding Company Act. To protect the principle of

8

fund advisers to improve controls and record-keeping systems. However, this regulation was struck down by the
courts in June of this year.

14
•

consolidated supervision over banking operations, the mission agreed that ILCs
should be limited in their ability to establish nationwide branch networks.

29.
The mission suggested that a Fund Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)
might be a useful vehicle for providing an international perspective on these issues.
Treasury and Fed officials responded that they were open to participating in an FSAP, and
indicated interest in discussing specific modalities. The team also asked whether publishing a
Financial Stability Report—as prepared by many other central banks or financial sector
supervisors—might improve the market’s understanding of U.S. financial risks and
vulnerabilities. Fed officials responded that such a report would not add much value to what
was already being published by regulators and market participants.
30.
The team welcomed Administration proposals to strengthen defined benefit (DB)
plans. Officials explained that current workers seemed to be accumulating retirement assets
at a pace comparable to previous generations but, given the unfunded liabilities of many DB
plans and the Social Security system, maintaining living standards past retirement could
become more challenging. Proposals included reducing disincentives for overfunding of
plans, using corporate bond yields to calculate pension liabilities, and allowing the Public
Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) to set risk-based premiums. On the accounting side,
officials were confident that a pending proposal by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) to include pension accounts in corporate balance sheets would lead to greater
transparency and could help improve plan funding.
31.
Staff and officials agreed that automatic enrollment in employer sponsored defined
contribution plans with rising contribution schedules could help boost personal saving.
Officials were seeking to amend pension regulations so that workers could be automatically
enrolled in such plans, but legislation might be required to protect employers from legal
sanctions that might arise if the return on pension investments disappointed. Officials
observed that tax incentives, such as the lifetime saving accounts (LSAs) proposed in the
budget, could also stimulate personal saving, but acknowledged that the net impact on
national saving might be small in the absence of offsetting deficit-reduction measures.
B. How Will the Current Account Deficit Adjust?
32.
The current account widened to a record 6¼ percent of GDP in 2005, owing to
higher oil prices and the relative strength of U.S. import demand (Figure 9 and Tables 3
and 4). In addition, staff analysis suggests that the shift in U.S. trade toward low-cost
producers had blunted some of the measured real effective exchange rate depreciation in
recent years (Figure 10 and Box 2 in last year’s Staff Report). Nonetheless, the U.S. net
foreign liability (NFL) position barely deteriorated in 2005, reflecting the effects of the
relative strength of foreign equity markets on U.S. residents’ investments, although recent
financial market developments may have reversed some of these gains.

Box 2. U.S. Spillovers to the Rest of the World
With the world’s largest economy and most dominant financial markets, the U.S. has large significant
spillovers on other countries :
•

Real activity. Past WEO forecast errors
(available since 1990) suggest that an
unanticipated 1 percent undershoot in U.S.
growth is associated with a ¼ percent
slowing in growth elsewhere, with the
largest effects being on countries with close
trade and financial links. This may
underestimate the effect of U.S. growth on
the rest of the world, given the possible
offsets provided by large non-U.S. shocks
in the 1990s—such as the Asian crisis and
German unification.

rates, including to major regions such as the
euro area, and emerging market bond
spreads appear particularly closely linked to U.S. financial conditions (see Box 1.5 of the April 2006
Global Financial Stability Report). In addition, rising gross international investment positions have
increased the potential for wealth spillovers from changes in the dollar and U.S. asset prices
(Annex II.4). Finally, U.S. financial market conditions have a direct impact on countries that link
their exchange rates to the U.S. dollar.

•

External indebtedness. Most analysts agree that while the size of U.S. net international liabilities
are not currently a concern they are growing at an unsustainable rate. While many see a
significant—and possibly abrupt—adjustment of the dollar as being necessary to correct this trend,
with attendant risks for global growth and financial stability (as discussed in the World Economic
Outlook), others have suggested that the resolution could come through a gradual adjustment of
global saving and investment balances with more limited impacts on exchange rates.

U.S. monetary and fiscal policies also have international spillovers although the size of their impact
remains a subject of controversy. Global Financial Stability Reports have discussed how abundant
international liquidity—partly reflecting the stance of the Fed—has put downward pressure on global
bond yields and supported a search for yield. In addition, analysis in the World Economic Outlook and
elsewhere has estimated the impact of U.S. fiscal deficits on U.S. and global saving, external
imbalances, and global real interest rates.
U.S. policies often matter more for other countries than domestically. A good example of this is the
proposal by the President’s Tax Reform commission to move from taxing worldwide corporate earning
to a territorial system, which has generated almost no discussion at home but could significantly increase
global tax competition. Staff analysis of this subject is discussed in Annex II.5.

16
33.
Officials agreed that the current account deficit seemed likely to widen further.
Although the pickup in activity in Europe and Japan would support the trade balance, the
large gap between exports and imports meant that exports needed to grow almost twice as
fast as imports simply to keep the deficit unchanged. This could be difficult to achieve given
that most estimates placed the income elasticity of U.S. imports as up to double the size of
that for exports. Growing foreign indebtedness and rising U.S. interest rates also meant that
debt dynamics were adverse, with the investment balance expected to turn negative in 2006.
34.
The staff noted that the real exchange rate appeared significantly overvalued,
especially given the projected deterioration of U.S. net foreign liabilities (see Annex III). A
staff assessment using macroeconomic fundamentals estimated the overvaluation in the
15-35 percent range. Officials cautioned that such estimates were highly sensitive to
underlying assumptions, markets were best placed to judge appropriate exchange rate levels,
and foreign investors showed no signs of becoming less willing to invest in U.S. markets. In
this context, they expressed concern that exchange rate inflexibility and other factors were
impeding needed adjustment in many countries’ competitiveness.
35.
Officials remained relatively sanguine about the risk of a disorderly adjustment.
U.S. financial markets were well placed to intermediate global savings, and recent dollar
strength implied that the demand for U.S. securities was not satiated.9 Staff noted that market
expectations implied a relative sanguine view of the risks of future dollar weakness
(background work, summarized in Annex II.3, finds dollar risk premiums have varied widely
over time but have not consistently risen with the increase in net foreign liabilities). Officials
responded that, although sharp exchange rate adjustments could not be ruled out, experience
suggested that markets could absorb considerable exchange rate movements, particularly
since national financial systems had become more resilient.
36.
The mission cautioned about the risks of a “disorderly” resolution of imbalances,
emphasizing the need for a cooperative global adjustment strategy. This underscored the
importance of raising U.S. national saving, including by more ambitious fiscal consolidation,
in conjunction with steps toward greater exchange rate flexibility in emerging Asia and
continued structural reforms to boost growth in Europe and Japan. Extensive analysis in the
World Economic Outlook and elsewhere indicated that a disorderly resolution could
significantly lower growth in the United States and abroad (Box 2).10 Annex II.4 summarizes
background work suggesting that wealth losses to foreign investors from a drop in U.S. asset
prices and the value of the dollar could be significant.
37.
Officials agreed that the solution to global imbalances would require a multilateral
approach. They expressed strong support for the Fund’s leadership in the multilateral
consultations process, and hoped that this would increase the understanding of the shared
9

Analysis in Chapter 1 of the Selected Issues paper suggests that mortgage securitization has created an asset
class that has proved highly attractive to domestic and foreign investors.

17
responsibility for addressing the situation. Officials were concerned that surplus countries
had not accepted the need to boost domestic demand relative to output and cautioned that,
without such an understanding, efforts to boost U.S. national saving—including through
fiscal deficit reduction—would likely have a modest impact on global imbalances but could
slow global growth. They also stressed that increased financial globalization argued against
pursuing international exchange rate agreements, such as those contained in the 1985 Plaza
Accord.
IV. FISCAL POLICY: PREPARING FOR AN AGING POPULATION
A. The Long-Term Challenge
38.
Staff and Treasury officials agreed that the long-term fiscal outlook was
unsustainable and that entitlement reform was needed (Figure 11). Population aging and
rising health care costs are projected to place an ever increasing burden on public retirement
and health systems in the United States, as it is in other OECD countries (Figure 12). The FY
2007 budget projects that spending on entitlement programs (including Social Security and
Medicare) will rise by around 1½ percent of GDP each decade through 2080. With
contributions to these programs expected to grow much less rapidly:
•

The Trustees currently estimate the 75-year funding gap of the Social Security and
Medicare systems at 325 percent of GDP. The Social Security system—which
presently runs a cash surplus of 1½ percent of GDP—is projected to fall into deficit
as early as 2017. The underfunding of the Medicare system is much larger, and has
been increased by 80 percent of GDP by the prescription drug benefit.

•

Medicaid—the federal and state program providing health coverage for the poor
and disabled—also has a large implicit funding gap. The rapid increase in outlays
would make it increasingly difficult for states to meet their balanced-budget
requirements without spending cuts elsewhere, increased tax revenues, or higher
federal transfers.

•

Social Security reforms have stalled in Congress. The Administration has proposed
establishing a bipartisan commission to examine broad reform of entitlement
programs, but there has been little subsequent progress. Greater consensus was
needed in Congress to carry the process forward.
B. Medium-Term Budget Policy

39.
Officials emphasized that recent revenue buoyancy and expenditure discipline had
improved fiscal prospects (Table 5). Tax receipts through April (which included annual
personal tax filings for 2005) exceeded projections on both the personal and corporate side
by a significant margin. The reasons for revenue overperformance were still not fully
understood, but all indications were that this year’s deficit would fall below 2½ percent of
GDP, well under the budget projection of 3¼ percent. As a result, the objective of “halving
the deficit”—relative to the $540 billion (4½ percent of GDP) that had been forecast for
FY2005—now seemed likely to be met by FY 2008, a year ahead of schedule.

Sources: FY 2007 Budget of the U.S. Government (February 6, 2006); and Fund staff estimates.
1/ Staff projections are based on the Administration's budget adjusted for differences in macroeconomic projections;
staff estimates of the cost of ongoing operations in Iraq; some additional non-defense discretionary expenditure;
and continued AMT relief beyond FY2007. The projections also assume that PRA's are not introduced.

40.
Staff welcomed the improved fiscal performance, which provided the opportunity to
embrace a more ambitious medium-term target for deficit reduction. The fall in the federal
fiscal deficit largely reflected unexpected revenue buoyancy, whose permanence remained to
be seen. The expenditure ratio was still rising despite some recent success in constraining
nondefense discretionary spending (comprising about one-fifth of all outlays), reflecting
rising costs of entitlement programs and debt service, as well as emergency spending on
Afghanistan, Iraq, and hurricane Katrina. Budget projections showing a deficit reduction to
1¼ percent of GDP by FY 2011 appeared unambitious, implying an adjustment of only
around 1 percentage point relative to the likely outturn for FY 2006.
41.
Balancing the budget excluding the Social Security surplus over the next five years,
if coupled with entitlement reform, would restore long-term fiscal sustainability (Box 3).
Staff analysis suggested that even with reforms that slowed entitlement benefit growth
gradually (to provide individuals with time to adjust long-term plans) large additional
adjustments would be needed to meet the needs of a growing elderly population. Achieving a
balanced budget excluding Social Security would meet this challenge by lowering the debt
burden and interest costs, thereby lessening the size of the necessary fiscal adjustment and
avoiding placing an undue burden on future generations. This would require annual
consolidation of some ¾ percent of GDP, whose impact on U.S. and global demand seemed
manageable.
42.
Officials stressed the Administration’s commitment to achieving deficit reduction
through expenditure restraint. The staff cautioned, however, that the discipline on
discretionary spending assumed in the current budget appeared optimistic. Budget proposals
involved a backloaded reduction of nondefense discretionary spending as a ratio to GDP to

2030 and 6.6 percent by 2050; and (iii) maintaining the revenue ratio at its long-term average of
18.3 percent of GDP.
Entitlement reform that gradually reduces the growth of health and retirement benefits improves the
situation but does not achieve fiscal sustainability (Scenario B). Reforms are assumed to eliminate the
annual excess cost growth for Medicare and Medicaid by 2050, which reduces the rise in health care
outlays from this source by 40 percent through 2050, and progressive indexation of Social Security
benefits is also assumed.2 However, these steps are not enough to prevent a rapid build up of debt,
reflecting the doubling of the old-age dependency ratio.
Combining such reform with balancing the budget excluding social security by FY 2011 achieves
long-term fiscal sustainability. Scenario C augments entitlement reform with medium-term deficit
reduction that achieves budget balance, excluding Social Security, in FY 2011 through higher revenues
or lower nonentitlement spending. The 3 percent of GDP improvement in the nonentitlement primary
balance is assumed to be maintained subsequently.
Alternative paths for achieving fiscal sustainability involve much lower benefits or higher taxes:
•

To maintain the revenue ratio at its historical average, excess cost growth in Medicare and
Medicaid would need to be eliminated immediately, presumably through benefit reductions, and
larger cuts to the nonentitlement spending ratio would be required.

•

More gradual deficit reduction—assumed to occur through rescinding the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts
and leaving the AMT unreformed—would lead to a higher debt ratio than with the reforms
contained in Scenario C, increasing the needed long-term fiscal consolidation by slightly over
2 percentage points of GDP.

unprecedented lows, relied on several measures that had previously been rejected by
Congress, and ignored the costs of funding operations in Iraq and Afghanistan beyond
FY 2007 (Chapter 3 of the 2004 Selected Issues paper discusses the potential for expenditure
restraint). The team welcomed, therefore, the Administration’s support of a reinstatement of
pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) rules for mandatory spending and statutory limits on the growth of
discretionary spending, but questioned the unwillingness to include tax cuts in the PAYGO
rules.11
43.
The staff suggested that it would be prudent to explore options for raising the
revenue ratio to meet long-term spending pressures. Given rising entitlement spending,
there could be growing pressure to withdraw the 2001–03 marginal income tax cuts due to
expire in 2011, and it would be increasingly difficult to bear the revenue costs of reforming
the AMT. In order to avoid the attendant negative implications for economic efficiency, a
number of options could be considered in the context of a broader tax reform:
•

Base broadening. The President’s Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform offered a
number of options for gradually reducing a number of ill-targeted and distortionary
tax breaks, including those for mortgage interest payments, employers’ contributions
to health insurance plan premiums, and state and local tax payments. The team also
noted the possibility of raising Social Security and Medicare contribution limits.

•

Energy taxation. Energy taxes could yield significant revenues and, by lowering
consumption, could also help support of the authorities’ energy security and
environmental objectives.

•

A national VAT. An indirect consumption tax would tend to maintain buoyancy even
as the workforce retires and, by avoiding taxation of factor incomes, would encourage
private saving and investment.

44.
Officials responded that it was inadvisable to set a medium-term deficit objective to
address spending pressures whose size was uncertain and whose solutions were largely
political. The real issue, which would require difficult political choices by Congress rather
than shifts in the near-term fiscal stance, was whether U.S. society was prepared to tolerate
the higher taxes needed to finance existing entitlement programs or would accept lower
entitlement benefits per capita. The Administration opposed revenue increases to finance
deficit reduction because of their detrimental supply-side effects. Although the ratio of
revenues to GDP would tend to rise gradually over time through bracket creep, they
cautioned that in the past the tendency had been to respond with tax cuts, and the ratio had
not deviated from its long-term average of slightly over 18 percent of GDP for an extended
time in the postwar period.

11

The Budget Enforcement Act’s PAYGO rules required that any legislation affecting revenues or entitlement
programs be deficit neutral, whereas the Administration has proposed exempting tax cuts from this discipline.

21
C. Entitlement Reform
45.
The team observed that there appeared to be an urgent need for major reform of
the U.S. health care system to contain costs. U.S. health care spending was around
15 percent of GDP, well above the OECD average, with the public sector responsible for
around half of the total (Figure 13). Officials agreed on the need for reform and noted that
their key focus was on addressing the tendency of third-party insurance to insulate consumers
from rising health costs. Accordingly, health savings accounts (HSAs) had been introduced
coupled with tax incentives for high deductible health care insurance plans, and steps were
also being taken to improve information on the quality and effectiveness of
procedures/services.
46.
The Administration was encouraging state initiatives to increase the efficiency of
the Medicaid program. Officials observed that states were in a better position than the
federal government to control health costs through policy initiatives and experimentation. For
example, “personal responsibility accounts” that encouraged healthier lifestyles had shown
some promise. State representatives agreed that the federal government was providing
significant flexibility in the Medicaid program while also tightening the definition of
expenses eligible for federal matching grants.
47.
Officials indicated that the Administration was open to a range of reforms of the
Social Security system. The President had endorsed slowing benefit growth by linking
payments to a sliding combination of wage and price indexing, which would more than halve
the 75-year funding gap. The Administration would consider most additional proposals that
moved the system to a sounder financial footing, particularly towards the end of the 75-year
funding window, such as indexing benefits to longevity and raising the cap on payroll taxes,
although raising payroll tax rates would not be acceptable. While the President had proposed
creating Personal Retirement Accounts without raising payroll taxes, other approaches had
not been rejected. Staff responded that the key priority was to ensure that reforms are not
delayed, as this would only increase the cost of the eventual adjustment.
V. TRADE POLICY AND ODA
48.
Officials stressed that an ambitious completion of the Doha round remained a
priority for the Administration. With trade promotion authority (TPA) expiring mid-2007,
there was a need to wrap up negotiations by the end of this year. Staff noted that reductions
in U.S. agricultural subsidies, and similar subsidies elsewhere, would need to be a key
component of a multilateral deal. Officials responded that the United States had already made
an ambitious proposal, including the ultimate elimination of agricultural tariffs and tradedistorting subsidies, and expressed disappointment with the unwillingness of others to
reciprocate. They cautioned that it would be impossible to gain Congressional support for
lower U.S. agricultural subsidies without a corresponding increase in market access.
49.
Officials saw U.S. bilateral free trade arrangements (FTAs) as a complement to
multinational negotiations, while staff expressed concern about their proliferation.
U.S. FTAs have been concluded or are under negotiation with 29 countries; only four were in
place in 2002. Officials observed that U.S. negotiators sought comprehensive and WTO-

22
compatible FTAs that generally increased support within countries for multilateral
agreements, and that the United States was looking for free trade “any way it can.” Staff
responded that the proliferation of preferential agreements could undermine the multilateral
fabric of world trade. The potential for defensive responses to others’ FTAs suggested there
was scope to agree mutual restraints or the inclusion of open-access clauses allowing
countries to accede to existing FTAs. Simple and liberal rules of origin were crucial to avoid
burdening cross-border value chains.
50.
Staff emphasized the importance of resisting mounting protectionist sentiment. In
particular, recent Congressional proposals targeted at China risked hurting workers in both
countries while having little impact on the U.S. trade balance. Officials responded that they
considered United States/Chinese trade relations as healthy and stressed that all U.S. policies
were WTO compliant and were aimed at integrating China into the multilateral trading
system. Treasury officials observed that the May semiannual report on economic and
exchange rate policies had not designated China as a currency manipulator, and indicated that
the Administration favored shifting the nomenclature from the inherently subjective concept
of “manipulation” to the more analytically precise “misalignment.”
51.
The mission inquired about prospects for raising the share of U.S. official
development assistance (ODA) in GDP, which remains one of the lowest among industrial
countries. While the budget had requested a modest increase for FY 2007, OECD estimates
suggested that this could be insufficient to meet the Gleneagles G-8 commitments on
increased aid to Africa; the Millennium Challenge Account; and initiatives on HIV/AIDS and
malaria. Officials suggested that the United States was well on its way to meeting these
commitments, especially with large increases in Millennium Challenge Corporation
financing programmed for the next few years. Moreover, they stressed that overall U.S.
assistance (including remittances and other private capital flows) remained several times the
level of official ODA, and were more important for the United States than for other
countries.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
52.
The U.S. economy has remained a key engine of global growth, despite devastating
hurricanes, a withdrawal of monetary stimulus, and high energy prices. Activity has
remained robust, supported by strong productivity growth, and buoyant tax revenues seem
likely to keep the FY 2006 federal deficit well below initial budget estimates. Looking
forward, prospects appear favorable for growth to gradually ease to a more sustainable rate.
53.
In the year ahead, the Federal Reserve faces the difficult task of steering a course
between competing risks. In particular, a cooling housing market, higher energy prices, and
negative household saving rate could weigh more heavily on activity than expected. At the
same time, however, the recent pick up in core inflation and expectations, coupled with a
further drop in the unemployment rate, have underscored the danger of a build up in price
pressures. Given the importance of keeping inflation expectations in check, policymakers
have appropriately cautioned that some further policy firming may yet be needed.

23
54.
There would seem to be merit in the Fed providing a more explicit statement of its
inflation objective. While the Fed’s communications strategy in recent years has been highly
effective, this additional step could help further anchor inflation expectations without
undermining confidence in the Fed’s commitment to its broader mandate. Providing more
frequent Monetary Policy Reports with a greater focus on future developments could also
further increase the Fed’s high level of transparency.
55.
The U.S. financial sector has proven innovative and resilient in recent years. The
system appears well-positioned as the credit cycle turns, although conditions in markets for
credit derivatives merit close monitoring, and there are important areas where further reform
could help enhance the financial system’s resilience and efficiency:
•

Action is still needed to carry forward the Administration’s proposals to strengthen
the supervision of the housing GSEs and limit the size of their balance sheets so as to
contain systemic risk in financial markets.

•

Steps too are needed to improve the funding of the PBGC, strengthen the accounting
and transparency of defined benefit pension plans, and improve the incentives for
participation in defined contribution plans.

•

Supervision and regulation of insurance companies is fragmented and steps to
establish a more uniform approach would be welcome.

•

Undertaking a Fund FSAP and publishing a regular Financial Stability Report could
provide further insights on these challenges.

56.
The United States has a major role to play in catalyzing vigorous implementation of
the cooperative strategy laid out by the IMFC last April. An orderly resolution of
imbalances would be supported by ambitious fiscal consolidation that helps boost national
saving. Delaying the inevitable adjustment of global imbalances will mean continued
increases in U.S. external indebtedness, heightening the risk of a sharp disruption to
exchange rates, financial markets, and growth, both domestically and abroad.
57.
The Budget again this year has highlighted that demographic and other pressures
threaten both fiscal sustainability and the nation’s future prosperity. While there is no
doubt that entitlement reform is essential for achieving a sustainable fiscal position, even
significant entitlement reforms and cuts in other spending may not be sufficient to
accommodate the increased demands on public health and retirement systems from an aging
population.
58.
With buoyant revenues supporting deficit reduction, the time is opportune to
establish a more ambitious medium-term fiscal anchor. In particular, achieving a balanced
budget, excluding the Social Security surplus, within the next five years would set the federal
debt ratio on a firm downward path, reducing the burden on future generations of providing
health care and retirement income to the baby boom generation. It would also provide the
needed room to develop and phase in the reforms required to place entitlement systems on a
more sustainable basis. Given current budget projections, this would require consolidation of

24
around ¾ percentage point of GDP a year, providing a helpful boost to national saving and
multilateral efforts to narrow global imbalances.
59.
Although controlling outlays should remain central to deficit reduction, revenue
measures should not be ruled out:
•

On the expenditure side, despite some success in slowing the growth of discretionary
outlays, it may be difficult to sustain expenditure discipline, especially in light of
pressures to fund defense commitments and other emergency priorities. Therefore,
there would seem merit in re-introducing caps on discretionary outlays, as well as
pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirements covering both entitlement spending and tax
measures.

•

On the revenue side, it may be difficult to sustain the significant reductions in
marginal tax rates of recent years while meeting the fiscal burden from population
aging. Nonetheless, the priority should be on reforms that would broaden the revenue
base by reducing tax preferences, including those for mortgage interest payments,
employers’ contributions to health insurance plan premiums, and state and local tax
payments, as suggested by the President’s Advisory Panel. Consideration could also
be given to consumption-based indirect taxes—such as a national sales tax, a VAT, or
energy taxation—that would maintain revenue buoyancy as workers retire.

60.
It is critically important to re-invigorate the momentum for entitlement reform. The
Administration has offered some useful suggestions—including for “progressive price
indexation”—and the challenge for policymakers is to form the necessary consensus to
develop a package of reforms that can place the Social Security system on a sustainable
basis. However, especially with the addition of the new prescription drug benefit, the
financial shortfall of the Medicare system dwarfs that of Social Security, and while highdeductible health plans and other measures may help improve incentives, a broader,
fundamental reform of the U.S. health care system seems necessary.
61.
Leadership by the United States remains key to global trade liberalization.
Continued U.S. commitment and initiative is needed to ensure sufficient momentum for an
ambitious conclusion to the Doha Round negotiations. At the same time, care will be needed
to resist domestic protectionist sentiment and to ensure that bilateral trade initiatives
complement rather than substitute multilateral approaches. Further boosting ODA would help
achieve the ambitious goals already agreed to support the poorest countries in the world.
62.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with the United States will be held
on the regular 12-month cycle.

Understanding Fan Charts
The fan charts in Figure 1 summarize staffs’ assessment of the overall impact of risks to
baseline GDP growth and CPI inflation forecasts. The uncertainty around the baseline
(which reflects the “most likely” outcome) is captured by the fan chart’s width, while the
balance of risks—up or down—is reflected in its asymmetry. For example, the growth fan
chart is negatively skewed, suggesting downside risk to staff’s baseline growth forecast.
Two key inputs are required to construct a fan chart:
•

A measure of the inherent reliability of the baseline forecast. Staff used the standard
deviation of the forecast error, calculated from the growth forecast errors in the April
World Economic Outlook over 1992–2005.

•

The balance of risks to the baseline forecast. Staff assessed four risks to baseline
growth, stemming from the housing market, labor productivity, financial conditions (all
of which were assessed to produce downside risks to growth), and corporate spending (an
upside risk). Staff also considered the impact of unlikely “discontinuous” events with
large effects on growth—an Avian flu pandemic, other geopolitical risks (including a
sharp spike in oil prices), and a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances. The balance
of risks for 2006 implies that the average (mean) forecast for growth is ¼ percent below
the staff’s most likely (mode) forecast, and this difference rises further in 2007.

To provide a sense of the assumptions underpinning a specific risk imbedded in the growth
fan chart, it is useful to elaborate on the risks to growth stemming from the U.S. housing
market in 2006—the largest “continuous” risk to the baseline forecast. The baseline growth
forecast assumes real house price growth will slow to 5 percent in 2006, implying a drag on
GDP growth from the housing market of approximately ½ percent in 2006 and in 2007.
Staff then assessed two extreme but equally likely outcomes in the housing market. A
downside risk is that nominal house prices will remain unchanged over the next year (real
prices fall moderately) and residential investment growth turns negative. In this case,
assuming a larger housing wealth effect of 10 cents in the dollar owing to a rapid slowdown
in home equity withdrawal, GDP growth is expected to fall by 1 percent relative to the 2006
baseline. Staff also considered an upside risk that house price inflation and activity in 2006
remains the same as in 2005, implying a ½ percentage point higher GDP growth than in the
baseline forecast.
Risks to inflation were considered to be on the upside. The downside risks associated with
the potential for lower activity were offset by the potential boost to unit labor costs from
slower-than-expected productivity growth. The upside risk comes from adding the possibility
that high oil costs would be passed through to prices.

SUMMARIES OF BACKGROUND WORK ISSUED AS WORKING PAPERS
1. Is Housing Wealth an ‘ATM’? The Relationship between Household Wealth,
Home Equity Withdrawal, and Saving Rates
by Vladimir Klyuev and Paul Mills (WP/06/162)
The increase in U.S. home equity withdrawal (HEW) in recent years is often associated
with the decline of the U.S. household saving rate. HEW is net new household borrowing
secured on dwellings in excess of actual investment in housing. HEW increased from around
1 percent of U.S. net disposable income in the early 1990s to 9 percent in 2005—a period
during which the ratio of household saving to disposable income fell from 7 percent to minus
0.5 percent. Some analysts have therefore argued that U.S. households have mainly used
HEW to finance consumption, whereas others contend that HEW has been used to acquire
financial assets, with lower saving a consequence of rising household wealth.
The paper analyzes the relationship between HEW, household wealth, and the saving rate
for four countries. Given similar trends in home ownership, personal wealth and saving in
the United States, Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, the paper investigates
whether developments in these countries can shed light on the future path for U.S. HEW and
household saving.
Trends in HEW
All countries have experienced considerable financial innovation, which has improved
access to home equity. Mortgage market innovations in all four countries mean that, to
varying degrees, borrowing constraints on middle- and low-income households have been
relaxed, the cost of refinancing has fallen, and housing equity can be accessed at lower
transactions costs. This is illustrated by the increasing share of secured credit in household
debt in the United States. The increase in the liquidity of home equity is also likely to reduce
the volatility of consumption and increase the attractiveness of owning a home by making it a
more readily accessible store of value.
However, HEW does not appear to have played a consistent role across countries:
•

While the decline in personal saving has been relatively similar, HEW trends have
differed markedly across countries. In the United States, HEW has been on an
upward trend since the mid-1990s, consistent with the stylized fact that HEW tends to
rise with housing market turnover and real house price inflation. HEW has exhibited a
more cyclical pattern in the U.K. and Australia, with the latter also showing some
trend increase. In Canada, the household sector in aggregate has almost never
withdrawn equity from their housing assets.

•

Survey evidence indicates that HEW is used for a variety of purposes, with
consumer spending taking only a modest share. Evidence from the United States,

45

ANNEX II

the U.K., and Australia indicates that acquisition of financial assets and repayment of
other debts constituted the principal uses of HEW, with about 15-25 percent of
withdrawn equity being used to finance consumption. In these surveys, a similar
amount is used for home improvement, which is counted as residential investment
and is not included in the national accounts definition of HEW.
The link between HEW and the net acquisition of financial assets by households is less
clear in the aggregate data. Unlike the synchronous rise in HEW and decline in the personal
saving rate, the acquisition of financial assets in the United States, Australia, and the United
Kingdom has not exhibited a clear trend. In Canada, household saving declined against the
background of growing home equity injection and a declining flow into net financial assets.
Regression results
Regression results indicate that HEW does not affect household saving rates in the long
run, including in the United States. In the long run, the personal saving rates are largely
determined by the ratio of household net worth to disposable income, the real interest rate,
and the inflation rate. A time trend, probably reflecting financial market liberalization and
innovation, also helps to explain the path of the U.S. saving rate.
Regressions do suggest, however, that HEW may have a notable short-run effect on
saving. Changes in HEW are estimated to lead to a 15–20 cents in the dollar temporary offset
on U.S. household saving, consistent with the survey evidence, although the impact is not
statistically significant. Results for other countries vary, with the U.K. regression indicating a
larger (and significant) effect, while the effects in Australia and Canada are estimated to be
somewhat smaller than in the in the United States and insignificant.
Policy implications
Accessing housing wealth through HEW appears to have a short-term impact on
household saving, while long-term trends are dominated by changes in household wealth
and real interest rates. This presumably reflects the fact that different forms of wealth are
increasingly fungible over time. One implication is that mortgage market innovation—such
as lower transaction costs and easier access to home equity—may well increase the level and
volatility of HEW, but there should be some benefit to macroeconomic stability from
allowing households to more effectively smooth consumption over time.
Turning to the current conjecture, the likely fall in HEW as the housing market cools
should support some rise in the U.S. household saving rate. Recent experience in the U.K.
and Australia indicates that HEW could fall significantly as the housing market decelerates.
Was HEW to rapidly revert to its long-term average of around 1 percentage point, regression
coefficients imply a temporary boost to household saving of 1 percentage point or so,
combined with a negative impact on residential investment spending on home improvement.

2. U.S. Inflation Dynamics: What Drives Them Over Different Frequencies?
by Ravi Balakrishnan and Sam Ouliaris (WP/06/159)
As in many other industrialized countries, inflation in the U.S. has remained low since the
mid-1990s. This favorable outcome has occurred despite generally robust economic growth
and substantial oil and commodity price increases.
The academic literature offers only limited explanation for this decline in inflation.
Traditional empirical models tend to over-predict inflation, particularly after the mid-1990s,
and most researchers have argued that improved monetary policy credibility and increased
globalization have contributed to the decline in price pressures.
The paper seeks to improve the understanding of U.S. inflation dynamics by separating
structural from cyclical effects, and by studying the impact of external factors. Using data
for 1960-2005, frequency domain decompositions reveal that there has been a smooth,
secular decline in underlying inflation that started around 1980. The paper also finds a
reduction in the size and volatility of the business cycle component of inflation over a similar
period, with indications that the growing impact of globalization has played a role in this
development.
Two models are used to analyzing the inflation-output tradeoff. The traditional Phillips
curve (TPC) focuses on the role of lagged inflation and the output gap on inflation. The
forward-looking New Keynesian Phillips Curve approach places more emphasis on expected
future inflation and movements in marginal producer costs.
Traditional Phillips Curve
The TPC model enhances the understanding of cyclical inflation movements but still over
predicts inflation. The model produces relatively good forecasts for the business cycle
component of inflation. However, even after incorporating external shocks to capture the
impact of imported inflation—proxied by movements in the terms of trade—much of the
trend decline in inflation is unexplained. This suggests that the decline in inflation since the
1980s is a structural, as opposed to cyclical, phenomenon.
Several factors are likely to contribute to the model’s shortcomings. Apart from ignoring
forward-looking inflation expectations, possible shifts in the expectation formation process—
for example due to enhanced U.S. monetary policy credibility—may also play a role.
Moreover, significant measurement error in the output gap estimate, especially in view of the
apparent increase in structural productivity growth during the second half of the 1990s, may
have contributed to the upward bias in inflation projections.

47

ANNEX II

New Keynesian Phillips Curve
The New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) model offers theoretical improvements over
the traditional Phillips curve approach. To address some of the shortcomings inherent in
TPC models, these models use forward-looking inflation expectations and focus on changes
in marginal costs—which should directly affect producers’ pricing decisions—rather than
measures of the output gap.
Although the NKPC also falls short of explaining the decline in structural inflation, the
results suggest that the link between production costs and inflation has weakened over
time. Using the labor share in GDP as a proxy for marginal production costs, we find that the
relationship between inflation and marginal costs breaks down in the late 1990s—around the
same time the TPC model starts to over-predict inflation. This finding is robust to changes in
the definition of the labor share, such as stripping out stock options from labor income.
External variables improve the fit of the NKPC, providing support to the hypothesis that
trade and global factor markets have helped to reduce inflation. The basic model was
extended by introducing imported intermediate goods and allowing desired price mark-ups to
vary with the business cycle and the degree of competition. This improved the overall
performance of the model, although the impact and significance of external variables are
evident mainly in the cyclical component.
Policy implications
The paper finds that downward price pressures related to globalization appear to be largely
cyclical in nature, suggesting that their beneficial impact on inflation could wane earlier
than expected. The decomposition of inflation into its cyclical component and secular trend
components reveals that excess demand, terms-of-trade shocks, and competitive pressures
linked to globalization operate mainly over the cycle. The result for globalization is
particularly important, as it suggests that competitive effects coming from low-cost producers
and higher global competition are unlikely to keep inflation low on a permanent basis.
This suggests that preserving and strengthening monetary policy credibility will be key to
cementing the secular decline in inflation. Given the limited role identified for other factors,
higher credibility not only appears to have contributed to the trend decline in inflation but
also to have lowered the variability of inflation around its long-run path. Pinning down the
structural and cyclical implications of monetary policy credibility will be an important
project for future research.

3. U.S. Dollar Risk Premiums and Capital Flows
by Ravi Balakrishnan and Volodymyr Tulin (WP/06/160)
Although the U.S. current account deficit has so far been easily financed, questions about
the availability of future financing have been mounting. Following a steady deterioration
since the early 1990s, the U.S. current account deficit reached a record 6½ percent of GDP in
2005. While this has been financed without placing any obvious pressure on U.S. interest
rates or the dollar, many analysts and policymakers have cautioned that the current trajectory
of U.S. net foreign liabilities is unsustainable, suggesting that market sentiment toward U.S.
dollar assets could weaken significantly.
The paper sheds light on the attractiveness for U.S. assets by studying dollar risk
premiums and linking them to bilateral capital flows. First, bilateral risk premiums on the
U.S. dollar are estimated, using an uncovered interest parity framework and Consensus
exchange rate forecasts. Second, the paper analyzes the link between capital flows and
measured risk premiums for various regions. Finally, the paper uses regression analysis to
test whether macroeconomic factors have had an influence on movements in risk premiums.
Risk premiums were estimated at one- and two-year horizons for the dollar against the
pound sterling, the Canadian dollar, the euro, and the yen. These series were also used to
construct “global” dollar risk premium measures.
Results
Dollar risk premiums have generally been negative in recent years.12 This is consistent with
investors buying U.S. assets for reasons other than expected returns, such as the presence of a
wider range of financial instruments, or liquidity or security preferences. However, premiums
have exhibited large fluctuations against the Japanese yen and the euro:
•

The risk premium vis-à-vis the euro declined to about –10 percent in 2000, but has
now moved closer to zero.

•

The risk premium against the yen has generally been positive, but turned negative in
recent years—consistent with studies that find Japanese home bias declining from
extremely high levels in the past.

•

The overall risk premium has largely remained negative in recent years. Rising
expectations of dollar depreciation have only been partly offset by growing interest
differentials in favor of the United States.

12

For the purpose of this paper, a dollar risk premium is defined as the difference in one or two-year interest
rates on U.S. and foreign assets, adjusted for expected changes in the exchange rate. A negative premium
implies that investors accept a negative expected return by investing in U.S. interest-bearing assets.

49

ANNEX II

These trends coincided with a substantial increase in capital flows into the United States in
recent years. The rise in U.S. net liabilities has occurred mostly through increases in fixed
income securities, which were purchased largely by investors in the euro area, Japan, and
emerging Asian economies. European investors acquired mainly corporate bonds and equity,
whereas Japan and emerging Asia invested primarily into treasury bonds. The coincidence of
riskier investment patterns and—on occasion—strongly negative risk premiums on the dollar
against the euro suggests that European investors may have had a greater risk appetite than
Asian investors as far as U.S. assets have been concerned.
Fluctuations in dollar sentiment seem to be largely unrelated to macroeconomic
developments. Regressions of risk premiums on variables such as debt sustainability
indicators and U.S.-foreign growth differentials generally yielded incorrectly signed or
insignificant coefficients.
On the other hand, differences in regional risk appetites, and the aftermath of the Asia
crisis, appear to have had a measurable influence on dollar sentiment. In particular, an
increase in risk appetites in the U.K. and the euro area—as measured by investors’ revealed
preference for purchasing corporate bonds over safer Treasury assets—tends to go hand in
hand with a decline in risk premiums on the dollar.
Policy implications
The constellation of negative risk premiums and record capital inflows could suggest that
investors may favor U.S. investments for structural reasons. The paper found that measures
that influence expected returns—such as relative growth prospects—appear to have not been
particularly important. One possible explanation could be that the Asian crisis created a large
pool of savings searching for low-risk investment opportunities, which were provided by
relatively deep, liquid, and innovative U.S. financial markets. Moreover, continued inflows
of European funds into the United States suggest that investors are attracted by the wide
array of instruments with different risk/return characteristics that only U.S. markets currently
offer.
Looking forward, the allocative efficiency of U.S financial markets could mitigate the risks
of a disorderly unwinding of global current account imbalances. To be sure, there is the
risk that foreign investors will begin to demand a sharp increase in relative compensation for
dollar assets without a rapid dollar depreciation. However, the likelihood of such an adverse
scenario is reduced by the dollar’s role as global reserve currency; the recent improvement in
economic prospects in other regions; and by the continued attractiveness of the U.S. financial
system, assuming that continued innovation retains its advantage over other financial
markets.

4. How Might a Disorderly Resolution of Global Imbalances Affect Global Wealth?
by Francis E. Warnock (WP/06/170)
The widening U.S. current account deficit and the associated large positions that
foreigners have amassed in U.S. securities have garnered much attention. This paper
addresses the question how a disorderly adjustment that involves a marked shift in investor
preferences away from U.S. assets might impact the wealth of residents in a wide range of
foreign countries. To provide a sense of the orders of magnitude involved, a stylized scenario
is analyzed in which there is a simultaneous decline in the value of the dollar against all other
currencies, accompanied by a fall in U.S. bond and equity prices.
Very similar results are found using two surveys of international investment positions with
different strengths and weaknesses:
•

The comprehensive U.S. benchmark liabilities survey is of extremely high quality,
but liabilities are subject to a custodial center bias from the use of third-country
custodians. If, for example, a German resident holds a U.S. corporate bond through a
custodian in Luxembourg, the survey will attribute the holdings to Luxembourg. The
survey can only access the first foreign address, not that of the ultimate holder.

•

The IMF’s December 2004 Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) does
not yet have the same level of overall quality, since many of the participants are still
refining their survey techniques. However, as it compiles results from individual
country’s asset surveys, it suffers less from the custodial center bias.

A disorderly adjustment is illustrated by assuming a simultaneous 10 percent decline in the
U.S. currency and prices in equity and bond markets. The combination of all three markets
moving in the same direction is indicative of a shift in investor preferences. However, the
calculations are based on the assumption that the scenario would impact U.S. markets only,
which may be regarded as somewhat unlikely.
The impact would be to lower the rest of the world’s wealth by about 5 percentage points of
GDP. In aggregate, foreigners have accumulated large positions in U.S. bonds and equities—
roughly $5 trillion by mid-2004—with considerable variation in exposure across countries.
The analysis suggests that for every 10 percent drop in U.S. bond prices and in the exchange
value of the dollar, aggregate wealth losses for the rest of the world would amount to
2½ percentage points of their GDP. If, in addition, U.S. equity markets also declined by
10 percent, foreigners would incur losses of another 1½ percentage points of GDP. Including
losses through the rest of the world’s exposure to dollar-denominated bonds issued by
foreign countries, brings the total loss to nearly 5 percentage points of GDP.
These losses are about half as large as those experienced by U.S. residents. A 10 percent
decrease in U.S. equity and bond markets would lead to a decrease in U.S. wealth of almost

51

ANNEX II

11 percentage points of GDP. Partially offsetting this would be the 2 percentage point gain
from the currency appreciation on U.S. investors’ foreign portfolio holdings.
The exposure of the rest of the world to U.S. assets has increased rapidly over time,
reflecting rapid internationalization of asset markets as well as large U.S. external deficits.
Aggregate losses from U.S. assets based on the disorderly scenario discussed above would
have been 1 percentage point of foreign GDP in 1994, 3 percentage points in 2000, and
4 percentage points as of 2004. Examining the impact across more than 50 countries
illustrates that the increased exposure to U.S. securities markets over the past decade has
been broadly based.
The exposure to U.S. assets is similar for developed countries and for emerging markets,
but for emerging markets reserve holdings are more important. Foreign countries, and
especially emerging markets, are more exposed to U.S. bonds than to U.S. equities. While the
average overall exposure of developed countries and emerging markets is very similar (when
normalized by GDP), the exposure of the public sector is much larger for emerging markets.
The analysis of reserves positions suggests that public sector losses in emerging markets
could amount to about 2¾ percentage points of GDP.
Exposures vary significantly across individual countries. Excluding financial centers where
losses are artificially high due to large custodial bias (Belgium, Hong Kong, Luxembourg,
Singapore, and parts of the Caribbean), countries with high losses include Ireland
(14½ percent of GDP), Taiwan and the Netherlands (8 percent), Canada, Norway, Sweden,
and the United Kingdom (5–6 percent), and China, Japan, and Middle East oil exporters
(4–4½ percent). These countries could also incur additional losses through custodial centers.
Policy implications
Rapidly growing holdings of foreign assets have increased the potential for international
wealth spillovers. While global wealth effects from a significant depreciation in the dollar
and fall in the value of U.S. asset prices were trivial as late as of the mid-1990s, these effects
have quadrupled and become systemically important. As a result, the impact of a sudden
adverse shock to U.S. asset prices on foreign wealth could be as large as half the impact on
U.S. wealth (relative to foreign and U.S. GDP, respectively).
The similarity of the exposures of emerging markets and developed countries underlines
growing links within the international monetary system. Emerging Asia and, more recently,
oil exporters have become important sources of capital inflows to the United States. One
important difference, however, is that for emerging markets most of the losses would be
experienced by governments, while in the developed world the impact would be primarily on
the private sector.

5. Moving to Territoriality? Implications for the United States
and the Rest of the World
by Peter Mullins (WP/06/161)
The Report of President’s Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform includes a suggestion to
move the corporation tax from its present worldwide basis to a territorial basis. Under the
worldwide tax system, profits earned abroad are taxed in the United States when they are
repatriated, but with a credit for foreign taxes paid. Under the territorial tax system, profits
earned abroad would be exempt in the United States. The paper considers the implications of
such a reform for the United States and the rest of the world.
Impact on the United States
Advocates of territorial taxation argue that it would increase the competitiveness of U.S.
firms in foreign markets. This is because foreign earnings of U.S. firms would not be taxed
at U.S. corporate rates, which are relatively high by international comparison. Other
arguments used to support territoriality include: removing a distortionary incentive to retain
profits offshore, which could increase domestic investment; eliminating some avoidance
opportunities; and greater simplicity.
Opponents argue that territoriality will encourage U.S. firms to invest abroad rather than
in the United States. In their view, the gains from simplification would be minimal, as many
of the current complex rules would still apply under a territorial system, and some existing
problems (such as transfer pricing) would be exacerbated.
The potential benefits to the United States from adopting a territorial system are not clear
cut. Against this background, there may be merit in an often proposed alternative that would
retain the worldwide system but remove the current deferral of tax until repatriation (and
hence the bias against this behavior) and tightening foreign tax crediting rules.
Impact on the foreign countries
The rest of the world’s interest in a move by the United States to a territorial system would
partly depend on its impact on U.S. FDI abroad. The United States is the leading source of
FDI, accounting for around 20 percent of the worldwide stock, and relatively small changes
could have a large impact on some other countries. Recipient countries would benefit to the
extent that increased U.S. FDI inflows would not displace FDI from elsewhere, leading to a
net gain in revenue.
The impact on foreign tax revenues is potentially sizable. The amount of revenue at stake is
significant as foreign taxes paid by U.S. companies on foreign source income amounted to
$44½ billion in 2001, of which about a third accrued to developing countries.

53

ANNEX II

In considering the implications for the rest of the world, the paper addresses three key
questions:
•

Would the territorial system change the level and location of U.S. FDI? The
empirical evidence suggests that a U.S. move to a territorial system could lead to
changes in the location of FDI (in response to differences in national tax rates) but
would leave the overall level of U.S. FDI roughly unchanged. This result reflects a
number of factors, including the impact of other tax changes associated with the move
to a territorial system—such as limits on expense deductibility and foreign tax crosscrediting; the tax exemption already provided under the current system (largely
through tax deferral); and the possibility that increased U.S. FDI would replace nonU.S. FDI.

•

Would the territorial system encourage tax competition to attract U.S. FDI? To the
extent that countries are already competing to attract investment from other countries
with territorial systems, the additional impact on tax competition may be limited.
However, some countries that are currently setting tax rates to “soak up” U.S. foreign
tax credits may move to a territorial system, which could encourage others to reduce
rates to attract more FDI.

•

Would other countries follow the United States lead and move to a territorial
system? Except in the Latin American region, many emerging markets and
developing countries have generally shifted toward territorial taxation, and adoption
by the United States could provide further encouragement in this direction. However,
given the scope for abuse under a territorial system (e.g., related to transfer pricing),
the revenue impact could be negative for countries without strong administrative
systems in place. Moreover, most double tax treaties provide for taxes on
multinational corporations to be collected by the source country. Therefore, U.S.
treaty partners may feel under pressure to reduce their tax rates in order to attract U.S.
FDI.

Policy implications
A move to territoriality may have tax revenue implications for the United States. The direct
effect of exempting foreign source income would be to reduce tax revenues, although the Tax
Panel and other analysts argue that the proposal would be largely revenue-neutral or even
increase revenues. This is due to the possible increase in investment in the United States as a
result of earlier profit repatriation, as well as the effect of other proposed tax changes
associated with the territorial system.
A move by the United States could also intensify tax competition amongst developing
countries. Although countries already competing for FDI from other destinations would be
less affected, countries where U.S. FDI has traditionally been most important could
experience additional pressures on revenues.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
July 24, 2006

1.
This note reports on information that has become available since the staff report
was issued. The topics covered include the recent economic and financial market
developments, monetary policy prospects, and the budget outlook. They do not affect the
staff appraisal.
Recent economic and financial market developments
2.
Recent developments continue to point to a gradual slowing in activity. June payroll
employment rose by only 121,000, but with stronger growth in the household employment
survey, the unemployment rate remained steady at 4.6 percent. Indicators continue to suggest
that the housing market is cooling, with weaker housing starts and building permits in June.
Retail sales retreated 0.1 percent and producer and consumer sentiment have both softened.
However, industrial production increased 0.8 percent in June, and relatively strong export
growth helped keep the trade deficit broadly stable at $63.8 billion in May, suggesting an
upside risk to the staff’s estimate of real net exports.
3.
Core CPI inflation again exceeded expectations in June. The 12-month increase in
overall and core consumer prices ticked up to 4.3 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively, with
the increase in core inflation slightly above market expectations. While 12-month core
producer price inflation was stable and in line with expectations at 1.9 percent, headline PPI
inflation rose to 4.8 percent and hourly wage growth accelerated to close to 4 percent in June.
However, spreads between conventional and inflation-indexed 10-year bonds remained stable
at around 2.6 percent, suggesting that inflation expectations remain relatively well anchored.
4.
U.S. financial markets have softened in response to signs of slowing activity. Longterm bond yields have decreased by about 10 basis points to just over 5 percent and equity
prices have fallen by 1½ to 2 percent since end-June. Market expectations regarding the nearterm course of monetary policy have remained broadly unchanged, with futures prices
suggesting a roughly 50 percent probability of a 25 basis point hike in the federal funds rate
at the early August meeting of the Federal Open Markets Committee.
Monetary and fiscal developments
5.
The Federal Reserve’s semi-annual Monetary Policy Report (MPR) was presented
to Congress on July 19 by Chairman Bernanke. The MPR projects that core PCE inflation
(which has been running around a ¼ percentage point lower than core CPI inflation) will
likely ease from around 2¼–2½ percent in 2006 (fourth quarter on fourth quarter) to slightly
above 2 percent in 2007. Economic growth is projected to moderate from around 3¼–3½
percent this year (again fourth quarter on fourth quarter) to around 3–3¼ percent in 2007.
Both forecasts are broadly in line with staff projections. The Chairman acknowledged the

-2-

recent rise in core inflation but appeared confident that, with growth slowing, inflation would
ease later in the year, prompting markets to rally.
6.
The Administration’s Mid-Session Review sharply lowered the forecast budget
deficit for this year to a level consistent with staff projections. Reflecting buoyant and
broad-based revenue growth through June, the Administration lowered its projection for the
FY 2006 unified federal deficit (ends this September 30) to $296 billion (2¼ percent of
GDP), from its February estimate of $423 billion (3¼ percent of GDP), leaving the forecast
identical to the staff’s. The strong revenue growth, together with expectations of further
compression in the expenditure ratio beyond FY 2008 owing to higher growth, have also led
the Administration to reduce projected deficits for FY2007–11 by ¼–½ percent of GDP
(Table), with the unified federal deficit projected to fall below 1 percent of GDP by FY 2010.
7.
The Mid-Session Review emphasized the need to address the long-term fiscal
challenge posed by the unsustainable growth in entitlement spending. It noted that
“...entitlement spending in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid is growing faster than
the economy and the Nation’s ability to pay for this spending. No plausible amount of cuts to
discretionary programs or tax increases can avert this major fiscal challenge,” underscoring
the urgent need for entitlement reform.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with the
United States
On July 24, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the United States.1
Background
The U.S. economy continued to grow strongly over the last year even in the face of a withdrawal
of monetary stimulus and high oil prices. Household spending remained the principal driver of
the expansion, spurred by mortgage borrowing and double-digit house price inflation. However,
employment and wage growth remained modest, and the household saving ratio moved further
into negative territory. As a result, and despite strong business saving and an improvement in
the fiscal balance, the current account deficit reached a new record high.
Household consumption and residential investment have grown an average ½ percentage point
faster than GDP since the 2001 recession, financed in large part through home equity
withdrawal, stimulated by rapid house price inflation as well as innovative mortgage
instruments, low refinancing costs, and easy access to tax-advantaged home equity loans.
However, U.S. house prices now appear to be overvalued and with signs that market conditions
are cooling, the housing market is no longer likely to provide significant support to household
spending.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
During the past year, business investment also remained robust, supported by declines in
capital goods prices, the economic expansion, and high profits, even in the face of higher
interest rates. U.S. businesses have generally used high profits and low interest rates to
strengthen balance sheets and accumulate cash holding, suggesting that the fundamentals for
investment remain strong.
With sustained strong growth and recent hikes in oil and commodity prices, resource utilization
has increased and headline inflation remained high. Although core CPI inflation had been
relatively subdued, in recent months the core rate has risen sharply, exceeding 2½ percent in
June (12-month rate). At the same time, the unemployment rate—at just above 4½ percent in
June—remains at the low end of most estimates of the NAIRU, and capacity utilization reached
its long-run average. Nevertheless, unit labor costs have remained contained, reflecting solid
productivity growth and modest wage gains.
The current account deficit has widened on higher oil prices and solid import demand, and
stood at about 6½ percent of GDP in the first quarter of 2006. Nevertheless, the dollar remained
broadly stable, and the U.S. net foreign liability position barely deteriorated in 2005, reflecting
the valuation effects of the relative strength of foreign equity markets.
U.S. financial markets have provided important support to the expansion and facilitated the U.S.
economy’s ability to access foreign saving. Financial market innovation—including securitization
and credit risk transfer techniques—contributed to low credit risk spreads and improved the
pricing and allocation of credit risk. The increased activity of hedge funds has enhanced price
discovery and liquidity in many of the new markets. At the same time, banks remained wellcapitalized and highly profitable despite changing market conditions. While bank revenues
continued to depend on the real estate market, widespread securitization has helped reduce
vulnerabilities to regional shocks, and a range of indicators suggest that systemic risks are at a
low ebb.
Against this background, the Federal Reserve Board continued to gradually withdraw monetary
stimulus, raising the federal funds rate to 5 percent by the time of the Article IV discussions and
further to 5¼ percent after the June 28-29 meeting of the Federal Market Open Committee
(FOMC). On the fiscal front, federal tax revenues remained buoyant and expenditure discipline
has been maintained, suggesting that the FY 2006 federal budget deficit is likely to outperform
initial budget estimates and fall modestly to 2¼ percent of GDP. Looking forward, the
Administration appears on track for achieving its goal of halving the federal budget deficit earlier
than FY 2009.
The staff’s baseline scenario for the short-term outlook is for a “soft landing,” with growth easing
to potential and inflation remaining contained. The housing market is likely to cool in response
to high valuations and tightening financial conditions, reducing the impetus from consumption
and residential investment, but strong fundamentals should continue to support business
investment. The external deficit is likely to remain wide, but the drag on activity from net exports
will lessen as growth abroad strengthens. On the supply side, solid productivity growth should
accommodate wage gains while containing price pressures.

3
There appear to be competing risks to this outlook. The possibility of a more abrupt slowdown in
the housing market, disappointments on the productivity front, and a disorderly adjustment to
global imbalances, as well as the risk of higher oil prices more than offset the upside potential
for business investment. Avian flu and geopolitical events represent further and more difficult to
quantify downside risks. In contrast, inflation risks—which mainly stem from supply effects—
seem mostly on the upside. These include the possibility of a larger-than-anticipated
productivity slowdown pushing up unit labor costs, and the potential for pass-through of high
commodity and oil prices.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They noted that—despite a
significant withdrawal of monetary stimulus, high energy prices, and other shocks—the U.S.
economy continues to be a key engine of global growth, supported by strong productivity
increases. Encouragingly, buoyant tax revenues are likely to keep the FY 2006 federal deficit
well below initial budget estimates. Also, Directors commended the Federal Reserve for the
measured pace of its monetary tightening which, accompanied by a clear communications
policy, has helped keep inflationary expectations in check while avoiding a pronounced
slowdown in activity.
Looking forward, Directors saw good prospects for a soft landing of the economy, with growth
likely to ease to a more sustainable rate and inflation to remain contained. However, most
Directors cautioned that risks to activity are on the downside, reflecting a cooling housing
market, higher energy prices, and a negative household saving rate. At the same time, these
Directors observed that the recent pick up in core inflation and expectations, coupled with a
further drop in the unemployment rate, suggests a risk of a build up in price pressures.
Given these competing risks, Directors observed that the Federal Reserve will need to steer an
especially delicate course that limits downside risks to activity while ensuring that inflation
expectations remain anchored. In such circumstances, future policy decisions would depend
heavily on evolving views on the outlook as well as the importance of ensuring that inflation
expectations are kept in check.
Directors remarked that the Fed’s communications strategy in recent years has been highly
effective. Nonetheless, a number of Directors suggested that there could be merit in the Fed
providing a more explicit statement of its inflation objective, noting that this could help further
anchor inflation expectations without undermining confidence in the Fed’s commitment to its
broader mandate. In this context, some Directors remarked that a formal inflation target might
bring little additional gain to the Fed’s well-established credibility, while having implications for
the Fed’s other policy objectives. Directors looked forward to a further consideration of these
issues, and welcomed the recent establishment of a committee to examine the Fed’s overall
communication policy, including refining the definition of price stability. Some Directors also
observed that providing more frequent Monetary Policy Reports with a greater focus on future
developments could further increase the Fed’s high level of transparency.

4
Directors recognized that the U.S. financial sector has proven innovative and resilient in recent
years, and noted that the financial system appears well-positioned as the credit cycle turns.
At the same time, Directors saw important areas where further reform could help enhance the
financial system’s resilience and efficiency. These included tightening the supervision of the
housing Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs), reforming rules for defined-benefit
pension plan, and possibly moving to consolidate supervision and regulation of insurance
companies. Directors welcomed the authorities’ willingness to undertake an IMF Financial
Sector Assessment Program, which they considered could provide further insights on these
challenges, as well as a good framework for further analysis of the systemic role of the U.S.
financial markets. It would be similarly beneficial to publish a regular Financial Stability Report.
Directors cautioned that demographic and other pressures continue to threaten long-term fiscal
sustainability and economic prospects, especially given the need to accommodate the
increased demands on public health and retirement systems from an aging population.
They therefore welcomed the authorities’ recognition of the importance of fiscal consolidation,
including entitlement reform. With buoyant revenues supporting deficit reduction, most Directors
suggested that the time is opportune to establish a more ambitious medium-term fiscal anchor.
In particular, they noted that balancing the budget, excluding the Social Security surplus, within
the next five years would set the federal debt ratio on a firm downward path. This would reduce
the burden on future generations of providing health care and retirement income to the baby
boom generation, while also providing the needed room to develop and phase in the reforms
required to place entitlement systems on a more sustainable basis. It was observed that this
would require consolidation of around ¾ percentage point of GDP a year. Such consolidation
would provide a helpful boost to national saving and multilateral efforts to narrow global
imbalances while having a manageable impact on U.S. and global demand. A few Directors
cautioned that too rapid a fiscal consolidation could lower U.S. and global growth.
Several Directors observed that planned expenditure discipline may be difficult to sustain,
especially in light of pressures to fund defense commitments and other emergency priorities.
To help contain spending pressures, these Directors suggested there could be merit in reintroducing caps on discretionary outlays, as well as pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirements
covering both entitlement spending and tax measures.
Although controlling outlays should remain central to deficit reduction, most Directors suggested
that revenue measures should not be ruled out. They cautioned that it may be difficult to sustain
the significant reductions in marginal tax rates of recent years while meeting the fiscal burden
from population aging. They agreed that the priority should be on reforms that broaden the
revenue base by reducing tax preferences, including those for mortgage interest payments,
employers’ contributions to health insurance plan premiums, and state and local tax payments,
as suggested by the President’s Advisory Panel. A number of Directors also agreed that
consideration could be given to consumption-based indirect taxes—such as a national sales
tax, a VAT, or energy taxation—that would maintain revenue buoyancy as workers retire.
Directors stressed the importance of re-invigorating the momentum for entitlement reform,
and welcomed the proposed bipartisan commission to review this issue, which will be tasked
with preparing proposals for reforming all three major entitlement programs to address future

5
shortfalls. They noted that useful reform options have already been suggested—including for
“progressive price indexation”—and that the key challenge now is to build the necessary
consensus around a package of measures that would place the Social Security system on a
more sustainable basis. However, concrete proposals will also be required to address Medicare
and Medicaid funding gaps, especially given that with the addition of the new prescription drug
benefit, the financial shortfall of the Medicare system dwarfs that of Social Security. While highdeductible health plans and other measures may help improve incentives, with health spending
as a ratio-to-GDP well above the OECD average, Directors suggested that fundamental reform
of the U.S. health care system would seem to be necessary.
At a more systemic level, and in light of the high U.S. current account deficit, Directors noted the
risks in the medium term of a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances. While several Directors
considered such risks to be relatively low, Directors agreed that the United States has a key role
to play in supporting the cooperative strategy for an orderly resolution of global imbalances laid
out by the International Monetary and Financial Committee in April 2006. In particular, they
underscored the importance of boosting U.S. national saving, through ambitious fiscal
consolidation, while also preserving the resilience and flexibility of the U.S. economy.
Directors also generally considered that delaying the inevitable adjustment would mean
continued increases in U.S. external indebtedness, and heighten the risk of a sharp disruption
to exchange rates, financial markets, and growth—both domestically and abroad. In this
context, they looked forward to the results of the multilateral consultations surveillance initiative,
for the U.S. and other participating countries.
Directors agreed that leadership by the United States remains key to global trade liberalization,
especially given the growing urgency of achieving an ambitious conclusion to the Doha Round
negotiations. At the same time, most Directors cautioned that care would be needed to resist
domestic protectionist sentiment and to ensure that bilateral trade initiatives complement rather
than substitute multilateral approaches. While welcoming recent increases in U.S. overseas
development assistance, Directors called on the authorities to boost such assistance further,
noting that it remains one of the lowest among industrial countries as a proportion of gross
national income.
