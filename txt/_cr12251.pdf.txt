AUSTRIA
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 31, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context: Austria has relatively strong macroeconomic fundamentals and limited
economic slack, but deep ties with the rest of the euro area and the legacy of an overly
ambitious eastward financial sector expansion are creating substantial challenges.
Growth outlook and risks: After a strong 2011, a weak external environment is
slowing down growth, though buoyant wages should support private consumption. A
switch to a more domestic demand-led growth would help reduce imbalances within
the euro area. The main risks stem from a further intensification of the crisis in the euro
area and its ramifications to Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe (CESEE).
Fiscal Policy: The new medium-term structural consolidation path strikes an
appropriate balance between fiscal discipline and the cyclical needs of the economy,
but needs to be locked in by accelerated reforms to contain aging cost. In addition,
there are sizeable contingent liabilities from medium-sized bank restructuring.
Financial sector: Recovery in some CESEE credit markets is slower than expected. NPLs
are still rising and profitability is subdued, but large banks have strengthened their
capital and liquidity positions. Plans to restructure medium-sized banks that received
public support need revamping to allow more efficient disposals.
Structural issues: Labor market participation could be increased by reducing the
burden on labor from taxes and social security contributions and smoothing high tax
wedges. The budgetary impact could be offset by spending cuts or increases in less
distortionary taxes, such as real estate, excise, or environmental taxes.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

AUSTRIA

INTRODUCTION
1.
Austria has relatively strong macroeconomic fundamentals, but deep ties with the rest of
the euro area and the legacy of an overly ambitious eastward financial sector expansion are
creating substantial challenges. With intensified market scrutiny of sovereign and bank
creditworthiness in late 2011 and a sovereign rating downgrade in early 2012, the authorities reacted.
They introduced a fiscal rule and strengthened medium-term consolidation plans; and, in the banking
sector, they increased capital requirements and stepped up the monitoring of the funding sources of
large banking groups’ subsidiaries. This policy response and the ECB’s LTROs brought relief, but the
subsequent partial nationalization of the fourth-largest bank was a reminder of the challenges ahead.
2.
Policies need to preserve market confidence, increase resilience against future adverse
external spillovers, and boost potential growth. As in other euro area countries, fiscal policy must
balance the need to safeguard confidence in the sovereign with the risk of an excessive pro-cyclical
fiscal tightening. In the financial sector, regulation and supervision need to be strengthened without
causing a disruptive decline in credit supply (including in CESEE), while the fiscal costs of restructuring
intervened banks must be contained. To boost potential growth, the large tax wedges that discourage
labor supply and demand need to come down, but without adding to the fiscal deficit.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND
RISKS
Background
3.
Growth was strong in 2011, supported by buoyant employment, and the economy has
limited slack. For the year as a whole, growth amounted to 2.7 percent, mainly driven by strong
investment (Figure 1). The last half of the year was flat, but the first quarter of 2012 saw a recovery,
with broad-based growth of 0.3 percent q-o-q. Employment grew strongly, and unemployment
reached a post-2009 low of 4.2 percent in 2011, the lowest rate in the euro area. Wage growth
lagged inflation and stood at 2.7 percent in 2011.
4.
Inflation has fallen rapidly from its 2011 high, but wages are rising. At 3.6 percent
in 2011, inflation reached its highest level in decades as excise tax increases and a stronger passthrough of commodity price hikes opened a gap to Germany and the rest of the euro area. In the
first half of 2012, these effects subsided and the discrepancy narrowed, and inflation stood at
2.2 percent in June. On the other hand, negotiated wage growth has accelerated to above 3 percent,
reflecting the backward-looking wage setting mechanism but also, possibly, tight labor market
conditions. Housing prices accelerated in the first quarter of 2012, but after a long period of
stagnation (except for a few “hot spots” such as Vienna).
5.
The current account surplus is shrinking, reflecting in part cyclical factors. After peaking
in 2008 at 5 percent of GDP, the current account has narrowed, reaching 1.9 percent of GDP in 2011.
Staff calculations indicate that cyclical factors, namely a smaller output gap than trading partners

AUSTRIA

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

and less favorable terms of trade than the norm, lowered the CA surplus by 1.2 percentage points of
GDP. Imports were boosted by high energy prices, while exports as a share of GDP remained below
their 2008 record (Figure 2). Consistent with regional rebalancing, the bulk of the decline in the trade
balance in 2011 was against the rest of the euro area. The real and nominal exchange rates were
broadly stable in 2011. Unit labor cost growth accelerated, but in line with that in Austria’s trading
partners, while the global export market share continued its trend decline. Outward FDI and crossborder lending gathered steam, but some of Austrian portfolio investment abroad was withdrawn,
even as foreigners resumed portfolio investment in Austria. Capital flows into CESEE remain
depressed, with only timid signs of improvement, in part related to Austrian banks’ support to their
subsidiaries.
6.
The fiscal position has improved but public debt is still rising. In 2011, the deficit fell to
2.6 percent of GDP, but this improvement is likely to be partly reversed to some 3 percent of GDP
in 2012, on the back of slowing growth and significantly higher support to troubled medium-sized
banks (Figure 3). General government gross debt stood at 72 percent of GDP, up from a pre-crisis
level of 60 percent of GDP.
7.
Banks’ profitability in 2011 suffered from the continued deterioration of loan quality
in several CESEE countries and losses on securities portfolios.1 With consolidated assets of 380
percent of GDP, the banking sector is large relative to the economy, reflecting the strong presence
of Austrian banks in the CESEE region. In the face of funding pressures in European markets in the
second half of 2011, Austrian banks increased their reliance on central bank funding and cut their
external positions (Figure 4). These cuts focused on markets other than Austria and the CESEE, most
notably the euro area periphery – though exposure to Italy remains significant. The return on assets
fell sharply during 2011, including because of losses from the Greek PSI. With the recovery in CESEE
sluggish, large write-downs on goodwill for past acquisitions and continued provisioning on the
growing stock of NPLs were necessary. In addition, Hungary’s scheme to help borrowers indebted in
foreign currency caused sizable losses for Austrian banks.
Staff’s view
8.
Economic growth is set for a gradual recovery in late 2012 and throughout 2013. Even
with a projected slowdown around mid-year, some ¾ percent annual growth for 2012 should still be
in the offing. A continued growth revival thereafter, mainly on the back of domestic demand, would
point to 1¾ percent growth in 2013. On the other hand, protracted uncertainty about prospects in
the euro area will continue to cloud the landscape and preclude a more robust recovery. Annual
average inflation will be close to 2 percent in 2012 and remain around that level thereafter.
9.
Austria’s external balance is on the strong side relative to economic fundamentals, but
is expected to decline in line with regional re-equilibration. Although the real effective exchange
rate is close to a level consistent with fundamentals, the current account, at 1.9 percent of GDP
in 2011, is somewhat stronger than predicted by standard models, with the divergence reflecting

AUSTRIA

factors other than policy distortions.2 One of these factors, wage moderation, may now be coming to
an end, with real wage growth accelerating this year and expected to remain around ¾ percent in
the medium term. Accordingly, the current account surplus is projected to continue its recent
downward trend in the medium term as growth becomes more driven by domestic demand,
consistent with rebalancing within the euro area.
10.
Risks stem mainly from a further intensification of the euro area crisis and could lead
to a negative feedback loop between banking and sovereign risk. An escalation of financial
instability in the euro area would spill over to Austria through trade and financial linkages.3 Renewed
and protracted stress in wholesale funding markets for euro area banks, if not addressed by
offsetting policy measures, could impact Austrian banks by increasing their funding costs and,
ultimately, forcing them to contract their asset portfolio. The government may have to step in with
additional financial support in the form of capital injections or guarantees, thereby worsening the
sovereign fiscal position. Higher sovereign spreads, in turn, would push up bank funding costs,
exacerbating deleveraging.
11.
Spillovers via CESEE might further aggravate such a downside scenario. Growth in CESEE
would weaken because of trade and financial linkages with the euro area, with adverse repercussions
on the quality of the Austrian banks’ loan portfolios, already burdened by the legacy of
the 2008/2009 crisis. On the other hand, the floor on the Swiss franc/euro rate would limit adverse
balance sheet effects for holders of Swiss franc-denominated mortgages in Austria and CESEE, thus
short-circuiting a potential channel of contagion.
12.
Severe spillovers could be expected in an extreme scenario in which Italy was strongly
affected by contagion. This would reflect the close trade links, direct banking sector exposure
(some 5 percent of GDP), and the fact that the second largest banking group in Austria is a
subsidiary of an Italian bank.
The authorities’ view
13.
The authorities broadly concurred with the staff’s projections and assessment of the
main risks. The June forecast of the Austrian Central Bank (OeNB) deviates only marginally from the
staff’s baseline scenario in 2012 and 2013 (and is a bit more sanguine in 2014). Differences are also
marginal to the projections of the Austrian economic research institute IHS, while the WIFO institute
foresees growth in 2012 and 2013 at only 0.6 and 1.3 percent. Furthermore, there was broad
agreement that the most prominent risk for the outlook stems from an intensification of the euro
area crisis.

2

CGER models suggest that the real effective exchange rate is undervalued 1, 3 or 8 percent according to the
equilibrium real exchange rate, macroeconomic balance, and external sustainability approaches, respectively. The new
External Balance Assessment (EBA) methodology indicates a two percent real exchange rate undervaluation and a
current account gap (the difference between the cyclically-adjusted current account balance and the value implied by
fundamentals and desired policies) of about 3 percent of GDP (but a zero policy gap).

14.
The authorities agreed that the external position was strong but did not necessarily
foresee a further weakening in the short run. They acknowledged that adjustment in the euro
area would require higher–than–average inflation in surplus countries, and would not oppose such a
development in Austria. They also noted that private sector wages are formed through collective
negotiations with no government interference, and emphasized the importance of non-price factors
(such as a first-mover advantage in CESEE) in explaining Austria’s success in export markets.

(Scale—high, medium, or low)
Relative Likelihood
Medium
Re-intensified financial instability in

on wholesale bank funding
markets, and capital flow reversals
in CESEE.

Medium

non-compliance at subnational
level with domestic stability pact.
Medium
Destabilizing policies in a number
of CESEE countries to which
Austrian banks are significantly
exposed.

Impact if Realized
High
Spillovers would work through trade and
financial linkages directly (including from
Italy) and via CESEE. Multiple feedback
loops would unfold, including between
Austrian sovereign and bank credit
worthiness/funding cost. Euro
depreciation, however, would stimulate
growth, while the peg on the CHF/EUR
rate would prevent adverse balance
sheet effects from the high share of CHFdenominated loans.
High
Fiscal discipline might be in doubt,
causing sovereign and bank bond
spreads to climb rapidly. Foreign
investors might no longer roll over
exposures (though long average maturity
of sovereign debt would help). Austrian
banks may step in and support sovereign
debt, but would have to reduce other
exposures, with likely negative feedback
loops. Higher funding costs would also
threaten the banks’ ability/willingness to
fund some CESEE operations.
Medium
Spillovers would work through trade and
financial linkages, notably the loan
portfolio of Austrian banks. Potential
confidence effects may hurt Austrian
sovereign creditworthiness with feedback
on bank ratings and funding cost.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path discussed in this report
(which is the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of the staff). The RAM reflects staff's views on the source
of risks and overall level of concerns as of the time of discussions with the authorities. The relative likelihood of risks
listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding this baseline.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The discussions focused on fiscal, financial sector, and structural policies to increase the
economy’s resilience against euro area shocks, contain adverse spillovers, manage legacy
problems in the financial sector, and increase potential GDP growth through better labor
utilization.

A. Implementing and Anchoring Structural Fiscal Consolidation
Background
15.
The authorities’ consolidation plans envisage a balanced budget by 2016. The
government’s current medium-term fiscal framework was strengthened in March 2012 and targets a
balanced budget for general government by 2016 (Box 2). Net of capital transfers to banks, this would
amount to an average annual adjustment of almost ½ percent of GDP in structural terms. Additional
bank restructuring costs may push up the debt level, but even in this case the strict implementation of
the new adjustment path and adherence to the new fiscal rule framework should ultimately put debt
back on a downward trajectory.
16.
However, a significant part of the consolidation plan is subject to high yield uncertainty
or not yet underpinned by specific measures. The main measures in 2012 (anticipated taxation of
corporate pensions) and 2013 (tax treaty with Switzerland) have high yield uncertainty, while in 201416 measures underlying almost a quarter of the consolidation still need to be implemented, are
unspecified, or depend on the cooperation of subnational governments (financial transaction tax,
subsidy and health care reform, and expenditure consolidation by states and municipalities). Not yet
implemented or unspecified measures are not reflected in the staff’s baseline scenario.5

If the authorities’ plans are fully implemented, their fiscal targets would be achieved under staff’s baseline
macroeconomic scenario.

17.
In addition, further fiscal costs from restructuring medium-sized banks are likely and
aging-related fiscal pressures will emerge in the longer run. In 2008–11, the government injected
€ 7½ billion (2½ percent of GDP) into banks, one third of which were or became capital transfers. This
year has so far witnessed € 2.3 billion in bank support, mainly capital transfers. This year has so far
witnessed an additional € 2.3 billion in bank support, mainly capital transfers. In addition, crisis-related
federal government guarantees stood at € 17.2 billion at the end of 2011, with a guarantee of similar
magnitude by a state to one of the nationalized banks. Against this background, medium-sized banks
with significant public ownership will likely cause further fiscal needs.6 In addition, there are fiscal
pressures from an aging population: the European Commission projects the increase in Austria’s
aging-related expenditure at some 4½ percent of GDP between 2015 and 2050 from already one of
the highest levels in the EU.7
18.
Improvements in the fiscal governance framework have advanced but not on all fronts.
At end-2011, parliament adopted a federal “debt brake” rule limiting the federal structural deficit
(including social security) to 0.35 percent of GDP from 2017 onwards. Furthermore, in May 2012 a
revamped domestic stability pact was approved that extends the “debt brake” to sub-national
governments and restricts their overall structural deficit to 0.1 percent of GDP, also starting in 2017.
However, these fiscal rules have not been enshrined in the constitution, as a sufficient parliamentary
majority could not be mustered. In addition, not much progress has been made in the discussions on a
reform of intra-governmental financial arrangements (Annex II).

There are also contingent liabilities in non-financial public enterprises, as described in the 2011 IMF Staff Report.

In May 2012, the federal coalition government agreed on a broad array of measures to strengthen
medium–term fiscal consolidation. The package is reflected in the medium-term fiscal framework 20132016, and entailed numerous legislative changes, including amendments to the 2012 budget. The authorities
estimate the impact of these measures, defined as difference to no-policy-change revenue and expenditure

1/ cumulative against authorities' baseline.
2/ further pension-related measures are included under "social contributions" above.

Almost 2/3 of the measures are taken on the expenditure side. There is a clear focus on the pension area,
with more than a third of the estimated impact stemming from a limitation of pension increases below
inflation in 2013/14. The measures underlying the envisaged cuts in subsidies and health care expenditure
and the consolidation contributions by states and municipalities are back-loaded and still unspecified.
On the revenue side, the tax treaty with Switzerland, the anticipated taxation of corporate pensions, a capital
gains tax on real estate sales, and a tax increase for high-income earners should fall on wealthier households
and thus have very small multipliers.
As regards social contributions, several measures harmonize pension systems of different occupational
groups and raise ceilings on contribution bases, while the exemption for older workers from unemployment
insurance contributions has been lifted.

Staff’s view
19.
The envisaged medium-term structural consolidation path strikes a good balance
between fiscal prudence and growth considerations. In structural terms, net of capital transfers to
banks, the authorities’ plans for 2013-16 would amount to an average annual adjustment of almost
½ percent of GDP, broadly in line with staff’s recommendation in the 2011 Art IV consultation.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

AUSTRIA

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Provided that the new fiscal rules are adhered to and the consolidation is locked in after the
authorities’ planning horizon, this path should ultimately put debt on a downward trajectory even in
case it is pushed up by additional bank restructuring cost. From a growth perspective, in the years
when the economy is expected to be weaker (2012 and 2013), roughly half of the consolidation
measures fall on wealthier households and are thus likely to have only rather modest effects on
consumption. In case cyclical conditions deteriorate more than expected, it would be desirable to let
automatic stabilizers work, though adverse effects on the credibility of the fiscal rules would have to
be taken into account.8 On the other hand, any relaxation of the envisaged consolidation path in
structural terms could only be justifiably considered in case of a deep recession, as may arise from the
realization of tail risks, such as a strong intensification of the euro area crisis. In this case, measures
would need to be strictly temporary and targeted.
20.
Hence, the authorities should strictly implement the planned consolidation in structural
terms, but also take further measures to anchor sustainability in the longer run. The planned
savings in health care, subsidies, and by states and municipalities should be rapidly underpinned by
specific measures. Moreover, contingency plans would need to be designed to offset potential
underperformance of consolidation measures or cope with the likely required additional bank support.
Concerning the latter, the offsets should be calibrated to ensure that bringing the debt-to-GDP ratio
back to its pre-crisis level of about 60 percent of GDP by the end of the decade remains achievable.
Also, given rising aging cost pressures and long implementation lags for related measures, additional
pension reforms should be legislated soon. This would prevent the deficit from expanding again
after 2016 – a precondition for complying with the new fiscal rules and keeping the debt-to-GDP ratio
down.
21.
While the introduction of a system of fiscal rules for general government is
commendable, more progress is needed in fiscal governance reform. Following earlier budget
reforms, including a medium-term fiscal planning framework, the new fiscal rules are a further major
step towards better fiscal governance, although anchoring them in the constitution would have
provided a stronger commitment. Moreover, as emphasized in past consultations, incentives for rule
compliance at subnational level would be strengthened if intra-governmental financial arrangements
were streamlined, provided a stronger nexus between spending decisions and financing
responsibilities, and granted meaningful tax autonomy to states. In connection with the negotiation of
the next vintage of the financial equalization law, which expires in 2014, such reforms should be
implemented.
The authorities’ view
22.
The authorities assured that the envisaged consolidation path would be fully
implemented. They were confident in their budgetary projections and noted that the macroeconomic
outlook was now somewhat better than the one used in the budget. Accordingly, for 2012 the issue of

automatic stabilizers to offset a downturn was likely to be moot. For later years, the authorities saw as
a priority the need to ensure the credibility of the new fiscal rules. Furthermore, the authorities were
skeptical about stimulus measures in case of a deeper crisis, pointing to the limited fiscal multipliers in
a small open economy and the difficulty of finding suitable measures in light of the 2008–09
experience.
23.
Further reforms of fiscal federalism would be difficult in the short run. The authorities
assured that subnational governments would contribute their share to the consolidation effort, given
the revamped domestic stability pact. On fiscal federalism, while optimistic that the next vintage of the
fiscal equalization law would be ready in time, the authorities had low expectations as to the feasibility
of deeper reforms. In this respect, they pointed, in particular, to the reluctance of states to accept any
significant tax autonomy.

B. Managing Financial Sector Risks from Euro Area, CESEE, and Swiss Franc
Exposures while Accelerating Medium-Size Bank Restructuring
Background
24.
Large banks met the June 2012 capital requirements set by the European Banking
Authority (EBA). The two large Austrian-owned banks subject to the requirement used a mix of
genuine build-up of risk-bearing capacity (retained earnings, conversion of non-EBA-eligible liabilities
into common equity, improved collateralization), and other measures such as risk-weighted assets
optimization, reclassification of assets, and changes in accounting options. Compared to their
European peers, large Austrian banks’ capital adequacy remains on the low side, but their leverage is
below the median. In addition, state capital injections received in 2009 still need to be repaid.
25.
The Austrian supervisory authorities introduced a set of macroprudential guidelines to
strengthen the resilience of the banking sector. The measures, introduced in March 2012, apply to
the three largest Austria-based banks, all of which have large foreign operations (Box 3). They include
early implementation of the Basel III capital requirements, a capital surcharge, the design of recovery
and resolution plans, and close monitoring of subsidiaries’ local stable financing for new lending. The
latter is expected to limit the growth of Austrian banking sector’s foreign exposures, as well as help
reduce future funding and credit risk in subsidiaries, thereby fostering financial stability in host
countries. As to the likely short-term impact of the guidance, banks cited strong local deposit growth
and lackluster credit demand in CESEE as factors curbing cross-border funding needs in subsidiaries.

Box 3: Austrian Authorities’ Supervisory Guidance on the Strengthening of the Sustainability
of the Business Models of Large Internationally Active Austrian Banks
On March 14th, 2012, the Austrian supervisors issued new supervisory guidance for the largest three Austriabased banks after consultations with CESEE supervisors; the goal is to improve the sustainability of these
banks’ foreign operations (particularly those in CESEE) and secure financial stability both in Austria and in
host countries. The guidance consists of three pillars:



Higher capital buffers. Basel III capital rules have to be fully implemented by January 1st, 2013 without
transitional provisions (though private and government participation capital issued under the Austrian
bank support act will initially be included in the Core Tier I capital base), as well as a Core Tier I capital
surcharge of up to 3 percentage points from January 1st, 2016. The rules governing the exact amount of
this surcharge remain to be determined.



Promotion of stable local funding of subsidiaries. Supervisors will monitor the funding of
subsidiaries to encourage more reliance on local funding. The latter will be measured by the Loan-toLocal-Stable-Funding-Ratio (LLSFR), defined as loans to non-banks divided by local stable funding (i.e.,
deposits from non-banks + supranational funding + capital from third parties + total outstanding
volume of debt securities with original maturities of one year or more issued by the subsidiary to
investors outside their consolidated group). The “LLSFR flow ratio” is defined using the year-on-year
changes in the numerator and the denominator of the LLSFR. Subsidiaries with a stock-LLSFR above 110
percent shall achieve a sustainable flow-LLSFR so as to reduce their LLSFR over time to below 110
percent, unless home and host supervisors agree that (i) there are no impediments to liquidity transfers
between parent and subsidiary and there would not be any in a stress situation either; and (ii) a burden
sharing agreement is in place between the supervisory and fiscal authorities of the countries concerned.
In any case, the Austrian supervisors will place a particular focus on subsidiaries with a current LLSFR
exceeding 110 percent. In addition, parent banks are expected to price intragroup liquidity transfers
taking into account adequate risk, in line with the relevant EBA guidelines.



Recovery and resolution plans. Parent banks must have these plans submitted by end-2012.

26.
A number of medium-sized banks continue to need government support. Earlier this year,
the government semi-nationalized the fourth largest bank after delays in the implementation of its
restructuring plan contributed to large losses. Another bank, nationalized in 2009, still struggles to
make a profit, needs to improve its capital adequacy, and so far has not found buyers for its units
earmarked for sale. A bad bank created from another nationalized institution made large losses
following the Greek PSI, has large residual exposures to the EA periphery, and a large negative gap
between the book value and the market value of its portfolio. Losses on Greek bonds also erased one
third of the capital of the associated good bank. While nationalized banks have generally reduced their
balance sheet size though disposals, the process has been slow, and valuations of some of the
remaining assets remain uncertain.

The domestic banking sector shows signs of overcapacity. While the number of banks
(head offices) has been on a declining trend in the past few quarters, it remains very large (824 at end2011). The number of branches has increased by 6 percent during 2011, and branch and bank
employee density are high in international comparison.9 In addition, the profitability of domestic
banking activities has been consistently low, so that banks have relied on their foreign operations to
try to achieve their return on equity targets.10

The peer comparison group includes countries such as Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands and Spain, which have a
banking sector of a similar or larger size relative to GDP compared to Austria’s. The relatively large number of bank
employee density cannot be attributed to Austria being a regional financial center because large international Austrian
banks have a retail focus and the vast majority of their staff is employed by subsidiaries abroad.
10

Likely impediments to a rationalization of banking sector capacity in the past include a variety of factors, such as the
ability to generate profits through foreign expansion in the years of the CESEE boom, the historical importance of the
cooperative sector, collective labor agreements making layoffs difficult, and a lack of bank resolution tools.

of around EUR 4 billion for Swiss-franc-denominated RPV-loans, or 19 percent of the outstanding
volume, mostly reflecting the appreciation of the Swiss franc.
Staff’s view
29.
Intensive monitoring of the banking system is warranted in light of the fragile European
market situation. Staff emphasized the importance of contingency planning for the downside
scenario of an escalating euro-area crisis. While the banking system’s liquidity situation appeared
comfortable in the aggregate as a result of the build-up of liquid assets and eligible collateral as well
as efforts to increase the maturity of foreign currency funding and recent ECB actions, pockets of
vulnerabilities could re-emerge quickly, which may require policy intervention. In the context of crisis
preparedness for cross-border financial groups, cooperation with host supervisors is also key.
30.
Staff welcomed the new macroprudential guidelines for large Austrian banks and
encouraged the involvement of supervisory colleges in their implementation. Staff had
emphasized the need to build up strong capital buffers against future risks, especially in the too-bigtoo-fail institutions, during last year’s Article IV consultation. Early implementation of the new Basel III
capital requirements and capital surcharges on systemic banks will increase the capacity of these
institutions to absorb unexpected losses. The requirement to draft recovery and resolution plans is a
potentially important crisis management tool. Lastly, close monitoring of the funding structure of
foreign subsidiaries to encourage reliance on local funding for new lending should help reduce
structural vulnerabilities. Staff analysis suggests that the LLSFR is an important and appropriate
monitoring tool, and that the enforcement of a threshold of 110 should not be mechanistic (see Box 4
and forthcoming Selected Issues Paper “Funding of Austrian Banks’ Subsidiaries and Associated
Risks”). In addition, any corrective measures should be discussed in the context of supervisory colleges,
especially in light of the present concerns about possible disruptive deleveraging. Finally, the mission
warned about the risk of circumvention through cross-border lending by the parent bank.
Box 4. Funding of Austrian Banks’ Subsidiaries and Associated Risks
Evidence for CESEE banks suggests that the loan-to-local-stable-funding ratio (LLSFR) is an
appropriate tool to monitor credit risk. In a sample of CESEE banks, including many foreign bank
subsidiaries, a measure of credit risk (the change in banks’ loan-loss provisions) in the two years following
the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy (2008–10) is positively and significantly associated with the banks’ loan-todeposit ratio (LDR) at the end of 2008, even after controlling for aggregate factors and individual bank loan
growth. The LDR is a close proxy for the LLSFR, the ratio monitored by the Austrian supervisors, which
cannot be computed based on publicly available data. This suggests that the use of the LLSFR as a
vulnerability indicator related to credit risk in a supervisory context is warranted.
At the same time, the data caution against the mechanistic implementation of any specific threshold
for supervisory action. The dispersion in the change in asset quality after the shock of end-2008 is large for
any particular level of the LDR, suggesting that significant credit risk can also build up in banks with a low
LDR. Furthermore, the jump in the average deterioration in asset quality seems to take place at a somewhat
higher level than the LLSFR threshold of 110 percent in the Austrian supervisors’ guidelines. Thus, while a
conservative threshold of 110 will clearly reduce Austrian banking groups’ funding and liquidity risk, from
the point of view of curbing credit risk a less conservative threshold may be acceptable.

31.
Restructuring of intervened mid-sized banks should be accelerated and take into
account excess capacity in Austria. The recent experience with medium-sized banks where the
government had to take a significant ownership stake has shown the cost of delaying the disposal of
legacy and non-core assets. While most intervened banks have reduced their balance sheet size, the
restructuring process has been slow. Introducing more flexible structures to facilitate the efficient
disposal of assets would help contain final fiscal costs. In addition, the exit strategy from government
ownership following balance sheet clean-up should take into account the fact that the Austrian market
is overbanked.
32.
Putting in place a new early intervention and bank resolution framework should be a
priority. Stronger intervention tools would give the Austrian supervisors a stronger mandate to
impose early and forceful corrective measures, while a new resolution regime – including revamped
deposit insurance – would provide more flexibility in dealing with insolvent institutions. Early
legislation on the matter consistent with FSB recommendations and the June 2012 EC proposal would
be desirable.
33.
Banks’ capital allocation against the risks related to foreign currency loans with
repayment vehicles in Austria should be conservative. While these loans are currently performing
well, the sizable funding gap in repayment vehicles indicates that problems may arise when loans
mature. To guard against this risk, a review of parameters used in banks’ internal risk models is
warranted to make sure that banks are well prepared for persistent funding gaps.
The authorities’ view
34.
The authorities indicated that, although there had been no sign of significant stress so
far, they had stepped up their monitoring of banking sector liquidity, including intra-group
exposures. Banks have been encouraged to pay particular attention to their funding and liquidity
profiles, in particular in foreign currency, and have increased their pool of ECB-eligible collateral. In
addition, the authorities conduct regular macroeconomic stress tests. A cross-border stability group
formed last year with several CESEE countries was expected to hold its first crisis simulation exercise in
early July, and would be an opportunity to discuss burden-sharing issues for the first time.
35.
Any supervisory action related to the new guidelines on the funding model of
subsidiaries would be the outcome of a process in the context of supervisory colleges. The
monitoring of trends in the “sustainability” of subsidiaries’ loan book growth started in 2012Q1, a first
full assessment will take place at year-end based on year-on-year data, and deeper consultations with
host supervisors would then take place about the appropriate course of action in case of deviations
from the guidelines. The authorities were aware of the risk of circumvention through cross-border
lending but viewed it as small and relatively easy to monitor.
36.
The authorities were open to a review of the strategy for the disposal of legacy assets in
banks with significant state ownership, and agreed that there was scope for a reduction in
overbanking in the Austrian market. They agreed that delays in restructuring were often costly, but
argued that all institutional structures aimed at winding down portfolios had their pros and cons. On

overbanking in Austria, they shared staff’s view that greater cost efficiency would be welcome as it
would improve capital generation capacity. They foresaw that the gradual implementation of Basel III
standards would foster consolidation of small institutions, while EC state aid rules would likely force
intervened banks to downsize their domestic operations.
37.
Adopting a new framework for early intervention and bank resolution is a priority. The
authorities reported that a concept paper for new domestic legislation based on principles consistent
with the European Commission’s June 2012 proposal had been prepared and discussed by interested
parties in mid-June. They were also considering a reform of the Austrian deposit insurance framework
that would include the move to an ex ante funding mechanism. The Austrian parliament adopted a
motion in early July asking the government to look into these issues.
38.
Austrian supervisors plan to strengthen the risk management of Swiss franc loans to
unhedged borrowers in Austria through the publication of more detailed guidelines and the
supervisory process, in line with ESRB recommendations issued last year. The Austrian guidelines
issued in 2003 and 2010 will be reviewed and updated by the end of the year in particular with respect
to internal risk pricing and capital allocation. The authorities are considering taking supervisory
measures through Basel II’s second pillar in the course of next year. The authorities also noted that
banks can build up capital buffers gradually as the first large vintage of Swiss franc mortgages will
mature only in 2017. Finally, they pointed out that households who borrowed in foreign currency had
higher average income, a factor limiting downside risk.

C. Increasing Growth by Improving Incentives to Work
Background
39.
Labor force participation by some groups is low in international comparison. While
female and youth employment rates are high and the percentage of long-term unemployed is low, the
employment rate of older workers is much lower than in most OECD countries (Annex III). The average
effective retirement age is at around 59 years for men and 57 years for women, well below the
statutory age. The unemployment rate is high among unskilled workers, and a considerable share of
workers, especially women, is employed part-time.
40.
Incentives for early retirement remain despite several steps to reduce them. Access to the
early retirement scheme for long-term contributors has been limited, and further tightening is
envisaged for 2014, but other paths to early retirement exist, including through disability or
occupational pensions. Rehabilitation efforts for disabled workers have recently been enhanced and
eligibility criteria tightened, but the range of alternative occupations against which disability is
assessed remains relatively narrow. The penalty for the regular early retirement scheme was raised in
the mid-2000s to 4.2 percent per year and is slated for a further rise to 5.1 percent in 2017, still

AUSTRIA

somewhat below most estimates of the actuarially neutral adjustment.11 The statutory retirement age
for women is 60 years—5 years less than for men, a rare disparity for advanced economies.
41.
Austria has some of the highest tax wedges among advanced economies, so that for
some individuals work does not pay. High social security contributions and the interaction of tax
and benefit systems contribute to the wedges. Tax wedges for both primary and secondary earners are
among the highest in the OECD, the latter reflecting the sole-earner tax credit among other things. At
the same time, a combination of relatively high sectoral minimum wages and social security
contribution may be pricing low-skilled workers out of the market. These wedges likely explain the low
employment rate among the low-skilled and the prevalence of part-time work.
Staff’s view
42.
Further action to increase employment of older workers is desirable. While there has been
commendable progress in several areas, the disability regime remains relatively liberal and robust
implementation of the rehabilitation and reintegration efforts is key to achieve the desired progress.
As the retirement scheme for long-term contributors is made less attractive, it is important to ensure
that alternative avenues into early retirement do not see a spike in usage. The planned increase in the
early retirement penalty for standard pensions is welcome, but it would still remain below the
actuarially neutral value. At the same time, there is clear scope for accelerating the timetable for
unifying female and male statutory retirement ages and for tying both to life expectancy. To increase
the willingness of employers to hire older workers, a review of age-based wage premiums in collective
labor contracts would be important.
43.
The burden on labor resulting from high taxes and social security contributions should
be reduced to increase labor supply and potential growth. A budget-neutral reduction in social
security contributions, particularly for low-skilled workers, and a redesign of taxes and benefits to
smooth high and uneven marginal effective tax rates would be beneficial to labor force participation.
The budgetary impact could be offset by spending reductions or increases in less distorting forms of
taxation, such as environmental, excise, or real estate taxes. The latter is especially low in international
comparison and could also be used to strengthen the tax autonomy of subnational governments.
Model simulations (see Annex III) show that reducing labor taxes by one percentage point of GDP in a
budget-neutral manner can increase output in the long run by as much as ¾ percent.
The authorities’ view
44.
The authorities stressed that measures taken in recent years will increase labor supply
and saw a reduction in the burden on labor as desirable. With respect to older workers, their focus
has been on bringing the effective retirement age closer to the statutory age rather than increasing
the latter, and they expect a substantial increase in labor force participation of older workers as a
result of actions already taken or planned. They also noted steps to increase availability of daycare,

which should stimulate female labor supply. The government and the social partners recognize that
labor taxation and tax wedges are high and share a desire to reduce them in a budget-neutral way, but
agreement is still lacking on how to pay for the cuts.

STAFF APPRAISAL
45.
The ongoing rebalancing of GDP growth toward domestic demand is welcome. Real wage
growth is picking up, facilitating a shift in demand toward private consumption and resulting in a
decline in Austria’s current account surplus. The continuation of these developments would contribute
to restoring macroeconomic equilibrium within the monetary union.
46.
The new consolidation path strikes a good balance between fiscal prudence and growth
considerations and should be fully implemented in structural terms. The planned average annual
structural adjustment would foster the credibility of the new fiscal rules and should eventually put debt
on a downward path. The envisaged adjustment is also relatively growth-friendly. Its full
implementation needs to be ensured by rapidly identifying specific measures in health care, subsidies,
and at the subnational level. To the same end, contingency plans need to be designed in case some
consolidation steps do not generate the projected yield or new outlays emerge, with the possibility of
further bank restructuring costs an area of particular concern.
47.
To anchor debt reduction and sustainability in the medium and long term, further
expenditure reforms will be necessary. Even if a structural deficit close to balance is reached
by 2016 as envisaged, aging-cost pressures will tend to push it up again and hamper further debt
reduction. To contain these pressures, the authorities should soon adopt additional reforms, given the
long implementation lags of such policies in particular in the pension area. The other main areas to
tackle remain health care spending as well as subsidies.
48.
While the recent introduction of a system of fiscal rules is commendable, more progress
is needed in fiscal governance reform. Incentives for compliance with fiscal rules at the subnational
level would be strengthened by streamlining intra-governmental financial arrangements, establishing a
stronger nexus between spending decisions and financing responsibilities, and granting meaningful
tax autonomy to states. These reforms should take place in connection with the renewal of the fiscal
equalization law.
49.
Intensive monitoring of systemic banks, including through regular stress tests, is
warranted in light of the fragile European market situation. The recent increase in capital ratios in
large banks is the result of genuine build-up of risk-bearing capacity, one-off accounting changes, and
risk-weighted asset optimization. However, the continuing need to provision against non-performing
loans keeps hampering profitability, thus reducing internal capital generation capacity. Swiss franc
loans to unhedged borrowers in Austria are also a source of risk, which the authorities are rightly
planning to address through additional supervisory measures.

The mission welcomes the new macroprudential guidelines for large Austrian banks.
Early implementation of the new Basel III capital requirements and capital surcharges on systemic
banks will increase the capacity of these institutions to absorb unexpected losses. The requirement to
draft recovery and resolution plans is a potentially important crisis management tool. Lastly, close
monitoring of the funding structure of foreign subsidiaries to encourage reliance on local funding for
new lending should help reduce structural vulnerabilities. Appropriately, the monitoring will take place
in close cooperation with host country supervisors
51.
The authorities should develop a strategy for a more efficient disposal of legacy assets in
banks with substantial government ownership with the goal of minimizing final fiscal costs. The
recent experience with medium-sized banks has shown the cost of delaying the disposal of legacy and
non-core assets. A revised strategy should provide for more rapid and flexible balance sheet clean up.
The exit strategy from government ownership should take into account the need to reduce
overbanking in the Austrian market.
52.
Putting in place a new early intervention and bank resolution framework should be a
priority. Stronger intervention tools would give the Austrian supervisors a better basis – and clearer
responsibility – to impose early and forceful corrective measures. The authorities have started
consultations on the design of a new national framework based on principles consistent with the
European Commission’s June 2012 proposal. We encourage rapid progress on this front and reliance
on international best practice should there be further delays in the EU legislative process.
53.
Substantial steps have been taken to increase the employment of older workers, and
further action is desirable. Robust implementation is essential for maximizing the impact of
measures already taken. In addition, the authorities and the social partners should continue on the
road of reform. Specifically, there is clear scope for accelerating the timetable for unifying female and
male statutory retirement ages and tying both to life expectancy. Further efforts to improve the
employability of older workers (including reducing age-based wage premiums) would also be
welcome.
54.
Taxation of labor should be reduced in a budget-neutral way to foster labor supply and
increase potential growth. A reduction in social security contributions would lower the tax burden on
labor; there is also a case for smoothing marginal effective tax rates to improve incentives to get
employment or move from part-time to full-time work. The fiscal impact could be offset by spending
reductions or increases in less distortionary forms of taxation, such as environmental, excise, or real
estate taxes. The latter is especially low in international comparison, and its increase could also
strengthen the tax autonomy of subnational governments.
55.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Austria be held on the usual
12-month cycle.

AUSTRIA

Table 6. Authorities’ Response to Past IMF Policy Recommendations
(Scale―fully consistent, broadly consistent, or marginally consistent)
IMF 2011 Article IV Recommendations
Fiscal policy I
Implement consolidation measures of at least
½ percent of GDP annually, mainly through
expenditure rationalization in three areas:
pensions, health care and subsidies.

Fiscal policy II
Strengthen Domestic Stability Pact.

Fiscal policy III
Streamline intergovernmental fiscal relations and
create stronger nexus between spending and
financing responsibilities at the subnational level.
Financial sector policy I
Take macroprudential measures to address risks
posed by systemically important banks.

Financial sector policy II
Strengthen early intervention powers for bank
supervisors and revisit the institutional framework
for bank supervision and regulation, including
with respect to macro-prudential policy.
Structural reforms
Increase labor market participation of low-skilled,
older and female workers and strengthen human
capital formation through reforms of the
education system.

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Authorities’ Response
Broadly consistent
New medium-term fiscal framework envisages
average annual structural adjustment of almost
½ percent of GDP. Focus on pension area, but
more needs to be done. Health care and subsidy
measures still need to be specified.
Broadly consistent
Comprehensive new fiscal rule framework,
including revamped Domestic Stability Pact.
Marginally consistent
No substantial progress.

Broadly consistent
New macroprudential guidelines for
internationally active banks have been issued. EBA
capital exercise also leading to stronger capital for
systemically important banks.
Marginally consistent
Consultations have begun on a reform of early
intervention and bank resolution. No plans yet for
other reforms.

Broadly consistent
Pension reforms to rein in early retirement have
been strengthened but more needs to be done.
Tax wedges and major education reforms still to
be addressed.

Annex I. Financial Sector Performance and Vulnerabilities1
Aggregate balance sheet structure and profitability
1.
The Austrian banking sector’s total consolidated banking sector assets have been stable
since 2008Q1. They amounted to EUR 1.17 trillion at end-2011, or 380 percent of GDP. The share of
fully consolidated subsidiaries – which are mostly located in Central, Eastern, and South-Eastern
Europe (CESEE) – was also stable at 23.2 percent. The structure of aggregated assets and liabilities
remained characteristic of a banking system dominated by classic commercial banking activities
(Table A1). The loan-to-deposit ratio remained close to 128 percent2, as both loans and deposits
grew by 3-4 percent year-on-year.

2.
Overall profitability slumped, with the aggregate ROA declining from 0.46 percent in 2010 to
0.11 percent in 2011, as goodwill write-offs in CESEE (most notably in Hungary, Romania and
Ukraine because of a deteriorated outlook), losses on sovereign bond portfolios (including through
the Greek PSI), new provisioning charges for asset impairment, and losses associated with a
Hungarian government-sponsored scheme that caps the exchange rate for repayments on foreign
currency mortgages took their toll. Yet the share of operating profits emanating from CESEE
subsidiaries jumped to 66 percent, as the interest margin in Austria remained low at a level slightly
above 1 percent, about 0.5 percentage points below that of the Euro Area (EA) average.
Capital adequacy
3.
In spite of this deteriorating performance and the implementation of the stricter Basel 2.5
capital requirements at end-2011, the Tier I ratio improved in the banking system as a whole (to
10.3 percent) and in the three large internationally active banks (see table below) even if it remained
slightly below the average of European peers. The two Austrian-owned banks subject to the end1

June 2012 EBA capital exercise met these requirements. They filled the capital gap that existed at the
start of the exercise in the fall of 2011 by running down or selling some capital-intensive businesses,
taking some capital clean-up measures (including through an update of collateral appraisals),
moving from local to international accounting standards in some countries, retaining earnings, and
buying back or converting some non-EBA-eligible capital into common equity.
4.
The Austrian macroprudential guidance introduced this year (Box 2) should require little
extra capital in the baseline scenario, in particular because grandfathering provisions in the new
forthcoming EU capital regulation will make private and state participation capital eligible as Core
Tier I.3 Nevertheless, the largest banking group has announced that it would likely change its
institutional structure and deconsolidate part of its Austrian activities should the treatment of
minority interests in the forthcoming European Union’ Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV) be
too penalizing in terms of eligible capital.

2/ The ratio's numerator is total loan loss provisions, except for bank 2 and bank 5 for which it is loan loss provisions for NPLs only.

5.
Among medium-sized banks, one bank which was nationalized in 2009 reported a
turnaround in 2011 after large losses on CESEE exposures in 2010 but remains weakly capitalized. A
restructuring plan is under examination by the European Commission while the bank is looking for
buyers for parts of the business and is examining strategic options for its large wind-down portfolio.
Another troubled medium-sized bank that already relied heavily on government capital support had
to be semi-nationalized in early 2012 as it lost 50 percent of its equity after its restructuring plans
were delayed and the value of some of its assets had to be written down. This bank is systemic as it
serves as a central institution for a large group of smaller Austrian banks that are its main private
shareholders. Following the latest round of government support, these shareholders agreed to make
their association with the central institution stronger and more formal, a transformation which is
expected to create a more robust banking group.

6.
At the time of the June 2011 Article IV mission, Austrian banks expected their NPL ratios in
CESEE subsidiaries to peak in mid-2011. Yet the stock of NPLs kept increasing throughout the year
and the aggregate NPL ratio reached 15 percent in 2011Q4 as the growth outlook in CESEE
deteriorated with the intensification of the Euro Area sovereign crisis and the sharp slowdown in
Western Europe. Austrian banks anticipate that asset quality will deteriorate further in several CESEE
countries during the remainder

7.
The amount of foreign currency loans in CESEE subsidiaries declined for households, but
increased significantly for corporations, in particular in Romania and Russia. In total, the share of FX
loans in CESEE declined by 1 percentage point to 47.5 percent in exchange-rate-adjusted terms in
2011.
8.
NPLs on exposures booked in Austria remain low, but the large share of Swiss francdenominated loans to unhedged borrowers in a context of Swiss franc strength is a persistent cause
for concern. At end-2012Q1, foreign-currency loans (FCLs) to Austrian non-banks amounted to
EUR 56 bn (18.7 percent of GDP), of which EUR 38 billion were attributable to households,
EUR 12 billion to nonfinancial corporations, and EUR 3billion to the public sector. FCLs to
households represented almost 30 percent of loans to that category, consisted mostly of mortgages
(73 percent) and were mostly denominated in Swiss francs. Adverse exchange rate developments
over the past four years have made these loans more risky. Furthermore, since most of them are
linked to repayment vehicles (RPV) and have bullet maturity, the full impact of the Swiss franc
appreciation will be felt only when sizable loan vintages mature starting in 2017. Following strong
supervisory measures—but also unfavorable exchange rate movements acting as a deterrent—the
stock of household foreign-currency loans (adjusted for exchange rate movements) is now on a
declining trend.
9.
A survey performed by the OeNB in June 2011 showed a funding gap for CHF-denominated
RPV loans to households of EUR 4bn (or 19 percent of the amount due at maturity). The increase of
loan loss provisioning ratios on CHF loans has been muted so far. This is partly attributable to loan
conversions into EUR-denominated loans, and to the fact that the rise in installment amounts due to
34

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

AUSTRIA

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

the CHF appreciation has been compensated by a decrease in interest rate levels since the initiation
of the loans.
10.
Exposures of Austrian-owned banks to peripheral Euro Area countries with high risk premia
remain modest in comparison with other large and medium-sized European countries. They
amounted to 6.4 percent of GDP at end-2012Q1 and were concentrated in Italy, which is Austria’s
second largest trading partner. Exposures to Italy of the second largest Austrian banking group –
which is Italian-owned – are relatively more significant.
Funding and liquidity
11.
The Austrian banking sector’s liquidity situation appears comfortable in the aggregate, with
the net financing gap being very largely covered by the cumulated counterbalancing capacity at
various horizons. The banks’ liquidity position has become more conservative in recent months,
which reflects in part their increased reliance on Euro system operations through the two 3-year
LTROs (in December 2011 and February 2012). Their total allotted volume at end-May 2012
represented 1.3 percent of the EA-wide allotted volume. According to an OeNB survey, banks’
motives for participating in the LTROs were (i) increasing their liquidity buffer in a context of high
funding markets uncertainty; (ii) substituting more expensive funding sources; and (iii) funding their
lending activities. Austrian banks also improved their net position on the unsecured interbank
market, while they shifted their issuances from unsecured funding towards covered bonds.
12.
Regarding foreign-currency liquidity, the US dollar position is well covered by the USD/EUR
swap arrangement between the ECB and the US Federal Reserve. The unbalanced CHF positions are
the legacy of fast growth of Swiss franc lending combined with short-term funding via FX-swaps
during the last decade. Pressured by the Austrian authorities, banks have made efforts to lengthen
their funding tenors in the EUR/CHF swap market, diversify counterparties and funding instruments,
obtain direct or indirect access to the Swiss National Bank’s tender operations, and post sufficient
collateral to withstand a funding shock in the FX-swap market.
Intra-group funding and deleveraging in CESEE
13.
Intra-group liquidity transfers to CESEE subsidiaries declined by about EUR 7 billion from
their peak of EUR 48 billion at end-June 2011 to their end-2012Q1 level. Because banks were able to
attract local deposits for a similar amount, the size of the loan portfolio remained stable over the
same period of time. Thus there was no reduction in credit supplied by subsidiaries operating in the
region in the aggregate. Exposure reductions in recent quarters were concentrated on Hungary and
largely driven by the foreign currency loan early redemption scheme.
14.
The Austrian supervisor introduced a new monitoring tool, the Loan-to-Local-StableFunding-Ratio (LLSFR) as part of its guidelines to improve the sustainability of the three large
Austrian banks’ growth model in the CESEE region (see Box 3 in the SR and Selected Issues Paper).
The first LLSFR-monitoring exercise based on end-2012Q1 data showed that 15 subsidiaries out of
42 had a stock-LLSFR above the 110 threshold defined in the guidance (see Figure A2). These 15

15.
The OeNB regularly performs stress tests to assess the resilience of the banking system.
Liquidity indicators are monitored and stress-tested frequently using data from a weekly forwardlooking liquidity reporting system introduced in late 2008. Macroeconomic stress tests are
performed twice a year for the entire consolidated Austrian banking system. The adverse scenario of
the latest test simulated the impact of a very severe recession together with that of several risk
factor add-ons, such as haircuts on sovereign holdings of EA program countries, frontloaded
implementation of Basel III risk-weights, greater distribution of profits, and a small shock to the cost
of funding. Over the projection horizon (2011Q4-2013Q4), the Core Tier I ratio of the banking

significantly above the new phased-in Basel III minimum of 4.5 percent with the add-ons. Each of the
three largest banks would remain above the 7 percent full implementation Basel III minimum.

Annex II. The New Fiscal Rule Framework1
1.
Austria has made substantial advances in fiscal governance in recent years. In addition to a
medium-term expenditure framework at the federal level that is operational since 2009 and other
budget reforms, more recently a system of numerical fiscal rules has been introduced. To this end,
the federal budget law was amended with a simple parliamentary majority in December 2011; and a
revamped Domestic Stability Pact was agreed between federal government, states, and
municipalities in May 2012. Although the government has a continued preference for anchoring the
new rules in Austria’s constitution, this has so far not been possible as none of the three opposition
parties has been willing to contribute to the necessary qualified constitutional majority.
2.
The central component of the new fiscal rules is a limit on the general government structural
deficit of 0.45 percent of GDP as of 2017, split into 0.35 percent of GDP for the federal level
(including social security) and a total of 0.10 percent of GDP for all states and municipalities. These
limits are combined with an “error correction mechanism”: deviations between actual and prescribed
structural balances will be accumulated in compensation accounts; if the (negative) balance in the
accounts exceeds 1.25 percent of GDP for the federal level or 0.367 percent of GDP for states and
municipalities, a correction has to be initiated. This takes the economic cycle into account, i.e., if
there is a negative output gap, a correction is only required as long as the gap narrows.
3.
In the transition period from the current fiscal situation to the requirements of the new
framework (2012-16), the domestic stability pact determines the fiscal targets in terms of headline
rather than structural deficits. This could lead to pro-cyclicality if growth turns out less favorably
than projected. The targets in the Domestic Stability Pact are set as follows:

The system of rules also incorporates explicitly the stipulations at EU level on expenditure
growth limits, debt reduction, and exemptions. The latter include a “severe cyclical downturn”
exception. Furthermore, the rules oblige all levels of government to introduce limits on guarantees,
which are, however, not quantified in the pact.

5.
The rules are supported by a sanctioning mechanism: If the Austrian Statistical Agency
identifies a violation of the rules, the Court of Auditors follows up with a report to a body consisting
of two federal, two state, and two municipal representatives. This body will ask the non-complying
entity for remedial actions within two months. If such actions are not taken, the body can impose a
financial sanction in the amount of 15 percent of the (highest) deviation from any of the stipulated
targets by unanimous voting. Peers of the affected party at the same government level are not
allowed to vote. A sanctioned entity has the right to appeal to a second instance (an “arbitration
court”). The latter will have three members, one of which will be appointed by the appealing entity.
According to the authorities, the arbitration court will decide only on whether to overturn the
sanction of the first instance and will need unanimity for doing so.
6.
Although concluded without expiration date in principle, the Domestic Stability Pact will
become void if there is no successor agreement to the current arrangements on intra-governmental
fiscal relations (“fiscal equalization law”) that end in 2014 (but could be extended to 2016). As
pointed out in previous staff reports (SR 2010 and 2011), these relations are highly complex, and
characterized by frequent task overlaps and a pervasive disconnect between spending decisions and
financing responsibilities, which is also reflected in the fact that there is basically no tax autonomy at
the state level.
7.
Experience in neighboring Switzerland shows that, although often difficult from a political
economy perspective, reforms of federalist fiscal relations are not impossible to implement
(see 2012 staff report on Switzerland). Switzerland streamlined both the task distribution across
government levels and its fiscal equalization mechanism in 2008. The number of areas for which the
Swiss Confederation and Cantons have joint responsibilities was almost cut in half, and a clearer
division of labor was introduced for the remaining joint tasks. In a similar vein, fiscal equalization
was rationalized to two mechanisms that are transparently based on resource potential and needs of
each of the Swiss Cantons. Furthermore, in Switzerland, a considerable degree of tax autonomy
creates a strong nexus between spending decisions and financing responsibility and enhances fiscal
discipline at the subnational level, while a no-bail-out presumption for cantons and municipalities is
inherent.

Annex III. Boosting Potential Growth by Expanding Labor Supply1
Situation in the labor market
1.
While Austria generally has favorable labor market outcomes relative to other advanced
countries, there is scope for increasing labor supply. Austria stands out in international comparison
as having one of the lowest unemployment rates in the EU and the OECD. The percentage of longterm unemployed is also relatively small. The relative performance is not quite as strong in terms of
the participation rate, which is only somewhat above the OECD median and average. Nonetheless,
all in all Austria boasts a relatively high employment rate, although the share of part-time workers is
fairly high, particularly among women.
2.
Certain population groups are less involved in the labor market than their peers in Austria or
in other countries. These groups include older workers, unskilled workers, and lower-income women
with family responsibilities.
Employment Rate of Older Workers
(Percent of Population Aged 55-64)



The employment rate of older workers is much
lower than in most OECD countries. It should
be noted, however, that the elderly
employment rate has increased considerably
over the last few years—from 28.8 percent
in 2004 to (still relatively low) 41.5 percent
in 2011. The average effective retirement age
during the 2004–09 period was 58.9 years for
males and 57.5 years for females—both the
second lowest ages in the OECD.



Unemployment rates of low-skilled workers are
high. Low-skilled workers are concentrated in certain groups, such as older workers, immigrants,
women, and workers on non-standard contracts. It should be noted that the share of the lowskilled in the working-age population is diminishing.



Even though the female employment rate is in the top half of the OECD, women are relatively
more often working part time and finding it less attractive to work when they have small children.

Reasons for selected problems
3.
An examination of the tax/benefit system suggests that the system plays a role in
discouraging labor effort. Generous pension benefits and easy avenues to early retirement make
work unattractive to older workers. High tax wedges curtail the financial benefit from entering

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

AUSTRIA

employment from inactivity, especially for low-wage earners. The tax treatment of secondary wage
earners and child care costs also discourage participation.
4.
The low employment rate for the elderly reflects fairly generous pension benefits and
relatively easy paths into early retirement or disability pension. Both gross and net replacement rates
for average earners are among the highest across advanced economies. The statutory retirement
age for women is 60 years—five years younger than for man and than what is typical for both males
and females in the OECD. The penalty for early retirement, which was raised from 3 percent to
4.2 percent in 2004, is still below actuarially neutral adjustment. Moreover, as described in more
detail in the 2011 Staff Report, several avenues facilitate early retirement. The most prominent
among them are the lax disability regime and the Hacklerregelung scheme, which allows long-term
contributors to the public pension system to retire considerably earlier than the statutory age and
permits purchasing contribution years under certain conditions. Criteria for drawing a disability
pension are relatively lax, with a disproportionately large number of Austrians qualifying for one.
In 2010, only 28 percent of new pensioners took “standard” retirement, while 41 percent benefited
from an early retirement scheme and 31 percent were granted a disability pension.
5.
In recent years substantial steps have been taken to discourage early retirement. The price
for purchasing contribution years under the Hacklerregelung has been raised significantly, and
starting with 2014 such ex post purchases of secondary and tertiary education years will no longer
be counted as eligibility-creating contribution months. Moreover, in the same year the eligibility for
early retirement under that scheme will be raised by 2 years to 57 for women and 62 for men,
largely eliminating its advantages relative to the standard corridor pension. The early retirement
penalty under the corridor pension will be raised in 2017.2 Disability criteria have been tightened,
with stricter evaluation (expanding beyond fitness only for the previous occupation) and mandatory
rehabilitation before filing for a pension. These are important steps in the right direction and the
impact of these reforms can be expected to build over several years, although a number of
alternative avenues into early retirement remain open, and on the whole the incentives for older
workers to stay in the labor force still appear lower than in most advanced economies.
6.
The average tax wedge on labor is one of the highest in the OECD, primarily because of high
social security contributions paid by both the employer and the employee. Austria is one of few
advanced economies that have bucked the general trend toward reducing tax wedges. Importantly,
while low-income workers do not pay income taxes, they are still subject to social security
contributions.3 Given relatively generous unemployment benefits and social assistance, the
monetary gain from taking up employment is low, or even negative, for many people with low
earning potential. The tax wedge on secondary earners is one of the highest in the OECD, partly
because of sole-earner tax credits, which are lost if a spouse takes up more than marginal
employment. Studies show that the labor supply of low-skilled, older workers, married women and
2

The early retirement penalty under Hacklerregelung will remain at 4.2 percent.

single mothers is particularly sensitive to after-tax earnings.4 On the demand side, the combination
of high minimum wages in many sectors and high employer contributions to social security may
price low-skilled workers out of jobs.
Possible solutions
Restrict avenues into early retirement and raise statutory retirement age
7.
Eligibility criteria for disability pensions could be tightened further—including a stricter
obligation to look for jobs in alternative occupations. This would complement enhanced
rehabilitation efforts and the recent initiatives to improve workplace suitability for older employees.
8.
Reforms to reduce the access to and the generosity of various early retirement schemes
could continue. The Hacklerregelung scheme, which does not have a clear justification on economic
or equity grounds, should be allowed to expire. The rationale and eligibility criteria for other
avenues into early retirement, including for workers with particularly heavy working conditions
during part of their work history and for subsidized old-age part-time working arrangements with a
possibility of front-loading, should be reevaluated. The use of these alternatives may increase once
Hacklerregelung becomes less accessible. The early retirement penalty (and the late retirement
premium) under the corridor pension system will remain below the actuarially neutral value even
after an increase planned for 2017.
9.
The statutory retirement age for women could be equalized with that of men much sooner
than envisaged by current law. Historical reasons for differentiation no longer apply in a modern
society, and such a gap is rare among advanced countries. Moreover, it would be advisable to link
the statutory retirement age to longevity.
10.
At the same time, obstacles to employment of older workers could be eliminated. In
particular, the practice of stipulating higher wages for older employees in collective bargaining
agreements creates a disincentive for firms to hire them.

advanced economies, Austria relies heavily on taxing labor and less on taxing consumption and
capital.5 Property taxes are particularly low, reflecting both low rates and low valuations. Some of the
excises, particularly on alcohol, are also rather low. Environmental taxes are fairly low as well,
although not out of line with the rest of the OECD. One could consider increasing the VAT, which is
one of the least distortionary sources of revenues—although one should note that Austria’s VAT is
fairly efficient, with relatively little revenue (compared to other EU countries) lost to reduced rates or
evasion. Expenditure cuts could also be used for compensation and, specifically, over time one could
also consider lowering pension benefits commensurately with the reduction in contributions, given
the relatively high pension replacement rate in Austria.
12.
Lower payroll taxes would stimulate labor force participation and raise potential GDP.
According to OECD analysis,6 the employment rate in Austria could be raised by 2.4 percent within
10 years following a reduction of the average labor tax wedge to the level observed in the six OECD
economies with the highest employment rate. A simulation using the IMF’s GIMF model (see the
next subsection) shows that a one percent of GDP reduction in labor taxes offset by a cut in
government transfers would raise real GDP by three quarters of a percent over the long run.
13.
Reducing social security costs for low-skilled workers would be particularly effective.
According to a joint study by the OECD and the Institute for Advanced Studies, halving employer
social security contributions for workers in the bottom quintile of wage distribution (with the
budgetary impact offset by spending cuts) would increase low-skilled employment by about
1 percent and GDP by about a quarter percent.7 Increasing the in-work benefit for low-income
workers is a complementary option for lowering welfare walls. The interaction of the tax and benefit
systems creates a very uneven distribution of marginal tax rates, which spike to the neighborhood of
100 percent in some situation, and effort should be made to smooth those rates.
Simulation of budget-neutral tax reform
14.
The Fund’s Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal Model (GIMF) was applied to analyze the
impact of a budget-neutral tax reform on the Austrian economy. GIMF is a micro-founded, nonRicardian, multi-country, dynamic general equilibrium model developed at the IMF and used
extensively for policy analysis.8 The model features optimizing consumers, a realistic trade and
production structure, and a variety of fiscal instruments, making it well-suited for exploring the
effects of changes in fiscal policy.

15.
In the experiment, the labor tax is reduced permanently by one percent of GDP, and
government transfers are lowered by the equivalent amount. The reduction in the labor tax
corresponds approximately to a cut in the rate of social security contributions by 3 percentage
points.
16.
This reform would have a substantial, permanent impact on output (Figure A1). Lower
payroll taxes stimulate investment and work effort. As a result, real GDP increases relative to the
baseline of unchanged policy, with potential output higher by 0.8 percent in the steady state. With
time, private consumption also increases above the baseline. The trade and current account
balances improve marginally, mostly thanks to stronger exports.

Macroeconomic statistics are adequate for surveillance. Austria subscribed to the Fund’s
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in 1996, and its metadata are available on the Fund’s
electronic Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. Austria is availing itself of the SDDS flexibility
option on the timeliness of the industrial production index and the merchandise trade data.

The ECB reporting framework is used for monetary statistics and data are reported to
the IMF through a “gateway” arrangement with the ECB. The arrangement provides an efficient

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Austria
August 27, 2012

1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the Staff
Report (SM/12/207) was circulated to the Executive Board on August 2, 2012. The
information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Revised data shows somewhat stronger GDP growth in the first quarter of 2012,
while preliminary data confirms the expected deceleration in the second quarter.
Together with their Q2 flash release, the Austrian authorities have revised their quarterly
GDP series. Growth in 2012Q1 was revised upwards from 0.3 percent (qoq) to 0.5 percent
(qoq). The Q2 flash estimate shows a deceleration to 0.2 percent (qoq), mainly due to a
reduction of the external growth contribution to zero, but also somewhat weaker domestic
consumption. Looking forward, the weak external environment suggests that the deceleration
in economic activity will continue in the second half of the year and may even be stronger
than originally envisaged. All in all, annual growth for this year is likely to be somewhat
higher than the 0.8 percent in the staff report. However, growth prospects for 2013 may have
worsened, given the overall external environment. The inflation reading in July was
2.1 percent (down from 2.2 percent in June).

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Austria
On August 27, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Austria. 1
Background
Austria’s growth performance was strong in 2011, supported by buoyant employment, and
the economy has limited slack. For the year as a whole, growth amounted to 2.7 percent,
mainly driven by investment. Employment grew strongly, and unemployment reached
4.2 percent in 2011, the lowest rate in the euro area.
At 3.6 percent in 2011, inflation reached its highest level in decades as excise tax
increases and a stronger pass-through of commodity price hikes opened a gap to
Germany and the rest of the euro area. In the first half of 2012, these effects subsided
and the discrepancy narrowed, and inflation stood at 2.2 percent in June. On the other
hand, negotiated wage growth has accelerated to above 3 percent, reflecting the
backward-looking wage setting mechanism but also, possibly, tight labor market
conditions.
After peaking in 2008 at 5 percent of GDP, the current account has narrowed, reaching
1.9 percent of GDP in 2011. Imports were boosted by high energy prices, while exports as
a share of GDP remained below their 2008 record. Consistent with regional rebalancing,

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found

the bulk of the decline in the trade balance in 2011 was against the rest of the euro area.
The real and nominal exchange rates were broadly stable in 2011. Unit labor cost growth
accelerated, but in line with that in Austria’s trading partners, while the global export
market share continued its trend decline. Outward foreign direct investment (FDI) and
cross-border lending gathered steam, but some of Austrian portfolio investment abroad
was withdrawn, even as foreigners resumed portfolio investment in Austria. Capital flows
into Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe (CESEE) remain depressed, with only
timid signs of improvement, in part related to Austrian banks’ support to their subsidiaries.
The fiscal position has improved but public debt is still rising. In 2011, the deficit fell to
2.6 percent of GDP, but this improvement is likely to be partly reversed to some 3 percent
of GDP in 2012, on the back of slowing growth and significantly higher support to troubled
medium-sized banks. General government gross debt stood at 72 percent of GDP, up
from a pre-crisis level of 60 percent of GDP.
Banks’ profitability in 2011 suffered from the continued deterioration of loan quality in
several CESEE countries and losses on securities portfolios. Faced with external funding
pressures in the second half of 2011, Austrian banks increased their reliance on central
bank funding and cut their external positions. These cuts focused on markets other than
Austria and the CESEE, most notably the euro area periphery – though exposure to Italy
remains significant. The return on assets fell sharply during 2011, including because of
losses from the Greek private sector involvement. With the recovery in CESEE sluggish,
large write-downs on goodwill for past acquisitions and continued provisioning on the
growing stock of non-performing loans were necessary. In addition, Hungary’s scheme to
help borrowers indebted in foreign currency caused sizable losses for Austrian banks.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their strong economic performance
and noted that wage growth and low unemployment continue to support domestic
demand, contributing to a welcome rebalancing in growth. As a weaker external
environment is now taking a toll on economic activity, Directors concurred that a further
intensification of the euro area crisis represents the main risk to the economy. In this
context, they agreed that policies should be focused on preserving market confidence,
increasing resilience against adverse external spillovers, and boosting long-term growth.
Directors welcomed the adoption of a strong medium-term consolidation strategy, which
strikes an appropriate balance between fiscal prudence and growth considerations. They
agreed on the need to clearly identify measures that underlie the envisaged structural
adjustment, and recommended that the authorities prepare contingency plans in case
further support is needed for nationalized or partly nationalized medium-sized banks. In
addition, noting the long implementation lags of related reforms, Directors encouraged
additional steps to contain aging costs.

3

Directors welcomed the introduction of fiscal rules, which further strengthen the policy
framework. They noted, however, that a comprehensive reform of fiscal federalism is
needed to streamline intra-governmental financial arrangements and provide stronger
incentives for rule compliance to sub-national governments.
Directors noted that the legacy of an overly ambitious eastward expansion continues to
weigh on the banking sector. They welcomed the recent supervisory initiatives leading to
an increase in the capital buffer of large banks and looked forward to the prompt definition
of a strategy for a more efficient disposal of legacy assets in government-supported
medium-sized banks. Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans to strengthen early
intervention and resolution tools in the banking system in line with international best
practices.
Directors saw the new macroprudential guidelines as useful tools to improve financial
stability. A capital surcharge, recovery and resolution plans, and greater reliance on local
stable funding by foreign subsidiaries should bring about a more solid business model for
large and internationally active Austrian banks. Directors also welcomed plans to monitor
compliance with the guidelines in close cooperation with host supervisors.
Directors commended the authorities for the steps taken to foster labor market
participation by older workers and looked forward to a rapid implementation of these
measures. In addition, they encouraged the authorities to explore further reforms to
strengthen work incentives, including the equalization of male and female retirement ages
and the reduction of the tax burden on labor. Fiscal revenue losses from the latter reforms
could be compensated by increasing less distortionary taxes.

Statement by Mr. Johann Prader, Alternate Executive Director for Austria
August 27, 2012
The Austrian authorities welcome the consultations with the Fund and thank staff for the highquality report. They broadly agree with the assessment of Austria's economic and financial
situation and the recommendations on economic and financial policies.
The staff report describes the robust development of the Austrian economy in 2011, with real
GDP surpassing its pre-crisis level. So far, the economy has withstood the turmoil in the euro
area fairly well, but a slowdown may be inevitable in the second half of 2012, given the
deterioration of the external environment, also outside the euro area, and Austria’s extensive
trade and financial linkages. The fiscal position is relatively favorable in international
comparison. Fiscal rules have been further improved recently, setting the stage for ambitious
structural consolidation and a determined reduction of the debt burden. The Austrian authorities
broadly agree with the staff’s analysis of the challenges ahead as regards strengthening the longterm growth potential and improving the resilience of the banking sector.
Macroeconomic outlook
Staff rightly notes the strong fundamentals of the Austrian economy and resilience to shocks,
which resulted in solid growth of 2.7% of GDP in 2011 despite the worsening of the external
environment in the second half of the year. Output growth was supported by buoyant
employment and investment activity, while consumption growth remained subdued due to
relatively high inflation. Uncertainties over debt sustainability in the euro area periphery
might have affected consumer confidence.
According to the latest available estimates, the first half of 2012 saw a moderate expansion of
GDP, with growth rates of 0.5% in Q1 and 0.2% in Q2 (qoq). Employment growth continued
well into 2012, even outperforming GDP growth in Q2 2012. However, a slowdown has set
in and unemployment started to increase from past year’s post-crisis low of 4.2%. The
outlook for the remainder of the year has deteriorated over the past few weeks, as weakerthan-expected external conditions will weigh on export and investment activity. However, on
the back of solid consumption growth, supported by lower inflation and high wage increases,
the economy is expected to escape recession and the authorities’ current estimate of a growth
rate of 0.6% for 2012 as a whole should be feasible.
The authorities concur with staff that the main risks to the outlook are external and stem from
a further intensification of the debt crisis in the euro area and possible spillovers to important
trade and financial partners in CESEE. However, upward risks, in particular the possibility
that uncertainty abates more quickly than currently expected, should also be taken into
account. It is also noteworthy that Austrian sovereign bonds have been regarded as a safe
haven, with spreads over German Bunds declining since the start of the year and long-term
interest rates at historically low levels.
The staff report points out that Austria’s long-term growth potential would benefit from
reforms to strengthen work incentives. The authorities have undertaken important efforts in

2
this direction as part of the consolidation package enacted in early 2012. Access to early
retirement and invalidity pension has been tightened and the opportunity cost of withdrawing
from the labor market before reaching the statutory retirement age has been raised. Funds for
full-day child care and education have been increased with a view to encourage labor market
participation of women and low-skilled workers. The authorities continue to monitor labor
market developments very closely and give priority to structural issues in the formulation of
medium-term economic and fiscal policies.
Fiscal policy
The government has put in place a “debt brake” similar to the German model, restricting the
general government structural deficit to 0.45% of GDP from 2017. Its implementation was
accompanied by a comprehensive consolidation package, aimed at reducing the structural
deficit to 0.4% of GDP by 2016 and putting the debt ratio on a strictly downward path
from 2013 onwards. The package was applied in addition to the measures already
implemented in early 2011.
The baseline scenario in the staff report is very close to the authorities’ projections in the
Stability Program, thus underlining the overall credibility of the consolidation strategy. The
report points out that the yield of some revenue measures in 2012 and 2013 is uncertain.
However, Austria has a good track record of providing conservative and reliable revenue
estimates and executing the budget strictly, so that risks to the consolidation targets are
limited. Moreover, there are safety margins in the budget plans (e.g., interest expenditure
in 2012 is likely to turn out lower than budgeted) and thus possible revenue shortfalls could
be compensated. In the past, budgetary outcomes in Austria used to surprise on the upside
rather than on the downside. As regards savings from 2014 onwards, the authorities remain
fully committed to implement the necessary reforms in the areas of health care and subsidies
as planned in cooperation with regional governments.
Budget execution at sub-national levels has benefited from the strengthening of the
sanctioning mechanism in the Domestic Stability Pact in 2011, and will be reinforced this
year by a complete overhaul, which extends the “debt brake” and the main elements of the
reformed EU fiscal surveillance (debt and expenditure rules) to the state and local levels. It is
noteworthy that the strengthening of the sanctioning mechanism seems to have had an
immediate effect, with states overachieving deficit targets in the past year. Thus the risk of
overspending at sub-national levels has been reduced significantly.
The staff report commends the consolidation package for striking a good balance between
fiscal prudence and growth considerations, with structural reforms aimed at sustainable
expenditure reduction at the center of the strategy. The authorities have put emphasis on a
fair distribution of the burden without increasing mass taxes and with a view to futureoriented investment. Where taxes have been raised, emphasis has been put on broadening the
tax base and on high-income groups, so as to avoid an increase in labor taxes that would
counteract the efforts to increase work incentives.

3
Financial Sector
The Austrian banking sector is operating in a challenging international environment but
managed to weather the renewed sovereign and banking sector stress in selected euro area
countries relatively well so far. Over the past year, the liquidity management of Austrian banks
has become increasingly conservative and the sector as a whole continues to exhibit belowaverage reliance on central bank funding compared to other euro area banks. Wholesale funding
dependence is low in European comparison, and funding conditions for large Austrian banks
with significant CESEE operations continue to be favorable. Nevertheless, as part of the euro
area financial system, funding risks of Austrian financial institutions also remain contingent
upon the broader international environment and in particular on current efforts to contain the
crisis.
Recent foreign exposure developments by Austrian banks point at two diverging trends. On the
one hand, banks gradually scaled back their comparatively low exposures to euro area countries
with high risk premiums, partly related to the Greek PSI. On the other hand, the large and
diversified foreign exposure to the CESEE region remained broadly stable in recent months and
increased in many countries on an FX- and provisions-adjusted basis, as reflected in the staff
report. The widespread deleveraging concerns that were raised in late 2011 have not
materialized so far, and large Austrian banks continue to show a strong commitment to the
region.
Despite the only modest deleveraging pressures, it is also important to recognize that the
CESEE region has become, over the past three years, an increasingly heterogeneous market for
banks to do business, both in terms of risks and potential returns. Signs of growing
heterogeneity may not only be found in banking sector indicators such as credit risk or
profitability, but also in policy choices, as illustrated by the unorthodox policy measures set by
the Hungarian government in 2011, and macroeconomic conditions, as shown by the significant
cross-country variation in current economic forecasts. From a prudential perspective, it is
therefore obvious for CESEE banks to adapt to the increasingly heterogeneous operating
environment and gradually rebalance their exposure to those segments that offer more favorable
(and predictable) conditions than others. To the extent that exposure rebalancing is not
associated with competitive pressures for other banks, it should be regarded as standard
procedure in a market economy, and as something that prudential supervisors should expect
from financial institutions managing their risks.
The Austrian authorities are closely monitoring the exposure development of Austrian banks to
the CESEE region and are ready to set appropriate measures to prevent not only disruptive
deleveraging but also the opposite situation, i.e. the build-up of additional risks that exceed their
current risk-bearing capacity. Even though the large Austrian banks that participated in the EBA
recapitalization exercise were able to meet the Core Tier 1 capital requirements as of endJune 2012, their capital position remains below average compared to international peers. Given
the difficult market environment, a further strengthening of their risk-bearing capacity must be a
priority before engaging in further growth. In addition, the authorities agree with the staff’s view
that further expansion in the CESEE region should be funded to a larger extent by local stable
funding sources than in previous years, both from a credit risk and a funding risk perspective.

4

The set of macro-prudential guidelines known as the “Sustainability Package” and published by
the Financial Market Authority (FMA) and the Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB) in
March 2012, was an important move in the direction of encouraging large Austrian banks to
take further steps to permanently strengthen their capital base, further improve their liquidity
situation and enhance the sustainability of their business model. In order to safeguard as far as
possible the free movement of capital within the European Union, the Austrian authorities made
clear that specific measures based on the guidelines will only be set after consulting with host
authorities in the context of supervisory college cooperation. Given the large presence of
Austrian banks in the region, improvements along the objectives of the “Sustainability Package”
will not only benefit the affected banking groups, but ultimately financial stability in host
countries as well.
Given the sluggish economic environment, credit risks continue to exert a significant drag on
banks’ overall profitability. NPL ratios in many parts of the CESEE region continued to increase
during the second half of 2011, in particular in the foreign-currency loan segment. In Austria,
the large stock of foreign currency loans and repayment vehicles loans poses a more mediumterm challenge, assuming that the EUR-CHF exchange rate continues to stay at or above the
floor set by the Swiss National Bank for the time being. The authorities concur with the staff’s
view that banks should be conservative in allocating capital to the associated risks. The existing
guiding principles on foreign-currency lending in the domestic market are already in the process
of being harmonized with the respective ESRB recommendations. From 2013 onwards, Pillar 2
measures may be applied to cover the risks arising from existing funding gaps in repayment
vehicle loans.
