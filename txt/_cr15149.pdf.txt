IMF Executive Board Approves US$23.8 Million in Financial Support for Vanuatu

On June 5, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved
financial support for Vanuatu as it rebuilds its economy after a devastating cyclone hit the
country last March. The Board approved a disbursement of the equivalent of SDR8.5 million
(about US$11.9 million or 50 percent of quota) under the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF)1 and a
purchase in the equivalent of SDR8.5 million under the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI).2
Category-five Cyclone Pam struck Vanuatu on March 13, 2015. It took eleven lives, displaced a
quarter of the population, and destroyed a large share of Vanuatu’s housing stock, infrastructure,
tourist facilities, crops, and livestock. Estimated damage and losses to the economy exceed
60 percent of GDP.
At the conclusion of the Executive Board’s discussion, Mr. Min Zhu, Acting Chair and Deputy
Managing Director issued the following Statement:
“The macroeconomic impact of Cyclone Pam on Vanuatu is estimated to be severe. The
economy is likely to contract this year, and the trade deficit is expected to widen substantially.
“The main challenge in the short run is to secure sufficient resources from donors and
international aid agencies for reconstruction and rehabilitation. The government should seek
grant financing to the extent possible and seek synergies between the existing infrastructure
pipeline and reconstruction needs. Once the recovery takes hold, the government should rebuild
fiscal buffers.

1

The RCF provides rapid financial support in a single, up-front payout for low-income countries facing urgent
financing needs. Financial assistance under the RCF is provided as an outright disbursement to Poverty Reduction
and Growth Trust (PRGT)-eligible members that face an urgent balance of payments need, and where a full-fledged
economic program is either not necessary or not feasible. Financing under the RCF carries a zero interest rate
through 2016, has a grace period of 5½ years, and a final maturity of 10 years.
2

The RFI is similar to the RCF and designed for situations where a full-fledged economic program is either not
necessary or not feasible. Financial assistance provided under the RFI is subject to the same financing terms as
the Flexible Credit Line (FCL), the Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL) and Stand-By Arrangements (SBA), and
should be repaid within 3¼ to 5 years

2
“The disbursement under the Fund’s Rapid Credit Facility and the purchase under the Rapid
Financing Instrument are intended to help Vanuatu cope with its immediate balance-of-payments
needs and to catalyze critical donor support for the recovery.”

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Vanuatu

On June 5, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the 2015
Article IV consultation1 with Vanuatu.
Real GDP is expected to decline by 2 percent this year because of the cyclone damage to
Vanuatu’s main export sectors—tourism and agriculture—which will be only partially offset by
reconstruction activities and infrastructure investment. Risks to the outlook are biased to the
downside since reconstruction may be constrained by availability of funding and by
implementation capacity. In 2016, a recovery in tourism and agriculture combined with further
ramping-up of infrastructure projects is expected to propel growth to 5 percent.
With exports of goods and services depressed by cyclone damage and with imports boosted by
domestic shortages and reconstruction needs, the current account balance is projected to
deteriorate by 28 percent of GDP. This will put considerable pressure on Vanuatu’s international
reserves, which are likely to decline below prudent levels in the absence of substantial external
financing. To strengthen the reserves position, the authorities have requested financial assistance
from the IMF in the form an SDR8.5 million (about US$11.9 million) disbursement from the
Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) and a purchase of SDR8.5 million under the Rapid Financing
Instrument (RFI).2
Public sector recovery needs are estimated at about 20 percent of GDP. This combined with the
negative impact of economic disruption on government revenue and the public infrastructure
investment plans will exert significant pressures on the budget. As a result, fiscal deficits in the
order of 12 percent of GDP are expected in 2015 and 2016. The government plans to seek grant
financing as much as possible to close the fiscal gap. At the same time, the relatively low public
debt level (20 percent of GDP at end–2014) gives it room for concessional borrowing. Once the

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

The Executive Board approved the RCF and RFI for Vanuatu on June 5, 2015 (see Press Release No. 15/264).

recovery phase is over, the government should start rebuilding fiscal buffers through a
combination of revenue mobilization and expenditure control.
Executive Board Assessment3
Executive Directors expressed sympathy with the people of Vanuatu for the devastation
inflicted by Cyclone Pam, and noted the resulting pressures on the fiscal position and the
balance of payments. While reconstruction activity will partly offset the adverse impact of the
cyclone on tourism and agriculture, the economy is likely to contract this year, and risks are
tilted to the downside. Nonetheless, Directors were encouraged by Vanuatu’s track record of
prudent economic management, the resilience of the population, and the swift humanitarian
response. They expressed hope that the Fund’s financial assistance would catalyze additional
donor support.
Directors stressed the importance of a sound recovery plan and welcomed the work on the
National Recovery and Economic Strengthening Program. Noting the large cost of reconstruction
and rehabilitation, Directors supported the authorities’ intention to seek grant financing to the
extent possible before resorting to concessional debt. They recommended that the government’s
infrastructure investment priorities be aligned with absorptive capacity and, where feasible, with
the reconstruction efforts. They also advised strengthening the social safety nets.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to rebuild fiscal buffers once reconstruction
is completed, and to put public debt on a declining path over the medium term. This will
require efforts to improve revenue mobilization, strengthen spending discipline, rationalize and
raise the efficiency of public investment, and enhance public financial management. It would
also be prudent to establish a contingency fund.
Directors viewed the measures taken by the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu to support the economy
and the banking system as broadly appropriate. They noted the need to continue to adhere to
prudential norms during the recovery period and to undertake a thorough bank balance sheet
assessment once pressures subside.
Directors agreed that Vanuatu would benefit from reforms to improve the business environment
and promote economic diversification, alongside investments in infrastructure and human
capital. Reform of government business enterprises is also needed, and Directors encouraged the
authorities to submit a law based on the new Government Business Enterprise Policy to
parliament without delay.

Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND REQUEST FOR DISBURSEMENT UNDER THE RAPID
CREDIT FACILITY AND PURCHASE UNDER THE RAPID
FINANCING INSTRUMENT

KEY ISSUES
Context. Devastating Cyclone Pam hit Vanuatu on March 13, destroying a large share
of housing, infrastructure, tourist facilities, crops, and livestock. Estimated damage and
losses to the economy exceed 60 percent of GDP.
Outlook. GDP is projected to decline by 2 percent in 2015, and risks are to the
downside. A wide trade deficit in goods and services—driven by cyclone damage to
export facilities and a boost to imports from domestic shortages and reconstruction
needs—will put pressure on international reserves. Reconstruction spending is also
expected to give rise to large fiscal deficits. For 2015, staff projects a current account
deficit of 27 percent of GDP and a budget deficit of 12 percent of GDP.
Financial assistance. In view of the urgent balance-of-payments need, the authorities
have requested emergency assistance from the IMF under RCF and RFI in the amount
equivalent to SDR17 million (100 percent of the quota). Staff supports the request for
Fund assistance, which would help ease the pressure on the balance of payments and
catalyze financing from development partners to support the recovery and
reconstruction efforts.
Key policy recommendations:
concessional borrowing. Going forward, rebuild fiscal buffers and create room for
important social and development expenditures by reprioritizing spending,
strengthening public financial management, and increasing tax and non-tax revenues.
Also in the medium term, establish a contingency fund for natural disasters.
appropriate safeguards, and be ready to withdraw the liquidity once the situation is
stabilized.
rate basket peg at the current level for now but be ready to
review and adjust the level to support the external sector and rebuild buffers if balance

Official commitments. The authorities’ policies for the near term are broadly in line
with staff recommendations. The authorities are committed to preserving
macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability in the medium term.

BACKGROUND
1.
Cyclone Pam. A devastating cyclone struck Vanuatu on March 13, leaving in its wake
massive destruction and loss of life (Box 1). The Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) estimated
the damage to physical assets at 29.3 billion vatu (36.7 percent of the 2014 GDP) and production
losses at 19.3 billion vatu (24.2 percent of GDP), for a combined 60.8 percent of GDP.

no confidence vote in May 2014, partly because
of a controversial public-private airport
expansion deal that would have created a substantial contingent liability. The new government
canceled the deal and professed commitment to fiscal prudence in line with staff advice (Appendix
II). At the same time, it has kept public investment plans largely unchanged.
3.
Pre-cyclone economic developments. Real GDP rose 2.3 percent in 2014—a slight
acceleration from the 2013 pace of 2.0 percent. Agricultural production and exports boomed in
response to rising prices of copra, coconut oil, kava, and beef, but tourist arrivals declined from the
2013 peak, reflecting a slowdown in the Australian economy, Australian dollar weakness, and a
reduction in tourism promotion. Public infrastructure projects—which had been expected to boost
growth—were slow to get off the ground, but a submarine cable connection completed in January
2014 spurred growth in the ICT sector. Inflation dropped to 1 percent due to a deceleration in the
prices of food and household and electronic items. The current account balance recorded a surplus
of 0.5 percent of GDP after a deficit in the previous year on account of an improvement in the terms
of trade and increased official transfers. The basket-pegged vatu depreciated against the U.S. dollar
but appreciated against the Australian dollar over the course of 2014. The fiscal balance
strengthened to a surplus of 1 percent of GDP, reflecting improved tax compliance, high proceeds
from “commercial diplomacy” programs (Appendix III), and underspending on grant-financed
development projects.

IMPACT OF THE CYCLONE—OUTLOOK AND RISKS
4.
Outlook. Because of cyclone damage, tourism and agricultural output are expected to
sustain a big drop in 2015. Reconstruction activity and commencement of several large
infrastructure projects should provide a partial offset. On balance, real GDP is projected to decline
by 2 percent this year, in contrast to the pre-cyclone forecast of about 3½ percent growth.1 In 2016,
a recovery in tourism and agriculture combined with further ramping-up of infrastructure projects is
expected to propel growth to 5 percent. Cyclone-induced shortages, reconstruction activity, and
infrastructure projects are likely to raise inflation to about 2 percent in 2015, with a temporary
suspension of VAT on construction materials, tools and seedlings and a decline in oil prices
guarding against a more pronounced acceleration.
5.
Risks. The outlook is subject to considerable uncertainty, and risks are biased to the
downside (Appendix IV). The timing of agriculture and tourism recovery is difficult to predict. It
partly depends on the speed and size of insurance payments, which are still being assessed.2
Moreover, the scale and pace of reconstruction efforts may fall short of needs and expectations if
external financing is not sufficient or because of constraints on implementation capacity. Further
delays in infrastructure projects remain a possibility. From the external side, a larger-than-expected
slowdown in major advanced or emerging economies or a persistent appreciation of the U.S. dollar
would be a drag on Vanuatu, although their impact would likely be moderate given that Vanuatu’s
export sectors are currently supply-constrained. Finally, the danger of new natural disasters remains
ever-present. On the upside, the impact of post-cyclone monetary stimulus may prove larger than
expected.
6.
Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly agreed with staff on the outlook. They
emphasized that 2015 will be a challenging year. At the same time, they noted the resilience of the
people and the economy.

1

For a variety of reasons, including non-market production and the difference between gross output and value
added, output losses in PDNA do not translate directly into the impact on GDP. The projected impact of the cyclone
is broadly in line with Cabezon and others (forthcoming), Strengthening Macro-Fiscal Resilience to Natural Disasters
and Climate Change in the Small States of the Pacific, which relates GDP decline to the share of the population
affected by a natural disaster.
2
Insurance assessment is still ongoing. Insurance companies have reported 614 claims with an estimated total loss of
US$101 million. The actual payout is expected to be considerably lower.

Box 1. Cyclone Pam and Economic Impact of Natural Disasters in Vanuatu1
Devastating category-5 Cyclone Pam made a direct hit on Vanuatu on March 13, 2015. With wind
speed of up to 250 km per hour, it is one of the strongest storms ever and one of the worst natural
disasters in the Pacific region. All of the country’s provinces were affected including the capital city of Port
Vila, with the islands in the southern region struck particularly hard. Eleven fatalities were confirmed.
According to the OCHA reports, 188,000 people were affected across the country (out of a total
population of 265,000), including 60,000 school-age children.2 An estimated 65,000 residents were
displaced from their homes and several thousands were sheltered in evacuation centers. Approximately
15,000 buildings were damaged or destroyed, including houses, schools, and medical facilities. Large-scale
destruction of crops as well as agricultural infrastructure was reported, and the livelihoods of at least
80 percent of Vanuatu’s rural population were negatively impacted. With food and water supply
compromised, the spread of disease was a threat, although the worst fears had not materialized.
International humanitarian response was swift. It included in-kind assistance and pledges of financial
aid totaling US$50 million. Particularly large amounts of support were received from Australia (US$12
million), the United Kingdom (US$5.5 million), China (US$4.9 million), New Zealand (US$3.5 million),
Netherlands (US$2.9 million), and the United States (US$2 million). The UN Central Emergency Response
Fund has spent US$5 million through various agencies. The Asian Development Bank has provided
US$1 million from its Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund. In addition, Vanuatu has received a payout of
US$1.9 million under the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Insurance Pilot for the Pacific Islands. 3
A preliminary Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) led by the government and assisted by
development partners estimated the total damage and loss at 48.6 billion vatu, equivalent to 60.8
percent of GDP, of which 36.7 percentage points was attributed to damages and 24.2 percentage points
to production losses (Table 1). The sector that sustained the most damages was housing, which accounted
for 32 percent of the total damages, followed by tourism (20 percent), education (13 percent), and
transportation (10 percent). The largest production losses were estimated in the agriculture and tourism
sectors at 33 and 26 percent of total losses, respectively. The public sector accounted for 31 percent of the
total damages and losses, while the remainder was borne by the private sector. Recovery needs, at
42.0 percent of GDP, are nearly equally split between the public and the private sector.

GDP, compared with 8 percent in
the pre-cyclone baseline. Insurance payments and foreign direct investment are expected to cover a
relatively small part of the shortfall.4 Without additional external financing, international reserves
would decline to US$87 million (1.8 months of imports) by the end of 2015. Such levels would
clearly be inadequate, particularly for a country subject to large and frequent shocks. Even if the
fiscal gap (see the next section) is fully covered with external grants and loans, reserves would still
be expected to decline to 2.7 months of imports.

immediate economic, social, and humanitarian needs of Vanuatu. The RCF/RFI financing would
increase the reserve cushion to 3.2 months of imports at end-2015. This cushion is still too low given
high uncertainty about balance-of-payments flows this year, and the government continues to seek
additional external support with the RCF/RFI playing a catalytic role. Vanuatu has adequate capacity
to repay the Fund as the bulk of its public debt is concessional and the debt service is low relative to
projected export earnings and foreign reserves. With the RCF/RFI, Vanuatu’s repayments to the Fund
are projected to peak in 2019 at a low level of 0.6 percent of GDP, or 1.2 percent of exports of goods
and services (See Table 9 on Capacity to Repay the Fund).
9.
Policy commitments. The authorities are committed to implementing sound policies to
ensure macroeconomic stability and inclusive growth. As outlined in the Letter of Intent (Annex I),
the authorities’ agenda is broadly in line with staff’s recommendations presented in this report (see
below). Staff believes that the RCF/RFI will help achieve stable macroeconomic conditions and
encourage development partners to be more forthcoming in their assistance. The authorities
welcome a safeguards assessment as an opportunity to strengthen the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu’s
(RBV) governance and control framework.

2014 outturn. Last year the government recorded a surplus of 1 percent of GDP because of
improved tax compliance, strong performance of the Hong Kong Permanent Residency Visa
Program (HKPR) and Capital Investment Immigration Program (CIIP), and underspending on grantfinanced projects. Due to enhanced enforcement, VAT receipts exceeded budget expectations by
4 percent. Revenue was also boosted by the success of HKPR and CIIP, which brought in a higherthan-expected 1.3 percent of GDP. In addition, by year-end the government spent less than two
thirds of 4.1 percent of GDP it received in grants for several development programs and technical
assistance on infrastructure projects. At the same time, budget overruns by government offices and
programs remained a concern. Total expenditures exceeded the budget by more than 1 percent of
GDP, leading to two supplementary budgets. One of the triggers for the supplementary budgets
was a health care crisis, where payment delays and disputes had led to a temporary suspension of
services. Other major items in the supplementary budgets included payments to the submarine
cable company, covering a shortfall in the tertiary scholarship program, and a contribution to
electrification of Malampa, Penama, and Torba provinces.
11.
Pre-cyclone budget plans. In its 2015 budget, the government expected to increase
domestic revenue by 5.5 percent compared to the 2014 Budget, to 18.1 percent of GDP, mainly due
to higher VAT and HKPR receipts. Donor cash grants for social projects and productive sectors were
projected to almost double from the 2014 Budget. Expenses were projected at 20.5 percent of GDP,
including 1.2 percent of GDP allocated toward outstanding government obligations and severance
payments. Capital expenditures were expected to rise sharply as several major infrastructure projects
were ready to commence this year (Box 2). Even though two major projects (Luganville Wharf and
Bauerfield Airport Rehabilitation) were not included in the budget, it envisaged a deficit of

5.9 percent of GDP. With the infrastructure projects financed mostly with external grants and
concessional loans, the stock of external debt was projected to rise by 50 percent to reach
19 percent of GDP at year-end. In addition, the suspension of HKPR in January created a shortfall of
1.1 percent of GDP in projected revenues. In an effort to close that gap, the government expanded
the excise tax list, broadened the scope of CIIP, and introduced some expenditure control measures.
It also received 0.4 percent of GDP in budget support from the European Union.

complementarities between infrastructure projects and reconstruction activities and because of
reallocation of spending. About 3 percent of GDP is expected to be lost in tax revenues over the
next 3 years because of a lower tax base and also, in 2015, because of general disruption and a
three-month suspension of VAT on construction materials, tools and seedlings.

Box 2. Infrastructure Projects1
The Vanuatu government has been working with development partners in the last few years on setting up
several major investment projects to address the country’s infrastructure bottlenecks and boost growth.
Although the preparation took longer than expected, seven major projects are due to begin the construction
stage in 2015 with total investment of US$397 million (49 percent of 2014 GDP). The government plans to
implement them over the next five years.
List of projects (only the first five were included in the 2015 Budget):
1. Port Vila Urban Infrastructure (grant from Australia and loan from ADB);
2. Interisland Shipping Project (grant from New Zealand and loan from ADB);
3. International Wharf (loan from JICA);
4. Vanuatu Tourism Infrastructure (grant from New Zealand);
5. Tanna and Malekula Road (loan from China Ex-Im Bank);
6. Luganville Wharf (loan from China Ex-Im Bank);
7. Bauerfield International Airport Rehabilitation (loan from the World Bank).
Location: Most of the projects are aimed at improving wharves, airports and other infrastructure in Port Vila
and Luganville, which are the main urban areas. The Interisland Shipping Project and the Tanna and Malekula
roads are two projects aiming at improving transportation to and within outer islands and at facilitating market
access for the population living in those areas.
Delays: Arose mostly because of constrained implementation capacity. Initial design problems also increased
project costs and lengthened the preparation, as additional funding negotiations were needed.
Financing: These projects are mainly financed externally by grants and loans. Australia and New Zealand
provide together US$67 million for the urban and tourist infrastructure in Port Vila and for the Interisland
Shipping Project. The Asian Development Bank provides over US$34 million in loans for these projects with the
interest rate of 1.5 percent, 8-year grace period, and 36-year maturity (grant element of 45 percent). The
government will contribute US$8 million for the Port Vila Urban Infrastructure Project and the Vanuatu Tourist
Infrastructure Project. The other 4 projects are financed exclusively by loans. JICA signed a loan agreement in
2012 and expects to agree this year on a second loan to finance the International Wharf in Port Vila, totaling
US$84 million with less than 1 percent interest rate, 10–year grace period, and 30-year maturity (grant element
of 53 percent). Two loan agreements were signed with China Ex-Im Bank in 2014 for US$57 million and
US$87 million for the Tanna and Malekula Roads and the Luganville Wharf projects, respectively. These loans
have an interest rate of 2 percent, grace periods of 5 and 7 years, and 20-year maturity (grant element of 30
percent). The grace period starts from the moment the loan agreement is signed rather than from actual
disbursements. The World Bank has just finalized a US$59 million loan to improve the runway at the Bauerfield
International Airport with no interest, 10-year grace period, and 40-year maturity (grant element of 61
percent).
Current situation: In the aftermath of
cyclone Pam, the government expressed its
intention to keep the momentum and
continue these infrastructure projects as
planned.

Financing and resource mobilization. With revenue and expenditure projections as
outlined above, and counting only grants that have already been committed,5 the central
government’s operating budget would remain close to balanced, providing a fiscal anchor, even
as the overall deficit rises to nearly 12 percent of GDP in 2015 and 2016 and 10 percent in
2017 to cover reconstruction-related investments. The government has about 6 percent of GDP
per year lined up in project financing. Thus the government is facing a gap of about 15 percent
of GDP over 2015–17 between its projected deficits and identified financing sources. If that gap
is not filled, the government could borrow a limited additional amount from domestic banks and
further reprioritize expenditures, but it would also have to scale down its reconstruction efforts
and support for vulnerable groups. The authorities should seek further support from the
international community building on a solid recovery plan, with IMF financing playing a catalytic
role. Development partners have indicated their commitment to support Vanuatu, with specifics
to be determined after the recovery plan is unveiled.6 Still it is unlikely that all reconstruction
needs can be financed with grants. The government has ample fiscal space to access
concessional lending to meet the recovery and development needs in the context of a mediumterm fiscal plan. In the baseline it is assumed that the fiscal gap is filled with external
concessional loans from multilateral and bilateral donors on terms equivalent to a blend of IDA,
ADB, and China Ex-Im Bank terms.
14.
Rebuilding fiscal buffers. Following the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the
economy, the authorities should embark on a consolidation plan to rebuild fiscal buffers over the
medium term. Under the baseline of unchanged policies, central government debt is projected to
continue rising for several years after the cyclone, reaching 58 percent of GDP in 2020, largely
because of the government’s plans to ratchet up infrastructure investment (to a large extent
debt-financed). According to the Debt Sustainability Analysis, this trajectory elevates Vanuatu
from low to moderate risk of debt distress. Staff recommends the following policy priorities to
set the public debt ratio on a declining trend after 2017 (with a text table below quantifying the
impact):


Infrastructure projects. Staff supports the government’s policy to improve infrastructure in
order to raise Vanuatu’s growth potential, but the challenge is to do it in an efficient and
sustainable manner. Steps to increase absorptive capacity through adequate resource
allocation are essential for raising return on that investment. The country would benefit from
formulating an infrastructure investment plan that is aligned with the country’s development

5

In fiscal accounts, cash grants to the government are included under grants, while in-kind aid is classified as
non-tax revenue (which explains the projected increase in this item in 2015). Aid that does not go through the
government is recorded in the balance of payments, but not in fiscal accounts. The insurance payout from the
Pacific Catastrophe Risk Insurance Pilot is recorded as non-tax revenue in fiscal accounts and as a current transfer
in external accounts.
6

The macroeconomic projections reflect an expected financing contribution from multilateral institutions of
around US$90 million to Vanuatu’s recovery. Additional support from bilateral donors would help close the
remaining financing gap.

Revenue mobilization. Vanuatu government’s revenues are low in the regional context, and
staff recommends raising them starting in 2017 or after the recovery takes hold.7 The
government has recently initiated two programs that offer Vanuatu citizenship or residency
in exchange for a fee and an investment in the country—the HKPR and the CIIP. However, the
HKPR suffered a setback when the actions by Hong Kong, SAR authorities undermined the
incentive for Chinese citizens to seek Vanuatu resident status. While potentially lucrative,
“commercial diplomacy” programs carry integrity risks, and the revenues they generate are
temporary and unpredictable. Staff welcomes the government’s plan to raise non-tax revenue
(NTR) supported by PFTAC technical assistance. However, the necessary expansion of the budget
envelope would require additional measures, and the government should consider introducing
an income tax at moderate coverage and rates, which, according to PFTAC analysis, could yield 3–
4 percent of GDP.

Spending discipline. The fiscal room for priority development and social expenditures could
be expanded by controlling spending growth in other areas, including tertiary scholarships.

Government Business Enterprises (GBEs). GBEs operations remain opaque, and the
government is working with ADB to assess their financial situation and to improve governance
and performance (Appendix V). According to the latest data, government-guaranteed GBE debt
amounted to 4.6 percent of GDP at the end of 2014, adding to the burden of public debt.8 Staff
welcomes the GBE Policy approved by the Cabinet in October 2013. The implementation of these
reform proposals will help improve discipline, accountability and financial viability of GBEs. The
government should submit the new GBE law to Parliament without delay. The new law would
also allow it to proceed with rationalization plans developed for several commercial GBEs.
16.
Authorities’ views. The authorities noted that seeking grant financing for the recovery
plan was crucial, but additional borrowing was also contemplated. They emphasized the
significance of infrastructure projects for increasing the country’s production potential. They
agreed that spending discipline and revenue-raising measures are important for rebuilding fiscal
buffers in the medium term. The authorities expressed their appreciation for technical assistance
in the areas of PFM and NTR. They signaled their openness to introducing an income tax,
perhaps gradually, and indicated that they would welcome technical assistance on practical
aspects of that measure. They noted that the new GBE law is in final stages of review and will be
submitted to Parliament in June. Overall, their commitments expressed in the LOI are in line with
staff views.

All GBE debt is domestic, although some of it is owed to foreign-owned banks and is denominated in foreign
currency. The numbers for non-guaranteed GBE debt are not available.

B. External Sector
17.
Recent developments. In 2014, the trade balance improved noticeably due to favorable
terms of trade including a decline in oil prices and rising prices of key agricultural products,
namely copra, coconut oil, kava and beef, which stimulated their production and exports. Service
income remained robust despite a decline in tourism receipts compared to their peak in 2013.
Improvement in the trade balance together with inflows of foreign aid and income of ni-Vanuatu
workers participating in the Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) and Pacific Seasonal Employer
(PSE) schemes in New Zealand and Australia contributed to a current account surplus of
0.5 percent in 2014. Foreign direct investment was relatively small in 2014, partly reflecting a
”wait and see” attitude of private sector investors toward the government’s infrastructure
projects. As for the exchange rate, from January 2013 to end-2014, the vatu depreciated by
13 percent against the U.S. dollar while appreciating by 11 percent against the Australian dollar.
The value of international reserves in U.S. dollars increased considerably less than would have
been expected from the current, capital and financial account surpluses, indicating large errors
and omissions in the balance of payments and valuation losses due to U.S. dollar appreciation. At
end-2014 the reserves stood at a healthy level of US$184 million (5 months of pre-cyclone
import projection).

since exchange rate stability is important for
preserving confidence, while the effectiveness of a devaluation would be blunted by supply
constraints. At the same time, the authorities should review Vanuatu’s external position once the
reconstruction stage is over and be ready to adjust the level of the peg in the future if the
balance of payments remains under pressure.

ensure external stability over the medium term.

Box 3. External Sector Assessment1
Prior to the cyclone, Vanuatu was typically running moderate current account deficits, with a surplus
recorded in 2014. Generally, current account deficits in the past had been more than fully financed by stable
inflows of FDI as well as foreign capital grants and concessional loans. As a result, international reserves
increased gradually over time, providing buffers to external shocks. Under normal circumstances, the end-2014
level of international reserves—at 23 percent of GDP, about 5 months of import cover (using pre-cyclone
import forecast), and 165 percent of the Fund’s adequacy metric—would be deemed adequate by standard
thresholds.

The catastrophic cyclone will cause the current account deficit to widen substantially in 2015. Given that
cash crops and farming facilities were severely damaged by the cyclone, export receipts from the agricultural
sector are likely to plummet over 2015–16. Tourism earnings are expected to be dramatically affected this year,
as it will take time for tourists to return to Vanuatu following the cyclone and many major hotels will remain
closed for 3-6 months. Imports are poised to rise significantly due to increased demand for food supplies,
building materials and related items for reconstruction, as well as planned implementation of major
infrastructure projects. An increase in remittances is likely to be small since ni-Vanuatu diasporas abroad are
considerably smaller than those of some other Pacific nations, such as Samoa and Tonga. FDI and insurance
inflows are likely to increase and provide some financing for private sector recovery. Foreign aid from
development partners is anticipated to finance a portion of the BOP need. However, a large drawdown of
foreign exchange reserves would still be expected, which could bring the reserves below prudent norms. At the
same time, the impact of the cyclone is temporary, and reserves are expected to recover to adequate levels in a
few years.
The exchange rate appears to be broadly in line with
fundamentals. Standard exchange rate assessment
methodologies produce mixed results. The EBA-lite and
the macroeconomic balance approaches suggest an
undervaluation of 5 and 7 percent, respectively, while the
other approaches indicate an overvaluation ranging from
6 to 14 percent.2 Overall, there is no clear indication of
misalignment. Since these methodologies are subject to
limitations and are sensitive to assumptions, caution
should be exercised in interpreting the results.

C. Monetary and Financial Policies
20.
Background. The onshore financial system consists of commercial banks, one credit
institution, four insurance companies, and a national provident fund. Three of the four major
commercial banks are foreign-owned. National Bank of Vanuatu is majority-owned by the
government and is the only bank that has significant presence outside the urban areas. The
financial system in Vanuatu is relatively shallow and dominated by commercial banks. Non-bank
financial institutions generally play a limited role in Vanuatu’s financial system, with the exception
of the Vanuatu National Provident Fund (VNPF) given its relatively large asset size (20 percent of
total banking system assets) and its importance as a source of liquidity for commercial banks.
Commercial banks are well-capitalized and profitable. Banking system’s liquidity is high in the
aggregate, but is unevenly distributed, with some banks experiencing occasional shortages.

driven by a few large loans, before
declining to 11 percent at end-2014 due to significant loan write-offs. Credit growth remained
slow in line with anemic economic activity. To provide stimulus to the economy, RBV lowered its
policy rate from 5½ to 5¼ percent in November 2014. However, the pass-through from the
policy rate to lending rates is rather limited. Soon after Cyclone Pam, the government allowed
contributors to the VNPF to withdraw up to 20 percent of their retirement savings—a figure
expected to reach 2 billion vatu. This action was expected to put pressure on bank liquidity, as
VNPF would have to liquidate some of its term deposits in the banking system to fund the
withdrawals.
22.
Monetary policy. After the cyclone, RBV moved swiftly to support economic recovery
and financial stability by lowering its policy rate, reducing the required reserve ratio, and
activating RBV’s credit facilities. The policy rate was tied to the rate on RBV’s 91-day bill
(currently 1.8 percent). The Statutory Reserve Deposit (SRD) requirement was lowered from 7 to
5 percent to alleviate a potential liquidity pressure on banks after the VNPF withdrawals. The
Secured Advance Facility was reactivated, allowing banks to borrow at a rate 250 basis points
higher than the policy rate. The collateral requirement for this facility was relaxed and banks
could now use their required reserves—in addition to their holdings of government bonds and
RBV notes—as collateral. RBV also activated its new Import Substitution and Export Financing
facility, allowing commercial banks to borrow at 1 percent under the condition that the funds will

be on-lent to private firms in specific sectors at a rate capped at 5 percent.9 In staff’s view, the
liquidity measures provide immediate relief to banks and will support post-cyclone recovery in
the private sector. At the same time, liquidity support should be provided only to solvent banks
and against adequate collateral. The authorities should be ready to withdraw liquidity once the
situation is stabilized.
23.
Financial stability. Liquidity pressures may still emerge, and NPLs are likely to rise
because of cyclone damage. Commercial banks have voluntarily allowed their customers to
suspend debt service for 2 or 3 months after the cyclone. Hence the impact of the disaster on
loan performance has not yet crystallized. Staff emphasized that to safeguard against financial
stability risks in the face of an anticipated pickup in credit demand, supervisory policies should
ensure that banks continue to follow prudential norms for loan quality assessment with adequate
risk management. Once the recovery takes hold and the situation improves, RBV should
undertake a diagnostic assessment of bank balance sheets. If necessary, bank capital would need
to be replenished by the government for the government-owned commercial bank or the parent
banks in the case of foreign bank subsidiaries. Removing solvency concerns should also alleviate
liquidity pressures in individual institutions, allowing monetary and macro-prudential policies to
be driven by the overall economic and financial conditions.
24.
Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed with the importance of maintaining
prudential standards. In the current conditions, the focus of monetary and financial policies is on
supporting the economy and the banks. The authorities agreed with the necessity to evaluate the
situation in individual banks after the recovery takes hold and to take corrective measures if
necessary. They appreciated an offer to enlist PFTAC assistance with the diagnostic. The
authorities noted their continued efforts to strengthen the financial sector regulatory framework
through a number of measures. These include (i) implementing new prudential returns, which are
more comprehensive than the previous ones; and (ii) adopting new prudential guidelines in
several areas—such as asset classification, minimum provisioning, capital adequacy, and foreign
currency open positions—in line with international

in several categories. Similarly to other small islands, the economy is not very diversified. These
challenges have been exacerbated by the cyclone.
26.
Business environment. Infrastructure investment should be complemented with broad
reforms aimed at enhancing the business environment. There is room to improve Vanuatu’s
ranking on the ease of starting a business and registering property.10 The cost of electricity is
among the highest in the region. Land issues remain a challenge to business development,
although to a lesser degree than in many other Pacific islands. The recent reforms to dispute
resolution and leasing regime for customary land can be expected to improve transparency and
fairness, but their impact on the ease of doing business remains to be seen.
27.
Diversification. Vanuatu’s export base is narrow, concentrated in tourism (primarily from
Australia) and a few cash crops. Improvements in connectivity—thanks to the recently completed
submarine cable connection, planned investment in transport infrastructure, and lower fuel
prices—should facilitate introduction of new activities (e.g., call centers), robust growth beyond
the capital, and expansion into new markets. In particular, the growing middle class in emerging
Asia could be a major source of tourists, but tourism promotion in new countries is needed. On
the other hand, Vanuatu’s offshore financial sector has been under pressure from various Antimoney Laundering – Counter-terrorism Financing (AML-CTF) initiatives, and has shrunk further
after the Global Financial Crisis (Appendix VI). The government may wish to consider whether the
benefits of hosting the offshore financial sector outweigh the costs, including reputational risks.
28.
Inclusiveness. Staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to inclusive growth aimed at
fulfilling the National Vision of “A Just, Educated, Healthy and Wealthy Vanuatu” as elaborated in
the government’s Priorities and Action Agenda. Infrastructure development will improve both
inter-island connectivity and access to export markets. Staff supports the government’s
commitment to bringing financial services to remote areas of the country, including via mobile
banking and micro-credit. The authorities’ plan to improve access to electricity in rural areas as
well as in and around Port Vila is also welcome.
29.
Authorities’ views. The authorities emphasized their commitment to inclusive growth
and poverty reduction. They are developing strategies for providing low-cost housing to the
needy. The authorities agreed with the importance of diversifying the economy and shared their
plans for extending the submarine cable to other islands and private sector ideas for making
Vanuatu a business hub utilizing the high-speed internet connection. They expressed interest in
conducting a cost-benefit analysis in regard to hosting an offshore financial sector.

STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
Outlook. Vanuatu’s economy is projected to decline by 2 percent this year, primarily
because of massive damage to tourism and agriculture by Cyclone Pam, which is only partially
offset by reconstruction. As export sectors start to recover, 5 percent growth is expected in 2016.
10

These indicators should be interpreted with caution owing to a limited number of respondents, a limited
geographical coverage, and standardized assumptions on business constraints and information availability.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Risks are biased to the downside, particularly because of the uncertainty over the scale and
timing of the government’s reconstruction plans.
31.
Balance-of-payments pressures and the exchange rate. With plunging exports and
surging imports, RBV’s international reserves will decline below prudent levels unless substantial
assistance is provided by development partners. Staff therefore supports the authorities’ request
for balance-of-payments support in the amount of SDR17 million (100 percent of the quota)
under combined RCF/RFI. The Fund’s support would shore up reserves and catalyze aid from
other development partners. The exchange rate is broadly in line with medium-term
fundamentals and the peg should be maintained at its current level during the recovery period.
32.
Fiscal challenges. Reconstruction cost in the order of 20 percent of GDP and some loss
of tax revenue will put considerable pressures on the budget. The government should seek
grants assistance as much as possible, formulating a sound recovery plan and building on the
catalytic role of RCF/RFI. However, some recourse to concessional debt is unavoidable given the
large size of the reconstruction cost. This borrowing, combined with that from the government’s
infrastructure investment plans, will cause the public debt to increase sharply in the next several
years, and debt sustainability analysis indicates a shift from low to moderate risk of debt distress.
Where feasible, the infrastructure investment pipeline should be used to support the current
reconstruction effort and mitigate risks from possible future disasters.
33.
Fiscal adjustments. The government should initiate steps to ensure that fiscal buffers are
rebuilt once the reconstruction phase is over. Fiscal consolidation measures needed to put the
public debt ratio on a downward trajectory include (i) revenue mobilization, with income tax
introduction emerging as a viable option; (ii) spending discipline, including via strengthening
public financial management; and (iii) rationalization of public investment in the context of a
comprehensive infrastructure development plan aligned with national priorities, implementation
capacity, and fiscal space. Steps in these areas should be taken as a high priority.
34.
Government business enterprises. The authorities’ efforts to ascertain the financial
position and improve transparency and governance of GBEs are timely. The government should
submit the new GBE law to Parliament without delay and proceed with its rationalization plans
for commercial GBEs.
35.
Monetary policy. RBV’s measures to support the economy and the banking system are
welcome. Liquidity should be provided to solvent banks against adequate collateral. Supervisory
policies should ensure that banks continue to follow prudential norms in their loan assessment,
with adequate risk management.
36.
Financial sector. The banking system appears well-capitalized. However, the high level of
NPLs is a source of concern, and liquidity, while high overall, is distributed unevenly. Liquidity
support for the banking system is essential at the moment. However, once the pressures subside,
a thorough assessment of bank balance sheets should be conducted and, if necessary, bank
capital should be replenished.

20

37.
Structural policies. Vanuatu would benefit from reforms aimed at enhancing the
business environment, including by making it easier to start a business, register property, and
lease land. The recently established high-speed internet connection should facilitate
diversification of the economy. The authorities’ commitment to economic and financial inclusion
is welcome.
38.
Consultation cycle. Given the devastation to the economy and the need for close
monitoring and consultation with the authorities in the coming year, it is recommended that the
next Article IV consultation be held on the 12–month cycle.

Appendix I. Letter of Intent
May 20, 2015
Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, N.W.
Washington, DC 20431, USA
Dear Ms. Lagarde:
On the 13th of March 2015, a category-five tropical cyclone, Pam, hit Vanuatu, resulting in the
loss of eleven lives and in extensive damage to infrastructure, agriculture, housing, and tourist
facilities. The cyclone undermined food security for more than 60 percent of the country’s
population, destroyed or severely damaged more than a quarter of the housing stock, and
disrupted the provision of essential services such as water, electricity, and telecommunication.
With many schools damaged and several used as shelters, education has been disrupted.
Damage to hospitals and clinics has interfered with health service delivery just as the need has
surged.
The Damage and Loss Assessment completed in April puts the total value of the damages to
property at VT29.3 billion or US$283 million. Together with estimated production losses of
VT19.3 billion, or US$186 million, the total estimated cost of the cyclone amounts to
VT48.6 billion, or US$469 million, equivalent to 61 percent of GDP.
The disaster has set back our efforts to develop the economy. It has damaged critical
infrastructure such as bridges, roads, wharves, and airports. The tourism sector—Vanuatu’s main
source of foreign exchange—has been hit hard, with several major hotels closed for repairs.
Agriculture has suffered even more, as this year’s crop has been destroyed in many parts of the
country, and some areas will take years to recover; moreover, much livestock perished in the
cyclone and many fishing boats were damaged. We expect our economic growth to be
considerably lower this year than the robust expansion anticipated prior to this sudden and
exogenous shock, even after taking into account reconstruction activity.
With Vanuatu’s main export sectors—tourism and agriculture—severely affected by the cyclone
and with imports boosted by emergency response, recovery and reconstruction needs, and
infrastructure investment, we project a sharp deterioration of our trade balance for 2015, in the
order of 35 percent of GDP. While this deterioration will be partially offset by insurance receipts,
external assistance, and private capital inflows, it will put pressure on our external position, and
we are concerned that our international reserves may fall to a dangerously low level.
The deterioration of the current account balance will also reflect a worsening of our fiscal
position. Supporting the vulnerable population and restoring public facilities and infrastructure
will necessitate considerable expansion in government expenditures even as revenues will suffer
with the weak economy. Public sector recovery and reconstruction needs estimated at
VT17.7 billion, or 21 percent of GDP, will have to be accounted for as additional expenditures for

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

35

VANUATU

2015 and beyond. In mobilizing financial resources for recovery and reconstruction, we intend to
remain prudent and avoid excessive debt accumulation. We will seek external grants as much as
possible before resorting to concessional loans or domestic borrowing. So far, Vanuatu has
received US$50 million worth of emergency assistance in cash and in kind. We intend to seek
synergies between our planned development projects and reconstruction work, as well as to
reduce expenditures in other areas where possible. Despite these efforts and some insurance
payments, we still have a fiscal financing gap of about 15 percent of GDP, over the period
2015–17.
Against this background, the Government of Vanuatu would like to request financial assistance
from the International Monetary Fund to address Vanuatu’s urgent balance-of-payments need
and prevent an immediate and severe economic disruption. The assistance would be in the
amount equivalent to SDR17 million (US$23.5 million) as a disbursement of SDR8.5 million
(50 percent of our quota) under the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) and a purchase of SDR8.5 million
under the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) to ease the pressure on our fiscal position and official
foreign reserves. We have been holding extensive discussions with our key development partners
on possible financial support and we expect that Fund assistance would help catalyze additional
inflows of external resources.
While significant increases in budget deficits and public debt are inevitable as we rebuild our
economy, we are committed to restoring our fiscal and financial buffers over time. We will
embark on fiscal consolidation as soon as economic recovery takes hold and aim to put the ratio
of public debt to GDP on a declining path. To this end, we will take the following steps: (i)
strengthen spending discipline by stricter adherence to budget allocations, strengthening
internal audit, and making other improvements in public financial management, with technical
assistance from PFTAC; (ii) review our infrastructure investment program to ensure that debtfinanced projects fit into our country’s overall development strategy and are in line with our
implementation capacity; (iii) mobilize additional fiscal revenues (which are currently low in
comparison to regional peers) via further improving compliance, raising non-tax revenues, and
other measures—possibly including introducing an income tax. Moreover, with technical
assistance from the World Bank, we will enhance our debt management framework in order to
lower borrowing costs and minimize debt risks. The government will finalize rationalization
strategies for eight Government Business Enterprises (GBEs) and submit to Parliament a new GBE
bill aimed at improving their discipline, accountability and financial viability. While enforcing
expenditure control, we will make sure that vulnerable groups of the population are protected
and sufficient funds are allocated for primary and secondary education and for health care.
We have lowered the policy interest rate and reduced the statutory reserve deposit requirement
to support economic recovery and ensure that banks have sufficient liquidity. We will continue to
support the economy and the banking system while maintaining adequate safeguards. In the
same vein, our supervisory policies will make certain that banks continue to follow prudential
norms for loan quality assessment with adequate risk management. Once the recovery takes hold
and the situation normalizes, we will undertake a diagnostic assessment of bank balance sheets
and, if necessary, seek to replenish bank capital. Building on several recent regulatory and

36

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

VANUATU

supervisory steps, we will further strengthen Vanuatu’s Anti-Money Laundering and CounterTerrorism Financing (AML/CTF) regime. We will introduce amendments to the 2014 AML/CTF Act
that will bring it in conformity with international standards.
Our exchange rate regime has served the country well, and we will maintain the value of the vatu
against the currency basket to preserve private sector confidence. Once the reconstruction stage
is over, we will review our balance-of-payments outlook and assess whether the current level of
the peg is consistent with external sustainability or whether an adjustment is needed to restore
competitiveness.
Vanuatu will promote inclusive growth through structural reforms. Private sector development
and employment creation are top priorities in our Priorities and Action Agenda. As assessed by
the World Bank, our business environment compares favorably with regional peers, but we will
seek improvement in the few lagging areas, such as the ease of starting a business. Our
infrastructure plans target development in several islands and will improve connectivity across
the country. The recently established—via a public-private partnership—submarine cable
connection will provide additional opportunities. The government will continue its efforts to
bring financial services to remote areas of the country, including via mobile banking and microcredit. We are developing strategies for providing low-cost housing to the needy. In cooperation
with the World Bank, we are working on improving access to electricity in rural areas as well as in
and around Port Vila.
The Government of Vanuatu values its cooperation with the IMF and takes its obligations
seriously. We do not intend to introduce measures or policies that would compound the
balance-of-payments difficulties. We do not intend to impose new or intensify existing
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, trade
restrictions for balance-of-payments purposes, or multiple currency practices, or to enter into
bilateral payments agreements which are inconsistent with Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of
Agreement. Furthermore, we commit to undergoing a safeguards assessment, providing IMF
staff with access to the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu’s most recently completed external audit
reports, and authorizing our external auditors to hold discussions with IMF staff. The Reserve
Bank of Vanuatu will publish soon on its website the audited financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2013.

Appendix II. Vanuatu—Staff Policy Advice from the
2013 Article IV Consultation
Staff Advice
Monetary policy should remain geared toward
maintaining high international reserves and low
inflation.

Continue with conservative approach to debt
financing.

Assess carefully financing options for new large
infrastructure projects, in particular the
upgrading of the airport system.

Seek new revenues; specifically, introduce an
income tax.

Concentrate public spending on areas where
impact is highest while holding government
agencies accountable.
Conduct reforms to increase the effectiveness of
the civil service, enhance competition in key
sectors, and improve the accessibility of land.

Reform government business enterprises (GBEs)
to control risks and improve financial
performance.

Introduce regulations limiting net open foreign
exchange positions.
Pay attention to liquidity and credit risks.

38

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Policy Action
Low and stable inflation rate and maintaining a
sufficient level of official foreign exchange
reserves remain the main objectives of RBV’s
monetary policy. Over the last two years
international reserves have risen to 5 months of
imports, while inflation has remained low and
stable.
Public debt declined in 2013 and 2014, and the
new Prime Minister has pledged a cautious
approach to external borrowing. However, the
2015 Budget envisaged large infrastructure
investment, much of it debt-financed.
The new government has canceled the
controversial large-scale airport expansion plan
and finalized a loan agreement with the World
Bank to finance repairs and upgrading of the
existing main international airport.
The authorities have raised new revenues by
improving VAT compliance and via economic
citizenship programs. They are planning to
increase non-tax revenue with PFTAC assistance.
An income tax remains under consideration.
Overspending in some areas (tertiary
scholarships) and underfunding in others (health
care) has led to recurring supplementary budgets.
Vanuatu has made property transfers faster by
digitizing its land registry system. The impact of
recent changes to the regime for leasing
customary land is not yet clear. Initiatives to
promote renewable energy sources may increase
competition in the electricity sector.
The Cabinet approved a new policy aimed at
improving discipline, accountability and financial
viability of GBEs in October 2013. However, no
law based on that policy has yet been introduced
in parliament. A workshop on GBE reform
organized by ADB took place in Port Vila in
September 2014.
Regulation limiting net open foreign exchange
positions has been drafted, but not yet
introduced.
RBV has tightened prudential guidelines on loan
classification and increased the amount of
information it collects on banks’ financial
position.

Appendix III. Economic Citizenship Programs in Vanuatu and
around the World1
Economic citizenship programs have gained popularity over the last decade, particularly in
smaller nations. Several Pacific island countries, including Vanuatu, have adopted or are
considering variations of such programs. This note lays out (i) examples of economic citizenship
programs from around the world, highlighting their benefits and drawbacks; (ii) the economic
citizenship programs initiated recently in Vanuatu, and (iii) measures to mitigate the risks of such
programs.

Programs in Other Countries
Economic citizenship programs—where a country’s citizenship or resident status is granted in
exchange for a substantial investment in the national economy—have become increasingly
popular in recent years.2 The motivation for investors varies, but often includes acquiring a
“passport of convenience” that would allow them to travel visa-free to a larger set of countries
than their original passport. Tax considerations also play an important role.
Most of the citizenship programs have been set up by relatively small nations (Table 1), and in
case of a successful launch, the revenue they bring to the budget may be quite substantial. In
one striking example, St. Kitts and Nevis’s Citizenship-by-Investment program collected
13 percent of GDP in budget revenue and similar amounts in contributions to the Sugar Industry
Diversification Foundation and in real estate investments in 2013. The scale of most other
programs is considerably more modest.
Almost everywhere, economic citizenship programs have given rise to various concerns. Often
there are claims of irregularities in the process and of diversion of funds by agents or
government officials for personal gain. Such problems marred a recent program in Comoros and
several early experiments in Pacific island nations, leading to their suspension or
discontinuation.3 There have also been allegations of passports being sold to terrorists and
criminals, facilitating their travel and allowing them to avoid extradition. This has led to
countermeasures, such as a recent imposition of visa requirements on citizens of St. Kitts and
Nevis by Canada.
Thus, economic citizenship programs have the potential to supplement government revenues.
However, their scale is difficult to predict, which complicates macroeconomic management. Very
large inflows may be difficult to intermediate, and care needs to be taken to avoid overheating
and loss of competitiveness by domestic producers. Even more perniciously, such programs
inflict reputational risks. Thus the inflows are subject to sudden stops in response to internal or

Vanuatu’s “Commercial Diplomacy” Programs
In the 1990s, there had been attempts to establish passport selling schemes in Vanuatu, which
required the state to waive its ten-year residency requirement for citizenship and lift its dual
citizenship prohibition. Many of them failed after fraud was publicized. Nevertheless, in the
period of 1996–1997, the country received 1.5 percent of GDP in revenue from selling
300 passports. But reports of illegal issuance of passports, some of which had been sold to
criminals, damaged the country’s international reputation. Some countries, such as Canada,
dropped visa waivers for Vanuatu nationals.
Over a decade later, the country has started
two new economic citizenship programs.
a. Hong Kong Permanent Residency
(HKPR) Visa Program
The Hong Kong permanent
residency visa program was
launched in September 2011. It was
targeted at investors from mainland

China who wanted to apply for Hong Kong permanent residency, particularly via the
Hong Kong Capital Investment Entrant Scheme, and thus needed residency from a
country or territory besides China and Hong Kong to be qualified to apply under this
scheme. In order to obtain Vanuatu’s permanent residency status, an investor had to
apply via an agent based in Hong Kong and invest at least $2,800 (300,000 vatu) in
companies registered in Vanuatu. The Vanuatu visa is valid for 10 years, within which
time the investors are expected to be granted Hong Kong permanent residency. So far
the program has attracted about 1500 investors and generated close to 2½ percent of
GDP in revenue since its inception. However, the Hong Kong Capital Investment Entrant
Scheme was suspended in January 2015, eliminating the main incentive for the mainland
Chinese to seek Vanuatu residency. Consequently, the Vanuatu government has
suspended HKPR, which was projected to bring 1.1 percent of GDP to the budget in
2015. Still, the authorities hope that as a result of this program, Vanuatu would become
better known in China as a destination for investment and tourism.
b. Capital Investment Immigration Plan (CIIP)
In addition to the Hong Kong Permanent Residency Visa Program, Vanuatu has recently
established the Capital Investment Immigration Plan (CIIP), whose target group is not
limited to the Chinese. In exchange for the Vanuatu citizenship, an investor has to pay a
$40,000 fee and invest $260,000. The investment, which will be returned to the investor
after 7 years, is allocated to deposits in partially-government-owned National Bank of
Vanuatu (25 percent), Vanuatu long-term government bond (25 percent), and real
investment in the country’s various islands (50 percent). The authorities hope that the
return from the real investment alone would be sufficient to fully repay investors. The
program was launched in 2014 and brought in about 0.2 percent of GDP that year.
Measures to Mitigate the Risks of Economic Citizenship Programs
Drawing from the past experience of various countries, including that of Vanuatu, a number of
measures can be implemented to mitigate the risks and address the drawbacks of the economic
citizenship programs.
a. Proper screening of applications: To avoid abuses of the programs as channels to
conceal criminal activities, adequate oversight and background checks, including
screening criminal records from the country of origin and the sources of investment and
fees, should be applied to all applications.
b. Ensuring transparency of the identity of the new citizens, the investments made,
and revenue management: Publishing the identity of the new citizens would enable
foreign authorities to identify potential misuse of the schemes and allow financial
institutions to build more precise profiles of the new citizens. Revenues and spending
related to the programs should be audited (to avoid mismanagement by government
officials and agents) and published.

c. Saving revenues from the programs for future needs: In case of substantial inflows, it
will be important to save a fair portion of the revenues to help address future financing
needs and to ensure that sufficient safeguards are in place to prevent misuse of the
revenues.

Appendix V. Overview of Government Business Enterprises in
Vanuatu1
State-owned enterprises are termed Government Business Enterprises (GBEs) in Vanuatu. While
there are 22 GBEs, not all are engaged in commercial activities. Those GBEs that are majority
owned by the government and operate under a commercial mandate are termed Commercial
Government Business Enterprises (CGBEs), of which there are 11—Airports Vanuatu Limited
(Airports), Air Vanuatu (Operations) Limited (AVL), Asset Management Unit (AMU), Metenesel
Estates Limited (MEL), National Bank of Vanuatu (NBV), National Housing Corporation (NHC),
Vanuatu Agriculture Development Bank (VADB), Vanuatu Broadcasting & Television Corporation
(VBTC), Vanuatu Commodities Marketing Board (VCMB), Vanuatu Livestock Development Limited
(VLDL), and Vanuatu Post Limited (VPL).
The remaining GBEs comprise six regulatory bodies,2 four minority holdings,3 and one mutual
financial institution.4 This appendix focuses mainly on the CGBEs.
Historically the entire GBE portfolio has performed poorly. While some entities demonstrate
sound governance and financial management, such as AVL, Vanuatu Post, NBV and VNPF, many
GBEs have poor governance and accountability as well as lax financial management. Some CGBEs
have not produced audited financial statements since the 1990s.5
Poor governance compounds the weak financial management. Of the 64 directors serving on the
11 CGBE boards, 37 directors (or 58 percent) comprised public servants, a further three
(5 percent) were GBE chief executives, and the remaining 24 positions (38 percent) were allocated
to independent private sector members. 6 In the main, the public servant directors were
appointed by the relevant sector or line ministries, further compromising their ability to act in the
best interests of the GBEs.
The
GBE’s
poor
financial
reporting
is
demonstrated
in
the
government’s
December 2013 account—the most recent available—where the financial data for the GBEs only
covers financial year 2011 and 2012 financial years. 7 The report indicates that total net
investment in the GBEs was 7,120 million vatu (nearly 10 percent of GDP), of which the CGBEs
comprised 5,493 million vatu (77 percent of the total). While the CGBEs are a significant
investment, comprising 22.87 percent of the government’s total net worth, the returns are poor,
contributing negative 78 million vatu in the 2012 financial year. The only two CGBEs that
provided the government shareholder with a positive return in 2012 were the National Bank of

Current and Future Developments
A. GBE Reform Policy
Recognizing that the status quo is not sustainable, the government has embarked upon a GBE
reform program with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). A GBE reform policy
was drafted in 2012 and adopted by the Council of Ministers (COM) in October 2013. The key
elements of the approved Policy include:


A primary objective for all GBEs to operate as profitable businesses;



Development of a robust community service obligation (CSO) framework requiring GBEs and
the government to properly identify, cost, contract and fund CSOs;



Enhanced governance, establishing basic director duties and requiring directors to be
appointed on the basis of best skill and experience;



The appointment of one minister responsible for all GBEs—the Responsible Minister;



GBEs must develop forward-looking business plans and statements of corporate intent;

8

Air Vanuatu (Operations) Limited recorded a surplus of 314 million vatu, but received additional equity of 425
million vatu to cover prior period losses.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

45

VANUATU



Improved transparency and accountability by requiring audited accounts to be produced in a
timely manner, tabled in Parliament and a summary published in local newspapers; and



The formal establishment of a GBE monitoring unit in the Ministry of Finance and guidelines
on how the Unit will operate and support the Responsible Minister.

B. GBE Legislation
Following the adoption of the Reform Policy, the government requested the ADB to draft a GBE
Bill,9 which was done in 2014 after consultation with GBEs and relevant sector ministries. The bill
follows the framework established by the GBE Reform Policy and all of the matters listed above
have been incorporated into the bill. Other provisions to note are:


The content of the statement of corporate intent (SCI) and business plan, as well as when
they need to be prepared and delivered to the Responsible Minister and adopted by the
board, are specified. The board must consult with the Minister on the content of the SCI and
business plan and they must clearly demonstrate how the GBE will achieve the Primary
Objective;



SCIs must be tabled in Parliament after they have been adopted;



Politicians may not be appointed to GBE boards and the number of public servants that can
be appointed is limited;10



General duties of GBE directors are clearly established in the bill as are board processes
including management of meetings, quorums, etc.;



There are provisions dealing with disclosure of interests, and GBEs must establish codes of
conduct;



Audited reports must be submitted to the Responsible Minister within 3 months from the
end of a financial year and summary accounts published in local newspapers. The audited
report must be tabled in Parliament; and



The bill defines the role, powers and responsibilities of the Responsible Minister.

The bill represents best international practice. The government has indicated that it intends to
submit the bill to Parliament in June 2015.

Reform and Rationalization
In 2014 the government identified eight CGBEs as reform priorities.11 With assistance from ADB,

rationalization strategies were developed for seven of the targeted CGBEs. The Vanuatu
Commodity Marketing Board, which had already been identified by the government as
warranting liquidation, was excluded. However, the government is now considering a revised role
for the Board. Reform strategies include:


COM papers have been prepared recommending the liquidation of Asset Management Unit,
Vanuatu Livestock Development Limited, and Metenesel Estates Limited;12



Identification, costing and contracting community service obligations (CSOs) for the
24 unprofitable domestic air routes serviced by Air Vanuatu. Informal and unfunded CSOs
undermine Air Vanuatu’s financial performance. As of 31 December 2013, AVL had 1.4 billion
vatu of outstanding loans from the government, up from 870 million four years earlier. In
addition, government loan guarantees totaled 2.1 billion vatu,13 up from 900 million vatu at
the end of 2009. Because of losses in most years—except for the 314 million vatu profit in
2012—Air Vanuatu’s net worth decreased from negative 166 million vatu at the end of
2008 to negative 600 million vatu as of 31 December 2013.14



Identification, costing and contracting CSOs for Vanuatu Post. CSOs are estimated to cost
Vanuatu Post 28 million vatu per year.



COM has approved using commercial assets—a quarry and development lands—owned by
National Housing to repay 60 million vatu owed to the government. If additional cash is
raised through this commercialization process, it will be returned to the government as
shareholder.



The separation of the commercial and regulatory functions undertaken by VBTC and an
assessment of whether the commercial activities should be privatized.

Adoption of the reform strategies will improve the commercial performance of the CGBEs;
release capital for the government through debt repayments and asset sales; and reduce
potential future claims on the government’s balance sheet.
Enacting the CGBE Bill and ensuring that it is fully implemented will support improved CGBE
performance through mandating an unambiguous commercial objective and requiring greater
transparency and accountability, improved governance, and effective ownership monitoring.

Appendix VI. Offshore Financial Sector in Vanuatu1
A. Overview of the Offshore Sector in Vanuatu
Vanuatu’s offshore financial sector was established under the 1970 Banking Act during the
joint Anglo-French Condominium. The adoption of an offshore financial center (OFC)2 was seen
as a potential source of growth for a geographically-isolated and largely undiversified economy.
By diversifying away from a declining agricultural sector, the OFC created a major boost for the
country and helped transform Port Vila during the 1970s and 1980s. The offshore financial sector
comprises offshore banks, non-bank entities including insurance companies, trust, company
service providers, as well as shipping registry.
The size of the offshore banking sector has declined dramatically over the past two
decades. After its peak at 120 in 1993, the number of offshore banks has fallen to only two at
present (Table 1), which represents at most 10 percent of the overall offshore sector.3 Meanwhile,
the number of international companies had steadily increased since the enactment of the
International Companies Act in 1993 to currently over 5,000 companies at its peak in 2006.4
International companies have been the primary product of the OFC in Vanuatu, contributing up
to 80 percent of the OFC’s income (IMF, 2005). The rest of the OFC institutions are of minor
importance to the overall offshore industry. The offshore industry’s clients are mostly from
Australia, New Zealand, and Asia, without a single area of concentration (in contrast with Samoa’s
concentration in China and Cook Islands’ focus on the United States). There are very few clients from
the United States and most of them would route their transactions via a third country rather than
directly to Vanuatu.

2

“Offshore sector” and “offshore financial center (OFC)” are used interchangeably throughout this report.

3

The number of offshore banks in Vanuatu declined to 2 banks during the first quarter of 2015. According to
RBV, 5 new offshore banks recently applied for new licenses. However, they have yet to conduct banking business
as they face difficultly in establishing offshore correspondent banks.
4

The decline in the number of international companies since 2007 started with the downturn in the global
financial markets and the subsequent Global Financial Crisis in 2008. However, the new registrations of
international companies picked up again during 2011–2014 as Vanuatu’s government actively promoted its
international company sector by providing Vanuatu Registry Services in Hong Kong and Singapore, along with
the Hong Kong Permanent Residency (HKPR) program launched in 2011. The number of international companies
registered through Hong Kong reached 1,706 companies by 2013. However, this trend is likely to cease with the
recent suspension of the HKPR program.

B. Offshore Banks
All offshore banks are prohibited from undertaking business with residents of Vanuatu, including
making loans to them or accepting local deposits. The decline of the offshore banking sector
during the late 1990s and early 2000s largely reflected the authorities’ effort to improve the
reputation of Vanuatu’s OFC and withdrawal of private offshore clients in the wake of adverse
publicity for the region and outside pressure for more transparency of OFCs, as well as increased
foreign competition. Total reported assets of the remaining seven banks, as of November 2014,
were approximately US$73 million, roughly 10 percent of the domestic banks’ assets. More than
half of the assets were recorded as market-related instruments and investments, while only about
7 percent of the assets were recorded as loans and advances.
Before the adoption of the 2002 International Banking Act, there was no requirement for
offshore entities to maintain a physical presence in Vanuatu, nor to prepare annual reports of
their financial transactions or operation plans. Most of the offshore banks operated as “shell
banks” with no presence and appeared to serve as in-house treasuries for foreign conglomerates
and wealthy individuals. Following the International Banking Act, offshore banks are now
required to maintain a physical presence in Vanuatu. The banks must have an office and records
in Vanuatu, employ staff locally and have management responsible for day-to-day operations. In
addition, the RBV has issued several prudential guidelines for offshore banks—including
guidelines on customer due diligence (“know your customer”), fit-and-proper criteria for key
management positions, and external audit requirements—which should enhance transparency
and information sharing in line with those prevailing for domestic banks.
C. Contribution to the Economy
The main contribution of the offshore sector to the country is claimed to be in terms of registration
fees,5 employment, expenditure including wages and salaries, and spending on office equipment and
housekeeping. There exist some estimates on these figures, although they seem to vary substantially
across different sources (Table 2). Based on the earlier estimates, it appears that the offshore
sector contributes at least 5 percent of GDP and roughly 3–5 percent of government revenue.6,7
5

Company registration fee is US$150 for incorporation and US$300 for annual renewal.
According to Sharman (2008), the discrepancy between the IMF’s estimates and the larger figures on GDP
contribution from other sources including the RBV is due to an assumption on the indirect effects of the OFC on
the general economy. The Ministry of Finance has apparently estimated the multiplier on GDP to be 2.5. However,
it can be argued that, since OFC institutions are prohibited from dealing with citizens and domestic financial
sector, the ‘spin off’ effect on domestic economy should have been rather low, if any.
6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

49

VANUATU

The sector employs no more than 200 staff, with about one forth believed to be foreign
expatriates. This accounts for less than 2 percent of total formal sector employment in Vanuatu
(IMF, 2002). Overall, it seems that the offshore sector makes only modest contribution to
Vanuatu in terms of economic growth, employment and government revenue. A recent study by
Jayaraman and Choong (2010) finds that OFC did not contribute to Vanuatu’s economic growth,
and hence the reliance on the OFC for growth is misplaced.
The offshore financial center in Vanuatu has been directly affected by the global financial crisis
through the losses incurred on foreign investments. There seems to be a dramatic shrinkage of
OFC’s assets in the subsequent period, which mirrors a large withdrawal of deposit funding by
corporate clients. However, the implications for the domestic economy are likely to be limited
due to the small contribution of the OFC to the overall economy.8

D. Impact of Global Regulatory Initiatives on Offshore Banking Activity
Major anti-OFC/anti-money laundering events or actions that may have significantly affected
Vanuatu’s OFC banking activity include the 1998 OECD Harmful Tax Competition initiative and
the subsequent OECD’s 2002 Blacklist, the 2000 Blacklist by the Financial Action Task Force
(FATF), and the 2001 U.S. Patriot Act. The pressure became heightened after the 9/11 terrorist
attacks in the United States in 2001. These events and their subsequent guidelines for tax havens
to improve transparency and exchange of information, even though they did not create any
obligations by law, damaged Vanuatu’s reputation as an offshore center and led to a sharp
decline of the OFC in 2002 due to loss of foreign investors and increased cost as access to
international financial networks being cut off. In addition, domestic banks—especially NBV which
does not have foreign parent linkages unlike the other foreign banks operating in Vanuatu—
have experienced difficulties accessing the international banking system as many foreign
counterparties, especially U.S. banks, have decided to suspend their relationship with Vanuatu
banks, being concerned about their own reputations.

7

In comparison, OFC represents about 3 percent of GDP in Samoa, and up to 8 percent in the Cook Islands.
According to the authorities, the contribution of the offshore banks to the economy is slightly below 1 percent
of GDP.
8

50

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

VANUATU

Banking businesses in Vanuatu recently experienced another shock when faced with the
Australian Tax Office (ATO)’s crackdown on tax evasion by demanding banks in offshore
jurisdictions—including Vanuatu, Samoa, Cook Islands, Singapore, and Hong Kong—to submit
bank account information on their Australian customers for scrutiny. However, doing so would
violate the secrecy provision of Vanuatu’s International Companies Act. As a result, both
commercial and offshore banks in Vanuatu were forced to close international companies’
accounts.
Steps were taken by Vanuatu authorities, largely in a cooperative manner, to strengthen the
oversight of the offshore sector in response to mounting outside pressure. In September 2000,
Vanuatu's authorities adopted the Financial Transactions Reporting Act (FTRA), which required
offshore entities to report suspicious transactions to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). In 2003,
Vanuatu's authorities endorsed the FATF 40 recommendations on money laundering as required
by the U.S. Patriot Act.
In June 2014, the old Financial Transaction Reporting Act was repealed and replaced with the AntiMoney Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (AML/CFT) Act, which imposes additional
responsibilities and obligations on businesses and professions providing financial services in
Vanuatu. Banks are in the process of updating their AML/CTF policies to reflect the changes.9 All
banks have also registered and filed with the U.S. IRS in compliance with the Foreign Account Tax
Compliance Act (FATCA) and are hence required to report foreign offshore assets of U.S. taxpayers.
In January 2015, Vanuatu brought into force amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act and the
Counter Terrorism and Transnational and Organized Crime (CTTOC) Act.
In the latest public statement on Vanuatu in April 2015, the Asia/Pacific Group on Money
Laundering (APG) welcomed the progress. At the same time, it noted that some of the deficiencies
identified in its 2006 Mutual Evaluation Report, particularly those regarding the criminalization of
money laundering and terrorist financing, have not been adequately addressed.
E.

Concluding Remarks

Overall, it appears that the contribution of the OFC to the general economy has been limited, while
the negative reputation impact from heightened OFC criticism has done considerable damage to
Vanuatu’s financial sector. The global pressure on tax havens has not only created problems for
offshore banks, but also appears to have inflicted significant indirect costs on some domestic
banks. These costs are in terms of the reluctance of foreign investors and international banks to do
business with Vanuatu or in additional scrutiny on the clients on whose behalf the domestic banks
are transacting. Given its concentrated domestic banking system, a disruption in the external
operations of the domestic banks has been one of the key vulnerabilities of Vanuatu’s economy.
With the backdrop of increasing global pressure, the benefit of the OFC should thus be weighed
against the spillover costs on the overall economy in considering the continuation of the OFC
status.

RBV has conducted two AML/CTF onsite reviews in 2014—one on a commercial bank and one on an offshore
banks.

Exchange Arrangements
Since 1988, Vanuatu has officially maintained an adjustable peg exchange rate arrangement.
Currently, the exchange rate of the vatu is linked to a transactions-weighted (trade and tourism
receipts) basket of currencies. The weights and composition of the basket, which are not publicly
disclosed, are adjusted periodically. The Reserve Bank of Vanuatu (RBV) quotes daily buying and

selling rates for the vatu against the U.S., Australian, and New Zealand dollars; the euro; the U.K.
pound; and the Japanese yen. The rate in terms of the U.S. dollar as of May 8, 2015 was
VT 105.60 per U.S. dollar. The de facto classification is “other managed,” as the composite weights
are not disclosed and cannot be confirmed. Vanuatu has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on payments and
transfers for current international transactions.

Article IV Consultation
Vanuatu has been on a 24–month consultation cycle. The previous Article IV consultation mission
took place during April 1–10, 2013, and the consultation was concluded on June 7, 2013 (Country
Report No. 13/169).

OFC Assessments
The most recent Offshore Financial Center Module II Assessment, conducted by MFD, was
concluded in May 2006.

Technical Assistance
LEG, MCM, PFTAC, and STA have provided technical assistance on anti-money laundering, banking
supervision and regulation, reserve management, tax and fiscal accounts, tax administration and
policy, non-tax revenue, public financial management, balance of payments, and national accounts.

Resident Representative
The resident representative office for the Pacific Islands, including Vanuatu, was opened in
September 2010 in Suva, Fiji. Mr. Tubagus Feridhanusetyawan is the Resident Representative.

RELATIONS WITH THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE CENTER (PFTAC)
Economic Statistics
During 2010 and 2011 PFTAC assisted with the upgrading of government finance statistics to the
2001 GFS Manual. Support is now being provided by a regional GFS project managed by STA and
the authorities are now reporting data regularly to STA. PFTAC has provided ongoing assistance with
peer review of annual GDP estimates, helped finalize and publish for the first time GDP by
expenditure approach, and is assisting with rebasing the constant price GDP measures to a
2010 base year. Future plans include the development of a quarterly measure of GDP.
Public Financial Management
Vanuatu has regularly sent officials to PFTAC-sponsored regional training events. During FY2015,
missions were conducted to prepare authorities for a review of non-tax revenues and assist with
business processes for internal audit, including technical assistance (TA) on the use of the audit
software TeamMate. Anticipated activity during FY2016 includes coordinating a guided PEFA
self-assessment and commencing work with Ministry of Finance officials on development of a PFM
Reform Roadmap. In addition, further TA on internal audit is likely.

Macroeconomics
In the macroeconomic area, PFTAC provided assistance to the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu (RBV) in
developing their monitoring and projection framework and in training staff on how to use the
framework effectively. In addition, staff members from the Ministry of Finance and Economic
Management and the RBV participated in a regional workshop on long-term fiscal planning
conducted jointly by PFTAC and the Asian Development Bank.
Tax Administration
PFTAC and IMF Legal Department have provided technical assistance to Vanuatu that included a
mission in June 2010 setting the foundation for introducing an income tax1 and the development of
a strategic and business plan2 in 2011. More recently, two PFTAC missions were carried out. The
first3 conducted an overall review of current reform progress. The second4 assisted the Department
of Customs and Inland Revenue (DCIR) in the renewal of their strategic and business plan. A
technical assistance plan to further strengthen compliance risk management has been agreed and
will commence shortly.
DCIR has made steady revenue administration reform progress over the last few years which has
included: (a) the development of a corporate strategy and business plan; (b) a risk-based compliance
improvement strategy; (c) implementation of performance standards; and (d) the development of an
IT strategy (supported by PFTAC) followed by the implementation of an IT system that has facilitated
taxpayer compliance. The authorities recently submitted a request to PFTAC to review the current
VAT and Rent Tax Legislation which needs to be modernized.
Financial Supervision
The PFTAC Resident Technical Advisor scheduled a series of technical missions involving on-site
examination of banks and revisions of the Credit Union Act and oversight capacity building. The
Reserve Bank of Vanuatu indicated that those sectors were a priority for technical support. The
programs are expected to be delivered during FY2016.

BANK–FUND COUNTRY TEAM CONSULTATIONS
(As of May 8, 2015)
A representative of the World Bank accompanied the IMF team on the Article IV mission to Vanuatu
(April 15–28, 2015) and participated in discussions with the Government of Vanuatu. The Bank and
Fund country teams also exchanged views on the main macroeconomic issues facing Vanuatu, the
effects of Cyclone Pam, and appropriate policy responses.
The teams agreed that addressing post-cyclone needs will require a large, temporary increase in
public spending to rehabilitate the economy and provide relief to vulnerable groups. To finance this
temporary increase in spending, it is important that the authorities seek external financing at highly
concessional terms. Moreover, after undertaking necessary recovery and reconstruction activities in
the aftermath of the cyclone, the authorities should rebuild fiscal buffers over the medium term,
including by taking steps to mobilize revenues. The teams agreed that formulating an infrastructure
investment plan in line with national priorities, and ensuring discipline and allocative efficiency in
public expenditure, will also be important in responding to fiscal challenges. Infrastructure
investment should be complemented with broad reforms aimed at enhancing the business
environment, improving connectivity and promoting tourism (including in new markets). Both teams
welcomed the authorities’ commitment to inclusive growth, which will be supported by government
strategies to provide low-cost housing and improve access to electricity and financial services.
The teams broadly welcomed the RBV’s measures to support the economy and banking system in
the aftermath of the cyclone, while noting that the clarity and communication of these measures
would be important determinants of their effectiveness. To safeguard against financial stability risks,
the central bank should ensure that banks continue to follow prudent lending and risk management
standards. The teams agreed that the vatu peg should be maintained in the short to medium term,
given the importance of exchange rate stability for maintaining confidence, but that there is scope
to adjust the peg over the longer term depending on the evolution of balance-of-payments
pressures.
The teams have the following requests for information and collaboration from their counterparts:


The Fund team requests to be kept informed of progress in various projects and analytical work
undertaken by the Bank in order to use resources efficiently and avoid work overlaps.



The Bank team requests that the Fund make available to the Bank its latest macroeconomic
assessments and macroeconomic data from time to time, as inputs to the Bank’s lending and
non-lending operations.

It was agreed that further details on collaboration, as necessary, will be agreed at the technical level
as work progresses. Table 1 details the specific activities planned by the two country teams over the
next year, along with their expected deliverables.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of May 4, 2015)
Operational Strategy
Asian Development Bank’s (ADB) Country Operations Business Plan for 2015–2017 is aligned with
the government’s Priorities and Action Agenda and aims to assist the government in (i) transport—
by providing support for improved connectivity to markets and social services; (ii) urban
development—by improving access to sanitation and drainage facilities and improving urban
infrastructure with a particular focus on Port Vila; and (iii) energy—by supporting greater energy
efficiency, rural electrification, and renewable energy sources. Consistent with the government’s
strategy of fostering private sector-led growth, ADB also focuses on improving the enabling
environment for the private sector through improving access to financial services, reforming
business laws, and supporting state-owned enterprise (SOE) reform.
ADB allocation to Vanuatu of Asian Development Fund loan resources for 2015–2016, determined
based on the results of the 2014 Country Performance Assessment exercise, has been set at
US$14.46 million. In addition to this, ADB will also provide on average approximately US$500,000
per annum in technical assistance (TA) grant support. To leverage ADB’s impact and reduce
borrowing costs, cofinancing opportunities will be pursued with other development partners.
Portfolio Status
Since joining ADB in 1981, 11 loans have been provided to Vanuatu for a total amount of
US$85.55 million and 62 TA projects for US$22.45 million. More than 50 percent of the loans and
technical assistance projects were for the transport sector. ADB resumed its lending operations in
Vanuatu with the approval of two projects in the last quarter of 2011. These were for the Vanuatu
Interisland Shipping Project (US$52.12 million), cofinanced by the Government of New Zealand, and
the Port Villa Urban Development Project (US$39.10 million), cofinanced by the Government of
Australia.
There are five ongoing TA projects amounting to US$5.19 million (including cofinancing):
TA 8724-VAN: Supporting the Preparation of the National Sustainable Development Plan; TA 8336VAN: Expansion of Rural Financial Services; TA 8285-VAN: Energy Access Project; TA 7938-VAN:
Interisland Shipping Support Project; and TA 7345-VAN: Port Vila Urban Development Project.
Interisland Shipping Support Project
The aim of this project is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of interisland shipping services
through provision of an integrated package of assistance. It comprises two major components: (i)
infrastructure investments in the capital of Port Vila and five outer islands, and (ii) establishment of a
shipping support scheme to catalyze the provision of services to remote noncommercial
destinations. The project is complemented by associated TA to improve sector governance through
institutional strengthening and legal and regulatory reforms, and by project management services.
ADB is providing a loan of US$29.30 million, the Government of New Zealand a parallel grant of
US$17.25 million, and the Government of Vanuatu US$5.57 million.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

VANUATU

Port Vila Urban Development Project
The aim of this project is to improve drainage, roads, and sanitation systems in greater Port Vila
(municipality and adjacent urban and peri-urban areas in the Shefa province). The project will
implement the recommendations of the drainage and sanitation master plan prepared through a
project preparatory TA, which identified priority interventions for improved access to, and delivery of
drainage and sanitation services to the residents of Port Vila. It will support affordable, sustainable,
and effective sanitation, roads, and storm water drainage services, and contribute to climate resilient
and sustainable urban development in and around Port Vila. ADB is providing a loan of
US$5.0 million and administering the corresponding grant of US$31.0 million from the Government
of Australia. The Government of Vanuatu is providing a contribution of US$3.1 million.
Private Sector Development
Private sector development in Vanuatu is supported through the Pacific Private Sector Development
Initiative (PSDI). PSDI is a regional technical assistance facility cofinanced by the Government of
Australia, the Government of New Zealand, and ADB. PSDI works with Pacific developing member
countries to improve the enabling environment for business and support inclusive, private sector-led
economic growth. ADB’s support under PSDI focuses on (i) improving access to financial services; (ii)
business law reform; and (iii) state-owned enterprise reform.


Improving Access to Financial Services. ADB supported the secured transactions framework
reform through the drafting and passage of the Personal Property Securities Act, and the
installation, and later upgrade, of an electronic registry to record the filing of security interests. A
diagnostic was also prepared for the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu and the Vanuatu Financial
Services Commission on the current framework for the regulation and supervision of
microfinance institutions.



Business Law Reform. ADB assistance has focused on drafting a new Companies Act, a new
Insolvency Act, and a new Trustee Act. Support will continue for the implementation of these
laws and for establishing an electronic registry to include company and business name
registrations.



State-Owned Enterprise Reform. ADB supported preparation of an SOE reform policy,
approved by Cabinet in October 2013, and the subsequent drafting of SOE legislation. ADB is
also working with several SOE’s on reform and rationalization strategies, including
recommending liquidation where appropriate.

Cyclone Response
Following Tropical Cyclone Pam in March 2015, ADB’s immediate support to the government
consisted of (i) the approval of US$1.0 million grant financing from the Asia Pacific Disaster
Response Fund, and (ii) deployment of urban and infrastructure specialists to Port Vila to provide
assistance. ADB is currently consulting with the government on the provision of additional financing
to support reconstruction needs.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. In particular,
national accounts and external sector statistics need to be further improved, while the coverage of
government finance statistics could be expanded. Reporting lags could be shortened.
National accounts: While there have been improvements in methodology and the development of
additional data sources, the accuracy of the recently-released, experimental expenditure-based GDP
estimates could be further improved. Data are compiled only on an annual basis. Work is underway on
rebasing the constant price GDP estimates using 2010 as the new base year. PFTAC is providing technical
assistance in this work, and also in the improvement of the experimental expenditure-based GDP and the
development of estimates of GDP on a quarterly basis.
Price statistics: The CPI weights are based on 1998 household surveys, and only cover the two urban
centers of Port Vila and Luganville. Work on rebasing the CPI is underway, using data from the 2010
Household Income and Expenditure Survey.
Government finance statistics: Budget classification is broadly consistent with the GFSM2001. Work is
underway to migrate budget classification to GFSM2014. Government operations data are compiled for the
central government only and exclude public enterprises and operations of provincial governments and the
two municipalities, as well as grant bodies and other central government extra-budgetary units. The
operations of the budget are recorded on a cash plus invoice basis.
Monetary statistics: The Reserve Bank of Vanuatu reports monthly monetary data, including the accounts
of the monetary authorities and commercial banks (only in aggregate), and the distribution of loans by
sector in its monthly bulletin posted on its website. The RBV also publishes a quarterly report with wider
coverage of financial data including fiscal transactions and key financial soundness indicators. Information
on financial access is sparse, and could be usefully expanded to allow for better assessment of financial
inclusiveness and monetary policy transmission.
External sector statistics: The Reserve Bank of Vanuatu releases quarterly BOP data in its Quarterly
Economic Report. A special Debt Unit has been created within the Ministry of Finance for public debt
management and recording. An external sector statistics mission visited Vanuatu during February 2015 to
assist the authorities in concluding the review of quarterly balance of payments and international
investment position (IIP) statistics.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND REQUEST FOR DISBURSEMENT UNDER THE RAPID
CREDIT FACILITY AND PURCHASE UNDER THE RAPID
FINANCING INSTRUMENT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
ANALYSIS
Approved By
Hoe Ee Khor and Peter
Allum (IMF)
Satu Kahkonen (IDA)

Prepared by the Staff of the International
Monetary Fund and the International
Development Association.

This joint IMF-WB debt sustainability analysis (DSA) updates the 2013 DSA. The results
indicate that Vanuatu has shifted from low to moderate risk of debt distress. This escalation of
debt distress risk largely reflects the expected high levels of fiscal deficits induced by postcyclone reconstruction expenditures as well as the planned scaling-up of public investment,
which will elevate the level of public debt over the next few years. The increase is expected to
be manageable provided that financing terms are concessional and the surge in financing
needs is temporary. Moreover, to the extent that grants are made available to fund the
government’s recovery plan, debt accumulation will be lower. Still, the authorities should be
strategic in their choice of future infrastructure projects, reprioritize spending, and seek ways
to increase revenues to ensure debt sustainability over the medium term.

VANUATU

BACKGROUND
1.
Vanuatu is coping with the consequences of Cyclone Pam that hit the country on
March 13. Together with previously planned infrastructure investment spending, this is expected to
increase both public and external debt in relation to GDP. The damage from Cyclone Pam will have
a significant short-term effect on growth as important sectors of the economy including agriculture
and tourism have been impaired.1 GDP is expected to contract by 2 percent in 2015, in contrast to
the pre-cyclone forecast of 3.5 percent growth. The investment projects are expected to foster
growth in the future as they aim to build and modernize the country’s infrastructure. However,
concerns regarding the efficiency of investment, implementation capacity, and resulting debt
burden suggest a prudent approach.
2.
The needs for post-cyclone reconstruction are large and will require external
assistance to fill the financing gap. In line with the preliminary Post-Disaster Needs Assessment
(PDNA), the recovery and reconstruction expenditures on the part of the public sector are expected
on the scale of 20 percent of GDP spread over 3 years. Taking into account the estimated loss of
revenue and grants committed so far, the fiscal deficit is projected to reach about 12 percent of
GDP in 2015–16 and 10 percent in 2017. About 6 percent of GDP per year will be financed by
project-related concessional loans. This leaves a financing gap of about 15 percent of GDP over
2015–17. In the absence of specific commitment of grants from development partners for
reconstruction, the baseline scenario assumes that the gap will be filled with concessional loans.
3.
In 2014, the face values of external public and total external debt were low and
declined from the 2013 levels in relation to GDP. The external public debt was estimated at
11.7 percent of GDP while total external debt stood at 22.5 percent of GDP. However, the total
public and publicly guaranteed debt increased to 24 percent of GDP owing to increases in both
domestic debt by the central government and the government-guaranteed debt extended to
Government Business Enterprises (GBEs).2 Due to data limitations, external liabilities of commercial
banks are used as a proxy for private external debt.
4.
At the end of 2014 domestic debt of the central government stood at 7.8 percent of
GDP. It constituted 40 percent of total central government debt and consisted of government

1

The Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) estimated the total damage and losses to the economy caused by
Cyclone Pam at 61 percent of GDP, of which the damage to physical assets accounts for 37 percent of GDP and
production losses account for 24 percent of GDP. The highest levels of damage were to the housing stock
(32 percent of total damage), the tourism sector (20 percent), the education sector (13 percent), and the transport
sector (10 percent). As for production losses, agriculture and tourism are expected to sustain the largest levels at
33 and 26 percent of the total, respectively. Sixty nine percent of the impact falls within private enterprises and
individual ownership, while the remaining 31 percent is in the public sector.
2

Government-guaranteed GBE debt amounted to 4.6 percent of GDP at end-2014. All GBE debt is domestic,
although some of it is owed to foreign-owned banks and is denominated in foreign currency. Comprehensive
information on non-guaranteed GBE debt is not available.

bonds placed with the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu, commercial banks and other financial institutions
(primarily the Vanuatu National Provident Fund).
5.
Most of Vanuatu’s external debt is concessional. It has been contracted from
multilateral lenders (ADB, EIB, and IDA) and via bilateral agreements (China Ex-Im Bank). The
interest rates on debt are fairly low and loan maturities are long. This is reflected in a relatively high
grant element of the debt and a low debt service, even though the degree of concessionality varies
considerably by lender.

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
6.
The DSA is produced using updated data provided by the authorities and estimates
from IMF and World Bank staff. 3 The impact of Cyclone Pam on the economy is drawn from the
PDNA estimates. The DSA framework uses a discount rate of 5 percent. Total public debt includes
central government debt, publicly guaranteed GBE debt, and RCF/RFI on the books of the Reserve
Bank of Vanuatu.
7.
Major infrastructure projects are assumed to proceed as planned, although at a more
protracted implementation schedule. Despite the unexpected economic disruption caused by
the cyclone, the government intends to proceed with previously planned scaling-up of public
infrastructure investment. In line with past experience and limited implementation capacity, the
DSA assumes a somewhat lower rate of project implementation than envisaged by the
government. Public capital expenditures are estimated to peak at 12.2 percent of GDP in 2016 and
decline to a historic norm of about 2.3 percent of GDP in 2021. After the current plans are
implemented, project borrowing is assumed to fall to the historical level of about 1 percent of GDP,
setting the public debt ratio on a declining path.
Key assumptions underlying the baseline DSA are consistent with the post-cyclone scenario
for the macroeconomic framework developed during the 2015 mission (Box 1). Differences
from the 2013 DSA are mainly caused by the impact of the cyclone and the scaling-up of public
investment.

Vanuatu’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) score average for years 2011–13 is 3.44. Accordingly,
it is considered to have medium policies and institutions.


GDP growth. GDP is projected to decline by 2 percent in 2015, mainly because of the cyclone impact on
agricultural output and tourism, and then increase 5 percent in 2016 as economic recovery takes hold. Growth is
expected to average 2.7 percent during 2015–2020, with the negative impact of the cyclone offset by
reconstruction and project investment. In the long run, the economy is assumed to grow at the rate of 3
percent—below the average of the past 10 years, but above the average of the last 5 years.

Fiscal balance. The fiscal deficit is projected at 10.7 and 10.6 percent of GDP in 2015 and 2016,
respectively, reflecting recovery and reconstruction expenditures and the planned increase in infrastructure
investment. The DSA assumes a gradual improvement in the fiscal balance over time and its stabilization at nearbalance levels in the long run.

Reconstruction efforts and financing. Based on the PDNA’s public sector needs assessment, reconstruction
expenditures are assumed to be 20 percent of GDP spread over 2015–17. Part of reconstruction activities are
assumed to overlap with infrastructure projects. Any additional external borrowing needed to fill the financing
gap is assumed to be made on concessional terms at the average of the terms on the ADB, the World Bank, and
the China ExIm Bank loans.

Imports and exports. Imports of goods and services are assumed to increase to about 76 percent of GDP
in 2015 and 69 percent in 2016 driven by humanitarian needs, local supply constraints, reconstruction and
project-related materials. Exports of goods and services in 2015-16 are expected to remain lower than the 2013
levels due to a contraction in tourism and agricultural exports, but to pick up gradually thereafter. The non-interest
current account deficit is projected at about 4 percent of GDP in the long run.

FDI is assumed to increase substantially over 2015-16 due to reconstruction needs, and remain relatively
high in the medium term reflecting the crowding-in effects of the government’s infrastructure projects. It is then
projected to stabilize at around 4 percent of GDP in the long run.

Inflation. Supply constraints caused by Cyclone Pam are expected to give rise to some inflationary
pressures in 2015, but this should be partially offset by the recent decline in oil prices. Thus, the DSA assumes a
slight increase in inflation to 2 percent in 2015. Higher rate of inflation is expected during 2016-18 due to
potential economic stimulus induced by project implementation.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
8.
Under the baseline scenario, the external debt of Vanuatu remains sustainable. Public
and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) external debt increases significantly over the medium term
compared to the 2013 DSA, primarily due to an increase in borrowing for reconstruction and
project investments. As these temporary factors fall out of the picture, the debt ratio then starts
declining. The face value of external PPG peaks in 2020 at 52.5 percent of GDP. Its present value

VANUATU

(PV) remains well below the DSA threshold, peaking at 32.4 percent of GDP in 2020. Other
indicators also remain below the relevant thresholds in the baseline scenario.
9.
One threshold for public external debt is breached under standard tests, suggesting a
moderate risk rating. The PV of the debt-to-GDP ratio breaches the threshold of 40 percent
under four out of eight standardized stress tests. The most extreme scenario corresponds to a
combination shock with lower nominal GDP and export growth and lower net non-debt-creating
flows than assumed in the baseline, which would set off the PV of the debt-to-GDP ratio to peak at
49 percent in 2020. The PV of the debt-to-exports ratio and the PV of the debt-to-revenue ratio
are close to breaching their thresholds in the most extreme scenarios. On the other hand, the ratios
of debt service to exports and to revenue remain well below the respective thresholds under
standard stress tests.
10.
It is important to keep in mind the refinancing risk. The baseline does not assume that
fiscal policy will be tightened in the medium term to an extent sufficient to generate surpluses that
would fully cover planned amortization. Thus public debt is expected to be rolled over at sufficiently
concessional terms. However, in an alternative scenario with the cost of borrowing 200 basis points
higher than in the baseline, the present discounted value of external public debt service increases
noticeably relative to the measures of repayment capacity and PV of the debt-to-GDP ratio breaches
the applicable threshold. Moreover, it should be kept in mind that the terms of new borrowing might
be considerably harsher than in this alternative scenario.
11.
The historical scenario yields debt ratios that are below the projections in the
baseline case. Macroeconomic assumptions in the baseline are less favorable than the average
economic outcomes over the last ten years. This reflects the deterioration of macroeconomic
prospects brought about by Cyclone Pam and a temporary widening of deficits over the next few
years caused by infrastructure projects.

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
12.
Under the baseline scenario the PV of total public debt is projected to increase from
30.9 percent of GDP in 2015 to 43.7 percent of GDP by 2020. Although this is a significant increase
from 21.5 percent of GDP in 2014, it remains below the benchmark of 56 percent. A gradual decline
is expected over the long run to bring the public debt level lower at 25.6 percent of GDP by 2035.
About 4.6 percent of GDP in total public debt in 2015 is due to contingent liabilities pertaining to GBE
borrowing. The PV of public debt is expected to rise to 218.4 percent of budget revenue in 2020 and
then decline to 128.1 percent by 2035. Debt service on the total public debt absorbs about 18 percent
of government revenue and grants in the long run.
13.
Standard stress tests do not pose sustainability concerns, even in the most extreme shock
scenario. The PV of debt to GDP breaches the benchmark of 56 percent of GDP only in a scenario
in which the primary balance is held fixed at its 2015 level. However, that scenario is unrealistic
since the large primary deficit this year is caused by Cyclone Pam and is clearly temporary.

CONCLUSION AND STAFF ASSESSMENT
14.
Vanuatu is currently at a moderate risk of debt distress and the planned trajectory of debt
accumulation should be managed prudently. External and public debt levels are currently low.
However, they are projected to rise steeply over the next few years and peak at substantially higher
levels before starting to decline. While remaining below applicable thresholds in the baseline
scenario, debt burden indicators show some breaches under standard stress tests.
15.
To maintain public and external debt at manageable levels, the authorities will need to
continue with prudent borrowing strategy and rebuild fiscal buffers over the medium term. This
requires the authorities to be strategic in the choice of future public investment projects, ensuring
that they are in line with national priorities, implementation capacity, and available fiscal room. The
recent experience of the massive cyclone also highlights the importance of building adequate
policy buffers in good times, which help cushion unexpected shocks. To set the public debt ratio
on a downward trajectory while making room for priority social and developmental expenditures,
the authorities should mobilize new revenue sources and strengthen public finance management
processes.

AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS
16.
The authorities broadly concurred with the implications of debt sustainability
analysis. They viewed the projected debt accumulation over the next few years as temporary and
agreed with the importance of rebuilding fiscal buffers over the medium term. They noted that
seeking grant financing for the recovery plan was crucial before resorting to additional borrowing.
Investment project prioritization was also important given the projected increases in debt burden.
They welcomed staff recommendations regarding spending discipline and increasing revenues and
would appreciate technical assistance on these aspects. Overall, the authorities are committed to
preserving debt sustainability in the medium term.

Statement by Barry Sterland, Executive Director for Vanuatu,
and Chris Stewart, Advisor to the Executive Director
June 5, 2015
Vanuatu was devastated by Cyclone Pam in mid-March this year. The size of the storm – one
of the strongest ever recorded globally – combined with Vanuatu’s vulnerabilities to such
natural disasters because of its small size and remoteness, resulted in extensive damage
across the entire country. Eleven people lost their lives and the United Nations estimates that
about 188,000 people, out of a population of just over 265,000, were directly affected. The
fact that more residents were not killed or injured during the storm is testament to the
authorities’ efforts to prepare the population for such events.
The authorities strongly appreciate the many expressions of support received from the
international community in response to this situation. This includes the prompt provision of
humanitarian aid by a number of countries and organizations. The personal message of
support by the Managing Director was greatly valued, as was the IMF’s flexibility and
responsiveness in quickly adapting the planned Article IV mission to the evolving situation
in Vanuatu and working with authorities on the financing request.
The Government is determined to draw on the strength and resilience of the people of
Vanuatu, as well as the cooperation of international partners, to move from the immediate
recovery efforts to reconstruction, and ultimately return to a strong development pathway.
Vanuatu requests the Board’s approval for financing under a blended Rapid Credit
Facility/Rapid Financing Instrument (RCF/RFI) facility to strengthen its reserves during this
difficult time, and looks forward to close engagement with the IMF on policy advice and
technical assistance.
Damage Assessment and Economic Outlook
The total value of damages and losses in production are estimated at over VT48 billion
(about US$470 million), or just over 60 percent of GDP. This is an enormous relative impact.
It reflects both damages and disruption across almost all areas of the community; the storm
has destroyed people’s homes and food production, damaged vital infrastructure, disrupted
essential services and greatly impacted people’s livelihoods through its effects on major
sectors (including tourism and agriculture). As such, the disaster has set back efforts to
develop the economy.
2015 will be a particularly difficult year. The economy is now forecast to contract this year,
potentially by up to 2 percent, in contrast to the reasonably robust expansion that had been
anticipated prior to this disaster. The trade deficit is expected to increase sharply during 2015
given the severe disruption caused to Vanuatu’s main exports – tourism and agriculture – and
the expected jump in imports in response to the recovery and reconstruction needs. This will

2
place reserves under pressure, even though they were maintained at prudent levels prior to
the cyclone. A fiscal deficit will also arise as revenues decline and expenditures climb as the
authorities provide relief to vulnerable groups in the short-term, support reconstruction
efforts, and continue to address various infrastructure needs constraining development.
Request for Assistance
In order to strengthen reserve buffers in the wake of the cyclone, Vanuatu requests
SDR17 million under a blended RCF/RFI facility which is intended for precautionary
purposes. This will help to address the urgent balance-of-payments needs and thus mitigate
the risk of economic disruption. The IMF’s involvement is also expected to help catalyse
further donor assistance.
Furthermore, in mobilizing additional resources, the authorities intend to remain prudent and
avoid excessive debt accumulation. Authorities will seek external grants as much as possible
before resorting to concessional loans or other borrowing. Authorities will also continue to
hold discussions with their key development partners on additional financial support given
the criticality of additional support and cooperation.
Fiscal policy
The authorities’ track record of prudent fiscal management provided them with solid buffers
preceding this crisis. Such an approach is particularly important given Vanuatu’s high
exposure to natural disasters. Once the immediate priority of supporting the recovery has
been addressed, the authorities are committed to rebuilding these buffers. In particular, once
the immediate needs have been addressed, the authorities intend to put public debt to GDP on
a declining path and continue to follow their long-running strategy of only borrowing to
invest in infrastructure projects. The authorities intend to achieve a stronger fiscal position in
the medium term through a number of actions detailed in their Letter of Intent. These include
strengthening expenditure discipline, reforming Government Business Enterprises, and
improving public debt management. The authorities will consider infrastructure priorities and
potentially consolidate the selection of projects of national importance, as well as explore
other sources of revenue, such as the potential introduction of an income tax in the medium
term.
To ensure that the recovery efforts are coherent and well prioritized, the Government is
developing its ‘National Recovery and Economic Strengthening Program’ in close
consultation with Vanuatu’s largest donors. This plan highlights the importance of
cooperation between these partners in identifying Vanuatu’s recovery needs, monitoring
progress and adjusting or cancelling projects where necessary. Indeed, even before the
cyclone, the Government had delayed or downsized a number of transport projects to move
resources to other priority areas. Such a consultative approach will help ensure that

3
immediate recovery needs are addressed, minimize sequencing problems and make sure that
the investment plans are consistent with the authorities’ already published national
development aspirations. The plan also notes the complementarities between a number of the
pre-cyclone infrastructure spending plans and post-cyclone recovery requirements.
Monetary Policy and the Financial Sector
The authorities are committed to operating monetary policy to support the economy while
maintaining economic and financial stability. In the immediate aftermath of the storm, the
Reserve Bank of Vanuatu (RBV) acted swiftly to support the economy and the financial
system through lowering the policy rate, reducing the statutory reserve deposit requirement
and introducing a number of facilities to ensure essential credit continued to flow. The
Reserve Bank of Vanuatu is conscious of the need to monitor how the economy and financial
system respond to these actions and broader developments in coming months, and stands
ready to implement additional measures or adjust actions already taken as warranted. In a
similar manner, in addition to implementing a range of measures to improve the banking
system’s prudential standing before the cyclone, the RBV will continue to make sure that
banks follow prudential norms and will step up its reviews of banks’ risk management. In
this regard, they welcome the technical assistance planned from the IMF’s Pacific Financial
Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC).
The authorities note that the pegged exchange rate has provided the economy with a useful
nominal anchor and intend to maintain this peg to preserve private sector confidence. The
blended RCF/RFI will provide additional resources to help ensure that reserves do not fall
below prudent levels, despite their elevated pre-cyclone levels, given the substantial increase
in the current account deficit expected in the short term. The authorities also acknowledge
the staff’s suggestion that it might be appropriate to re-evaluate the peg in the medium term.
Structural Reforms
The authorities are continuing to progress structural reforms to promote inclusive growth,
recognising that sustained growth is key to their development ambitions. First, the
forthcoming gazetting of new company laws should aid business incorporation, addressing
one of the areas where Vanuatu lags other regional peers. Second, planned land reforms,
should result in a more efficient and equitable system based on clearer and more predictable
processes. Third, the authorities will further strengthen Vanuatu’s Anti-Money Laundering
and Counter-Terrorism Financing regime, are cooperating with the Global Forum on
Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes, and are open to considering
the costs and benefits of hosting an offshore financial sector. Fourth, the authorities remain
committed to implementing their National Financial Inclusion Strategy to bring financial
services to more remote areas of the country. More generally, the authorities’ focus on
infrastructure investment will help address some of the bottlenecks hindering activity and,

4
through projects such as the recently completed submarine cable, provide new development
opportunities to a wider range of the population.
International Response
The authorities are thankful for the generous initial pledges by donors announced in recent
weeks. It is critical that international partners consider additional grant and concessional
assistance in light of the soon-to-be-finalized recovery plan to assist Vanuatu respond to this
devastation, and lay solid macroeconomic foundations for growth.
The authorities would like to reiterate their thanks to the IMF Staff for their productive
engagement on policy and the speed and flexibility of their response. Within four weeks of
the cyclone a mission was on the ground and within three months financial assistance is
being considered by the Board. The Managing Director indicated that the IMF stood ready to
assist the country in an unbureaucratic manner and this has been demonstrated by both HQ
and PFTAC staff. The authorities have found the discussions exceptionally productive, are
grateful for the large amount of insightful analysis provided by the staff team, and will
closely consider all aspects of the IMF’s policy advice. Authorities welcome the upcoming
Safeguards Assessment as a valuable opportunity to further examine the governance and
control framework of the RBV. The authorities are particularly appreciative of the offer of
moving Vanuatu to a 12-month Article IV timetable as well as specific offers of technical
assistance. This will assist Vanuatu in the critical transitions that it must manage in the near
term, and assist it in laying the foundation for a durable recovery.
Finally, our Authorities very much look forward to the Board’s feedback, and request its
positive consideration of the proposed RCF/RFI request. This will assist the Government in
the necessary task of catalysing further resources for reconstruction from its development
partners.
