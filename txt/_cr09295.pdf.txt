AUSTRIA
Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2009 Consultation with Austria
Approved by Juha Kähkönen and Martin Mühleisen
August 4, 2009
Executive Summary
Focus. The report is focused on the impact of the financial crisis on the Austrian economy and financial
sector, the authorities’ policy responses, and macro-financial linkages and spillovers.
Background. After a string of strong years, Austria’s open economy started to slow down in 2008. As
a result of this and a generous stimulus package, consisting mostly of lasting tax cuts, deficits and debt
are expected to rise and remain high in the medium term. The Austrian banking system is strongly
exposed to Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe (CESE). The authorities have been implementing
a large banking stabilization package, including public capital injections and guarantees.
Outlook. The economy is projected to shrink considerably in 2009, with a recovery expected to start in
2010. Exports and investment declined strongly already, and more recently consumption has been
affected as well. Inflation is expected to remain low this year, with a slight increase in 2010. The
uncertainties surrounding the outlook are considerable.
Key policy issues. The two main challenges for the authorities looking forward are:


To ensure financial stability during a period of shocks to the financial sector. Based on recent
stress tests—which showed that systemic banks would not breach minimum capital
requirements under shocks—the authorities do not see a need for further capital injections at
this stage. They are, however, closely monitoring conditions in the financial sector. The staff
report emphasizes that ratios well above regulatory minima are needed to support the markets’
confidence in the banks. It recommends that the authorities use the tests as input for discussions
with the banks about strengthening capital buffers, when needed. The banks’ strategy of
maintaining their presence in CESE will have positive spillovers for regional economic activity
and stability, provided the risks are well-managed. This will require close collaboration
between home and host authorities and adequate contingency planning. The authorities are
committed to this.



To support the economy through responsible fiscal policy. The approved stimulus, while
supporting the economy in the short run, is neither targeted nor temporary, and may therefore
become a threat to fiscal sustainability. The report recommends the development of a credible
exit plan, aimed at structural fiscal consolidation over the medium term, to be prepared this year
and implemented once the economy stabilizes. The focus should be on identifying expenditure
saving measures. The authorities agreed with the need for consolidation, but warned against a
premature exit from the stimulus.

However, the economy is now feeling the full impact of the global crisis. The
economy’s openness, both in trade and financial relations, means that it cannot be insulated
from foreign shocks. The transmission runs through two main channels: trade—in particular
the negative impact on exports of the worsened outlook for the European region—and
financial flows—including the impact of the slowdown in CESE on the returns on foreign
investments of the Austrian banks and corporates. These real and financial shocks associated
with the crisis have a major adverse impact on the outlook for the Austrian economy.
3.
Maintaining financial stability will be key to Austria’s economic future. The
financial sector has been expanding rapidly, mostly outside Austria. This has brought
substantial benefits, but also increased risks and vulnerabilities. The latter have now become
apparent as large exposures to countries in CESE have become a source of concern.
Maintaining financial stability will be essential for ensuring macroeconomic stability, fiscal
sustainability, and a return to growth, while also having important spillovers to regional
financial stability.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
4.
The current downturn is expected to be the deepest in its postwar history
(Table 1, Figure 1). The economy started shrinking in the fourth quarter of 2008 as the global
financial crisis intensified and world trade fell sharply. This process accelerated in the first
quarter of 2009, with exports of goods declining by roughly a quarter compared with 2008.
Consumption also declined slightly, but has held up relatively well so far (Figure 2)—due to
substantial wage increases agreed to last year when inflation was high, and tax cuts—but as
unemployment rises, household spending will lose momentum. Staff expects GDP to decline
by 4 percent in 2009 and to recover in the course of 2010—depending on global

developments. The authorities broadly agreed with this outlook and noted that the sharp
downward revision of earlier projections reflects an unprecedented collapse in demand for
exports and investment.
5.
Inflation is expected to remain subdued. As elsewhere in the euro area, inflation is
projected to decline further in 2009, to about ½ percent for the year. However, it is expected
to pick up again in 2010, and deflationary risks are considered limited. Core inflation has
been more stable than headline (Figure 3) and is expected to remain above 1 percent in the
period ahead. The authorities noted that Austria could temporarily experience some negative
inflation during the second half of 2009, depending on developments in energy and
commodity prices.
6.
The brunt of the crisis on unemployment is still to be felt. Austria traditionally
benefits from a low unemployment rate compared with the euro area. However, the absolute
increase in registered unemployment (especially in manufacturing) is the largest in decades,
due to the severity of the economic decline and the relatively flexible labor market.
Unemployment is widely expected to increase to above 5 percent in 2009 and to continue
rising into 2011 (Table 2). The authorities and social partners emphasized that subsidized
short-term work schemes were an important instrument to preserve human capital during an
economic downturn.
7.
The external position is expected to weaken somewhat, but to remain sound
(Table 3). Market shares and the real effective exchange rate have been relatively stable over
the past few years (Figure 4). Applying the CGER methodology to Austria also suggests that
there are no major competitiveness issues. 2 In 2009, imports—driven by private
consumption—are expected to shrink by less than exports. This will have a negative impact
on the current account surplus, which is nevertheless expected to remain positive. It was
expected that unit labor costs will increase in 2009, due to relatively high wage increases and
the use of short-term work schemes. However, there was no indication that these would have
a permanent impact on Austria’s competitiveness and authorities and social partners were
expecting moderate wage increases in the future.
8.
The uncertainties surrounding the outlook are considerable. The extent of
economic decline hinges critically on developments in trading partner countries. An
additional uncertainty is the impact of the crisis on Austria’s financial sector. Due to its large
exposure to Eastern Europe, it would be hit hard by a further economic decline in the region,
which could translate into deteriorating credit quality, declining profitability, and the
possibility of a credit crunch. The authorities acknowledged these factors, but saw the risks
as overall balanced, including in Eastern Europe.

2

The macro balance and the equilibrium real exchange rate approach indicate an overvaluation of 1 and
7 percent, respectively, while the external sustainability approach suggests a 4 percent undervaluation.

vulnerable to regional shocks. 3
The financial system’s rapid expansion into European emerging markets has brought
significant benefits but also increased vulnerabilities (see also section V). The CESE
exposures of Austrian banks are large relative to the domestic economy (roughly 70 percent
of GDP) and bank capital (350 percent), with profits from the CESE operations accounting
for 30-40 percent of total profits in 2005-07. These exposures are also large in relation to the
size of the economies of the host countries. About half of lending is denominated in foreign
exchange. The authorities emphasized that for the Austrian banking system as a whole, the
portfolios are relatively well-diversified, and that three-quarters of all assets in CESE
represent claims on EU member countries.

12.
Household balance sheets are in a relatively good shape (Figure 7). The lack of a
housing boom-bust cycle contributed to lower cumulative credit growth in recent years than
in some other European countries. This helped prevent an unsustainable rise in debt-financed
private consumption. Household debt stood at 90 percent of disposable income at end-2008,
compared with 100 percent in the euro area. There was agreement that relatively low levels
of debt are enabling Austria to avoid the sharp household deleveraging that has occurred
elsewhere with its negative impact on consumption and growth.
13.
The drop in stock markets will have an impact on savings. The erosion of wealth
in financial assets as well as precautionary motives are expected to induce an increase in the
savings rate. 4 To some extent this impact is cushioned by the guarantees that insurance
companies offer, including on retirement savings. However, a sizeable share of savings is
held in mutual funds, where investment losses are passed on to investors. Private pension
funds have been hit hard by the crisis and further reductions in benefits or increased
contributions will be hard to avoid, although this sector is relatively small.

4

Fenz and Fessler (2008) find that simulations based on macro data indicate that a decrease in wealth has a
relatively minor effect on private consumption and economic growth in Austria. However, the authors note that
in this crisis confidence effects could be stronger than estimated in their study (“Wealth Effects on Consumption
in Austria,” Monetary Policy & The Economy Q4/08, Österreichische Nationalbank).

The corporate sector did not enter
the crisis highly indebted. While corporate
debt to GDP increased by 8 percentage
points between 2007Q1 and 2008Q4, the
level is much lower than the euro area
average. Since the onset of the crisis,
Austrian enterprises have found it more
difficult to finance themselves through
profits or new equity and have resorted to
loans. Insolvencies increased in 2008, but
surveys show that this reflects a drop in
demand for output more than a lack of
financing.

Although credit conditions are tightening, there is little evidence of a credit
crunch so far (Figure 8). Credit growth to households has fallen substantially (to 1 percent
in April 2009), but bank lending surveys indicate that this trend is mostly associated with
demand factors. In particular, demand for consumer loans has dropped sharply. For the
corporate sector, credit standards have been tightened since the third quarter of 2007. While
the year-on-year growth rate of loans to nonfinancial enterprises slowed somewhat to
6 percent in April 2009, it is not far from earlier averages. The authorities are closely
monitoring credit conditions.
Financial sector developments also have a bearing on fiscal outcomes, through
direct and indirect channels. The direct contribution of the financial sector to tax revenues
has been limited, as financial institutions have benefited from relatively generous carryforward rules for past losses. Financial sector support, however, has substantially worsened
public finances. Under current projections, capital injections under the financial sector
support program may account for some 4½ percent of GDP in general government debt by
2010. In addition, concerns about the Austrian financial sector have spilled into sovereign
bond and CDS markets.

IV. FISCAL POLICY
A. Fiscal Developments and Outlook
17.
The fiscal stance was broadly neutral in 2008
despite some stimulus measures. In September 2008, the
authorities passed a stimulus package that envisaged a fiscal
impulse of 0.3 percent of GDP in 2008 and additional
stimulus in 2009-10. For 2008, the package increased family
and pension benefits and reduced unemployment insurance
contributions. More than offsetting this, however, were
earnings-related tax receipts that increased on the back of
strong labor market performance. As a result, the general
government balance improved by some 0.2 percentage points
of GDP to -0.5 percent of GDP (Table 4, Figure 9). This
deficit, combined with the issuance of bonds to pre-fund
financial sector support of almost 3 percent of GDP, raised
the stock of debt to 62.6 percent of GDP at end-2008.
18.
The 2009/10 budget includes a stimulus package
of 1.5 percent of GDP in 2009 and an additional
0.4 percent of GDP in 2010. In contrast to other
packages, the Austrian package consists mostly of personal
income tax (PIT) cuts (Box 1). Since only the top half of
income earners is subject to PIT, the multipliers of the
package will be relatively low. Public investment, which
has the highest multipliers if rapidly implemented,
represents less than 5 percent of the package. As part of
the package, Parliament recently approved a specific
stimulus (of 0.2 percent of GDP) aimed at supporting
employment through the extension of short-term labor
benefits and old-age part-time work benefits.
19.
The stimulus, the unrestricted operation of
automatic stabilizers, and support to a distressed
bank will widen the deficit to 4.2 percent of GDP in
2009 and 5.6 percent of GDP by 2010. Overall,
automatic stabilizers are similar to the euro area
average. In particular, the strong progression in PIT
rates by international comparison generates large
stabilizers. Initial unemployment benefits are less
generous than elsewhere in the OECD, but their

fall steeply after 12-24 months and are replaced by lower social assistance, the Austrian net

Box 1. Austrian Fiscal Stimulus Measures in 2008-09
Austria passed a series of fiscal stimulus packages:
 September 2008: increase in pension and family benefits, removal of university fees, and a cut in VAT on
pharmaceuticals.
 Stimulus package for 2008: support for SMEs, investment in broadband access, and increase in housing
subsidies.
 Stimulus package for 2009: tax cuts and investment incentives for 2009, the latter mainly through
advantageous depreciation rules.
More than half of the total stimulus for 2009 is accounted for by the tax reform that had originally been
planned for 2010 and was brought forward. The tax reform reduces the personal income tax (PIT) in the two
middle tax brackets by 0.3 and 1.8 percentage points, and raises the tax-exempt minimum by 10 percent and the
income threshold for the highest income bracket by 15 percent. In addition, a tax exemption per child was
introduced and the exemption for profits was raised. Tax deductibility of church and charitable contributions
was increased and a deduction for child care expenditures introduced.
Additional stimulus will be provided by the decision of state-owned railway and highway companies to
bring forward infrastructure investment. These plans amount to about 0.3 percent of GDP.

B. Fiscal Sustainability
20.
The underlying fiscal position has deteriorated significantly as a result of recent
policy measures. Absent consolidation measures, current policies put fiscal sustainability at
risk. Under current policies, deficits are projected to be above the Maastricht reference value
of 3 percent of GDP throughout the forecast

21.
With debt projected to rise above 80 percent of GDP by 2012, the authorities
and the mission agreed that fiscal consolidation was the key challenge once the economy
recovers. The mission recommended that—to put debt again on a downward path—specific
consolidation measures be agreed later this year, to be implemented when the economic
recovery begins. While the authorities agreed with the need for consolidation, they warned
against a premature exit from the stimulus. They noted that consolidation measures should be
expenditure based. In the administration of lower-level governments and in the health and
education sectors, there remains substantial potential for efficiency gains without curtailing
service quality. A Working Group on Fiscal Consolidation has been created to identify
specific measures for expenditure consolidation. Members of the working group described
10 areas chosen for further study, including education, health, pensions, subsidies, the
revenue sharing arrangement, and improvements in administrative efficiency. In education,
the working group has completed its recommendations and submitted them to the
government. With regard to improvements in administrative efficiency, recommendations
were expected to be finalized soon.

22.
here is room to raise certain nondistortionary taxes, but these are unlikely to
generate significant revenue increases. Most taxes are above or at OECD and EU averages.
The authorities noted that a further increase in labor taxation would run counter to the longterm need to reduce the tax burden on labor. Fuel taxes, in contrast, are low in comparison
with neighboring countries, encouraging cross-border arbitrage. However, even assuming no
behavioral response, the mission estimates that additional revenues from raising taxes to
comparable levels are likely to be less than ¼ percent of GDP. Increased property taxes
could provide an additional source of income for municipalities and, hence, encourage more
accountability compared with the current system of fiscal federalism. Additional revenues
may amount to some ½ percent of GDP.

C. Structural Fiscal Issues
23.
The mission welcomed the long-awaited introduction of a medium-term
budgeting framework (MTBF), but noted that the expenditure ceilings could have been
more ambitious. The budget for 2009/10 includes binding rolling four-year expenditure
ceilings—currently to 2013—for five broad categories of expenditure. 6 Within each broad
category, indicative ceilings are set but expenditures are fungible. To allow full operation of
automatic stabilizers, the nondiscretionary element of the expenditure ceilings, including
pension and unemployment benefits, is automatically modified according to objective
criteria. The discretionary element of the expenditure ceilings can only be modified by
parliament. The authorities highlighted the removal of disincentives for cost savings by
allowing budget entities to save unused funds at the end of the year. The mission cautioned,
however, that the medium-term expenditure ceilings have to be sufficiently ambitious for
them to be an effective tool for ensuring fiscal sustainability. The authorities agreed that the
currently envisaged expenditure path does not accomplish this goal and will be revised once
the economic recovery is underway. To ensure that expenditure ceilings are consistent with
long-term sustainability, the mission suggested that the authorities explicitly take into
account long-term aging cost estimates.

22
24.
Important supporting elements of the medium-term budgeting framework have
been postponed until 2013. In 2006, the authorities embarked on an administrative reform
that encompasses a wide range of structural reforms, many of them reaching into the
responsibilities of subnational governments. The authorities confirmed their commitment to
implementing these reforms. In both the education and health system, Austria ranks below
average in efficiency. At the level of the federal government, loopholes remain in the
disability insurance system that de facto assumes some of the functions of the pension and
unemployment insurance systems. An expenditure review in these areas could benefit from
benchmarking against comparator countries, along the lines of the indicators published in the
European Commission’s Catalogue of Quality of Public Finance Indicators (2008). Similar
benchmarking will also be helpful in preparation for the move to performance-based
budgeting, which was postponed to 2013 as was the introduction of a more comprehensive
accounting framework.
25.
A simplified federal equalization law for 2008-13 reduces some inefficiencies in
the fiscal federalism system. In particular, it converts some earmarked federal transfers into
general transfers. The mission acknowledged that, to the extent that earlier earmarking had
been enforced, this could enhance expenditure efficiency at the local and state government
level. Room for additional efficiency gains remains, however, since take-up of incentives for
municipalities to cooperate has been low. The federal equalization law is complemented by
an internal stability pact that limits deficits for each level of government. Enforcement of
these deficit limits, however, has not yet been tested because the trigger clause for sanctions
was based on general government balances, which had outperformed expectations recently.
In the authorities’ views, the pact nevertheless provided a useful framework for discussion
and a tool for raising awareness of the need for fiscal discipline.

23
V. FINANCIAL SECTOR
26.
The key challenges in the financial sector stem from risks related to the
economic downturn—both in Austria and CESE—and the financial crisis. While
Austrian banks have access to a solid base of domestic deposits and have had relatively little
exposure to U.S.-based structured securities, vulnerabilities arise from:


Their significant involvement in CESE (Figure 10), which has exposed them to economic
downturn in the region, directly through their subsidiaries and through the impact on
major Austrian corporate customers who are exposed to the region. A particular risk
arises from the extent of foreign currency loans made by their subsidiaries in CESE
countries. This exposes them to indirect credit risk through the foreign exchange
exposure taken on by unhedged borrowers.



Credit risk on loan portfolios in Austria at a time of economic downturn, including rising
unemployment. A particular risk arises from Austrian borrowers’ extensive use of
financial vehicles (“Tilgungsträger”) for the repayment of bullet loans. As these relied on
growth in underlying investments to provide the funds for repayment, funding gaps arose
when markets fell and these could lead to impairments of the related loans. Foreign
currency loans (in SFR) have also been made to Austrian customers, although their share
of total loans is lower than in CESE countries (Figure 11).



The need to secure medium-term funding in markets that remain challenging for banks.
Government guarantees are currently facilitating the rollover of funding, but new
guarantees are scheduled to be withdrawn by the end of the year.
A. The Authorities’ Response to the Crisis

27.
The events of Fall 2008 had a large impact. Against a background of rising
concerns over exposure to CESE countries, the banks suffered sudden losses from significant
exposures to Lehman and the Icelandic banks. Their participation in the European syndicated
loan markets led to credit losses as well as funding challenges. The widespread lack of
confidence that accompanied the market turmoil at that time caused interbank markets to dry
up and liquidity positions to come under pressure. Share prices dropped and CDS spreads
increased, while spreads on Austrian government paper were negatively affected as well
(Figure 12).
28.
The authorities moved swiftly to deal with the crisis. The Financial Market
Authority (FMA) and the Austrian National Bank (ANB) worked together on a rapid
response to the significant liquidity shortages facing banks. One small bank was subject to
intervention and sold to its creditors, while another, of systemic importance in its market
niche, was nationalized. Parliament enacted an extensive support package (Box 2) that
included funding for state capital injections and a state guarantee scheme for new debt issues,

available to both banks and insurance companies. A clearing bank supported by a public
guarantee was set up to reduce liquidity pressures in the interbank markets. Finally, to
address depositors’ concerns, and in response to similar actions taken by other EU members,
the authorities introduced a blanket deposit guarantee. The approach has been
comprehensive, although implementation with regard to the capital injections has been drawn
out.
Box 2. Financial Sector Support Measures
In October 2008, in response to tensions in financial markets, the authorities took several measures
to support the banking sector. The package amounted to €100 billion in total or about 35 percent of
GDP and contained the following support measures:
Capital injections, asset guarantees. The Financial Market Stability Act allows the Ministry of Finance
to recapitalize banks and insurance companies. The measures

institutions receiving such support. If capital injections and
asset guarantees in excess of the limit of €15 billion were needed, funds to support the interbank market
(see below) could be used.
Interbank market. Under the Interbank Market Support Act, the Ministry of Finance can provide
guarantees for bonds issued by banks and for liabilities of and losses incurred by the Oesterreichische
Clearingbank AG (OeCAG). Originally, €75 billion were pledged for this purpose of which €4 billion
are reserved for the OeCAG. As of mid-June, €17 billion were outstanding in government guaranteed
bank bond issues (used by four different banks) and €2.4 billion guarantees through the clearing bank.
Out of this €75 billion, €10 billion have been redesignated to secure funding of nonbank corporations
(see below).
Deposit insurance. Deposits of natural persons are guaranteed without limit until end-2009 and
thereafter up to €100,000. The government pledged an amount of €10 billion to back this guarantee.
Funding of non-financial corporates. Parliament has recently passed a law that allows the government
to guarantee debt of nonfinancial corporations up to a combined volume of €10 billion. Eligible
companies had to be profitable before the summer of 2008, have more than 250 employees, and a
turnover of more than €50 million.

28
29.
Despite the wide range of intervention measures, market sentiment has been
volatile. The government support package enabled the banks to maintain a relatively strong
capitalization—with Tier 1 capital ratios averaging 9 percent for the system at end-December
(Table 5)—while meeting refinancing needs. Such support also allowed issuer credit ratings
to be maintained. In addition, their relatively strong position ahead of the crisis enabled the
three biggest banks to remain profitable despite the market turmoil. However, in early Spring
2009, following the depreciation of some currencies in CESE, uncertainties about the
economic outlook and the resilience of the Austrian banks increased, the profit outlook was
downgraded by the rating agencies (Table 6), and CDS spreads rose to unprecedented levels.
30.
Banks are now strengthening their financial position in response to the
deteriorating economic outlook. While CDS spreads have recently subsided and liquidity
has returned to interbank markets, banks are strengthening their capital and reducing credit
risk. Internal lending policies have been tightened, foreign currency loans within Austria and
non-euro foreign currency loans outside Austria curtailed and, where possible, the term of
lending portfolios has been shortened. Banks are also seeking to broaden their deposit bases
to reduce dependence on interbank funding. In addition, they are reviewing their asset
portfolios to identify the collateral that would qualify in refinancing operations with the
ECB.
31.
The authorities were clear that further resources will be committed if necessary.
Banks and authorities were reluctant to contemplate a further round of capital support from
the government at this stage. However, if such support is required, and not (fully) available
from private sources, it will be made available by the government, including if necessary
from that part of the support package earmarked for guaranteed bank bond issuance.
B. CESE Exposures—Risks and Strategy
32.
Stress tests carried out by the ANB suggest that major banks could withstand a
relatively severe CESE recession without breaching minimum capital requirements.
Staff welcomed the ANB’s use of stress tests to identify banks’ CESE vulnerabilities and
noted that the methodology is in line with international best practice. The tests suggest that
the capital ratios of all systemic banks would remain above minimum regulatory
requirements under a range of adverse shocks (Box 3). The authorities concluded that for
now no further capital injections into the banking system were needed, although they are
closely monitoring conditions in the banking sector. Staff noted that while the assumptions
underlying the stress tests (the “Deep CESE Recession” scenario) appear to be broadly
within the range of those used by analysts, more adverse outcomes cannot be ruled out.
Moreover, because of uncertainty over the impact of the recession on future levels of banks’
non-performing loans, Tier 1 ratios well above the regulatory minimum may still be needed
to support private investors’ confidence in banks. The possibility of tail risks materializing
underlines the need for effective contingency planning, to which the authorities are
committed.

29
Box 3. The ANB’s Stress Tests
The stress tests recently conducted by the ANB included macro stress tests for credit risk, liquidity stress
tests, and sensitivity analysis for market risk (interest rate, equity, foreign exchange, and volatility risk).
In view of the importance of the Austrian banks’ exposures to Eastern Europe and the CIS, the macro stress
tests for credit risk focused on the “Deep CESE Recession” scenario. The stress test results were published on
the ANB’s website (http://www.oenb.at) on July 6, 2009.

The key features of the ANB’s top-down “Deep CESE Recession” stress test are as follows:
 the Austrian banks’ exposures include both direct cross-border lending and indirect exposures via foreign
subsidiaries (on and off-balance sheet positions), but not interbank loans or lending to sovereigns;
 it covers the period from end-2008 to end-2010;
 for CESE countries, the April, 2009 WEO growth projections are taken as a baseline and further scaled
down by 2 percentage points in 2009 and by 3.5 points in 2010;
 in addition, 20-30 percent depreciation is assumed for all countries with floating exchange rates and no
change for countries with fixed exchange rate regimes;
 the impact on Austria is assessed using the ANB’s Austrian Quarterly Model (AQM);
 further reduction of the banks’ operating income before risk and an increase in risk-weighted assets due
to deterioration of loan portfolios are taken into account as well.
Based on these assumptions, the NPL ratios reach close to 10 percent in the domestic market and almost
20 percent in the CESE region over the two year horizon.
The stress test results suggest that Austrian banks have sufficient buffers to withstand a fairly deep recession
in the CESE region. If economic conditions in the region were to deteriorate along the lines of the “Deep
CESE Recession” scenario, the top six banks’ Tier 1 ratios would weaken substantially, but remain above the
4 percent regulatory minimum. It should be noted that the banks’ starting Tier 1 ratios include €8.4 billion of
preferred shares from the Austrian bank rescue package and €0.7 billion from third parties, although part of
these capital infusions are still under negotiation. Further capital injections using the remainder of the
€15 billion bank support package would help to keep the average Tier 1 ratio of the top six banks from falling
below 6 percent in a stress scenario.

30
33.
Banks recognize the risks associated with foreign currency lending in CESE, but
see limited scope for a significant reduction within a short time frame. Most banks have
stopped new lending in currencies other than the euro, and have began to restructure
outstanding non-euro currency loans by extending maturities and, in some cases, converting
into local currencies. However, euro-denominated (or euro-linked) lending remains
pervasive, not least because a large proportion of the banks’ deposits in CESE are
denominated in or indexed to euros. Banks believe that any reduction in the outstanding
stock of euro loans can be made only gradually.
34.
While banks are committed to supporting their operations in Eastern Europe,
changes in strategy are to be expected. Banks are clearly concentrating more on risk
management, and some have stated that they plan to focus on countries and products in
which they have a sizeable market share. Major banks pointed to the good prospects for a
resumption of growth in financial services in many CESE markets. Engagement in the region
should continue to serve both the interests of the banks themselves and those of host
economies. However, banks noted that this will need to be supported by a stronger control of
risks, while the authorities are committed to further enhancement of the regulatory and
supervisory approach, with a stronger macroprudential focus. This will result in lower credit
growth rates than seen in the past.
35.
Banks and authorities are supporting international initiatives to address the
impact of the crisis on CESE countries. Banks’ public statements of commitment to their
subsidiaries through the downturn, and the endorsement of this approach by the authorities,
have helped support confidence within Austria as well as in the region generally. The
mission welcomed Austrian engagement in the European Bank Coordination Initiative
(“Vienna Initiative”), which is helping to address cross-border banking issues in Eastern
Europe (Box 4).
Box 4. European Bank Coordination Initiative (“Vienna Initiative”)
Western European banks play a key role in CESE countries and have a long-term interest in the region.
Continued private bank involvement is critical for balance of payments sustainability, which requires
coordination to: (i) keep banks well capitalized and (ii) ensure rollover of loans.
The European Bank Coordination Initiative (EBCI) facilitates information exchange and coordination
and includes home and host country authorities and banks. For program countries, the EBCI also
involves country-related bank coordination under the leadership of the IMF and the EC—with support
from other IFIs. Four country coordination rounds have taken place so far (Serbia, Romania, Hungary,
and Bosnia and Herzegovina) with foreign banks involved signing commitment letters to support their
subsidiaries in the individual countries, and also committing in some cases to forward looking
recapitalization, as necessary, based on agreed stress tests.
In parallel, under a “Joint IFI action plan”, the EBRD, EIB, and World Bank Group are directly lending
to commercial banks, aimed at maintaining exposure in the CESE region.
Looking ahead, coordination efforts are scheduled to be extended to more countries, with a focus on
specific commitments.

31
C. Insurance and Pensions
36.
The insurance sector has been affected by falling asset markets but has not
experienced liquidity pressures or major adverse changes in policyholder behavior.
Some insurers were exposed to Icelandic banks and asset-backed securities. The failure of
Lehman had an unexpected impact on guarantees attached to certain products. However, the
main crisis impact has been falling asset values—especially corporate bonds, as equity
investment is low (averaging 4.3 percent at the end of 2008). While many life policies have
guarantees, the guaranteed return is relatively low. Because of the limited development to
date of private pensions, annuities business is low. Insurers have not suffered liquidity
pressures, and lapses (policyholders cashing in policies early) remain low, although new
business has been falling in life insurance. Experience has been similar overall in CESE
countries, where the larger insurers have been developing significant market presence.
37.
While government support is available to insurance, the focus now is on
enhanced supervision. The authorities noted that for precautionary reasons, they had made
state support available to insurers as they had to banks, but neither capital nor guarantees had
been needed. In addition, Insurance Supervision Act requirements related to the accounting
recognition of investment losses were relaxed somewhat, mostly on a temporary basis. The
authorities are now monitoring unrecognized losses in case of permanent impairment, as well
as experience in CESE countries, where economic downturn may have increasingly varied
impacts on asset values and policyholder behavior across markets. In common with the
banks, Austrian insurers remain committed to a strategy of development in the CESE region.
The supervisors are also stepping up their monitoring of complex new products.
38.
The authorities are addressing crisis lessons for the private pension system. Falls
in asset values have spurred interest in reform of pension funds (Pensionskassen) and the key
Zukunftsvorsorge product (state-supported retirement provision). The authorities are now
discussing these issues with the Pensionskassen, insurance companies and others. The
mission noted that in the case of the Zukunftsvorsorge product, previous IMF reports,
including the 2008 FSAP Update, had raised concerns over the high (40 percent) minimum
equity investment requirement coupled with a generous guarantee. Total amounts invested
are still relatively low. However, as these are longer-term (up to 40 year) policies and over
one million have been sold since 2003, with total premiums now around €700 million per
year, aggregate values are set to rise significantly over the medium term.
D. Regulatory Initiatives
39.
Regulatory reform will be taken forward mainly through the EU process,
although other changes, many in response to the 2008 FSAP Update, are being made.
Most crisis lessons for regulation, including for bank capital and liquidity requirements, will
be addressed through Austria’s participation in EU reforms. But the authorities have also

32
responded to the particular crisis experience of Austria, including the prevalence of foreign
currency lending. 7 Many FSAP Update recommendations on regulatory reform and related
issues have been addressed. Cooperation between the ANB and the FMA in banking
supervision has been intensified—and worked well under pressure of the crisis. On-site
inspection and off-site monitoring have been increased, staff resources augmented, and
cooperation with foreign regulators stepped up, including through supervisory colleges.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
40.
The economic downturn in Austria will be severe. The crisis came to Austria
relatively late, but has now fully arrived. The economy is expected to shrink by 4 percent in
2009—the highest rate of decline in the post-war period—with a recovery starting in 2010.
Exports and investment were affected first, in late 2008, and more recently private
consumption has been impacted as well. Inflation is projected to remain low this year, with a
slight increase in 2010. The risks to the outlook are balanced, but the uncertainties are large.
41.
The fiscal stimulus measures are welcome, but could have been better targeted.
The stimulus was timely, but neither temporary nor optimally targeted. The tax cuts for
middle-income earners are likely to have lower multipliers than public investment or more
targeted payments would have had. In addition, the measures included in the package—with
the exception of those supporting short-term labor arrangements—are largely permanent.
42.
The stimulus, large automatic stabilizers, and financial sector support will
weaken public finances significantly. In the next few years, the deficit is projected to
remain at 5-6 percent of GDP, and debt is expected to rise by about 20 percentage points to
above 80 percent of GDP. In light of the rapid fiscal deterioration, and in particular the sharp
rise in debt, further stimulus is not recommended at this stage.
43.
The authorities should prepare a credible fiscal consolidation plan to be
implemented once the economy stabilizes. This will strengthen the market’s confidence in
fiscal sustainability, and contribute to a lowering of borrowing costs. In particular, debt
should be brought back to a downward path to accommodate the costs of aging and avoid
crowding out the private sector. Plans for fiscal consolidation could be agreed upon later this
year, so that implementation can start when the economy recovers.
44.
Expenditure measures are preferable to tax hikes. Since taxation in the major
categories remains relatively high, expenditure measures should have priority. Key areas for
consolidation include administration at lower levels of government, pensions, and education
and health. It is important that the Working Group on Fiscal Consolidation makes early
7

See Annex 2 on Regulatory Reform Priorities in Austria for further details.

33
progress in developing specific recommendations. Accompanying measures on the revenue
side could include increases in the fuel tax and the real estate tax.
45.
Recent structural fiscal reforms are welcome, but need to be used more
effectively to ensure long-term sustainability. The federal equalization law for 2008-13
should be complemented by better-enforced limits on subnational deficits and by greater
cooperation between municipalities to reap efficiency gains. The long-awaited medium-term
budget establishes binding ceilings to 2013 for broad categories of federal government
expenditures. The ceilings in this budget, however, are unambitious.
46.
The authorities’ response to the financial crisis was timely and comprehensive.
The ANB and FMA cooperated to address liquidity shortages, while Parliament enacted a
large banking support package, which included fresh capital and guarantees for new debt
issues. A blanket deposit guarantee was introduced in response to similar measures by other
EU members. Supervision has been stepped up, as has cooperation with foreign regulators.
These measures have ensured that banks remain adequately capitalized with access to
funding, although the slow pace of disbursements under the public support program has been
a concern. Contingency planning should support quick and effective interventions, if needed.
47.
The banking system’s exposure to CESE is large and we welcome the ANB’s use
of stress tests to identify banks’ vulnerabilities. The recent tests indicate that the capital
ratios of all systemic banks would remain above minimum regulatory requirements under a
range of shocks. Because of uncertainty over the impact of the recession on future levels of
banks’ non-performing loans, ratios well above the regulatory minimum will be needed to
support private investors’ confidence in banks. The authorities are advised to use the tests—
to be repeated to reflect changes in the outlook—as input for discussions with the banks
about the possible need for stronger capital buffers, if necessary through further public sector
participation. Tail risks underline the importance of contingency planning.
48.
The banks are focused on risk management, while reiterating their commitment
to Eastern European markets. Many banks are reducing risk by tightening lending policies,
curtailing foreign currency lending and, where possible, shortening the term of lending
portfolios. They are also seeking to broaden their deposit base. At the same time, the major
banks have stated the intention to support their subsidiaries in Eastern Europe. In this
context, the active role of the Austrian banks and authorities in the European Bank
Coordination Initiative (the “Vienna Initiative”) is important and welcome.
49.
The insurance and pensions sectors also require attention. The FMA should
continue to monitor major insurers, particularly their vulnerability to asset falls that may
accompany economic downturn in Austria and Eastern Europe. Further development of
stress tests will be useful in this context. Government initiatives to consider possible reforms
to the private pension system (including the “Zukunftvorsorge”) are also worthwhile.

34
50.
The authorities should continue to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory
framework in response to crisis lessons. A further strengthening of regulatory capacity
may be needed as EU and wider international initiatives, for example on bank capital and
liquidity and the perimeter of regulation, are implemented. Gaps in the FMA’s powers, for
example its ability to levy significant fines, should be filled. Close cross-border supervisory
cooperation will also be essential.
51.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be conducted on the standard
12-month cycle.

Annex 1. Western Banks’ Exposures to Eastern Europe: Interpreting the BIS Data
The BIS international banking data shows a significant decline in the Western banks’
exposures to Eastern Europe in 2008Q4 and 2009Q1, with banks from most advanced
European countries contributing to the decline.
Based on the BIS locational banking statistics, the exposure of Western banks to Eastern
Europe declined by US$57 billion in 2008Q4 and US$40 billion in 2009Q1 (adjusted for
exchange rate changes), after increasing by US$25 billion in 2008Q3. The decline was
concentrated in five emerging market countries—Russia, Turkey, Poland, Ukraine, and the
Czech Republic (see Figure A1).

individual countries.

Because a breakdown of locational data by home/host country is not available, we take a
closer look at consolidated international banking statistics to gauge the changes in bilateral
exposures. Since the BIS does not publish the exchange rate adjusted changes in consolidated
foreign claims of reporting banks, US dollar amounts outstanding are converted into euros at
end-period exchange rates to control for US$/euro exchange rate changes. Table A1 shows
that the largest declines were observed in the Western banks' consolidated claims vis-à-vis,
Poland, Russia, the Czech Republic, Ukraine, Latvia, and Turkey—consistent with the
locational data. Only the Swedish, Spanish, and French banks seem to have maintained or
increased their Eastern European exposures between end-September 2008 and end-March
2009.

1/ The numbers in a row do not necessarily add up to the total in the first column due to differences in the population of banks included,
resulting from data limitations and definitional differences.

Possible interpretations:


Western banks seem to have scaled back some of the more risky exposures (for
example, Ukraine), while trying to maintain positions in markets where they have
long-term strategic interests.



Some of the banks’ Eastern European portfolio rebalancing may have been motivated
by the need to reduce concentration of exposures. For example, among the notable
reductions in bank positions were those of German banks vis-à-vis Russia, Austrian
and Belgian banks' vis-à-vis the Czech Republic, and Italian banks' vis-à-vis Poland
(see Figure A2).



Other considerations might have been the feasibility of scaling back exposures
without putting excessive pressure on local economies or without reputational
damage (for example, by reducing lending to unaffiliated entities, rather than the
banks’ affiliates).

Annex 2. Regulatory Reform Priorities in Austria
Financial regulation is undertaken by the FMA, an integrated regulator created in 2002.
Since January 1, 2008, responsibilities for onsite inspection and offsite analysis of banks that
were formerly shared between the FMA and the ANB have been allocated to the ANB but
the FMA remains the decision-taking authority for banks and is jointly responsible for
international cooperation.
Crisis lessons relating to weaknesses in prudential regulation will be addressed in Austria
through its implementation of changes in EU legislation such as the Capital Requirements
Directive. For insurance, the FMA’s approach will be transformed from 2011 by the
Solvency II directive, which will introduce market consistent approaches to asset and
liability valuation. The ANB will be a member of the new European Systemic Risk Board.
In the meantime, the FMA has addressed certain features of Austrian crisis experience,
including:


The high level of foreign currency lending in Austria. Such loans have not been
prohibited; instead, the FMA issued a recommendation in October 2008 on bank
practices, which has contributed to the ending of new foreign currency loans to
Austrian households. In June, the FMA announced an approach that will result in
banks reducing outstanding lending year by year in line with targets agreed with the
regulators. However, most of the intermediaries involved in arranging such loans will
remain unregulated.



Weaknesses in the conduct of investment business, particularly sales practices in
respect of property funds and investment-linked vehicles for the repayment of bank
loans (“Tilgungsträger”). Enforcement action has been taken, which has contributed
to a sharp reduction in the number of licensed companies.

Some material gaps in the FMA’s powers have been highlighted by the crisis. As elsewhere,
banks have not been required to include certain off-balance sheet vehicles and conduits in the
calculation of prudential ratios. There are also gaps in FMA’s investigative powers and its
powers of sanction are limited by the low ceiling (€75,000 in cases of market manipulation)
on administrative penalties (fines). Under official secrets legislation, the FMA is unable to
make public its administrative decisions and supervisory measures other than in the most
exceptional cases. One further significant gap was recently filled when Parliament removed
limits on FMA’s powers to set capital requirements for individual firms above the minimum
generally applicable level set out in law.

Annex II. Austria: Statistical Issues
1.
Macroeconomic statistics are adequate for surveillance. Austria subscribed to the
Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in 1996, and its metadata are available
on the Fund’s electronic Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. Austria is availing itself of
the SDDS flexibility option on the timeliness of the industrial production index and the
merchandise trade data.
2.
The transition to the new European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA 1995) has
complicated the analysis of national accounts and fiscal data. The new national accounts do
not provide information on household disposable income, except for an economy-wide
aggregate, thus precluding the calculation of a household saving ratio. In addition, the
reclassification of public hospitals in 1997 introduced a break in the national account series
on public and private consumption. Annual fiscal data for 1995 onward are derived from
ESA 1995 data reported to Eurostat, using bridge tables created in a collaborative effort by
the Fund and Eurostat. Data on outlays by function have been revised and are available from
1995 onward on a comparable basis according to major functional categories. Reported data
on the net acquisition of financial assets and net incurrence of liabilities exclude a breakdown
between domestic and foreign financing. Quarterly fiscal data reported through Eurostat are
disseminated in the IFS.
3.
The ECB reporting framework is used for monetary statistics and data are reported to
the IMF through a “gateway” arrangement with the ECB. The arrangement provides an
efficient transmission of monetary statistics to the IMF and for publication in the IFS and IFS
Supplement.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 21, 2009

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Austria
On September 9, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Austria.1
Background
After a string of strong years, Austria’s open economy started to slow down in 2008. As a result
of the downturn and a generous stimulus package, consisting mostly of lasting tax cuts, deficits
and debt are expected to rise and remain high in the medium term. The Austrian banking
system is strongly exposed to Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe (CESE). The
authorities have been implementing a large banking stabilization package, including public
capital injections and guarantees.
The economy is projected to shrink considerably in 2009, with a recovery expected to start in
2010. Exports and investment declined strongly already, and more recently consumption has
been affected as well. Inflation is expected to remain low this year, with a slight increase in
2010. The uncertainties surrounding the outlook are considerable.
The underlying fiscal position has deteriorated significantly as a result of policy measures. The
2009/10 budget includes a stimulus package of 1.5 percent of GDP in 2009 and an additional
0.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2010. The stimulus and automatic stabilizers
will widen the deficit to 4.2 percent of GDP in 2009 and 5.6 percent of GDP by 2010. Absent
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
consolidation measures, deficits are projected to remain above 3 percent of GDP throughout the
forecast horizon. Debt is projected to rise above 80 percent of GDP by 2012.
Risks in the financial sector arise from the economic downturn—both in Austria and CESE—and
the financial crisis. While Austrian banks have access to a solid base of domestic deposits and
have had relatively little exposure to U.S.-based structured securities, vulnerabilities arise from
their significant involvement in CESE. A particular risk stems from the extent of foreign currency
loans made by their subsidiaries in the region. This exposes them to indirect credit risk through
the foreign exchange exposure taken on by unhedged borrowers. Vulnerabilities also arise from
credit risk on loan portfolios in Austria at a time of economic downturn, including rising
unemployment.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that, following several years of strong growth performance, Austria’s
economy is now experiencing the full impact of the global financial crisis and the decline in
world trade. The economy is expected to shrink substantially in 2009, and, while a recovery is
expected to start in 2010, the outlook is uncertain.
Directors welcomed the sizeable and timely fiscal stimulus measures, although it was generally
felt that they could have been better targeted. Directors also observed that the measures
included in the package are largely permanent. The stimulus, in combination with large
automatic stabilizers and financial sector support, will therefore result in a sharp rise in public
debt.
Against this backdrop, Directors encouraged the authorities to prepare a credible fiscal
consolidation plan which would strengthen the market’s confidence in fiscal sustainability, and
contribute to a lowering of borrowing costs. They recommended that debt be brought back on a
downward path to accommodate the costs of population aging and avoid crowding out the
private sector. Directors encouraged the authorities to work towards an early agreement on
plans for fiscal consolidation, so that implementation can start when the economy recovers.
Directors noted that since taxation levels in Austria remain relatively high, expenditure
measures should have priority, with a focus on administration at lower levels of government,
continued pension reform, and efficiency gains in education and health. They welcomed the
establishment of a Working Group on Fiscal Consolidation and looked forward to the early
development of specific recommendations. Directors also welcomed this year’s introduction of a
medium-term budget, and encouraged the authorities to adopt more ambitious ceilings
consistent with long-term sustainability. They called for further structural reform over the
medium term to boost potential growth and labor market participation.
Directors commended the authorities for their timely and effective response to the financial
crisis. They welcomed the ample provision of liquidity to the financial system, the sizeable
banking support package, and the strengthened financial sector supervision, including
cooperation with foreign supervisors. While these measures, along with the solid deposit base

3
of Austrian banks, have helped to support financial stability, continued contingency planning
and close monitoring of exposures to Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe (CESE),
including the risks posed by foreign currency lending, are needed.
In light of this, Directors welcomed the use of stress tests to identify banks’ vulnerabilities. They
noted that the recent tests indicate that the capital ratios of all systemic banks would remain
above minimum regulatory requirements under a range of shocks. Directors advised the
authorities to repeat these tests at regular intervals and use them as input for discussions with
the banks about the need for possible stronger capital buffers.
Directors noted that the major banks have stated the intention to support their subsidiaries in
Eastern Europe. They welcomed the active role of the Austrian banks and authorities in the
European Bank Coordination Initiative (the “Vienna Initiative”).
Directors advised the authorities to continue monitoring the insurers’ and pension funds’
vulnerability to falling asset markets. Government initiatives to consider reforms to the private
pension system are welcome. Directors also supported continued efforts to strengthen the
regulatory framework in response to crisis lessons, and in line with European Union and wider
international initiatives. Gaps in the Financial Market Authority’s powers, for example its ability
to levy significant fines, should be filled.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2009 Article IV Consultation with Austria is also available.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Austria
September 9, 2009
1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the Staff Report
was circulated to the Executive Board on August 5, 2009. The information does not alter the
thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Real GDP declined in the second quarter of 2009 by 0.4 percent quarter-on-quarter
and by 4.4 percent year-on-year, despite a relatively strong increase in private consumption
of 0.4 percent quarter-on-quarter. The latest industrial production and export numbers are
still negative compared to last year, but seem to be bottoming out. On the basis of a more
positive outlook for Austria’s main trading partners, we now expect economic growth in
2010 to be slightly positive (about ¼ percentage point).
3.

Other developments:



Headline inflation is negative in July (0.4 percent both month-on-month and yearon-year). Core inflation in Austria remains positive.



Spreads on government bonds have come down significantly (from a peak of
130 basis points in February to 45 basis points at end-August).



Austrian stock prices have done well recently (the ATX was up by about
20 percent since end-June).



The authorities have negotiated a capital infusion into an additional bank, worth
around €1 billion (€0.6 billion in participation capital, €0.4 billion in asset
guarantees), in addition to the €6.5 billion spent on participation capital and asset
guarantees in various banks as reported in the staff report.



Large Austrian banks have reported profits for the first half of 2009, despite
higher provisioning for non-performing loans.

Statement by Johann Prader, Alternate Executive Director for Austria
September 9, 2009
The Austrian authorities appreciate the Article IV consultation discussions with the Fund staff
and commend them for the high quality of the Staff Report. They broadly agree with the staff's
assessment of Austria's economic situation and the recommendations on economic and financial
policies.
The Staff Report, once again, highlights Austria's historically good economic performance
relative to its European peers due to its solid economic policies, structural reforms and wage
moderation. They also note the issues raised regarding the Austrian financial system and its
engagement in CESE.
Short-term outlook
Towards the end of 2008, the Austrian economy entered a recession, albeit with a lag as
compared to its neighbouring countries. In 2009, unemployment has been rising and
employment declining, especially in the export sector, which is suffering because of the global
economic crisis. So far, the knock-on effects on domestic demand have been muted because of
the substantial stimulus measures implemented by the authorities. Since mid-2009, inflation has
entered negative territory, but there is no danger of deflation. Given the economy’s export
orientation and international developments, Austria’s economic outlook at present seems
unusually uncertain.
Like other developed economies, Austria too has been hit by the global financial crisis.
However, in contrast with some other countries, the Austrian economy entered the downturn
from a position of strength. The current account balance recorded a significant surplus and
the savings ratio of private households is high and has risen in the last several years.
Household and corporate balance sheets are relatively healthy as compared to the average of
other euro area countries. No overinvestment – as in the run up to the last downturn in 2001 –
has been observed and the housing market is stable.
Some imbalances built up only in the stock market, which has witnessed a pronounced
boom-bust cycle. Fortunately, wealth effects on consumption have been rather limited in
Austria. A risk specific to the Austrian economy is its high exposure to Eastern Europe due
to its close trade and financial links. However, after signs of stabilization appeared in Eastern
Europe, risks of stronger negative spillovers (at least) via the trade channel declined in the
recent months.
In the past few weeks, there have been several green shoots of stabilization in the global
economy and a possible - albeit weak - recovery is expected in the second half of the year.

2
Moreover, what is important for Austria is that the German economy is also showing signs of
stabilization.
Although Austrian GDP declined in the second quarter (-0.4 percent), the decline was less
than expected. Latest business indicators surprised on the upside. The stress in financial
markets is beginning to unwind (CDS spreads dropped from 260 basis points in midFebruary to 80 in mid-August and the Austrian stock exchange has gained almost 50 percent
since January 2009). And, more recently, even some hard indicators have begun to underpin
the – still very weak – recovery. Industrial production rose by 0.6 percent in June (seasonally
adjusted, month-on-month). The export indicator – based on road freight data until July –
signals that goods exports have started to rebound on a month-to-month basis from May 2009
onwards. Moreover, the situation in the labor market did not deteriorate further. The rise in
the number of unemployed seems to have stabilized since February. Subsidized short-term
work schemes and active labor-market policies proved to be very effective in helping to
normalize the situation in the labor market.
Nevertheless, the evidence from macro indicators is still mixed. Most available indicators
have improved but still remain well below historical averages. An internal update of the
central bank’s economic indicators points towards GDP growth of around ¼ percent both in
the third and the fourth quarter of 2009. Thus, we now expect a GDP growth rate for 2009 in
the range of -3.5 percent to -3.8 percent. This is slightly more optimistic than the latest
central bank forecast of June (-4.2 percent) and the IMF forecast (-4.0 percent).
Given the outcome for the second quarter of 2009 and the brighter prospects for the second
half of the year, we are now also more optimistic for 2010 and the coming years.
Overall, a U-shaped recovery is still the most likely scenario. The risks of a double-dip
recession seem to be limited and are mainly related to two factors: First, a worsening of the
external environment possibly triggered by the phasing out of temporary fiscal stimulus.
Second, a lagged and stronger than currently expected impact of the labor market slack with
negative consequences for private consumption. Moreover, spending by private households
could lose momentum in 2010 as the strong stimulus of tax cuts and substantial wage
increases in 2009 will peter out.
Fiscal policy
At 0.4 percent of GDP, the general government deficit for 2008 was somewhat lower than
expected. The 2009 budget reflects the biggest stimulus package ever and the automatic
stabilizers are set to work fully. We take note of the staff’s assessment of a low efficiency of
some of the measures in terms of short-term stimulus to growth. Apart from standard
Keynesian demand effects, other elements such as ensuring trust in the implementation of the
government’s economic program should also be taken into account. As Austria has a very
comprehensive and generous welfare state, adding transfers in a country with a high tax

3
burden would also have been problematic. The staff rightly notes that considerable amounts
will also be spent on infrastructure. However, due to the specific Austrian institutional set-up
these are not recorded as public investment. But, it should be noted that so far the
construction sector in Austria has not been affected severely by the crisis. Therefore,
additional demand might foster a misallocation of resources.
In the medium-term, the Austrian authorities agree that returning to fiscal stability is key for
the country. As the 2010 budget includes a further fiscal stimulus of around ½ percent of
GDP, fiscal consolidation is not on the immediate agenda but will be addressed as soon as
the recovery begins to take hold. It is planned that the fiscal deficit will return to below 3
percent in 2012.
Financial sector
In spring 2008, as a result of the international focus on the CESE region, the spotlight quickly
turned to the exposure of Austrian banks in Eastern Europe. The CDS spreads of Austrian banks
mirrored the evolution of Eastern European sovereign CDS spreads and rose significantly.
The lack of a housing boom-bust cycle in Austria, the solid deposit base of Austrian banks and
the EU-focus of their CESE exposure, as well as the comparatively large size of the Austrian
stabilization package helped the Austrian financial sector to cope with the volatility of financial
markets in the last couple of quarters.
As of today, it is noteworthy that even in the most difficult markets, Austrian banks have lived
up to their commitment as long-term investors in CESE. They were among the most active
banks in the European Bank Coordination Initiative and have repeatedly reaffirmed their
willingness to maintain their exposure and provide capital.
Notwithstanding the recent calming of international financial markets, the Austrian authorities
continue to be mindful of the region’s vulnerabilities. FX lending certainly remains one of the
top priorities on the authorities’ list of concerns.
Against the background of continuing uncertainty about the future evolution of the real
economy and its feedback into the banking system, the authorities also take note of the
importance of maintaining adequate capitalization levels. They agree with the need to monitor
closely both the path of non-performing loans in Austria and CESE, as well as their impact on
capital ratios of banks. In this respect, regular stress tests will be conducted to benchmark reality
against the stress tests’ scenarios and obtain early warning signals for effective contingency
planning. The markets reacted positively to the stress tests which were discussed with the Fund
staff and published by the authorities at the beginning of July.
