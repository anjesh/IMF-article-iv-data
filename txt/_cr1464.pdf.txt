STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Overview. Mongolia has made impressive progress in developing its economy over the
past decade. Medium-term prospects remain promising given Mongolia’s large natural
resource endowment, but macroeconomic policies have become unsustainably loose.
The resulting balance of payments (BOP) pressures have been compounded by negative
shocks to FDI and coal exports.
Outlook and Risks. Staff expect the economy to grow by 12 percent this year and
9½ percent in 2014, buoyed by the start of production at the Oyu Tolgoi (OT) copper
and gold mine. Over the past two years, nonmining growth has been boosted by fiscal
and monetary stimulus. In view of the uncertain external environment, Mongolia needs
to change course to reduce its vulnerability to external shocks. Gross international
reserves are still adequate for precautionary purposes, but they have been supported by
external borrowing and the declining trend in net international reserves observed this
year is not sustainable.
Policies. Securing sustainable growth while addressing macroeconomic risks requires a
package of fiscal adjustment, unwinding of the monetary stimulus provided this year,
and continued exchange rate flexibility. Banking sector vulnerabilities and weaknesses in
the business climate also need to be addressed.


Some encouraging steps are being taken to tighten fiscal policy in the remainder of
2013 and by basing the 2014 budget on more realistic revenue projections. However,
including off-budget spending by the Development Bank of Mongolia (DBM) the
overall fiscal deficit in 2013 will likely again be over 10 percent of GDP.
Implementation of the Fiscal Stability Law (FSL) is an urgent priority, with DBM
spending to be included in the budget. Public investment projects should be
reprioritized in view of constraints on absorptive and implementation capacity.



The Bank of Mongolia (BOM)’s large monetary stimulus, through its so-called “price
stabilization program,” mortgage program, and liquidity injection, distorts markets
and is bound to ratchet up inflation. The programs should be phased out and the
BOM should focus on further strengthening the monetary policy framework while
maintaining the increased exchange rate flexibility observed in recent months.



Banking sector vulnerabilities need to be addressed. They stem from weaknesses in
banking supervision, inadequate provisioning, high levels of loan concentration and
dollarization, and a high and rising credit-to-deposit ratio.



The government should build on the recent passage of the new investment law to
further improve the business climate and encourage FDI inflows.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. Introduction
1. Mongolia has made impressive progress in developing its economy (Figure 1). Spearheaded
by foreign direct investment (FDI)-financed development of the mining sector, per capita income has
increased five-fold, to more than US$3,000, over the past decade. Medium-term prospects are
promising as mining output is projected to expand further over the next five years. Foreign investors’
optimism about Mongolia’s prospects was illustrated by successful international bond issuances in
2012. A private mining company, a private bank, the state-owned Development Bank (DBM), and the
sovereign (the US$1.5 billion “Chinggis” bond) raised a total of US$3 billion (30 percent of GDP).
2. The strong growth of the economy has helped reduce poverty. Over the past two years,
poverty has declined by more than 11 percentage points, to 27 percent of the population in 2012.
However, indicators for inequality and unemployment suggest that there is scope to make growth
more inclusive, despite relatively high social spending compared to Mongolia’s peers (Figure 4).
3. However, macroeconomic policies have been unsustainably loose the past two years.
Government expenditure increased by 70 percent in real terms between 2010 and 2012, with
growing importance of off-budget spending. In late-2012, the BOM embarked on a major monetary
stimulus, which added to growing BOP pressures. During 2012 and the first half of 2013, BOP
pressures were mostly reflected in a decline in the BOM’s Net International Reserves (NIR). In recent
months, the exchange rate has become more flexible. Capitalization and liquidity of the banking
system have improved. However, dollarization remains high and the provisioning regime for
commercial banks lags Asian peers.
Staff Recommendations Made in the Context of the Last Two Article IV Consultations
 Scale back the growth of total government spending in view of inflation and BOP pressures.
 Take off-budget spending into account when determining the macro-economically sustainable
level of total government spending.
 Monetary easing should be contingent on demand pressures abating and prudent fiscal policy.
 BOP pressures should be reflected more in movements in the exchange rate.
 Continue efforts to strengthen the soundness and resilience of the banking system.
4. This year’s consultation focused on the need to adjust macroeconomic policies to rein in
domestic demand growth, curtail balance of payments pressures, and contain inflation. In
particular, discussions centered on the implementation of the 2010 Fiscal Stability Law (FSL)—which
has now become effective and which prescribes a 2 percent of GDP limit on the structural fiscal
deficit (Appendix II) 1—as well as the need for a significant correction in the monetary policy stance.
1

The new fiscal framework implied by the 2010 Fiscal Stability Law (FSL) was adopted in the aftermath of the 2008/09
balance of payments (BOP) crisis. It focuses on prudent natural resource management, taking into account absorptive
capacity constraints—in particular, macroeconomic stability and overheating concerns, and concerns about the
efficiency of scaled-up public investments, as well as intergenerational concerns. The framework was designed with
substantial input from the IMF (FAD), consistent with the principles and international experience summarized in the
2012 IMF Policy Paper on Macroeconomic Policy Frameworks for Resource-Rich Developing Countries. In turn, that
paper noted that the Mongolian fiscal policy framework anchored by the FSL constitutes a relevant example for other
middle- and low-income countries with large revenue from nonrenewable resources.

Other key topics included a renewed focus on financial sector risks—illustrated by the recent failure
of Savings Bank (Box 1)—and structural reforms to clarify the investment regime and boost nonmining growth. Staff liaised with Mongolia’s bilateral and multilateral development partners. While
noting Mongolia’s longer-term infrastructure needs, they shared the staff’s concerns about the
unsustainably loose macroeconomic policies.
5. A new government took over in 2012. The June 2012 parliamentary elections were won by
the opposition Democratic Party, which formed a coalition government with three smaller parties
and appointed a new central bank governor. With the June 2013 reelection of President Elbegdorj,
the Democratic Party now essentially controls government for the next three years.

B. Expansionary Policies and External Shocks Are Pressuring the BOP
6. The Mongolian economy has continued to grow very rapidly. The economy expanded by
12½ percent in 2012 and by 11½ percent in the first half of 2013. Growth has been buoyed by a
relatively mild winter boosting agriculture and highly expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. The
latter have been deployed to compensate for the marked slowdown in coal exports and FDI-financed
mining development—key drivers of growth in recent years.
7.

However, BOP pressures have intensified and inflation is bound to rise:



Negative shocks to FDI and coal exports increased BOP pressures from mid-2012 onwards.
These pressures have been compounded by highly expansionary fiscal and monetary policies
that are boosting the demand for non-mining imports.



Inflation fell to a two-year low of 7 percent in July thanks to moderating food prices and the
Bank of Mongolia’s (BOM) price stabilization program. However, the depreciation of the togrog
of the past three months is likely to push up inflation in the coming months.

8. Monetary policy has been highly expansionary. To cushion the impact of declining FDI and
to boost credit growth, the BOM took a two-pronged approach: it cut the policy rate three times by
a total of 275 basis points to 10.5 percent; and it lent substantial sums to banks at below-market
rates, including for on-lending to selected sectors through the price stabilization and mortgage
programs (Box 2). If it wasn’t for a large decline in its international reserves, the BOM’s balance sheet
and hence reserve money would have more than doubled in just 6 months. Commercial banks have
been taking advantage of the large provision of cheap BOM funding, and private sector credit
growth accelerated to 47 percent in August (y/y).
9.

Fiscal policy has remained highly expansionary.



The overall fiscal deficit (including DBM operations) rose to 10.9 percent of GDP in 2012,
6 percent of GDP higher than in 2011:
 The 2012 budget outturn recorded a deficit of 7.5 percent of GDP. Revenue growth
decelerated on declining FDI inflows. On-budget expenditures rose by 20 percent, in part
due to large increases in civil servants’ wages.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONGOLIA

 Off-budget spending by the government-owned DBM amounted to 3.4 percent of GDP in
2012. This spending should also be included in the assessment of the fiscal policy stance.
The DBM’s debt is guaranteed by the government and has to be serviced by the
government budget. A large part of DBM spending is on non-revenue-generating public
investment projects such as roads. For several of the “revenue-generating projects” there is
a substantial risk that the DBM will not be repaid, e.g. the US$200 million it has provided to
the loss-making state-owned coal producer Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi.


Government spending continued to rise sharply during the first 8 months of 2013.
Spending by the budget was unchanged from a year ago. However, including the more than
MNT 1 trillion (6½ percent of GDP) spending by the DBM, total government spending rose by
30 percent compared to the same period last year.



Public debt has been rising rapidly. Excluding an additional foreign bond issuance under
discussion, public debt is projected to reach 67 percent of GDP by the end of 2013, up from
39 percent just two years ago. Moreover, the cost and risk profile of the public debt have
become less favorable. The share of concessional loans has declined, the bulk of the debt is
denominated in foreign currency, and substantial refinancing risk has emerged for 2017. The
IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) now indicates that Mongolia is at moderate
risk of debt distress.

10. BOP pressures caused by the external shocks and expansionary policies have been
absorbed by BOM foreign exchange sales financed from external borrowing and, more
recently, increased exchange rate flexibility. Gross international reserves currently amount to
US$2.4 billion (about 3.7 months of prospective imports), about the same level as a year ago.
External borrowing has helped keep reserves at this level. For instance, the government deposited
the sovereign “Chinggis” bond proceeds at the BOM. This helped to raise the BOM’s Gross
International Reserves (GIR) to a record US$4.1 billion at end-2012. As a result of persistent sales of
foreign exchange in the spot and forward market, GIR subsequently fell to US$2.4 billion (Figure 3).
Over the past year, the exchange rate has depreciated by 22 percent vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, with
most of this occurring in the last four months.
11. International financial markets are becoming more concerned about developments in
Mongolia. The key selling points for Mongolia’s successful maiden sovereign bond issuance in late2012 were the new fiscal policy framework anchored by the FSL becoming operational in 2013 and
the imminent start of exports from the Oyu Tolgoi (OT) copper mine. However, sentiment
subsequently suffered with downward pressures on international reserves, the uncertain external
outlook, and the Savings Bank failure. By mid-September, as yields on relatively risky assets rose in
anticipation of the US Federal Reserve System starting to taper its asset purchases, Mongolia’s
sovereign spread had widened about 140 basis points more than the average for emerging markets
since the issuance. With the postponement of “Fed tapering”, the “excess spread” has narrowed
again (Figure 3).

C. Outlook and Risks
12.

The near-term outlook for growth is favorable but inflation will likely rise.



Growth is projected to remain in or near double digits in 2013 and 2014. Mineral GDP will
be boosted by the start of commercial operations at the Oyu Tolgoi (OT) copper mine and
expansion of coal production from the Tavan Tolgoi (TT) mine. Non-mineral GDP growth is
projected at 11 percent in 2013, supported by expansionary monetary and fiscal policies. Nonmineral GDP growth in 2014 depends in part on the pace of DBM disbursements for
investments in public investment projects and the extent to which the BOM’s stimulus
programs are continued.



Inflation is projected to move above 10 percent and remain there through late-2014. In
the context of continued strong growth of domestic demand, and notwithstanding the BOM’s
continued operation of the price stabilization program, the depreciation of the exchange rate
observed in recent months will likely spill over into higher inflation.

13.
However, continuation of current policies could lead to a highly vulnerable situation.
The important policy decisions facing the authorities are highlighted by a comparison of a “strong
policy scenario” with a “weak policy scenario” (see Table 1 on next page):


In the strong policy scenario, which is quantified in more detail in Tables 2–7, the medium-term
budget framework is consistent with the FSL. On-budget fiscal operations observe the FSL
starting with a 2014 budget based on realistic revenue projections. The off-budget program of
public investment projects is phased out by the end of 2015. To help ease demand and BOP
pressures further, the BOM’s stimulus programs are phased out by mid-2014.



The weak policy scenario illustrates the risks of a continuation of current policies amid
continued weakness of FDI inflows and coal exports. In this scenario, it takes the government
two more years to bring on-budget fiscal operations in line with the FSL. In addition, the
government continues to pursue its development strategy through the implementation of offbudget public investment projects. This would be broadly in line with the medium-term budget
framework for 2014-16 which was approved in May and envisages continued large
international bond issuances. Finally, the BOM’s stimulus measures are phased out only
gradually (by 2015). In this scenario, non-mining growth in 2014 would be higher than in the
strong policy scenario. However, Mongolia would run a progressively more serious risk of a
BOP crisis. In case of crisis, the required large adjustment of absorption would cause a
cumulative non-mining output loss of about 20 percentage points, compared to the strong
policy scenario, over a 4 year horizon (calibrated on cross-country experiences summarized in
WP/08/224 and the Board Paper on “Assessing Reserve Adequacy”). The larger exchange rate
depreciation (compared to the strong policy scenario) would add to inflationary pressures. The
implications of the weak policy scenario for key indicators of public external debt public are
illustrated in the Debt-Sustainability Analysis.

14.
In addition to the risks posed by the continuation of current policies, the outlook is subject to
other downside near- and medium-term risks (see Risk Assessment Matrix, Appendix I):



Spillovers from weakening external demand for commodities could further dampen mining
export revenues. Advanced economies will eventually exit from the very supportive
monetary policies implemented in recent years. China’s economy is expected to rebalance
away from a mostly investment-based growth model toward a more consumption-based
growth model. Both these factors will likely have significant spillovers globally and especially
in the region. China accounts for more than 90 percent of Mongolia’s exports and the recent
World Economic Outlook identifies Mongolia as one of the most vulnerable countries to a
rebalancing of demand in China. Slowing growth in China would affect Mongolia via trade
and FDI channels.



External shocks and/or the continuation of current policies could expose vulnerabilities in the
banking system, exacerbating a negative shock to growth and financial stability.

15.
Mongolia’s medium-term prospects remain promising. Mongolia’s large natural resource
endowment and its proximity to the fastest-growing economies in the world provide ample
opportunities for development. The start of copper production at the OT open pit mine, the
development of the OT underground mine, and the ramp up of coal production from the TT mine
are projected to keep the growth of mineral GDP at about 16 percent per annum, on average,
during 2013-17. Activity outside the mining sector is also projected to remain buoyant, although this
would need to be supported by continued reforms to strengthen the foundation of the economy
and the business climate.

Authorities’ Views
16.
The authorities expressed optimism about continued strong growth alongside a
strengthening of the BOP in the course of 2014 and over the medium term. The centerpiece of
their development strategy was scaled-up public investment, including in transportation
infrastructure, financed by foreign borrowing, to be sustained by continued rapid economic growth
and a recovery of export earnings. They pointed at their achievements, despite the external shocks,
including continued double-digit economic growth, buoyed by sharply rising domestic investments,
with inflation kept at manageable levels. The authorities projected the economy to grow by
15 percent per annum, on average, during 2013-2016. They expected mining and non-mining
output to record average annual growth of 32 percent and 11 percent, respectively.
17.
The authorities acknowledged the downside risks to the external outlook but indicated
they were taking steps to address prevailing BOP pressures. Government spending was being
curtailed for the remainder of the year (¶22). The BOM was discussing plans to unwind some of the
monetary stimulus (¶30). The recent exchange rate depreciation was dampening the demand for
imports (¶31). And Parliament passed a new Investment Law aimed at boosting FDI and domestic
investment (¶38). New foreign borrowing in the coming months and an anticipated rebound in coal
exports starting in the last quarter of this year would help holding immediate BOP pressures at bay.
On that basis, the authorities did not consider necessary at this time an additional package of
macroeconomic adjustments and reforms as outlined in the “strong policy scenario.”

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
18.
Notwithstanding Mongolia’s promising medium-term prospects, macroeconomic
policies are on an unsustainable path and need to be adjusted to rein in domestic demand
growth, curtail balance of payments pressures, and contain inflation. The discussions centered
on the need for a package of fiscal adjustment, unwinding of the monetary stimulus, and continued
exchange rate flexibility. Banking sector vulnerabilities and uncertainties surrounding the foreign
investment regime also need to be addressed.

A. Fiscal Policy
19.
Some encouraging steps have recently been taken to tighten fiscal policy. These steps
would moderate spending growth during the remainder of 2013 and provide a good foundation for
the preparation of the 2014 budget:


The Minister of Finance announced plans to reduce budgetary spending by almost
MNT 1 trillion (6 percent of GDP) so as to keep the 2013 budget within the FSL’s 2 percent of
GDP ceiling for the structural fiscal deficit.



During the remainder of 2013, the DBM will not receive additional funding from the Chinggisbond proceeds currently held by the government at the BOM. The DBM would pay out the cash
it currently has on hand (MNT 0.4 trillion) on ongoing public investment projects.



The Ministry of Finance has initiated work on the 2014 budget based on a relatively
conservative projection for government revenue.

20.
However, given the sustained BOP pressures and the uncertain outlook, staff argued
that further steps were needed. Even with the measures listed above, the fiscal deficit including
DBM operations in 2013 would top last year’s level (10.9 percent of GDP) and public debt (including
BOM external borrowing) would reach about 67 percent of GDP. This raises doubts about the
consistency of fiscal policy with the FSL


DBM operations should be included in the budget starting with the 2014 budget. The DBM was
founded after the FSL was adopted, and the FSL is not clear about whether the structural deficit
rule applies to public sector off-budget activities. Lack of clarity on this issue in the FSL has led
to off-budget public sector activities being excluded from the rule. However, the main purpose
of the FSL is “ensuring fiscal stability” (Article 1), and the law envisages comprehensive coverage
of public debt (Article 4.1.8). On that basis, off-budget activities through the DBM should be
reflected in the calculation of all FSL requirements.



An ambitious and credible fiscal consolidation plan should be drawn up, consistent with the FSL.
Budget operations and the operations of the DBM taken together should meet the 2 percent of
GDP ceiling for the structural deficit in due course. Given the sustained BOP pressures, the
planned adjustment needs to be adequately frontloaded, spearheaded by streamlining

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONGOLIA

subsidies and transfers and reprioritizing capital spending. Even so, the overall deficit (including
DBM operations) and the public debt would likely exceed the FSL limits in the next 2–3 years,
which should be transparently explained to Parliament. Over the medium term, and given also
current economic conditions and vulnerabilities, the FSL ceilings for the deficit and public debt
remain appropriate and should anchor adjustments to a sustainable policy path.


DBM spending should be re-phased and re-prioritized. DBM spending is projected to amount to
9 percent of GDP in 2013 and has contributed considerably to BOP pressures. To help ease
these pressures, the Ministry of Economic Development and the DBM should prepare a
prioritized list of capital expenditure items in their portfolios and only implement the projects
with the highest payoff in terms of contributions to medium-term growth.



The Social Welfare Law (SWL) should be implemented. The 2012 SWL envisages replacing
existing costly universal cash transfers with means-tested benefits that would reach the poorest
households. This would help increase fiscal flexibility and reduce inequality.

21.
The set up of a sovereign wealth fund (SWF) should be completed. The establishment of
a SWF would be an important complement to the FSL’s countercyclical fiscal policy. Technical work
on setting up a SWF should be finalized, building on technical assistance provided by the World
Bank and the IMF.

Authorities’ Views
22.
The authorities confirmed their commitment to observe the 2 percent of GDP ceiling
for the structural deficit for on-budget operations in 2013 and 2014. Cuts of current and capital
spending for the rest of the year had been decided through a Cabinet Resolution and would be
reflected in a supplementary 2013 budget to be discussed by Parliament in November. Discussions
on the 2014 budget had started based on realistic revenue projections.
23. They noted that DBM spending represented a key policy instrument to boost growth in
the short- and medium term. DBM spending was approved by parliament and bringing it onbudget could be done in different ways. In view of the uncertain economic outlook, the authorities
were not ready to commit to a target date by which the overall fiscal deficit including DBM
operations would observe the 2 percent of GDP structural deficit ceiling. They were looking to issue
another international bond to finance additional DBM spending until an expected pick up in exports
and growth would kick in. The authorities expressed an interest in further discussing with staff the
appropriateness of the FSL debt and deficit ceilings and the treatment of DBM operations under
those ceilings.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
24.
The monetary policy framework has been strengthened. Earlier this year, the BOM
introduced a policy interest rate corridor. The auctioning of treasury bills was modernized. And the
adoption of the new Securities Law should facilitate secondary market trading of treasury bills. These
measures are important in strengthening the interest rate channel of monetary policy.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

MONGOLIA

25. However, the large monetary and quasi-fiscal stimulus provided through three new
BOM programs creates risks and distortions, and should be unwound. The three programs
loosen the monetary policy stance, creating inflationary and BOP pressures (Box 3). They also
heighten banking sector vulnerabilities and could give rise to contingent liabilities for the public
sector (Box 2).
26.
Exchange rate flexibility has increased in recent months. The floating exchange rate
regime and auction system should be maintained. Intervention should be limited to smoothing
excessive exchange rate volatility. To support medium- and long-term external stability and the
exchange rate regime, appropriate fiscal and monetary policies are key, along the lines
recommended above.
27. The real exchange rate is assessed to be moderately overvalued, even in the strong
policy scenario which assumes a tightening of monetary and fiscal policy (Box 4). The
overvaluation, and the risk of a further large adjustment of the nominal exchange rate, would
become more pronounced in case the loose fiscal and monetary policy implemented so far this year
continued. This assessment takes into account the full development of the OT and TT mines. While
the current account is projected to continue to show a large deficit over the five-year projection
period, the long-term prospects are favorable, as the current account is expected to gradually move
to a surplus.
28. Even though international reserves have been
on a downward trajectory, they are still adequate for
precautionary purposes based on traditional
assessment criteria. A recently developed risk-based
metric of reserve adequacy (see SM/11/31) suggests
that Mongolia may need to hold more reserves than it
currently does. Moreover, the declining trend in net
international reserves—taking into account the deposits
taken from commercial banks and the BOM’s increasing
foreign liabilities—is not sustainable, underscoring the
need for policy adjustment.

Authorities’ Views
29.
The authorities explained that countercyclical monetary policy had been implemented
to prevent a serious economic downturn and a credit crunch. They noted that Mongolia faced a
difficult economic outlook in late-2012, owing to the negative shocks to FDI and coal exports. The
BOM’s stimulus programs had succeeded in reviving demand and supporting growth while keeping
inflation on a downward trajectory.
30. The intention is to phase out the monetary stimulus programs over time. The BOM
deposits placed with commercial banks would be pulled back in the coming months. The new
mortgages sold by banks would be taken off their books through securitization operations, and

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

3,500

MONGOLIA

banks would be obliged to repay the freed-up funds to the BOM. The authorities were confident
that the implications for banking-sector liquidity were manageable and that refinancing risks were
not an issue, pointing at commercial banks’ large holdings of central bank bills. The BOM would
continue to operate the price stabilization program pending the development of market-based,
efficient warehouse financing with private-sector participation.
31. The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to the floating exchange rate regime. They
expressed broad agreement with staff’s assessment of the exchange rate and reserve adequacy.
While the exchange rate depreciation in July and August was due to a string of bad news, including
with regard to the ongoing discussions among OT shareholders, the authorities noted that its
dampening effect on import demand was already visible.

C. Financial Sector Issues
32.
Good progress has been made in strengthening banks’ capitalization and liquidity, and
reported non-performing loans are low (Box 5). The higher capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of
14 percent for the four largest, systemically important banks that was achieved by mid-2013 is
providing welcome additional buffers. Moreover, the higher minimum paid-in capital requirement
(MNT 16 billion) and higher Tier 1 capital ratio (9 percent) are helpful for the relatively more
vulnerable small- and medium-size banks.
33. Nevertheless, as illustrated by the recent failure of Savings Bank, the banking sector
harbors significant vulnerabilities. There is a need to strengthen corporate governance practices
and enforcement of regulations, including single borrower limits. Mongolia’s loan-to-deposit ratio
and level of dollarization are among the highest in Asia. Surging credit growth is likely to have
posed a challenge to prudent underwriting practices and supervision. The currency depreciation of
the past four months could adversely affect credit quality of foreign currency-denominated loans. In
light of the relatively undiversified nature of the economy, the banking system also remains
vulnerable to a downturn in the mining sector and a deceleration of government spending.
34. To contain financial sector risks, the regulatory and supervisory framework should be
strengthened further:


The BOM should strictly enforce the existing prudential regulations and continue to improve
prudential indicators. The existing lending limits on a single borrower and a bank-related party
should be rigorously enforced. Focus should also be on strengthening underwriting practices as
well as on addressing deficiencies in loan classifications and NPL recognition. The BOM should
consider phasing in a more forward-looking provisioning scheme that takes into account the
risks of losses on performing loans.



The newly expanded State Bank should be recapitalized promptly and plans should be
developed toward its privatization.



The supervisory and bank resolution regimes should be enhanced. Following up on the
implementation of the 2010 FSAP recommendations, a strategic plan should be developed to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

MONGOLIA

implement a robust supervisory regime and strengthen the bank resolution framework. In
addition, there is a need to develop a legal framework for prompt corrective actions that
mandates progressively stronger supervisory actions as a bank’s capital declines. The recently
established Deposit Insurance Corporation and the BOM, in collaboration with other appropriate
entities, should develop a comprehensive framework to address standalone resolution
requirements, as well as a systemic financial crisis.


Lending dollarization should be discouraged. Mongolia’s relatively high dollarization, in
conjunction with the relatively small size of non-mining exports, suggests that the non-bank
private sector may have a considerable foreign currency mismatch with attendant risks. Yet the
2010 FSAP recommendation to establish guidelines for foreign exchange lending still has to be
followed up. Ideally, banks should only be allowed to lend in foreign currency to hedged
borrowers. Alternatively, consideration could be given to additional prudential measures such as
higher risk weights on foreign currency-denominated loans and caps on individual banks’
foreign currency loan-to-deposit ratio.

35. Efforts to strengthen the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of
Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework need to be stepped up. In October 2013, the Financial Action
Task Force (FATF) designated Mongolia as a jurisdiction not making sufficient progress in implementing
the agreed action plan to enhance its AML/CFT framework. There is a risk that, absent sufficient
progress by February 2014, the country will be placed on the FATF blacklist, which would lead to
heightened due diligence from foreign financial institutions regarding transactions with Mongolia.

Authorities’ Views
36.
The authorities expressed broad satisfaction with their management of financial sector
risks. Following the failure of Savings Bank there were no more banks under a Supervisory Action
Plan. Adequate safeguards had been built into the mortgage program (e.g. minimum downpayment requirements and maximum loan-to-value ratios). The authorities also pointed out that the
bulk of unhedged foreign-currency loans were to larger, more-diversified corporations who they
considered able to internalize the foreign currency risk. They further noted that the timing was not
right to adjust the provisioning regime.

D. Structural Reforms and Statistics
37.
Efforts to improve the business climate and trade integration should continue.
Mongolia ranks relatively high in the World Bank’s Doing Business Survey. However, there is scope
to further streamline procedures and strengthen policy frameworks to boost private-sector-led nonmineral growth. For instance, trading across borders, getting electricity and dealing with
construction permits remain relatively cumbersome.
38.
Adoption of a new Investment Law on October 3 is a major milestone in the authorities’
quest to revive domestic and foreign direct investment. The recent extraordinary session of
Parliament discussed a package of 5 laws aimed at boosting investment and gold exports by
streamlining and stabilizing rules and procedures for domestic and foreign investors. These

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONGOLIA

discussions have been brought to fruition through the recent adoption of the new Investment Law
and the Investment Fund Law.
39.
Efforts to strengthen macroeconomics statistics should continue. Good progress is
being made in upgrading national accounts and balance of payments statistics, building on
recommendations made by technical assistance experts. Timely release of data on DBM spending is
needed to facilitate comprehensive assessments of the fiscal policy stance.

STAFF APPRAISAL
40.
Mongolia continues to be one of the fastest growing economies in Asia. Growth in 2012
and the first half of 2013 was buoyed by the development of new large mining projects, a relatively
mild winter boosting agriculture, and highly expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. Inflation fell
to a two-year low in July thanks to moderating food prices and the BOM’s price stabilization
program. Poverty continued to decline in 2012.
41.
However, BOP pressures have been intensifying and inflation is bound to rise again. To
cushion the impact on domestic activity of declining FDI and coal exports, monetary and fiscal policy
have been loosened markedly. Through mid-year, the resulting BOP pressures were met by
intervention, supported by large sovereign and BOM external borrowing. More recently, the
exchange rate has been allowed to depreciate, which will likely push up inflation in the coming
months.
42.
A continuation of current policies could lead to a highly vulnerable situation. The nearterm outlook for growth is favorable. However, continued elevated fiscal spending, including
through off-budget public investment projects, and failure to rein in credit growth could heighten
risks to the economy and the financial sector. Given Mongolia’s exposure to external shocks, this
could necessitate a costly and painful adjustment down the road. In particular, the outlook is subject
to risks from the uncertain outlook for external demand for commodities which could negatively
impact Mongolia via trade and FDI channels. There is also a risk that vulnerabilities in the banking
system could be exposed, which could exacerbate a negative shock to growth and financial stability.
The IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) now indicates that Mongolia is at a
moderate risk of debt distress.
43.
Putting the economy on a sustainable path requires implementation of a package of
fiscal and monetary adjustment in the context of a flexible exchange rate regime, as outlined
in the “strong policy scenario”. In this regard, some encouraging steps have been taken in recent
months, particularly in the areas of fiscal policy and exchange rate policy. This signals a good start
by the authorities to initiate the “strong policy scenario,” provided the monetary expansion and offbudget fiscal operations are reined in.
44.
An ambitious and credible fiscal consolidation plan should be drawn up. Recently
announced steps would moderate spending growth during the remainder of 2013 and provide a
solid foundation for the preparation of the 2014 budget. However, further measures are urgently

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

MONGOLIA

needed. Even with the announced steps, this year’s fiscal deficit (including DBM operations) will still
be very large and public debt, including external borrowing by the Bank of Mongolia, will reach
about 67 percent of GDP this year, up from 39 percent of GDP in 2011. This raises doubts about the
consistency of fiscal policy with the FSL. Budget operations and the operations of the DBM taken
together should meet the 2 percent of GDP ceiling for the structural deficit over the next 2-3 years.
Given the sustained BOP pressures, the planned adjustment needs to be adequately frontloaded,
spearheaded by streamlining subsidies and transfers and reprioritizing capital spending.
45.
Reform of the fiscal policy framework should continue. Implementation of the SWL
would enhance fiscal flexibility and efficiency and reduce inequality. Establishment of a SWF would
be an important complement to the FSL’s countercyclical fiscal policy framework.
46.
The large monetary stimulus provided by the BOM should be unwound. The three BOM
programs that have been launched over the past year have unduly loosened the monetary policy
stance, creating inflationary and BOP pressures. Moreover, they create important distortions,
heighten banking sector vulnerabilities, and could give rise to contingent liabilities for the public
sector.
47.
The increased exchange rate flexibility observed in recent months has helped absorb
some of the BOP pressures. The floating exchange rate regime and auction system should be
maintained, and intervention should be limited to smoothing excessive exchange rate volatility.
While gross reserves remain adequate for precautionary purposes, net international reserves are on
a downward trajectory that is not sustainable The real exchange rate is assessed to be moderately
overvalued, even in a strong policy scenario which assumes a tightening of monetary and fiscal
policy.
48.
Efforts to contain financial sector risks should continue. Building on progress in
strengthening banks’ capitalization and liquidity, the BOM should strictly enforce existing prudential
regulations, including single-borrower limits. Focus should also be on strengthening underwriting
practices, loan classifications, and NPL recognition. The BOM should consider phasing in a more
forward-looking provisioning scheme that takes into account the risks of losses on performing
loans. Lending dollarization should be discouraged. The bank resolution regime should be
enhanced, and a legal framework developed for prompt corrective actions that mandates
progressively stronger supervisory actions as a bank’s capital declines. Efforts to strengthen the
AML/CFT framework need to be stepped up to avoid blacklisting by the FATF.
49.
Mongolia’s medium-term prospects remain promising. Mongolia’s large natural resource
endowment and its proximity to fast-growing economies provide ample opportunities for
development. Mining GDP is projected to expand rapidly during the next five years thanks to large
mining projects coming on stream. The sustained growth of activity outside the mining sector would
need to be supported by continued reforms to strengthen the business climate, building on the
government’s recent success in passing a new investment law. Efforts to strengthen macroeconomic
statistics should continue.

Box 1. The Recent Failure of Savings Bank1
The Bank of Mongolia (BOM) announced on July 22 that it had intervened Savings Bank. Privatelyowned Savings Bank accounted for 8 percent of total banking assets (fifth-largest in the country). Reflecting
its historically broad branch network, it processed over half of government financial services transactions
including payments of pensions, child allowances, and subsidies. The intervention included the appointment
of a receiver and transfer of most of the bank’s assets and liabilities to State Bank, a government-owned
bank established in 2009 to manage assets and liabilities from two failed banks.
Savings Bank’s failure underscores the need to strengthen banking supervision. In its announcement,
the BOM indicated that the Savings Bank had faced financial difficulties since 2011. The BOM linked the
failure to loans to related interests of the bank’s only shareholder and indicated that the matter would be
turned over to relevant law enforcement agencies. The related-party loans in this instance exceeded capital
by more than 2 times (compared to the 20 percent of capital limitation on loans to any related parties, and
the 5 percent limitation on loans to related parties of the bank).
The failure’s impact on macro-financial stability appears to be well-contained. The BOM reports that
deposit outflows subsequent to the merger were minimal (including in State Bank). While market observers
have highlighted that the unexpected nature of the intervention could undermine confidence in the system
as a whole, the BOM notes that the Savings Bank had been under a special supervisory program since 2011.
A recapitalization of State Bank in the amount of MNT 205 billion is planned. Accordingly, the Deposit
Insurance Corporation would provide these funds to State Bank in the form of financial support and share
purchases, financed from a loan from the BOM. This would restore the bank’s CAR to 18 percent, the level
before it received the assets and assumed the liabilities of the failed Savings Bank. The authorities expressed
a commitment to privatize the State Bank as soon as possible.

Box 2. Price Stabilization Program, Mortgage Program and Liquidity Injection
Over the past year, the BOM has attempted to reduce inflation and spur economic growth using
unconventional methods. However, the exceptionally large monetary and quasi-fiscal stimulus provided
through various programs risk ratcheting up inflation, adding to BOP pressures, and heightening banking
sector vulnerabilities.
The total planned allocation under the three programs is equivalent to MNT 3.4 trillion (20 percent
of GDP). By end-August, about MNT 3 trillion had been disbursed, causing the BOM’s Net Domestic Assets
to rise by more than 100 percent of end-2012 reserve money and raising reserve money growth to 34
percent (y/y):



Price Stabilization Program (PSP). Under this program, launched in late-2012, the BOM provides lowcost funding to corporations whose price-setting behavior has a significant impact on the CPI (e.g.
wholesale distributors of meat, flour and imported petroleum products). By end-August, about MNT 0.6
trillion had been channeled through banks, which are charged 0.5-4 percent and, in turn, can charge
their corporate customers up to 7 percent.



Liquidity injection. Through August, the BOM provided banks MNT 900 billion in the form of one-year
time deposits at 7 percent interest to reverse the downward trend in lending growth.



Mortgage program and housing support supply loans. In mid-June, the BOM launched a MNT 1.1 trillion
mortgage lending program, aimed to provide low-cost mortgage loans to qualified consumers. Funding
under this program was provided to banks at 4 percent interest, and on-lent by banks through 20-year
mortgages at 8 percent interest. In addition, the BOM has provided about MNT 0.4 trillion housing
supply support to construction companies and real estate developers.

Besides adding to inflationary and BOP pressures, the programs heighten banking sector
vulnerabilities. They could also give rise to contingent liabilities for the public sector:




Owing to the lending rate caps, the banks cannot adequately price credit risk.
The mortgage lending and liquidity injection programs create refinancing risk for the banks, in case the
BOM withdraws from the programs.



Risks are exacerbated by the fact that loans issued under the programs are exempt from prudential
ratios, in particular the single large exposure and related-lending limits. This worsens moral hazard and
adverse selection.



Under the mortgage lending program, credit risk is envisaged to be transferred away from the banking
system through mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) issued by the Mongolian Mortgage Corporation
(MIK) without recourse to the banks. However, in that case the risks would be borne by the potential
MBS investors. In view of the subsidized mortgage lending rates, yields on the MBSs may well be too
low to attract private investors. Hence, the MBSs would likely remain in the public sector (e.g. BOM,
government, or the Social Insurance Fund), giving rise to contingent liabilities.

The social objectives pursued by the programs (e.g. making housing more affordable) and efforts to address
supply bottlenecks to curb inflation would be best pursued through structural reforms and the government
budget. Loans should be transparently priced at market interest, with subsidies provided from the budget.

Box 3. The Monetary Policy Stance1
An analysis of exchange market pressures and Taylor-type rules suggests that the recent monetary easing
implemented through the stimulus programs discussed in Box 2 has been excessive and distortionary.
Monetary easing contributing to exchange market pressures.
During the first 9 months of 2013, the nominal exchange rate of the togrog depreciated by 19 percent, and gross
international reserves declined by 35 percent.

 The chart below shows a clear correlation between an index of exchange market pressures (EMP)2 and credit

growth. Specifically, the EMP index started to show sustained depreciation pressures after credit growth
accelerated from early 2012. Depreciation pressures intensified from early 2013 with the acceleration of credit
growth triggered by the BOM stimulus programs.

 A clear empirical association is found between developments in credit growth and reserve money growth on the
one hand and the path of the EMP index on the other hand. In particular, a one standard deviation increase in
reserve money is associated with an increase in the EMP index by 3½ standard deviations after about
5 months. Similarly, a one standard deviation increase in credit growth is associated with an increase in the
EMP index by 2 standard deviations after 6 months.

Mongolia-specific estimates of Taylor-type rules
indicate that the BOM’s monetary policy has been
accommodative in recent years. The BOM has
typically responded actively to overheating
pressures. However, the policy-rate responses to
rising inflationary pressures have been less forceful
than implied by the Taylor rule. In other words,
when inflation increased, real policy interest rates
have typically tended to fall.

Actual and Implied Interest Rates
Actural interest rate

The interest rates set by the BOM for the monetary stimulus programs deviate substantially from the levels
implied by Mongolia-specific estimates of Taylor-type rules. In particular, the interest rate implied by the
Taylor-type rule for Mongolia is about 11–12 percent in 2013Q3, while the interest rates charged by the BOM
on loans under the price stabilization program, mortgage program, and time deposits are around 1, 4, and
7 percent, respectively. The large deviation of BOM lending rates from the rate implied by the Taylor-rule is
likely to raise external, inflationary, and financial risks and distorts the signal of the BOM’s headline policy
rate.

Box 4. Exchange Rate Assessment1
Staff’s assessment based on the “strong policy scenario” is that the togrog is moderately overvalued despite the
recent real depreciation. This assessment underscores the importance of increased exchange rate flexibility—as
observed in the past four months—supported by tighter fiscal and monetary policy. Structural reforms aimed at
improving the business climate and trade integration should be pursued with a view to narrowing the mediumterm non-mining current account deficit. In the “weak policy scenario” the overvaluation would be considerably
higher.



Equilibrium exchange rate approach. The real
exchange rate of the togrog is 12 percent more
appreciated than the “equilibrium exchange rate”
determined on the basis of a panel regression on a
set of macroeconomic fundamentals, including net
foreign assets, relative productivity, terms of trade,
and government consumption.



External sustainability (ES) approach. The BOM
estimates that the FDI and portfolio inflows have
pushed Mongolia’s international investment position
(IIP) to a net liability position of 126 percent of GDP
in 2012. Only a 1 percent real depreciation of the
togrog would be needed to stabilize Mongolia’s IIP
at this low level. Over time, as Mongolia moves
through the mining investment cycle, its IIP can be
expected to improve. In that case, the estimated
overvaluation of the togrog according to the ES
approach can be expected to rise.

Box 5. Financial Soundness Indicators and Bank Stress Tests1
Financial soundness indicators improved in 2012
(Table 8). The capital adequacy ratio reached 16 percent
of risk-weighted assets at the end of 2012, and Tier 1
capital rose to more than 11 percent. NPLs (including
past due loans) declined to 3.8 percent of total loans.
However, banking sector vulnerabilities remain
significant. Bank credit remains highly concentrated in a
few sectors. Unlike in many other Asian countries which
have been strengthening their rules and regulations for
provisioning, provisioning requirements for performing
loans remain zero in Mongolia. On the back of the
BOM’s stimulus programs, the loan-to-deposit ratio has
surged beyond levels seen in Mongolia’s Asian peers.
Dollarization remains higher than in most other Asian
countries, potentially giving rise to foreign currency
mismatches in the non-bank private sector.
Stress tests illustrate prevailing credit risk. As
expected, tentative stress tests on bank-by-bank data for
general credit risk, sectoral concentration risk and large
exposure risk suggest that the banking system would be
substantially affected by shocks related to these risks. In
a severe stress scenario, simulating the effect of a broadbased shock to credit quality similar to 2008/09,
15 percent of performing loans deteriorate to
substandard, 15 percent of substandard loans
downgrade to doubtful, 25 percent of doubtful loans
deteriorate to loss, and five percent of performing loans
deteriorate to loss. In this scenario, two of the 14 banks
become insolvent and four others banks see their CAR
fall below 8 percent, implying substantial recapitalization
needs.

of deposits on the fifth day, all banks continue to
observe the 25 percent minimum liquidity ratio. In a severe scenario similar to the experience in 2008/09 with
the daily deposit withdrawal rising to 20 percent of total deposits, one small bank becomes illiquid.



In a scenario with a 20 percent depreciation of the togrog vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, one small bank sees its
capital reduced below the minimum requirement. One small bank and one large bank would need such a
recapitalization in case of a 50 percent depreciation. It should be noted that the latter two scenarios do not
incorporate the potential indirect impact of the depreciation on loan quality through balance sheet effects
affecting unhedged foreign currency borrowers.

*/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view
of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff's subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline ("low" is meant to
indicate a probability below 10 percent, "medium" a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and "high" a probability of 30 percent or more). The
RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities.

Appendix II. Mongolia’s New Fiscal Framework
Anchored by the Fiscal Stability Law 1 2
A.

Background to the Adoption of the Fiscal Stability Law (FSL)

The mining sector’s share of Mongolia’s export earnings increased from about 55 percent in
the early 2000s to 84 percent in 2008, and was expected to increase further with the imminent
development of large untapped copper and coal deposits. Mining also contributed about
31 percent of total government revenues in 2008, with a further increase expected over the medium
term. On this basis, many Mongolians expected the country’s mineral wealth to quickly lead to
lasting economic prosperity.
However, the global financial crisis was associated with an abrupt end to the global
commodity boom, causing the price of copper—Mongolia’s primary export—to decline by
70 percent from its July 2008 peak. The resulting decline in exports and the government’s mineral
revenues weighed heavily on the economy and opened up large deficits in both fiscal and external
accounts, heightening the risk of a disruptive contraction in economic activity. The macroeconomic
policy framework was not robust enough to withstand an external shock of this magnitude.
Government spending had expanded with the rise in mineral revenues, pushing the non-mineral
deficit to nearly 10 percent of GDP in 2007; there was no ready replacement for a shortfall in mineral
revenues.
Mongolia reformulated its framework for the management of mineral revenues in light of the
lessons from the 2008/09 crisis and in anticipation of the Oyu Tolgoi (OT) project coming on
stream. A FSL setting new fiscal rules and a stabilization (and savings) fund was approved by
Mongolia’s Parliament in 2010. The FSL benefitted from technical assistance (TA) from various
partners, including the Fund. However, as described below, some provisions in the final version of
the law deviated from their advice.

B.

Objectives of the FSL

The main objective of the FSL is to improve fiscal discipline and stability. The FSL aims to
dampen the macroeconomic effects of mineral price fluctuations by smoothing spending (insulating
the fiscal spending path from fluctuations in mineral revenue) in order to improve management of
macroeconomic demand. The law imposes fiscal discipline to avoid the temptation to spend mineral
revenue immediately and supports a stability-oriented fiscal policy. The FSL also aims to address a
potentially large increase in revenue from copper and/or coal production when large mining
projects mature, which, unless carefully managed, would infuse considerable additional demand into
the economy.

In addition to numerical rules, the FSL also incorporates procedural and transparency reforms
to strengthen budget discipline. For example, the law specifies that decisions on fiscal policy must
be taken first within a medium-term fiscal framework. The budget is then decided on within the
approved framework. The fact that amendments to the FSL require a two-thirds parliamentary
majority signals that the authorities are fully committed to the rules-based approach.

C.

Fiscal Rules in the FSL

The FSL put in place three complementary fiscal rules to function together to ensure fiscal
discipline:


A ceiling on the structural deficit of 2 percent of GDP (effective from 2013);



A ceiling on expenditure growth linked to the rate of growth of non-mineral GDP (effective
from 2013); and



A public debt ceiling of 40 percent of nominal GDP (in net present value (NPV) terms, effective
from 2014).

The main fiscal rule targets a “structural” balance. The structural balance is defined as the
difference between “structural” revenues and overall expenditures. Structural revenues are defined
as revenues that would be received if the prices of major minerals3 were at a particular level, defined
as a 16-year moving average of mineral prices.4 The use of structural revenues helps to insulate
spending plans from revenue fluctuations caused by short-term changes in prices. Originally, a zero
or positive target was recommended to allow the build-up of stabilization buffers and reduce debtto-GDP ratios. However, the political process led to the approval of a 2 percent of GDP deficit target.
Based on medium- to long-term simulations, that deficit target was deemed appropriate assuming
Mongolia’s future borrowing strategy relies mostly on concessional borrowing to ensure
stabilization of the debt-to-GDP and debt service ratios.
By restricting the maximum expansion of expenditures in any given year, the expenditure rule
functions as a secondary check for managing macroeconomic demand. The rule constrains total
expenditure growth to a rate consistent with the economy’s capacity to absorb the spending
without triggering a surge in inflation or an overshooting of the real exchange rate. This rule is a
critical complement to the structural (price-based) rule because of potentially substantial increases
in total mineral revenue as large mining projects like OT mature. In the FSL, the expenditure growth
ceiling is the greater of the current year’s nominal non-mineral GDP growth rate, and the 12-year
moving average of nominal non-mineral GDP growth. This rule does not distinguish between
current and capital expenditures.

3

Major minerals are the ones that generate revenues of at least 3 percent of total revenues. Copper and coal have
been classified as major minerals through 2013.

4

This comprised actual prices of the past 12 years and projected prices for the current year and the next 3 years. This
unusually long period was adopted on the political economy grounds of prudence. However, the use of a formula
that looks back a long time may lead to major forecast errors and long periods of undershooting or overshooting of
actual prices, which could eventually undermine the credibility of the rule.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONGOLIA

The gross debt rule is a secondary constraint to ensure that policy under the fiscal rules is
consistent with keeping debt sustainable. The primary guarantor of debt sustainability is the
choice of the structural balance target itself, which determines the required financing and thereby
the trajectory of public debt. The gross debt rule is a transparent, though indirect, anchor for fiscal
policy by implicitly limiting the maximum deficit the structural balance rule can target. The NPV of
public debt should be no greater than 40 percent of nominal GDP, and the coverage of public debt
includes all the types of financial obligations (including government guarantees) of fully and partly
state-owned legal entities. This provision takes effect in 2014. In the interim, to account for expected
debt dynamics, the FSL sets ceilings of 50 percent of GDP in 2011, 60 percent in 2012, and
50 percent in 2013.
A further consideration is that fiscal rules have to strike a balance between economic
strictness and political reality. Too strict and they risk breaking down due to political pressures;
too lax and they provide no benefits to the economy. To ensure some inherent flexibility in the rules,
the FSL foresees recalibrating the main fiscal target (the structural balance) every four years at the
beginning of a new government term. The law also has an escape clause in case of national
emergencies or economic crises.
A simulation in 2009 illustrated how fiscal indicators would have behaved for 2000–10 if the
fiscal framework had been constrained by both a structural balance rule and an expenditure
growth rule. The simulation implied substantive smoothing for both mineral revenue and
expenditure due to the structural balance rule, which stabilizes fiscal policy even when mineral prices
are very volatile. The expenditure rule was binding only occasionally because the price smoothing
built into the structural balance rule was already very effective in limiting the effect of mineral price
volatility on expenditures.

D.

Fiscal Stability Fund (FSF)

The fiscal framework is supported by a stabilization fund for mineral revenue. When actual
mineral revenue exceeds structural mineral revenue, the difference has to be placed in the
stabilization fund. This applies even if there is an overall fiscal deficit, in which case the government
has to borrow to make the transfers into the stabilization fund. On the other hand, when structural
mineral revenue exceeds actual mineral revenue and there is an overall fiscal deficit, the fund can be
used to finance that deficit.
The FSF is maintained at an account in the Bank of Mongolia (BOM) in accordance with the
Law on Government Special Funds. The FSF balance is denominated in domestic currency and
does therefore not contribute to international reserves. It amounted to MNT 360 billion at end-May
2013, which is equivalent to about 2 percent of GDP. The BOM is asked by the same Law to manage
the FSF in order to ensure liquidity of the resources in the event of a withdrawal request, to mitigate
risks, and to invest the balances efficiently on the international financial market. The FSL stipulates
that no active management of FSF balances should occur until the balance reaches 10 percent of
GDP. The BOM has paid no interest on this account.

36

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONGOLIA

An arrangement has now been made which governs FSF. Under a Minister’s Order, the share of
mineral revenues that is to be distributed to the FSF is calculated twice a month. These new
procedures promote more efficient and timely cash transfers to the FSF. However, a specific
arrangement on the rule for withdrawals from the FSF is still lacking and no withdrawals have been
made to date. Withdrawals might be made in 2013 because the actual price of some minerals
(especially coal) has fallen below the structural price according to some measures.
The fund will also function as a savings account to build wealth for future generations. To
promote a minimum savings effort by the government, the FSL requires the fund to be greater than
5 percent of GDP from FY 2018 onward, with excesses invested with a longer-term perspective.
While there is no consensus yet within the government on withdrawal rules, the fund balance is
expected to be used mainly after the mineral reserves are depleted. However, this provision could
create inconsistencies among rules if a gap between actual and structural revenues is not high
enough to meet the 5 percent of GDP floor.

E.

Recent Developments

The FSL was a milestone in tackling the procyclicality of Mongolia’s fiscal policy, but there are
serious questions concerning its full implementation in 2013 and beyond. The governmentowned Development Bank of Mongolia (DBM), established in 2011, is used as an off-budget vehicle
for spending outside the constraints of the FSL. In March 2012 the DBM raised US$580 million
(5.5 percent of GDP) by issuing 5-year government-guaranteed bonds. Total government spending,
including spending by the DBM, increased by 73 percent in real terms between 2010 and 2012. This
caused the overall fiscal deficit (including DBM operations) to worsen to 10.9 percent of GDP and
added to pressures on domestic demand and non-mining imports. The approved 2013 budget
targets a structural deficit of 2 percent of GDP, in line with the FSL. However, the budget’s revenue
projections are overly ambitious, and DBM spending which could reach 9 percent of GDP in 2013 is
not included in the budget.
Other improvements in the structural underpinnings for fiscal policy have also suffered
setbacks:

The Integrated Budget Law (IBL) passed in December 2011 was aimed to help support fiscal
sustainability and implementation of the FSL by mandating that the budget meet the FSL’s
requirements and by spelling out sanctions if they are violated. The IBL also aimed to
strengthen capital budgeting, mandating that only projects that have gone through a proper
appraisal process be considered for financing. According to the IBL, all financing decisions are
then made by the Ministry of Finance (MOF), abiding by the good principle of the MOF as a
single point of control on such matters. However, in September 2012 the Ministry of Economic
Development (MED) was created and was put in charge of planning the capital budget. The
MED was instrumental in launching the December 2012 sovereign bond issuance, drawing up a
list of off-budget public investment projects, and channeling the bond proceeds through the
DBM to start implementing these projects outside the budget.

The Social Welfare Law approved in January 2012 implied a significant step forward in
efficiently fighting poverty by mandating a means-tested benefit to replace costly universal
cash transfers. However, in September 2012 universal child benefits were reintroduced.

The Way Forward

Political commitment to macroeconomic stability and the FSL will be key to resist expenditure
pressures. The FSL framework is comprehensive, focused on fiscal rules specifically tailored for
producers of nonrenewable resources, and supported by a resource fund. The combination of a
price-based rule and an expenditure growth limit is attractive in terms of public communication—
because of its focus on highly visible mineral prices—while also delinking public expenditure from
revenue volatility due to other factors (like the possibly large increase in mineral revenue over the
medium term, once the OT mine starts to make dividend payments to the budget). The start of a
new political cycle could provide a window of opportunity to return to stability-oriented
macroeconomic policies.
The establishment of a sovereign wealth fund (SWF) would be an important complement to
the FSL’s fiscal policy framework. The current fiscal architecture includes a fiscal stabilization fund
held at the central bank in which revenue from higher-than-structural copper and coal prices are
deposited. However, given the sizable fiscal deficits of the past few years, the 2 percent of GDP
currently deposited in this fund has been funded from government borrowing and no net wealth
has been accumulated. For the next few years, the priority should be to return the fiscal balance to
the path prescribed by the FSL. In the longer run, when revenue from mining rises, the FSL’s
structural deficit ceiling may need to be tightened to allow for a significant accumulation of net
financial assets in the SWF. This would be consistent with recommendations made when the FSL was
set up and with the policy advice included in the 2012 IMF Policy Paper on Macroeconomic Policy
Frameworks for Resource-Rich Developing Countries.

1/ Three complementary FSL limits:
(1) A ceiling on the ‘structural deficit’ of 2 percent of GDP (effective from 2013);
(2) A ceiling on expenditure growth (the greater between the average of the previous 11 year non-mineral growth rate and
the present year non-mineral GDP growth rate, effective from 2013);
(3) A public debt ceiling of 40 percent of nominal GDP (effective from 2014, but for the transitional period (2012−2013) 60
percent in 2012 and 50 percent in 2013).
2/ This assumes that the DBM will raise US$600 million in early 2014 and that these funds will not be spend in 2014, in the
context of an overall government policy to contain the growth of domestic demand (strong policy scenario).

Safeguards Assessments:
An update safeguards assessment of the Bank of Mongolia (BOM) finalized in June 2009
found that the BOM has continued to improve its safeguards framework since the previous
assessment. The BOM’s financial reporting and audit practices generally comply with
international standards. The assessment made recommendations to (i) strengthen certain
aspects of the BOM’s oversight mechanism, (ii) remove external audit qualifications caused
by lack of access to central bank’s vaults, and (iii) improve the timeliness of audit completion
and publication of the bank’s financial statements. The authorities have since confirmed that
the auditors were granted access to its vaults at end-2009 to end-2011, and the timing of
audit completion has improved.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONGOLIA

Exchange Arrangement:
On March 24, 2009, the BOM instituted a foreign exchange auction allowing the
determination of the exchange rate mainly by market forces. The de facto and de jure
exchange rate arrangements are currently both classified as floating.
Mongolia accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on February 1, 1996.
Mongolia maintains two multiple currency practices (MCPs) subject to Fund jurisdiction. First,
the modalities of the multi-price auction system give rise to an MCP since there is no
mechanism in place that ensures that exchange rates of accepted bids at the multi-price
auction do not deviate by more than 2 percent. The Executive Board approved the multiprice auction MCP until June 22, 2010 (Decision No. 14365 of June 23, 2009), and it’s further
extension until March 15, 2012 or the next Article IV consultation whichever is earlier
(Decision No. 14669 of June 23, 2010 and Decision No. 14365 of March 16, 2011). The MCP,
however, could not be resolved by March 15, 2012, and would be continued as long as the
multiple price foreign exchange auction mechanism remains in place. Therefore the MCP is
unapproved, and since the criteria for approval of this MCP are not in place, staff does not
recommend Executive Board approval of said measure. In addition, Mongolia has an official
exchange rate (reference rate) that is mandatorily used for government transactions (as
opposed to the commercial market rate). Therefore, by way of official action, the authorities
have created a market segmentation. While Order #699 of the BOM issued on
December 3, 2010, sets forth that the reference rate is determined based on the weighted
average of market rates used from 4 PM of the previous day to 4 PM of the current day, staff
is of the view that this Order does not eliminate the market segmentation and the multiplicity
of effective rates arising from it. Accordingly, in the absence of a mechanism to ensure that
the commercial rates and the reference rate do not deviate by more than 2 percent, the way
the reference rate is used in government transactions gives rise to an MCP subject to Fund
approval. Since the criteria for approval of this MCP are not in place, it remains unapproved.
Mongolia imposes exchange restrictions for security reasons in accordance with United
Nations Security Council Resolution No. 92/757 concerning certain transactions with the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) that have been notified to the Fund
under Decision 144 (11/4/94).
The BOM notes that hitherto there have been no cases where exchange rates of accepted
bids at the multi-price auction deviate by more than 2 percent, and plans to introduce a
mechanism to ensure the deviation would never exceed 2 percent. The BOM is also working
on the development of an indicative spot exchange rate.

Article IV Consultation:
The 2012 Article IV consultation (IMF Country Report No. 12/320) was concluded by the
Executive Board on November 16, 2012. Mongolia is on a 12–month cycle.

WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION
1.
The Bank and the Fund country teams maintain a close working relationship. The teams,
led by Ms. Chorching Goh (Lead Economist, EASPR) and Mr. Gerard Almekinders (Mission Chief)
collaborate on a range of macroeconomic and structural issues.
2.

Cooperation and coordination is exemplary. It pertains to the following:



IMF surveillance. World Bank staff participates in Policy Consultation Meetings ahead of
Article IV consultation missions and comments on staff reports. World Bank staff also
participates in selected meetings of the Article IV mission team with the authorities. This
facilitates the discussions, especially as regards policies in areas of mutual interest such as
bank restructuring, social welfare reform, and fiscal policy.



Development Policy Credits (DPC) and Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). In turn, Fund
staff participated in the design and review of the Bank’s DPCs and was kept informed about
the development of the Bank’s new CPS for FY13−17.



Banking system issues. Both country teams have been active in this area, including by
fielding technical assistance missions. The teams coordinate closely to provide the authorities
with consistent advice while avoiding unnecessary duplication of efforts. The two teams also
continue to educate the public and parliamentarians on banking sector issues in an effort to
build support for reforms.



Structural reforms. Staffs of the Fund and the World Bank have worked together
successfully to provide technical assistance in expenditure management, the Fiscal Stability
Law, the Integrated Budget Law, the Social Welfare Law, the Investment Law , and taxation of
the mineral sector and on-going work on the Sovereign Wealth Fund Law.

3.
Based on the close collaboration, the Bank and the Fund share a common view about
Mongolia’s macroeconomic and structural reform priorities. These include:


Promoting long-term growth. Managing the mineral wealth to ensure strong, sustainable,
and equitable growth with low inflation. This includes the importance of avoiding the
“resource curse” and the productive use of mineral wealth management.



Macro-economic stability. This includes ensuring that the boom-bust policies of the past
are not repeated. The Fiscal Stability Law adopted in 2010 with the support of the Fund and
the Bank is a key step, and it is critical that it be strictly adhered to from 2013, the first year
the law is effective. At the same time, fiscal policy also has to be mindful of the
macroeconomic policy mix and medium and long-term fiscal sustainability.



Monetary policy. The Bank of Mongolia (BOM)’s large monetary stimulus, through its socalled “price stabilization program,” mortgage program, and liquidity injection, distorts
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

MONGOLIA

markets and is bound to ratchet up inflation. The stimulus program should be phased out
and the BOM should focus on further strengthening the monetary policy framework. The
flexible exchange rate regime should be maintained.


Protecting the poor. The 2012 Social Welfare Law envisages replacing existing costly
universal cash transfers with means-tested benefits that would reach the poorest households.
Full implementation of the law would represent a big step forward in strengthening the
social safety net and increasing fiscal flexibility. Concrete action following the adoption of the
law is important from a socio-economic perspective as well as a fiscal perspective.



Strengthening the banking system. Key steps include continued improvement in bank
regulation and supervision, ramping up risk disclosure and management—especially given
elevated systemic risks in the sector illustrated by the recent failure of Saving Bank—and
strengthening the newly established Mongolian Deposit Insurance Corporation.

4.
The teams agreed to continue the close cooperation going forward. Table 1 details
the specific activities planned by the two country teams over the period September 2013–
August 2014 along with their expected deliveries. It was also agreed that further details on
collaboration, as necessary, would be agreed at the technical level as work progresses.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK1
Mongolia became a member of the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) in February 1991. The AsDB has
been Mongolia’s largest source of multilateral development finance for more than two decades and
since Mongolia joined AsDB, the country has received 50 sovereign loans totaling US$955 million,
12 Asian Development Fund (ADF) grants for US$172 million and Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction
grants for US$23.7 million.
In recognition of its sound economic performance and higher credit worthiness, in 2011 Mongolia
gained access to AsDB’s ordinary capital resources (OCR), alongside AsDB’s concessional lending
from ADF. Given its AAA credit rating, AsDB makes funding available for development projects on
favorable terms. This change was welcomed by the Government of Mongolia as large amounts of
capital are needed to finance infrastructure investments and the improvement of social services.
In the past, AsDB provided financial, technical and policy support in areas ranging from urban
infrastructure, agriculture, energy, finance, education, health, to social protection and transport. AsDB
has also provided private sector financing for commercial banks and supported trade through its
Trade Finance Program.
The Mongolia Country Partnership Strategy 2012−16 was approved by AsDB’s board in April 2012,
which is formulated in line with the National Development Strategy of Mongolia, with the focus on
employment creation and support for economic diversification. AsDB’s investments are prioritizing (i)
transport, energy, and water supply infrastructure; (ii) access to education and health; and (iii)
regional economic cooperation in order to support sustainable and inclusive growth of economy.
In response to the change in government, after general elections in June 2012 and its priorities, a
number of adjustments have been made to the lending and non-lending programs of AsDB. To
reflect those new priorities in its operations, ADB is reviewing the current CPS and formulating new
COBP for 2014−2016. For 2013, AsDB will provide loans for US$172.5 million and US$42.5 million
from OCR and ADF funding sources, respectively. In addition, technical assistance worth
US$7.9 million will be provided.
AsDB’s operations will concentrate on the following sectors in the following years:
Transport. Transport is the largest sector of AsDB operations in Mongolia. AsDB is financing
construction of the country’s two main international road corridors, one in the east and the other in
the west. These projects are also included as priority corridors under the Central Asia Regional
Economic Cooperation (CAREC). Under the CAREC program, Mongolia is harmonizing cross-border
transport procedures, and developing mentioned key economic corridors, linking to its neighboring
economies. AsDB is also considering to develop a public transport system for Ulaanbaatar (UB), and

supporting the construction of logistics infrastructure and systems in Zamyn-Uud at the border to
the People’s Republic of China.
Urban Development. AsDB is helping to improve living conditions and greater access to basic
services, including water, sanitation, and heating, of the poor people in urban areas, including
secondary towns in the mineral-rich Gobi area, where communities are coping with a large
population influx in response to new mining operations. AsDB is planning to extend basic urban
infrastructure and construct socio-economic facilities in peri-urban area of the UB city, home of
nearly half of the population, to upgrade existing sub-centers for improved economic, housing, and
employment opportunities, and reduced environmental pollution.
Energy. Insufficient and unreliable power and heating are becoming bottlenecks to growth and
threaten livelihoods. AsDB is improving energy efficiency and capacity in UB, through the country’s
first major public–private partnership in constructing a new energy efficient combined heating and
power plant in UB with proper emission reduction equipment. AsDB has been piloting the
application of renewable energies, and is supporting Mongolia to access multilateral climate change
funds.
Education. AsDB has supported the government’s efforts to reform and develop the education
system in all the subsectors (pre-primary, primary, secondary, tertiary, technical and vocational
education and training). To meet pressing labor market demands, AsDB is currently supporting
reform of higher education and considering to help modernize vocational training.
Health and Social Protection. AsDB has made major investments to improve primary health services
and is supporting policy reforms and investments in the hospital sector, drug and blood safety and
hospitals hygiene. AsDB assisted the government in introduction of proxy means testing to target
the poor, cancellation of several universal benefits, introduction of the food stamp program as the
first poverty-targeted benefit in the country, and passage of the amended Social Welfare Law in
January 2012 that legalized the reforms. AsDB will continue to support the efficiency and
transparency of the delivery of social welfare and insurance services, through strengthened policy,
systems and information technology.
In addition to above priority areas, AsDB is focusing on improved access to finance and economic
diversification through support to the agribusinesses, in the fields of dairy, cashmere, carpet, meat
and food production, to develop Mongolian brands and generate employment.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of October 7, 2013

I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision to the Fund is broadly adequate for surveillance. The priority areas for improvement are
national accounts and government finance statistics.
National Accounts: The national accounts statistics compiled by the National Statistics Office (NSO) are broadly in
line with the guidelines of the 1993 SNA. They have improved the quality of national accounts data, but weaknesses
remain, including in the estimation of capital formation, estimation of GDP price deflators, and coverage of the
informal sector and small-scale activity (especially in the services sector). The compilation of constant price
expenditure-based national accounts, in line with the pilot done in 2008, would serve as a useful check for the
production side estimates. NSO disseminates both annual and quarterly expenditure-based GDP series both in value
terms and in real terms.
Price Statistics: The consumer price index (CPI) was rebased in January 2008 with expenditure-derived weights from
the 2005 Household Income and Expenditure Survey. NSO has published a national CPI for Ulaanbaatar and 21
aimags (provinces) since January 2008, and a housing price index since October 2008. Priority areas for improvement
are data on wages and earnings. NSO plans to disseminate a producer price index and a retail price index in 2013.
External Sector Statistics: The Bank of Mongolia (BOM) follows the concepts and methods in the Balance of
Payment Manual fifth edition and is expected to begin implementing the recommendations of the sixth edition of
the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6) in 2012. The BOM disseminates the
data according to the IMF standard presentation table. The coverage of the balance of payments statistics has been
broadened by extending the International Transaction Reporting System (ITRS) to nonbank financial institutions and
by increasing the number of direct reporting private enterprises. Priorities for improvement are in the analysis of
balance of payments and the quarterly survey of foreign investment enterprises. The BOM compiled an experimental
International Investment Position (IIP) for 2007, and started to publish IIP in 2011 covering data from 2010.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: BOM’s monetary and financial statistics conform to the concepts and definitions
of the MFSM methodology as the authorities implemented recommendations of the latest MFS missions. In
particular, the monetary data were improved by the proper classification of repurchase agreements, accrued interest,
and financial derivatives. The coverage of monetary statistics was expanded beginning in February 2010 to include
data of Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SCCs) that collect deposits and since May 2010 data for some other
financial corporations (OFIs) have been disseminated in the BOM monthly statistical bulletin. The September 2009
mission provided recommendations to reconcile the BOM and the Ministry of Finance data on government financing,
and finalized the standardized report forms for the data of the BOM and other depository corporations in
International Financial Statistics beginning in November 2009. The July/August 2011 mission discussed the quality of
data of the nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), insurance companies, and securities companies that are reported
to the Financial Regulatory Commission (FRC) and recommended their use in the compilation of monetary statistics.
However, due to insufficient coordination among various agencies, this recommendation has not been implemented.
Government Finance Statistics: Currently, the concepts, classifications, and definitions used to compile sub-annual
and annual fiscal statistics reported to the Fund fiscal statistics generally follow the guidelines of the GFSM 1986.
While no formal decision has yet been taken on adopting a migration path to the GFSM 2001 methodology,
Mongolia also compiles annual GFSM 2001-based Statement of government Operations, Statement of Sources and
Uses of cash, and a complete balance sheet for the consolidated general government. Data on external borrowing by
the Development Bank of Mongolia (DBM) is included in external public debt. However, data on DBM spending is
not reported systematically.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Mongolia participates in the General Data
A data ROSC mission visited Mongolia in September 2007 to
Dissemination System (GDDS), and maintains its
update the May 2000 assessment of the macroeconomic
efforts to subscribe the Special Data
statistics, complemented by an assessment of data quality based
Dissemination Standards (SDDS).
on the IMF’s Data Quality Assessment Framework. The report
was published in April 2008.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By
Markus Rodlauer and
Masato Miyazaki (IMF)
and Jeffrey Lewis and
Sudhir Shetty (IDA)

The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) has been prepared
jointly by IMF and World Bank staff, in consultation with the
authorities and the Asian Development Bank (AsDB), using
the debt sustainability framework for low-income countries
approved by the Boards of both institutions.

This year’s debt sustainability analysis (DSA) concludes that Mongolia faces a moderate risk
of debt distress. The DSAs prepared in recent years concluded that Mongolia’s risk of debt
distress was low.1 However, the large international bond issuances by the Development Bank
of Mongolia (DBM) and the sovereign have pushed up Mongolia’s public and publiclyguaranteed external debt. Moreover, the near and medium-term outlook for the balance of
payments has deteriorated owing to negative shocks to FDI and coal exports and
expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. As a result, even in a “strong policy scenario,”
which is used as the baseline scenario in this DSA and which would require the authorities to
tighten policies substantially from the current macroeconomic policy stance, Mongolia’s
present value of external debt-to-GDP ratio and debt-service-to-revenue ratio breach the
relevant policy-dependent indicative threshold in certain years.2 Some other debt-burden
indicators breach the thresholds when standard stress tests are applied. Moreover, debt and
debt-burden indicators would be even more unfavorable under an alternative “weak policy
scenario,” which assumes a continuation of current expansionary macroeconomic policies.
Under this “weak policy scenario,” Mongolia would need to be re-classified to a “high risk of
debt distress.”

1

This DSA is based on end-2012 debt data. The fiscal year for Mongolia is January–December. The 2012 DSA (see IMF
Country Report No. 12/320) was based on end-2011 debt data.
2

The low-income country debt sustainability framework (LIC DSF) recognizes that better policies and institutions
allow countries to manage higher levels of debt, and thus the threshold levels are policy-dependent. Mongolia’s
policies and institutions, as measured by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), place it
as a “medium performer”, with an average rating of 3.44 during 2010-12. The relevant indicative thresholds for this
category are: 40 percent for the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio, 150 percent for the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio,
250 percent for the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio, 20 percent for the debt service-to-exports ratio, and 20 percent for
the debt service-to-revenue ratio. These thresholds are applicable to public and publicly guaranteed external debt.

MONGOLIA

A. Background
1.
This DSA is built on baseline medium-term macroeconomic projections which assume
that the authorities tighten policies substantially from the current policy stance. Medium-term
prospects remain promising given Mongolia’s large natural resource endowment, but macroeconomic policies are currently on an unsustainable path. Negative shocks to FDI and coal exports
are compounding balance of payments (BOP) pressures caused by expansionary fiscal and monetary
policies. As a result, central bank reserves have been on a declining path and the exchange rate has
depreciated by about 22 percent over the past year. Continuation of current policies could lead to a
highly vulnerable situation. The important policy decisions facing the authorities are highlighted by a
comparison of a “strong policy scenario” with a “weak policy scenario” (see text table on page 7 and
Box 1). The “strong policy scenario” illustrates the substantial tightening of fiscal and monetary policy
needed to bring the economy back on a sustainable track. This tightening is not yet in hand and the
implications of the continuation of current policies are clearly illustrated in this DSA. Nevertheless, in
view of some steps that have recently been taken, the “strong policy scenario” is used as the baseline
scenario in this DSA. For instance, the authorities announced plans to reduce spending from
the 2013 budget by almost MNT 1 trillion (about 6 percent of GDP) so as to stay within the FSL’s
2 percent of GDP ceiling for the structural fiscal deficit for on-budget fiscal operations. Moreover, the
pace of spending by the Development Bank of Mongolia (DBM) will be slowed during the last
quarter of 2013. With regard to monetary policy, the Bank of Mongolia is discussing plans to unwind
some of the monetary stimulus provided during the first half of 2013.
2.
Compared to the previous DSA, public and publicly guaranteed external debt is on a
higher path, reflecting for the most part the additional sovereign borrowing contracted at the
end of 2012 (Box 2):


The face value of public external debt3 is now projected to amount to 51.8 percent of GDP
in 2013, up from 30 percent of GDP in the previous DSA. The higher public external debt
ratio is mostly accounted for by sovereign borrowing (15 percent of GDP in 2012), foreign
borrowing by the BOM (7 percent of GDP over the past 2 years) and the US$-value of GDP
being 7 percent lower than projected in the previous DSA.



The 18 percentage points of GDP projected decline in the face value of public external debt
over the next five years is substantially larger than the 5½ percentage points of GDP decline
projected in the previous DSA. This reflects the assumption in the strong policy scenario that
underlies this DSA that foreign borrowing will be reduced considerably in view of the sharp
rise in Mongolia’s external debt in the past two years and the less benign outlook for frontier
emerging market economies’ access to international capital markets.

3.
Compared to the previous DSA, the main features of the current macroeconomic
framework can be summarized as follows:
3

Consistent with the Staff Guidance Note, public external debt in this DSA includes government loans from bilateral
and multilateral creditors, sovereign bonds, bonds issued by the Development Bank, and foreign borrowing by the
central bank of Mongolia (BOM).



GDP growth is projected to average 8 percent per annum over the medium term (2013−18),
compared to 12 percent in the previous DSA. Projections for the nonmining sector have not
changed materially from the previous DSA, while the mining output projections have been
adjusted downward, reflecting weakening external demand and updated data on production
schedules by major mining companies. Moreover, the second stage of the Oyu Togoi has
been postponed, which would also affect mining output over the medium term. As such,
mining sector growth is projected to average 12 percent per annum during 2013–18,
compared to 20 percent per annum in the previous DSA, and is expected to slow gradually
over the long run, with annual average growth decelerating to 3.5 percent. Nonmining
growth is projected to decline to 5 percent in 2014 reflecting the tightening of macroeconomic policies in the “strong policy scenario” before recovering gradually to 7 percent
over the medium term, averaging about 7.3 percent per annum in 2013–18, a level similar to
that of the previous DSA.



Inflation is projected to rise above 10 percent by end-2013 and remain there until late 2014
on the back of the ongoing acceleration of credit growth and the exchange rate depreciation
of the past year. Over the medium and long term, with monetary tightening and fiscal
consolidation, inflation is projected to decelerate to about 5 percent. The trajectory of
inflation moderation is similar to the previous DSA.



The external current account is expected to remain weak despite the start of production at
the Oyu Tolgoi mine and increased exports by the Tavan Tolgoi. The current account deficit
in relation to GDP is expected to narrow to about 15 percent in 2018 from 33 percent
in 2012, reflecting increased mining exports and reduced mining-related imports largely
associated with moderating FDI inflows. This contrasts with the projection of the previous
DSA that envisages a current account surplus in 2018.



The copper and coal price projections through 2018 are based on the WEO projections as of
August 2013. These prices are assumed to remain constant in real terms in the years
beyond 2018.



The on-budget fiscal operations are assumed to be tightened considerably to observe the
FSL starting with the 2014 budget. The off-budget program of public investment projects is
assumed to be phased out by the end of 2015. While this would represent a tightening from
current policies it represents a loosening from the previous DSA which assumed that the
consolidated fiscal deficit would be brought in line with the FSL from 2013.



The previous DSA did not foresee the large size of Mongolia’s maiden sovereign bond
issuance (15 percent of GDP). Therefore, the spikes in the debt service to exports ratio and
debt service to revenue ratio in 2017 and 2022 are new in this DSA. This DSA assumes that
the 5-year bond and 10-year bond are rolled over.



The authorities have announced that they are working on the issuance of a US$600 million
(5½ percent of GDP) Samurai bond. The DSA assumes that this issuance will be completed
in 2014.

A joint IMF-World Bank mission visited Mongolia in April 2013 to help the authorities
improve the process of developing and implementing an effective Medium-Term Debt
Management Strategy (MTDS). The mission held a workshop on the MTDS toolkit, aimed at
enhancing a common understanding of the design and implementation of an MTDS. The mission
delivered presentations on quantification of cost and risk under alternative debt strategies, and the
MTDS analytical tool. The workshop was attended by participants from the Ministry of Finance,
Ministry of Economic Development and Bank of Mongolia.

5.

The current institutional set-up for debt management harbors important weaknesses.
An MTDS strategy document for 2012–14 was published by the Ministry of Finance in 2012, following
a 2011 baseline MTDS mission by the World Bank. The strategy envisaged developing domestic debt
markets and reducing external debt with high market risk. However, the large international bond
issuance in late 2012 demonstrated the need to revisit debt management in Mongolia. The debt
transaction was undertaken under the leadership of the Ministry of Economic Development with
limited reference to the medium-term debt management strategy and insufficient involvement of the
Ministry of Finance. This underscores the importance of ensuring that all debt management decisions
are taken within the framework of an agreed and published medium-term debt management
strategy.
6.
While the issuance of international bonds was successful from a market perspective, its
size and structure has substantially changed the cost and risk profile of public debt. After the
issuance, the share of FX-denominated debt increased to 77 percent and substantial refinancing risks
have emerged in 2017 and 2022 (about US$ 1 billion repayment is due in both of these years).
Despite strong export receipts, with the economy highly vulnerable to commodity price swings,
downside risks are large.
7.
Strengthening the capacity for domestic financing could help lower the risk profile of
debt, by developing a deeper domestic debt market. Over the last year, the authorities have
made progress in increasing the size of the domestic debt market. The auctioning of treasury bills
was modernized in late-2012. Since then, the outstanding stock of T-bills has risen by 4 percent of
GDP. However, demand for government securities in the primary market is still limited to a few
domestic banks and investor appetite for longer-dated government debt is uncertain.

B. Debt Sustainability
External DSA

The focus of the DSA is on public and publicly-guaranteed external debt. However, private sector external debt is
estimated at 85 percent of GDP in 2012. To the extent that this debt has floating interest rates, debt service
obligations could rise in the period ahead as advanced economies are getting ready to exit from the very supportive
monetary policies implemented in recent years. Similarly, rolling over this debt could become more difficult.

indicators breach the thresholds when standard stress tests are applied. The main results of the
external DSA are as follows:


The present value of debt in relation to GDP, exports, and revenue are expected to
decline over the 20-year projection period in the strong policy scenario that underlies
this DSA (Figure 1, Table 1). During the projection period, the PV of the debt-to-GDP ratio
decreases from 43 percent in 2013 to about 17½ percent in 2033. However, it is projected to
remain above the indicative threshold of 40 percent through 2014. The PV of the debt-toexports ratio is projected to decrease from around 96¼ percent in 2013 to 38 percent in 2033
(compared to an indicative threshold of 150 percent). The PV of the debt-to-revenue ratio is
expected to decline from 125¼ percent in 2013 to 56¾ percent in 2033, compared to an
indicative threshold of 250 percent.



The debt service to export ratio and debt service to revenue ratio would be high in 2017
and 2022. The debt service-to-export ratio would remain mostly below 10 percent in the next
two decades, but would reach 17¾ percent and 13½ percent in 2017 and 2022, respectively.
Similarly, the debt service-to-revenue ratio would largely stay around 10–15 percent, but
would breach the indicative threshold of 20 percent in 2017 and 2022.



The standard stress tests reveal an important vulnerability to exchange rate and export
shocks (Figure 1, Table 2). The standard exchange rate shock causes a prolonged breach of
the threshold by the PV of the debt to GDP ratio. The standard export shock causes the PV of
the debt-to-exports ratio as well as the two debt service indicators to stay above relevant
thresholds. This underscores the importance of restraint in borrowing internationally.



The standard “historical scenario” does not seem to represent a relevant comparator.
According to the way the historical scenario is set up in the standard DSA template, the
relatively low FDI projections for the next few years (13 percent of GDP on average for the
next 6 years) are replaced with the relatively high FDI inflows observed on average over the
past ten years (21.8 percent of GDP, see Table 3a). As a consequence, in this scenario the need
to contract new debt is lower and the external debt-to-GDP ratio rapidly declines to zero.

Public DSA
9.
In the strong policy scenario which is used as the baseline in this DSA, the PV of public
debt-to-GDP ratio peaks at 58½ percent of GDP in 2013 and then falls gradually over the
medium term to 44¾ percent of GDP in 2018 before stabilizing at about 39 percent of GDP
over the long run (Table 3). The alternative scenarios and bound tests indicate that the projected
paths of debt indicators are sensitive to alternative assumptions (Table 4 and Figure 2). In particular,
the scenario in which the primary balance is fixed at the level projected for 2013 illustrates the
steadily rising trend of the PV of debt-GDP ratio (from 58½ percent in 2013 to 240 percent in 2033).
This underscores the unsustainability of the government’s current fiscal policy and the need to follow
the consolidation path laid out in the strong policy scenario. In this regard, it should be noted that
the strong policy scenario used as the baseline in this DSA produces broadly the same outcomes as
the historical scenario in the public DSA. In a way this illustrates that the strong policy scenario is

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

MONGOLIA

broadly in line with the average fiscal outcomes in Mongolia over the past 10 years and hence
should not be regarded as unachievable.

External DSA and Public DSA in a Weak Policy Scenario
10.
External and Public DSAs were also ran for the case in which a weak policy scenario is
used as the baseline. Under the weak policy scenario, continued expansionary policies would cause
reserves to be drained in 2015 together with a sharp depreciation of 30–40 percent from end-2013.
Subsequently, a large absorption adjustment is inevitable, with an output loss of 15–20 percent over
the medium term compared to the strong policy scenario.
11.
Under the weak policy scenario, Mongolia would need to be reclassified to being at
“high risk of debt distress.” Figure 1 illustrates that the PV of the debt-to-GDP ratio would
generally remain above the indicative threshold of 40 percent throughout the 20-year projection
period. Moreover, the PV of debt service to revenue ratio would breach the threshold in 2017 and
from 2021 onwards.

C. Authorities' View
12.
The authorities broadly concurred with the overall assessment of the DebtSustainability Analysis, but made several important observations. First, they did not rule out
another international bond issuance in the next couple of years in addition to the Samurai bond they
plan to issue in the near term. They pointed out that the current medium-term fiscal framework
envisages additional international bond issuances of up to US$3.5 billion (32 percent of GDP)
by 2015. The authorities expected that the approval of the new Investment Law, by creating
favorable conditions for FDI inflows, would reduce the need for government borrowing to support
growth. As a result, they expected the risk of debt distress to decline over the medium term.

D. Conclusion
In the staffs’ view, Mongolia now faces a moderate risk of debt distress provided a strong
policy scenario is implemented. In a weak-policy scenario, which illustrates the risks of a
continuation of current policies, vulnerabilities would increase and Mongolia would need to be
reclassified to being at a ”high risk of debt distress.” The overall medium- to long-term economic
outlook is favorable given Mongolia’s large natural resource endowments, but macroeconomic
policies have been on an unsustainable path. Even in a “strong policy scenario,” which would require
the authorities to tighten policies substantially from the current policy stance, Mongolia’s present
value of external debt to GDP ratio breaches the relevant policy-dependent indicative threshold
through 2014, and the debt service-to-revenue ratio breaches the indicative threshold in 2017
and 2022. Some other debt-burden indicators breach the thresholds when standard stress tests are
applied.

Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions: Strong vs. Weak Policy Scenario
In the “strong policy scenario”, a tightening of fiscal and monetary policies would help relieve
BOP pressure and enhance debt sustainability. The monetary stimulus launched by the BOM
since late-2012 would be phased out by mid-2014. The budget framework would be brought in line
with the FSL over the medium term. On-budget fiscal operations would observe the FSL starting
in 2014. The overall fiscal balance, including DBM operations, would be put on a credible mediumterm consolidation path. In view of the prevailing BOP pressures the fiscal adjustment would be
frontloaded. Accordingly, in the “strong policy scenario” the off-budget program of public
investment projects, which was initiated in 2012 and was quickly ramped up in 2013, is phased out
by the end of 2015.


It is assumed that mining sector growth is not materially affected by macroeconomic policies,
while nonmining growth is projected to decline to 5 percent in 2014 due to the tightening of
macroeconomic policies, and recover to 7 percent over the medium-term.



Reflecting the large exchange rate depreciation of the past year, inflation would rise and remain
in low double-digits through late-2014. It would gradually decline to 5 percent over the medium
term.



The balance of payments’ current account deficit would narrow to 15 percent of GDP by 2018
due to rising commodity exports and moderating imports, the latter reflecting slowing FDI
inflows.

The weak policy scenario illustrates the risks of a continuation of current policies. In this
scenario, it takes the government two more years to bring on-budget fiscal operations in line with
the FSL. In addition, the government continues to pursue its development strategy through the
implementation of off-budget public investment projects. The BOM’s stimulus measures are phased
out only gradually. In this scenario, nonmining growth in 2014 would be higher than in the strong
policy scenario. However, the inevitable large adjustment of absorption would cause a cumulative
nonmining output loss of about 20 percentage points compared to the strong policy scenario over a
4-year horizon (calibrated on cross-country experiences summarized in IMF WP/08/224 and the IMF
Board Paper on “Assessing Reserve Adequacy”). The larger exchange rate depreciation (compared to
the “strong policy scenario”) would add to inflationary pressures.


It is assumed that mining sector growth is the same as in the strong policy scenario, while
nonmining growth is projected to reach 8 percent in 2014, boosted by looser macroeconomic
policies. However, nonmining growth would slump to -5 percent in 2015 as the large absorption
adjustment unfolds. By 2018, nonmining growth would recover to 1 percent.



Reflecting the larger exchange rate depreciation, inflation would be around 3–4 percentage
points higher than in the strong policy scenario. Over the medium term, the inflation rate would
converge to 5½ percent.



The large absorption adjustment and exchange rate depreciation would help BOP adjustment.
Accordingly, the current account deficit would narrow to 9 percent of GDP by 2018, compared
to 15 percent in the strong policy scenario.

Box 2. The Structure of Public Debt
Mongolia’s stock of public and publicly-guaranteed external debt had a face value of US$4.8 billion
(48.3 percent of GDP) at end-2012. The external debt more than doubled, from US$2.2 billion at end2011, owing to the large borrowing by the sovereign, the DBM, and the BOM. The share of Mongolia’s
external public debt owed to multilateral creditors on concessional terms, declined from 56 percent in 2011
to 25 percent of total external debt in 2012. Private external debt is also significant. It mainly reflects
intercompany lending for mining projects, including by the Rio Tinto/Ivanhoe mining conglomerate, to
finance the development of the OT copper and gold mine.
Domestic public debt amounted to 14.7 percent of GDP at end-2012, up from 10.9 percent in the
previous year.

The MNT 849 billion increase in
domestic public debt in 2012 mainly reflects
the issuance of government paper to finance
the large government deficit in 2012. The
sovereign bond issued in late-2012 was not
used to finance the deficit that year.

To preserve consistency between
debt stocks and flows of deficit financing,
some government paper issued during the
first quarter of 2013 is also included in the
end-2012 stock of government bonds (MNT
1,280 billion). In particular, Treasury bills were
issued to settle government spending carried
over from the 2012 budget (MNT 191 billion)
and to settle the end-2012 overdraft of the
Treasury Single Account (MNT 79 billion).

Unlike the previous DSAs, this DSA
does not include government borrowing
from the OT company to finance its
34 percent equity share in the mine. There
are several reasons for this. First, the amount
of this debt is under discussion and no
officially confirmed estimate is available.
Second, the government’s investment share
in the OT mining project will be repaid from
expected dividends and the government will
not be liable for the loan in the event that
dividends are insufficient.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assumingan offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Press Release No. 13/526
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

December 18, 2013
IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Mongolia
On November 15, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
2013 Article IV Consultation1 with Mongolia.
Mongolia continues to be one of the fastest growing economies in the world. The economy
expanded by 12½ percent in 2012 and by 11½ percent in the first half of 2013. Growth has been
buoyed by a relatively mild winter boosting agriculture and expansionary fiscal and monetary
policies. The latter have been deployed to compensate for the marked slowdown in coal exports
and foreign direct investment (FDI)-financed mining development—key drivers of growth in
recent years. The strong growth of the economy over the past two years has helped reduce
poverty.
Adverse shocks to FDI inflows and exports, together with expansionary macroeconomic
policies, have put pressure on the balance of payments. As a result, central bank reserves have
come down considerably from record levels reached in late-2012 following Mongolia’s
successful first sovereign bond issuance. In recent months, to help relieve the balance of
payment pressures, the Bank of Mongolia has allowed more exchange rate flexibility. Looking
ahead, real GDP growth for Mongolia is currently projected by the IMF at close to 12 percent in
2013 and by 9½ percent in 2014, buoyed by the start of production at the Oyu Tolgoi copper and
gold mine.
Mongolia’s medium-term prospects remain promising given its large natural resource
endowment. However, expansionary macro policies are likely to put pressure on inflation and
the balance of payments in the period ahead. Also, Mongolia is facing an uncertain external
environment. Advanced economies will eventually exit from the very supportive monetary
policies implemented in recent years. China’s economy is expected to rebalance away from a
mostly investment-based growth model toward a more consumption-based growth model. Both
these factors are bound to have major spillovers globally and especially in the region. Spillover
risks will particularly affect the more vulnerable emerging market economies.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A
staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic
developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended Mongolia’s significant progress in recent years in economic
development and reducing poverty. The medium-term outlook remains favorable, underpinned
by developments in the mining sector. However, Directors cautioned that continuation of
expansionary fiscal and monetary policies could threaten stability. They welcomed recent steps,
particularly in the areas of fiscal and exchange rate policies to address rising domestic demand
and balance of payments pressures, but called for further decisive recalibration of policies to
address vulnerabilities, rebuild buffers against external shocks and ensure sustainable strong
growth.
Directors emphasized the need for an ambitious and credible fiscal consolidation plan. They
encouraged the authorities to bring fiscal policy in line with the overall goals and targets of the
Fiscal Stability Law. Accordingly, they recommended that the operations of the Development
Bank of Mongolia (DBM) should be included in the budget, which should aim at meeting the
2 percent of GDP structural deficit ceiling of the law over the next 2−3 years. While recognizing
the role of DBM spending in boosting growth and development, Directors stressed the
importance of an adequately frontloaded adjustment, including by streamlining subsidies and
transfers and reprioritizing and rephasing capital spending. A few Directors stressed the need to
preserve development spending while ensuring fiscal sustainability. Directors also encouraged
the authorities to complete the set up of a sovereign wealth fund and to enhance public debt
management capacity.
Directors emphasized that the ongoing large monetary stimulus provided through the central
bank programs needs to be unwound to curb inflationary and balance of payments pressures.
They endorsed the authorities’ efforts to strengthen the monetary policy framework and to allow
greater exchange rate flexibility to support external stability.
Directors commended the authorities’ efforts to strengthen the financial sector, including
strengthened capitalization and liquidity of banks. They advised further steps to reinforce the
regulatory and supervisory framework to address banking sector vulnerabilities and contain risks,
including those arising from unhedged foreign currency lending. In particular, Directors
encouraged strict enforcement of existing prudential regulations, a strengthening of underwriting
practices and loan classification, and the phasing-in of a forward-looking provisioning scheme.
They also stressed the need to enhance the bank resolution regime, develop a legal framework
for prompt corrective actions, and address deficiencies in the AML/CFT regime.
To promote sustained growth outside the mining sector, Directors stressed the importance of
continued reforms to strengthen the business climate, building on the authorities’ recent success
in passing a new investment law.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can

2/ The public debt data refer to the nominal value of debt and include tax prepayments by mining companies (under domestic debt)
and external borrowing by the central bank. By contrast, the authorities’ estimates of public debt follow the definitions in the Fiscal
Stability Law. They are expressed in net present value terms and exclude borrowing by the central bank.

Statement by Jong-Won Yoon, Executive Director for Mongolia
and Kyounghwan Moon, Advisor
November 15, 2013
On behalf of the Mongolian authorities, we would like to thank the mission team for their
constructive policy consultation. Mongolia has achieved a remarkable growth in recent years,
aided by its vast mineral wealth. While it has great potential for the future as a resource rich
economy, however, the economy remains vulnerable to boom-bust cycles of volatile global
mineral markets. The Mongolian authorities are broadly in line with staff recommendations.
They will address the development challenges through continued cooperation with the Fund to
achieve sustainable and stable growth.
Economic Outlook
Economic growth of Mongolia has remained in double digits this year, one of the highest in
the region. Favorable weather conditions and policy measures to mitigate supply shocks helped
expand the agricultural sector to 20.6 percent in the first half. Mineral production increased
moderately by 6.1 percent during the same period, but will rebound in the second half with the
start of Oyu Tolgoi’s open-pit mining production. Construction sector expanded rapidly due to
active investments in infrastructure and housing.
Inflation is contained at single digit but there are signs of upward pressures. Inflation has
subdued to 9.9 percent, y.o.y, in September 2013 from 14.8 percent a year earlier, thanks to
moderating food prices and the Bank of Mongolia’s Price Stabilization Program. However, there
are risks in the coming months as domestic prices begin to reflect the recent exchange rate
depreciation.
Balance of payment pressures have become key downside risks together with the decline of
foreign direct investment (FDI). Trade deficit continued at US$ 1.7 billion for the first nine
months. In particular, coal exports, which accounted for 43 percent of total exports, dropped by
45.3 percent from a year ago. FDI inflows were 47 percent lower for the first eight months.
Reflecting the external developments, gross international reserves decreased from US$ 4.1 billion
in January 2013 to US$ 2.7 billion in September 2013, amounting to four month import
coverage.
Fiscal Policy
The authorities agree with staff that fiscal framework needs to be strengthened in a
sustainable way. During the first nine months, the budget recorded a small deficit (0.6 percent of
GDP; MNT 93 billion), which is a significant decrease from MNT 531 billion a year ago.
The authorities have strengthened fiscal discipline, announcing the significant 2013 budget
spending cut in October. The amended budget aims to respond to the projected revenue
shortage this year through additional tax mobilization efforts. The budget spending will be
greatly reduced by 10.9 percent (5 percent of GDP; MNT 814 billion). Capital expenditure was
adjusted by cutting MNT 620 billion on various public investment projects and additional MNT
234 billion was reduced from recurrent spending.

2
The 2014 budget was submitted to the Parliament with a lower level of capital expenditure
than in 2013 as well as realistic revenue projections. The authorities are also making efforts to
broaden tax base through increasing tax collections from the shadow economy.
The authorities are working to enhance public debt management capacity in response to
the increase of bond issuances. A Debt Management Law has been drafted and will be
submitted to the Parliament this December. It would clarify the legal definition of public debt and
require a proper registration for contingent liability of the government in addition to sovereign
bonds.
Despite the above fiscal consolidation efforts, sustaining high level of public investment is
inevitable given significant infrastructure bottlenecks which hamper Mongolia’s growth
potential. Improved transportation system such as roads and railways would contribute to
reducing transaction costs. Construction of manufacturing factories such as cement and steel will
help meet domestic demand within a few years, with easing supply constraints to growth.
As a key vehicle for ensuring fiscal prudence, the Fiscal Stability Law (FSL) has been
implemented this year. The authorities reiterated their commitment to keeping the 2 percent of
GDP ceiling for the structural deficit in 2013 and 2014. There have been intense discussions
within the cabinet on how to deal with the issue of the DBM spending. Reducing the deficit,
including all of the DBM spending, from current 11 percent to 2 percent within 2 or 3 years
would not be an easy task, given its adverse and abrupt impact on the economy. The authorities
will review what levels of fiscal deficit and public debt are appropriate for Mongolia over the
longer term, balancing the need of keeping macroeconomic stability and smoothing intertemporal spending to wisely utilize huge mineral resources. They will clarify the elements of the
FSL such as the contingent liabilities reflecting changes in the domestic and global economic
environment.
With regard to the establishment of a sovereign wealth fund (SWF), the authorities are
planning to submit the related bill to the Parliament this December. They carefully reviewed
the cases of other countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Norway and Canada, and
received assistance from the World Bank and the IMF. Once the bill is passed, the SWF will be
established in 2014 and begin the operation from 2016. The SWF would help mitigate risk from
an overheating economy, maintain balance between current and future generations, ensure long
term savings, and stabilize the economy when the economy faces a crisis in the future.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
The Bank of Mongolia (BOM) conducted a counter-cyclical monetary policy in response to
the economic slowdown in late 2012. The Price Stabilization Program has aimed to address
supply shortages and market imperfections in select basic goods such as oil, meat, flour and
construction materials. The authorities will gradually phase out the quasi-fiscal operations, based
on market developments. Counter-cyclical monetary policy has helped support domestic demand,
while maintaining prices at stable levels. Broad money growth (M2) has reduced from
37.1 percent in 2011 to 18.8 percent in 2012, and is projected to be 17.1 percent in 2013. While
private credits increased to 48 percent this September, it was partly an inevitable response to a
sharp reduction in money supply due to the drawdown of net international reserves.

3
The authorities reassure that they are ready to phase out the monetary stimulus program
over time. MNT 2 trillion of mortgage program and central bank bills would be taken out soon
and the monetary policy would be tightened in tandem with increase of inflation pressures.
The authorities will continue a floating exchange rate regime. Despite the recent sharp
depreciation since July, the exchange rates have been determined in the market, with limited
smoothing-out operations.
Financial Sector
Despite the recent failure of Savings Bank, the financial sector has maintained its resilience.
The resolution process of Savings Bank has been carried out as planned through its merge to the
State Bank and recapitalization from the Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Bank of
Mongolia. The authorities keep vigilant in managing financial market risks with adequate
supervision. They share staff’s concern on high dollarization and are seeking proper ways to
manage this.
The authorities are strongly committed to implementing the action plans for the AntiMoney Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism framework. The authorities
adopted a resolution on freezing terrorist assets in October and are currently under discussion
with the cabinet on amending the criminal procedure code and criminal code.
Investment Policy
The authorities have recently adopted the new Investment Law in October, which will
provide a positive signal to investors by providing a more transparent and stable
investment environment. The law aimed to provide a level playing field to both foreign and
domestic investors and to ensure investment stability. It streamlined the investment approval and
registration process, while keeping a special process for investment made by legal entities of
foreign governments. The law included tax stabilization clauses and tax incentives. The
authorities are planning to streamline regulations further to foster an investment-friendly
environment.
Mongolia’s business environment is improving. In the 2014 Doing Business report of the
World Bank, Mongolia ranked 76th among 189 countries with regard to the ease of doing
business, which is an improvement by 4 ranks since the 2013 report.
