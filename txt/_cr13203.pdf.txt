MALTA
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 4, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context: Malta has maintained macroeconomic stability in the face of a major crisis in
Europe. Low reliance on external finance by the government and domestic banks, solid
fundamentals, and a sound banking system have contributed to this resilience. However,
recent events in Europe have heightened financial stability risks. In the longer term,
Malta’s attractiveness as a financial and business location could be adversely affected by
regulatory and tax reforms at the European level.

Financial sector policies: Risks from the large international bank segment appear
contained given limited balance sheet exposure to the Maltese economy, though
continued vigilance is warranted. Regulatory changes to increase loan loss provisions
and the funding of the deposit compensation scheme would help contain risks in the
domestic banking sector.

Fiscal policy: The main challenges for fiscal policy are to reverse the deterioration of
public finances and to strengthen the governance framework. Additional measures are
needed to ensure that the fiscal deficit falls below 3 percent of GDP in 2013 and public
debt remains on a sustainable path. Fiscal risks from the restructuring of public
corporations bear close monitoring.

Structural policies: Pension and health care reforms remain a priority to ease long-term
fiscal pressures. To expand competitiveness gains, policy efforts are needed to
strengthen female labor force participation and education attainment, to ensure a better
alignment of wage and productivity developments, and to improve the business climate.
These reforms would help mitigate a potential erosion of competitiveness resulting from
changes in the tax system.

CONTEXT
1.
Compared with its euro area peers, Malta has shown remarkable macroeconomic
resilience. Average growth of the Maltese economy (relative to historical average) has been the
best in the euro area since the beginning of the crisis. Malta suffered lower output and
employment losses than most advanced economies, and none of its financial institutions
required solvency or liquidity assistance. As a result, real GDP is now 2½ percent above pre-crisis
level (compared with 2¼ percent below for the euro area) and unemployment is close to
historical lows (Appendix I). However, economic growth slowed in 2012 to about ¾ percent, from
1¾ percent in 2011, reflecting a weak external environment and subdued domestic demand. In
addition, the fiscal deficit widened by ½ percent to 3.3 percent of GDP and government and
guaranteed debt is uncomfortably high (90 percent of GDP), constraining the fiscal space in the
event of further shocks.

3.
Despite the slowdown in growth, inflation remained elevated in 2012. The HICP
inflation inched up to 3.2 percent in 2012 from 2.5 percent in 2011. The main reason, however,
was higher prices and some methodological changes related to tourist services, which are mainly
oriented towards foreigners and therefore have little impact on domestic consumption. That
being said, inflation moderated to 0.8 percent in May 2013.
4.
Financial spillover from the euro area crisis has so far remained contained reflecting
limited reliance on external finance by core domestic banks and the government.


The core domestic banking sector is largely funded by resident deposits, while the large
international banking segment has limited balance sheet exposures to the Maltese economy
(Box 2). Unlike many other EU countries, Malta has not experienced any deleveraging
pressures, deposits and credit to the private sector continued to grow in 2012, albeit at a
slower pace than in 2010-11, and Maltese banks outperformed European peers in terms of
profitability (Box 3). Since developments in Cyprus, the fluctuation of bank liabilities has
remained within the historical average.

MALTA

The Maltese sovereign bond market weathered the storm in other euro area debt
markets unscathed, with yields declining on strong domestic demand and manageable
government financing needs. In contrast with other advanced economies, 96 percent of
Maltese government debt is held by residents, limiting financial spillovers.

5.
Balance sheet vulnerabilities of the non-financial private sector remain contained.
Household debt has increased rapidly since EU accession and reached 63 percent of GDP by end2011 (latest data available), broadly catching up with the EU average. Despite this increase,
households’ net financial assets remain positive, standing at 170 percent of GDP, which is among
the highest in the euro area. The corporate debt stands at 140 percent of GDP in 2012, which is
relatively high. However, this reflects to some extent the presence of foreign firms, resulting in a
large share of intra-group loans matched by intra-group claims on the asset side. Furthermore,
around half of this debt is in the form of long-term loans, and the corporate sector also has
sizeable assets.

deposits. At the other end of the
spectrum, international banks have
no balance sheet exposure to the Maltese economy.
Banks’ disparate balance sheet structures imply different risk profiles.



Core domestic banks have a traditional business model: they are largely funded by resident deposits and most
of their assets represent claims on residents. This segment is dominated by two banks (HSBC and Bank of
Valletta). Their main vulnerability is credit risk stemming from high exposure to the property market and
collateral in the form of real estate.



International banks rely mostly on equity, wholesale (including intra-group) funding and non-resident
corporate deposits of relatively long maturities. These banks lend these funds abroad and operate with a very
small physical presence in Malta. Their main risk is liquidity risk. Two branches from Turkey have combined
assets exceeding 300 percent of GDP. The largest subsidiaries are Deutsche Bank and Commbank Australia,
with combined assets of about 100 percent of GDP.



Non-core domestic banks have a more diverse asset and liability structure, and about 10 percent of their
balance sheet is linked to the domestic economy in the form of resident deposits and domestic loans and
securities. The main risks stem from potential claims on the deposit compensation scheme and from crossborder deleveraging pressures.

Box 3. Performance of the Banking Sector
Despite turbulence in the euro area, the performance of Maltese banks has been relatively good.



Banks are adequately capitalized, profitable, and liquid. The aggregate capital adequacy ratio of all bank peer
groups is well above the required minimum. The return on assets and return on equity ratios have actually
improved in 2012 underpinned by higher non-interest income. The liquid assets cover substantial part of
short-term liabilities, and the reliance on Eurosystem funding is very low.



The share of nonperforming loans (NPLs) has slightly increased in 2012, mainly due to subdued conditions in
the construction and real estate sectors. Just under one third of all loans to the construction companies are
classified as nonperforming.



Banks continued to expand their balance sheets in 2012 albeit at a slower pace than in 2010-11. Resident
customer deposits and nonresident customer deposits increased during 2012, while the amount of wholesale
funding remained broadly unchanged. Loans to residents have also marginally increased, driven primarily by
mortgage lending and (to a lesser extent) loans to the manufacturing sector operating across a range of
activities. The exposure of Maltese banks to EU sovereign debt is very low and diversified.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
A. Staff’s Views
6.
Despite good performance overall, GDP growth remains below potential and
uncertainties abound. Domestic demand has remained lackluster, reflecting sluggish investment
and private consumption and headwinds from a soft real estate market. Going forward, staff
projects a moderate acceleration in real GDP growth in 2013-15, which means that Malta would
continue to outperform the euro area average. The pick-up in activity to 1¼ percent in 2013
(from ¾ percent in 2012) is predicated on the recovery of private consumption and improved
confidence, as policy uncertainty related to the electoral cycle decreases. While this would lead to
some increase in imports, the current account balance is projected to remain slightly positive.
7.
Short-term risks to this scenario are largely related to the external environment. A
protracted period of slower growth in Europe or re-emergence of euro area financial stress if
policy momentum is not sustained, would negatively affect the economy through the trade
channel. In addition, close financial integration with the euro area entails a spillover risk via
banking and financial markets channels (see Risk Assessment Matrix). However, relatively strong
fundamentals in Malta, including a comfortable external position, very small reliance on external
financing by the government, and relatively healthy balance sheets of households and
nonfinancial corporates limit the vulnerability against these risks.
8.
Recent events in Europe have heightened perceptions about risks of hosting a large
banking sector in a small country. In the case of Malta these risks are contained because the
large international banking segment (with assets about 5 times GDP) has limited balance sheet
exposures to the Maltese economy and negligible contingent claims on the deposit
compensation scheme. The sharp segmentation of the Maltese banking sector implies that the
nature of potential threats to financial stability differs substantially across the various institutions.


The main risk facing the core domestic banks is credit risk, particularly related to the
significant concentration of loans to the real estate and construction sectors and loans
backed by real estate as collateral. The real estate market risk is contained by the very high
share of owner-occupied properties, prudent loan-to-value ratios, and fair market valuations.
However, the real estate market is particularly sensitive to shifts in confidence linked to the
external environment and it could act as a channel that amplifies the impact of external risks.
Furthermore, the over-reliance on immovable collateral may pose risks if the property market
were to slow significantly.



A few non-core domestic and international banks could be exposed to liquidity risk. A
change in perceptions of the risks facing creditors may lead to an increase in funding costs of
these banks, particularly those which rely significantly on wholesale funding. However, given
the insubstantial balance sheet links of these banks with residents, the effects on the
economy are likely to be small in the near to medium term (see Appendix III).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALTA

9.
In the longer term, regulatory and tax reform at the European and global level
could adversely affect Malta’s attractiveness as a financial and business location. The
Maltese economy has greatly benefitted from a business-friendly tax regime (see Appendix III).
Although these gains are hard to quantify, the large increase experienced in financial services
and other niche activities since 2004 are likely related to Malta’s accession to the EU, its
macroeconomic stability, and relatively favorable tax regime. Over the last ten years, more than
half of the growth in value added is explained by the growth in financial services, ancillary
activities (legal, accounting, and consulting), remote gaming, and ICT. These sectors alone
account for a quarter of total value added and 12 percent of employment. It is possible that
greater fiscal integration of EU member states and a potential harmonization of tax rates could
erode some of these benefits, with consequences on employment, output and fiscal revenues.

The Authorities’ Views
10.
The authorities broadly agreed with the outlook. Official projections of GDP growth
and inflation in 2013-16 are very similar to those of staff. The authorities concurred that the main
risk to growth comes from abroad, given continuing weakness in the euro area. The authorities
are concerned about possible reputational risks to Malta following events in Cyprus, but
expressed confidence that the Maltese banking sector is robust and stable. They also noted that
the banking sector in Malta differs substantially from that of banks in some other EU countries
affected by the crisis. In particular, the authorities emphasized that the size of Malta’s domestic
banking system is below the euro area average. The rest of Malta’s banking sector is made of
non-core and international banks with limited or no links to the domestic market. The authorities
were also of the view that an EU-wide tax harmonization would not happen in the short or
medium term.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Maintaining Financial Sector Stability
Staff’s Views
11.
Malta has made progress in strengthening the oversight over its financial sector. To
enhance monitoring of systemic risks a Joint Financial Stability Board (JFSB) was established by
the Central Bank of Malta (CBM) and the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) in January
2013. The JFSB was set up following the recommendations of the European Systemic Risk Board
to EU member states and is having monthly meetings. In March 2013, following the
intensification of the crisis in Cyprus, the authorities adequately strengthened supervision and
introduced extraordinary monitoring of banks through daily reporting of liquidity. The authorities
should continue monitoring closely developments in all banks, including links between foreign
parent banks and their Maltese entities in the context of the existing colleges of supervisors. The
authorities should also stand ready to take action if spillovers from abroad become imminent or
the internationally-oriented banks increase their exposure to the domestic economy. In
particular, the emerging trend by some small non-core banks of attracting resident deposits—
often accompanied by aggressive interest rate policies—to finance assets outside of Malta,
requires closer monitoring, though magnitudes are currently small.
12.
Further efforts are still needed to shore up the resilience of Maltese banks and
ensure financial stability. The ratio of provisions to nonperforming loans for core domestic
banks has been hovering around 20 percent in recent years, which is the lowest among the EU
countries. Despite ample availability of collateral, the authorities should tighten provisioning
rules in order to increase the available buffers to cover loan losses. To this effect, the MFSA could
issue guidelines, which would set common parameters for impairment triggers, forbearance
measures, and homogeneous collateral valuation practices. In this context, the planned revisions
to Banking Rule 09 should ensure that the incurred loan losses are recognized as early as
possible, ensuring a more conservative approach to the measurement of provisions within the
context of IFRS and providing a level playing field for provisioning in the banking sector. It
would also be important to conduct a review of the judiciary procedures related to the
foreclosure of the seized properties, which are currently very slow, impacting recovery values.
13.
Work should also continue to strengthen crisis preparedness and management
frameworks. The authorities could start strengthening the bank resolution framework in line
with forthcoming reforms at the EU level. It might also be useful to conduct a crisis simulation
exercise, given that the bank resolution framework in Malta is untested (there have been no bank
failures in Malta in the past decade, and no bank required liquidity or solvency assistance since
the beginning of the European financial crisis in 2008). Of particular importance is the need to
boost the available resources of the Deposit Compensation Scheme (DCS). Recent amendments
to the regulations to increase the size of the DCS to 1 percent of eligible deposits (from 0.77
percent) within the next 3 years are a step in the right direction. However, more needs to be

14.
Looking ahead, like other EU countries, Malta will have to implement EU-level
initiatives relating to the bank regulatory and supervisory frameworks. These include:


Basel III and Capital Requirement Directive IV (CRD IV). Although the Maltese banks have
strong capitalization, the higher capital adequacy requirements of CRD IV may pose
difficulties for individual banks facing the need to form additional provisions to deal with
higher nonperforming loans. Therefore, these banks should be encouraged to further
enhance capital buffers through higher profit retention, in line with the timeline proposed
under Basel III. Tougher liquidity standards seem unlikely to create any challenges for banks.
While an ample transition period for liquidity standards is envisaged, the Maltese authorities
should continue to ensure that banks remain well prepared for the implementation of new
requirements.



Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). As a result of the EU Council agreement on SSM of
December 2012, Malta’s two largest domestic banks (Bank of Valetta and HSBC) and possibly
CommBank Europe, will be placed under the direct oversight of the ECB from 2014. The
MFSA should work closely with the ECB to ensure a smooth transition in the supervision of
these banks. While the new framework is expected to result in a more efficient supervision
over a longer term, efforts should be made to ensure no reduction in the supervisory
capacity of these banks during the transition period.

15.
Staff recommends a prompt and an in-depth examination of the financial sector
under the IMF Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). The MFSA is commended for its
self-imposed quality controls of commissioning regular independent assessments against

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALTA

international standards. In line with previous staff recommendations, the MFSA is also
undertaking a review of the consumer protection and business conduct functions with a view to
enhance the integrity of the financial system. An FSAP would report progress since the 2003
assessment and point to areas where further efforts may be needed.
16.
In light of the rapid growth in financial sector activities and online gaming, all
relevant institutions should maintain an effective anti-money laundering framework. Malta
has become an active destination for small international banks and non-bank financial
intermediaries, such as re-insurance companies and various investment funds, whose activities
are mostly outside Malta. While Malta has a comprehensive legal system to combat money
laundering and has increased the resources devoted to the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit
(FIAU), the increasing complexity of the Maltese financial sector warrants closer AML/CFT related
monitoring. The FSAP would be an opportunity to conduct a detailed AML/CFT assessment. The
ongoing practices of joint inspections carried out by the MFSA and FIAU is a welcome step, but
the number of on-site visits remains low and is not commensurate with the size of the financial
sector (see Appendix III). To strengthen human resources, consideration should be given to
hiring experts from abroad, financed by non-punitive levies on the financial sector.
17.
The intention of the authorities to establish a development bank has merits, but
requires careful evaluation. Development banks play an important role in many countries in
extending the outreach of credit and other financial services to customers, who may not have
easy access to commercial banks. However, the international experience with development banks
has been mixed, as these banks have sometimes been subject to undue political pressure and
weak supervision, which resulted in substantial losses to taxpayers. The authorities should ensure
that the conditions required for successful operation of a development bank are in place (Box 4).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

MALTA

Box 4. The Conditions Required for Successful Operation of a Development Bank
Recently, the Central Bank Governor has expressed interest in creating a development bank (DB) to address the
national financing gaps not met by the commercial banks. The purpose of the DB would be to provide longterm financing for public projects in infrastructure and social sectors, such as education, communications, and
environmental protection and rehabilitation. While the market failure to obtain finance and the positive
externalities of such projects provide a rationale for the establishment of a DB, state intervention in the banking
sector should be carefully crafted to mitigate the risks of political interference, poor governance, uncontrollable
fiscal contingent liabilities, and unfair advantages of the DB over private banks. Some of the steps that can be
taken to ensure that the social rate of return from the DB’s activities exceeds the private and fiscal costs are
listed below:



Establish a clear mandate: The DB mandate should aim at filling the financing gaps arising from market
failures. The mandate should specify the DB’s objectives, the time period required for implementing and
achieving the objectives, and the provisions for transparent accountability.



Relationship with the private banks: The objective should be to act complementarily with respect to
private banks, not compete with them.



Financial sustainability: The DB should be financially sustainable over time. However, the objective should
not be to maximize profit but generate the resources required for the completion of mandated projects.
The DB should be regulated and supervised as a commercial bank.



Instruments used: The mandate should be clear, specific and direct about the instruments used to correct
the market failure.



Accountable and efficient governance: Good and accountable governance is critical to prevent
government interference in credit decisions. One possible option could be to organize the DB as a
corporation comprising shareholders, board of directors and management with each group clearly
informed about its rights and responsibilities

The Authorities’ Views
18.
The authorities agreed with the staff’s assessment. The Financial Stability Report of
the CBM has encouraged banks to increase loan loss provision, strengthen capital buffers
through higher profit retention, and ensure higher funding for the deposit compensation
scheme. The MFSA is working on imposing additional capital requirements via Pillar II to account
for concentration risk and heightened levels of non-performing loans. The authorities noted that
the work on Basel III and SSM is under way, and the Joint Financial Stability Board has already
met several times since its inception in January 2013. The Domestic Standing Group, composed
of representatives of the CBM, MFSA, and Ministry of Finance, remains another forum for
discussion of systemic risks. The daily monitoring of liquidity position of individual banks has not
revealed any signs of excess volatility or abnormal capital inflows or outflows. The authorities
plan to request an FSAP and think that it could validate the findings of the recent independent
assessment of Malta’s regulatory and supervisory frameworks. The authorities support the
establishment of a development bank in Malta to channel the excess liquidity in the system to
infrastructure, social, and environmental projects and to deploy government assets (e.g.
underutilized real estate) more efficiently. Their view is that commercial banks cannot fill this gap

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALTA

because of the medium to long-term nature of the projects. In turn, budget financing is
constrained by the high level of public debt.

B. Ensuring Fiscal Sustainability
Staff’s Views
19.
The fiscal consolidation path was reversed in 2012 amid the election cycle. After
notable progress in 2011, the fiscal deficit widened by ½ percent to 3.3 percent of GDP in 2012
and government debt rose to 72.1 percent of GDP, or almost 90 percent of GDP including
guaranteed debt (Box 5). This has triggered a reassessment of Malta’s public finances under the
EU Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP), which Malta had exited in 2012. In late May 2013, the
European Commission recommended to initiate the first steps towards re-opening of the EDP,
with the deadline to achieve a durable correction of the deficit set for 2014. The fiscal slippage in
2012, which amounted to 1 percentage point of GDP relative to the budget target, was the result
of overruns in all components of current spending and lower-than-expected revenues.


Revenues improved relative to 2011, albeit by less than anticipated by the government.
Direct tax revenues increased substantially driven by higher income tax receipts from firms
and households. However, the ratio of indirect taxes to GDP fell, reflecting weaker than
expected consumption growth because of increased uncertainty surrounding the elections.



Overruns in current expenditure reflect the fast growth of health care spending and pension
outlays. In addition, new collective wage agreements and settlement of arrears from
previously acquired wage commitments resulted in a large increase in the wage bill. The
increase in current expenditure more than offset the impact of a significant amount of
deficit-reducing one-off measures (close to 1 percent of GDP). Since 2009, recourse to such
one-off and temporary measures to reduce the deficit has averaged more than ¾ percent of
GDP per year.

20.
The government’s objective to balance the budget over the medium term remains
essential, but it requires credible and sustainable consolidation efforts. On April 8, the
newly elected government and the opposition agreed to approve the 2013 budget rejected by
Parliament in December 2012, with only minor modifications. The budget proposed a fiscal
deficit of 2.7 percent of GDP in 2013 and a moderate structural adjustment of about ½ percent
of GDP per year over the medium-term. However, the discretionary measures announced for
2013 are expansionary and tax revenue projections appear optimistic in light of the moderate
growth outlook and developments so far. On a cash basis, the deficit through March 2013
already exceeds the authorities’ deficit target for the year. Therefore, in the absence of additional
measures, staff projects the deficit to widen further to 3.5 percent points of GDP in 2013, and to
remain above 3 percent of GDP in the near to medium term. As a result, the government debtto-GDP ratio is expected to continue to rise over the next three years.

Staff urges the Maltese authorities to adopt additional measures to ensure the
deficit falls below 3 percent of GDP in 2013 and public debt remains on a sustainable path.
These measures should be designed to contain the fast growth in current expenditures,
particularly intermediate consumption and social transfers, which show an unsustainable upward
trend, and compensation of employees, which is one of the highest in the EU. The focus should
be on tightening controls on the growth of health spending, greater use of means-testing of
government benefits, and containing the wage bill through prudent collective wage agreements
and compression of public sector employment through attrition. On the other hand, there is a
need to preserve capital spending and to increase absorption capacity of EU funds. There is also
a need to reduce reliance on one-off and temporary measures to ensure a sufficient and
sustainable improvement of the structural balance.

Persistent deficits have contributed to the increase in public debt, but intergovernmental loans to
support euro area countries have also been an important contributor in recent years.



Interest payments represent the largest component of the government deficit. The structural primary deficit



The government has tended to rely on one-off measures
to reduce the deficit, as evidenced by the negative
contribution of the cyclical primary balance, which
includes one-offs, on the deficit in four out of the five
years considered.





In 2012, cash and deposits of the government fell
significantly to finance the deficit, contributions to the
EFSF, and an accumulation in net receivables.
This is consistent with the trend observed in the

declined significantly in 2012, non-cash financial assets
increased substantially in 2012.

Restoring the profitability and viability of large public corporations is crucial to
alleviate fiscal pressures. The high level of government-guaranteed debt and delicate financial
position of Enemalta (the public utilities corporation) and Airmalta heighten concerns about
Malta’s fiscal sustainability. Progress on the restructuring of Airmalta appears on track and the
restructuring plan of Enemalta was recently approved. In this context, budget assistance to
Enemalta needs to be phased out. Staff supports the government’s objective to reduce energy
costs—one of the highest in the EU—and to diversify energy sources. However, any reduction in
electricity tariffs should be contingent on the success of the government’s strategy to reduce
costs and restore Enemalta’s financial health (see Appendix IV). It would also be important to
make Enemalta’s financial reporting more timely and enhance transparency by issuing progress
reports on Enemalta’s restructuring and the government’s energy reform plan.
23.
Further progress is needed to strengthen the fiscal governance framework. The
authorities need to undertake the necessary reform to ensure that its fiscal governance
framework meets the EU requirements under the six-pack and fiscal compact by end 2013 (Box
6)1. A clear rule-based multi-year fiscal policy framework would reinforce the linkage between
annual budget laws and the medium-term target. Fiscal discipline and governance should also be
strengthened by establishing an independent fiscal council to guide and assess the government’s
consolidation efforts. The fiscal council should have a comprehensive mandate, which includes
the provision of unbiased macroeconomic estimates and an assessment of consistency between
fiscal outcomes and the government’s targets derived from the fiscal rules.
The Authorities’ Views
24.
The authorities were more optimistic than staff regarding the fiscal outlook. The
authorities emphasized their commitment to reduce the budget deficit to 2.7 percent of GDP in
2013. With regards the 2013 budget, the authorities highlighted that small changes had been
made to the budget proposed by the previous government, largely because of the need to honor
previously acquired commitments. They also noted that their revenue projections were less
optimistic than those of the previous government and that improvements in tax collection could
yield substantial revenues. The authorities agreed with staff about the need to achieve a
sustainable fiscal consolidation and to tackle the risks posed by the fast growth of certain current
expenditure items. The government is committed to strengthening the governance framework
and is considering various options for the mandate and responsibilities of a fiscal council.

The six pack is a set of EU legislative measures to reform the Stability and Growth Pact and to introduce a
new macroeconomic surveillance. The fiscal compact is an intergovernmental treaty introduced as a new
stricter version of the Stability and Growth Pact.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALTA

Box 6. Malta: Fiscal Governance Framework
In order to prevent the build-up of fiscal imbalances, the six-pack and fiscal compact require EU member
countries to reform their fiscal frameworks by making changes to their legislation. This set of directives,
regulations and agreements, establish that the necessary elements to build a strong fiscal framework are: fiscal
rules, fiscal councils, medium term budgetary planning, budget coordination, and budget monitoring.
Member States should have clearly defined numerical fiscal rules that promote compliance with the
Stability and Growth Program (SGP). Fiscal rules may target the deficit, public debt or government
expenditure, and should be reflected in the annual budget. These rules must be effectively monitored, and
non-compliance should only be allowed under exceptional circumstances. The effective enforcement of fiscal
rules requires a gradual, well-defined and credible sanctions mechanism, which leaves only very limited room
for political discretion. To strengthen the enforcement of fiscal rules and counteract governments’ inherent
deficit bias, compliance with fiscal rules should be monitored by an independent body, such as a fiscal council.
Independent fiscal councils improve the transparency and quality of fiscal policies. These independent
bodies contribute to the effectiveness of fiscal rules, by providing unbiased and realistic macroeconomic and
budgetary projections, or by scrutinizing the government’s projections. Overly optimistic projections yield
excessively positive assessments of the underlying fiscal stance, thus masking emerging fiscal imbalances.
4



In fact, projections of economic growth and government
revenue have been “too optimistic” in a number of EU
Member States over the past decade. The Government’s
excessive optimism is proxied by its revenue projection
errors. From 2000 to 2011, Malta has registered one of
the highest projection errors among EU countries, while
the projection errors have been smaller in countries
where forecasts are produced or scrutinized by
independent bodies, such as in the Netherlands, Austria
and Belgium.

eradication of the government’s deficit bias, the fiscal
council must have the following characteristics: be strictly independent from the government; have a
comprehensive mandate; and have the tools to persuade the government by being visible. That is, if the
government fails to meet a target or does not follow a given rule, then it must publicly explain the
deviations from the fiscal council’s advice. Alternatively, the government could be asked to publish the
results of ex-post reviews prepared by the fiscal council.

To promote a sound and credible medium-term fiscal planning, a multi-annual fiscal budgeting
framework is required. Transparent multi-annual budgetary objectives, for the general government’s
expenditure, deficit and debt should be published, including the projections of the main revenue and
expenditure items for the budget year and beyond. Further, these projections should constitute the basis for
future budget preparations. A description of the medium-term policies envisaged should be provided, as well
as a forecast of the impact that these policies may have on long-term fiscal sustainability.
Strong budgetary coordination between the different levels of government is important for ensuring
full compliance with fiscal rules. EU Member States should have appropriate coordination mechanisms in
place across the different sub-sectors of general government. These mechanisms should ensure comprehensive
and consistent coverage of all government entities with respect to annual and multi-annual fiscal planning and
compliance with the numerical fiscal rules.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALTA

Box 6. Malta: Fiscal Governance Framework (concluded)
Finally, an adequate monitoring framework is a crucial element of fiscal surveillance. To ensure that fiscal
slippages are detected at an early stage, governments should be required to provide timely and accurate
budgetary data, including the publication of data on contingent liabilities, as these could have a large impact
on public budgets.
The figure below puts into perspective the progress Malta has made in adapting to the new regulatory
framework. Relative to its EU peers, the Maltese government needs to make further efforts in adopting a clear
fiscal rule, establish a fiscal council and impose its multi-annual fiscal projections as targets.

C. Boosting Long Term Growth and Competitiveness
Staff’s Views
25.
Steady implementation of structural reforms is critical to boost potential growth
and ensure the sustainability of public finances. The mission welcomes the government’s
recent adoption of the National Reform Program that includes specific measures in different
areas, but progress on other reforms has been slow, notably pension reform. If continued income
growth depends on flexibility in developing niche service industries, there will be a premium on
tackling the country’s low female labor force participation and tertiary education and relatively
inflexible wage-setting regime. The priority areas should include:


20

Advancing pension and health care reform to ease long-term fiscal pressures. Without the
implementation of mitigating reforms, Malta’s deficit would worsen by over 8 percentage
points of GDP by 2060, reflecting an expected large increase in ageing-related spending
(twice the EU average). The mission recommended: (i) indexing the retirement age to
longevity, (ii) accelerating the planned increase in the statutory retirement age to 65, and (iii)
introducing a mandatory privately funded second pillar and a voluntary third pillar to
supplement the pay-as-you-go system. The latter, which would require an appropriate legal
framework, would support the development of the local capital market and allow households
to diversify their sources of savings (Appendix V).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALTA



Strengthening female labor participation. The authorities have recently introduced tax
incentives and child care and maternity support measures to promote female labor
participation, which is the lowest in the euro area. This will also help alleviate long-term fiscal
pressures from ageing spending through a reduction in the dependency ratio.



Enhancing education attainment. The demand for high skilled labor in Malta is likely to
increase with the growth of the financial sector and other high-value added activities. Yet, the
rate of early school leavers in Malta is among the highest in the EU, and the rate of tertiary
education is among the lowest. Education reforms should focus on promoting greater social
inclusion and linking vocational training more closely with labor market needs.



Reforming the wage setting mechanism. Collective wage agreements should ensure better
alignment of wage and productivity developments. Wage growth has exceeded productivity
growth and increases in unit labor costs continue to outpace the euro area average. While
the removal of the cost of living adjustment (COLA) may not be politically feasible and may
raise social equitable considerations, a gradual moderation in the indexation mechanism and
its greater integration in the collective wage negotiations could help make the labor market
more efficient and competitive. Appendix VI discusses possible reform initiatives.



Improving the business climate. Malta ranks particularly poorly in the areas of starting a
business, getting construction permits, and contract enforcement. Measures to minimize
start-up barriers and improve the legal environment would create a more welcoming
business climate.

26.
More generally, these reforms would make the economy less vulnerable to sectoral
setbacks and more resilient to a potential harmonization of tax rates at the EU level. With
Malta’s growth model increasingly dependent on financial and niche services, measures to
broaden competitiveness would help diversify the economy. This is particularly important at a
time when many of Malta’s trading partners are undergoing internal devaluation, fiscal
consolidation, and structural reforms to restore their competitiveness.
The Authorities’ Views
27.
The authorities broadly agreed with the assessment but emphasized several
obstacles to the swift implementation of some of the proposed reforms. They
acknowledged that increasing the retirement age beyond what is already planned would help
reduce public expenditure and increase contributions. However, they noted that this would not
be politically acceptable in the short term, just as the introduction of the mandatory second
pension pillar. The government is exploring measures to reform the public pension system by
assessing potential enhancements to the first pension pillar, allowing the development of the
third pension pillar, and reviewing incentives aimed at encouraging individuals to save with
private pension funds. The authorities noted that measures to increase female labor force
participation and education attainment are included in the National Reform Program under the
Europe 2020 strategy. The government emphasized that COLA has served the country well in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

MALTA

terms of social cohesion and industrial peace, and noted that wage growth already reflected
productivity growth in some sectors of the economy.

D. Statistical Issues
28.
There is room to strengthen data collection and analysis. The recent IMF technical
assistance mission on balance of payments (BOP) identified several actions that the CBM and
National Statistics Office (NSO) should implement to achieve the latest internationally accepted
methodological standards and good practices. The current data collection system is based on a
direct reporting system covering the largest companies, which raises concern in terms of
coverage and timeliness, particularly in the context of the rapid growth of new activities
facilitated by tax incentives.
29.
Large revisions to the first released estimates in certain areas, in particular services,
point to the need of a re-examination of the data collection strategy. It would be important
to build up more robust sampling frames to conduct benchmark and/or regular BOP surveys. The
enrichment of the BOP register would constitute a first step. The inclusion of special purpose
entities (SPEs) in the external sector accounts would be one of the milestones for which the
country has committed as part of BPM6 adoption in 2014 by Euro area members. The release of
new estimates should be preceded by a thorough analysis of their impact on the external sector
accounts and other macroeconomic indicators, including GDP. There is a need to reinforce the
scarce human resources, in particular at the NSO, to facilitate the implementation of these
measures.
30.
Although the current provision of statistics is sufficient for surveillance, further
efforts in specific areas are needed. For instance, it would be advisable to compile series for
household disposable income and household savings.

STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
Malta has shown remarkable resilience in the face of a major crisis in Europe. Since
the beginning of the crisis, the average real GDP growth in Malta has been one of the best
among all EU members and the unemployment rate remains one of the lowest. This resilience
was underpinned by robust service export growth and a sound banking system. As a result, the
current account balance has improved gradually in recent years, turning into surplus in 2012.
Although, economic growth slowed in 2012 reflecting weak external conditions and subdued
domestic demand, staff projects a moderate acceleration in 2013-15, which means that Malta
would continue to outperform the euro area average. The pick-up in activity is predicated on the
recovery of private consumption and improved confidence. While this would lead to some
increase in imports, the current account balance is projected to remain slightly positive.

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALTA

32.
Recent events in Europe have heightened perceptions about the risks of hosting a
large banking sector in a small country, posing difficult policy challenges for the
authorities. These risks are contained in Malta because the large international banking segment
has limited balance sheet exposures to the domestic economy. Nonetheless, the authorities
should re-double their efforts to monitor closely developments in all banks, including links
between foreign parent banks and their Maltese entities, and take concrete measures to
strengthen the resilience and bolster the reputation of Malta’s financial system. Specifically, loan
loss provisions should be increased; the crisis preparedness and management frameworks should
be enhanced, notably by boosting the resources of the deposit insurance fund; and, in light of
the rapid growth in financial sector and online gaming activities, the implementation of the antimoney laundering framework should be further strengthened. In this regard, staff welcomes the
establishment of the Joint Financial Stability Board to monitor system-wide risk and conduct
macro-prudential policy, and urges the authorities to undergo a prompt and in-depth
examination of the financial sector under the IMF’s Financial Sector Assessment Program,
including an AML/CFT assessment.
33.
The authorities’ intention to establish a development bank has merits, but requires
careful evaluation. The authorities should ensure that the conditions required for the successful
operation of a development bank are in place, including clear mandate and identification of the
market failure that the development bank is expected to mitigate, robust governance structure to
ensure financial sustainability, and the use of best practices of the private sector. In addition, the
operation of the development bank should not cause significant market distortion or compete
with the private sector.
34.
The immediate challenge for fiscal policy is to reverse the deterioration in the fiscal
balance and to strengthen the fiscal governance framework. The fiscal position deteriorated
in 2012 amid the election cycle and the level of public debt is uncomfortably high, constraining
the fiscal space in the event of further shocks. Furthermore, discretionary measures announced
for 2013 are expansionary and tax revenue projections appear optimistic. In the absence of
additional credible measures, staff projects the deficit to widen further to 3.5 percent of GDP in
2013. Efforts should focus on containing the fast growth of current spending and reducing the
reliance on one-off and temporary measures, while preserving capital spending. Further fiscal
consolidation will be required in the medium-term to meet a structural balanced budget and
ensure sustainable debt dynamics, thus reducing fiscal risks to manageable levels.
35.
Much more needs to be done to reduce contingent liabilities and address Malta’s
long-term fiscal challenges. Pension and health care reforms are crucial to improve the
adequacy and sustainability of the schemes. In particular, the retirement age should be aligned
with life expectancy, and second and third pension pillars should be introduced. The latter, which
would require an appropriate legal framework, would support the development of the local
capital market. Staff supports the government’s plans to restructure Enemalta, reduce energy
costs, and diversify energy sources. However, there are significant potential fiscal risks from these
initiatives that require close monitoring.

36.
With Malta’s growth model increasingly dependent on financial and niche services,
the medium-term challenge to broaden competitiveness, diversify the economy, and boost
long-term growth appear increasingly daunting. Maintaining macroeconomic stability and a
sound financial system are necessary but not sufficient for long-term growth. Going forward,
policy efforts are needed to strengthen female labor force participation and educational
attainment, ensure better alignment of wages and productivity at the enterprise level, promote
foreign investment and R&D, and improve the business climate and the judicial system. These
reforms would also make the economy less vulnerable to sectoral setbacks and more resilient to
a potential harmonization of tax rates at the EU level.
37.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Malta be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Malta: Risk Assessment Matrix
Risk
Stalled or incomplete
delivery of Euro area policy
commitments

Difficulty in implementing
structural reforms

Protracted period of slower
European growth

Significant declines in real
estate prices

Difficulty to sustain the
favorable tax regime

Global oil shock triggered by
geopolitical events

Relative Likelihood

Impact if Realized

Medium
Re-emergence of euro area financial
stress and uncertainty over euro area
viability. This could result in significant
negative shocks to growth.

High
Spillovers through trade and financial
channels would reduce growth and
weaken banks’ balance sheets.

Medium
Lack of social consensus leading to
reform paralysis.

High
Delayed implementation of required
structural reforms would have negative
impact on long-term fiscal sustainability,
competitiveness, and medium-term
growth.

Medium
The adverse impact of the ongoing
public and private sector deleveraging
on the real economy could be larger
than currently expected, reducing
potential output and lowering growth in
the euro area over the medium term.

Medium
Slower European growth would affect
Malta through weaker exports and
confidence effects.

Medium
Growth in the commercial real estate
sector has softened and property-related
NPLs are rising. The domestic banks are
highly exposed to the property market
through lending and collateral in the
form of real estate.

Medium
Declines in house prices would dampen
domestic demand. The deterioration in
asset quality would require further loanloss provisions and bank capital,
adversely affecting bank profitability and
lending.

Low/Medium
Harmonization of the tax framework and
regulatory reforms might reduce
attractiveness of Malta.

Medium
Deleveraging of the international
banking and business sector may
adversely affect tax revenues and
employment.
Medium
Price and wage increases could erode
recent gains in competitiveness.

Low
Malta’s high dependence on oil imports
results in a high pass-through of energy
prices shocks to inflation and,
subsequently, wages due to the wage
indexation mechanism.

The RAM shows relatively low probability events that could materially alter the baseline discussed in this
report (which is the scenario most likely to materialize in view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks
listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of risks surrounding this baseline. The RAM reflects staff’s views
on the sources of risks as of the time of discussions with the authorities.

Crisis

1.
Compared to its euro area peer, Malta has shown
remarkable resilience during the financial and the euro area
sovereign debt crises. Average real GDP growth relative to the
country’s own pre-crisis growth has been the best in Malta, even
surpassing Germany, amongst euro area countries.

3.
Malta’s resilience was underpinned by robust export
growth. The export sector of the European countries was
severely hit by the crisis. Malta also had to wither the storm.
However, the fall in export growth was less than in most
countries due to the strong performance of the tourism sector
and niche services like remote gaming and financial services.

bond yield in Malta has remained low during the euro area
sovereign debt crisis, when the 10 year government bond
spreads raised by more than 1000 bps in Portugal and
Cyprus, causing severe funding constraints.

2.
The increase in the unemployment rate was less
drastic in Malta. The global financial crisis and the subsequent
euro area sovereign debt crisis resulted in a sharp spike in the
unemployment rate across advanced economies. Compared to
the pre-crisis trend, the unemployment rate actually decreased
in Malta during the crisis. The fall in real GDP growth was not
only lower than in other euro area counterparts, but also
resulted in less job loss than in the other countries.

Factors Contributing to Malta’s Resilience
7.
Robust household income, low consumer
leverage and robust credit growth contributed
towards consumption resilience. The resilience of
the household sector during the crisis can be
attributed to five factors:

Stable household loans as a share of GDP. At the onset of the crisis, Malta’s household loan as a
share of GDP was 52 percent in 2006, lower than Portugal, Ireland and Spain. Hence, unlike a lot
of advanced economies, there was no real pressure of deleveraging. Though the total household
loan as a share of GDP has increased since then, the interest rate burden on the household
remained stable since the household income was rising in line with the growth in debt.

8.
Export diversification, in terms of products, has helped Malta maintain robust export
growth. In the past years, Malta has very successfully reduced its trade balance and gradually
shifted from -6.1 percent of GDP in 2006 to 5.3 percent of GDP in 2011. The positive trade balance
has been achieved on the back of export diversification from goods to services, as discussed in
Appendix II. The market share in world services trade continues to increase at a rapid pace in Malta,
successfully offsetting the decrease in Malta’s share of world goods.

The fall in property prices was not drastic. The decline in property prices during the crisis was
8 percent. The loss in household wealth from property was thus moderate. Malta’s house prices
are one of the most undervalued amongst the advanced economy countries, indicating there is
no potential risk of correction in the property market. Both the price-to-income and price-torent ratio remain one of the lowest among the advanced economies.

Although consumer loan growth dropped in the negative territory in 2010, it rebounded in 2011
and 2012. A similar resilience is also exhibited by household mortgage loans where Malta’s
performance during the crisis is well above the euro area average. The mortgage loan growth
in 2009 was also strong when other countries faced headwinds in the mortgage market due to
the plunge in their GDP growth.

9.
Malta’s conservative domestic banking system with less reliance on wholesale funding
acted as a cushion during the crisis. The domestic banking sector in Malta has sound capital and
liquidity buffers, low leverage, and follows a conservative funding model (high deposit-to-loan
ratio). This has helped Malta’s banking sector to outperform its euro area peers, with both banking
sector’s return on equity and return on assets posting the best profit numbers amongst the euro
area countries. This performance was also supported by solid bank capital to assets and bank
regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets that were at par with other euro area peers. According to
the Financial Stability Report 2011, released by the Central Bank of Malta, the core domestic banks
had a very limited exposure of 8 percent of total assets to euro area assets. Moreover, those
holdings were diverse and exposed to higher rated sovereign states, with 39 percent of the foreign
sovereign holdings from France, 18 percent from Germany. The exposure to EU/IMF program
countries was 14 percent of the total (Ireland 7 percent, Greece 4.5 percent, and Portugal
2.8 percent).
10.
One of the main reasons for Malta’s strong fiscal stand during the crisis, relative to its
peers, is the limited foreign exposure of the country’s government debt. This left the
government bond prices insulated from the developments of the euro area sovereign crisis. Malta’s
foreign holding of government debt, at 4 percent in 2012, is by far the smallest amongst advanced
economies; and even smaller than that of Japan. Consequently, as discussed in the first section, the
government bond spreads remained low.
11.
Malta’s strong internal investment position (IIP) acted as a great cushion during the

crisis. Malta had entered the crisis with a strongly

Appendix II. Malta’s External Competitiveness

1

1.
Malta’s trade balance, driven by increases in services, has improved remarkably since
2004. This note sheds light into possible avenues for further improvement by comparing Malta’s
export performance to that of Germany. The comparative exercise shows that, despite less favorable
supply factors, Malta has benefited from a strong demand for its exports. The country could improve
its export performance by reorienting its exports, both in terms of products and destinations, and by
reducing the cost of production.
2.
Continued export diversification could preserve and extend Malta’s recent
competitiveness gains. Although Malta has done tremendous progress, there is scope for further
diversification of exports towards fast growing economies in emerging markets and newer varieties.
To shed light into possible avenues for improvement, Malta’s export performance is compared to
that of Germany’s. Germany has been a forerunner in the euro area as a country who has
successfully shifted its export base, both in terms of composition of trade and export destinations.
Also, Germany is one of the top five contributors of world export services growth, making it a
suitable benchmark for services trade as well.
3.
Malta has made tremendous progress in non-price competitiveness, by successfully
diversifying its trade (Appendix I). Malta’s external trade performance has improved significantly
since 2004. The improvement in the trade balance has been one of the best in the region, only
outperformed by Estonia and Latvia, and even better than Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands.
The improvement in the trade balance has been driven by increases in services.
Exports of goods
4.
Malta’s lower exposure to fast growing economies and its higher cost of producing
goods explain Malta’s worse trade performance relative to Germany. Malta’s exports of goods
grew by an average of 4 percent over 2005–11, compared to 7 percent in Germany. This partly
reflects Germany’s larger share of exports going to fast growing emerging markets, such as China,
India, Russia, Brazil, and Turkey. Furthermore, Germany’s goods have also done better in Malta’s
main destination markets, suggesting that supply factors (e.g. cost of producing goods, productivity)
are at play. In other words, Malta’s higher wage growth and lower productivity growth, relative to
Germany places Malta at a disadvantage in world’s export markets. There are two aspects worth
highlighting, nevertheless. First, although Malta’s trade share to the fast growing emerging markets
is smaller than Germany’s, Malta’s export growth in most of these markets is higher than Germany’s,
suggesting a large upside potential for Malta in these destinations. Second, Malta’s exposure to the
euro area seems to be lower than Germany’s, which does indicate that Malta has, to some extent,
diversified its export partners.

Counterfactual 1: Malta’s export growth of goods, but Germany’s destination markets.
What would be the export growth in Malta with the same destination markets as Germany? The
exercise suggests that Malta’s average export growth over the period 2005–2011 would have
been 6.9 percent, in par with Germany’s 7.1 percent over the same period, and higher than the
actual performance of 4.1 percent.



Counterfactual 2: Malta’s destination markets, but Germany’s export growth of goods.
What would be the export growth in Malta with German goods? The country’s growth would
then have been 6.2 percent, higher than its realized growth and closer to Germany’s overall
export growth.

Exports of Services
5.
Malta has outperformed Germany in terms of services exports, but could do better by
improving its composition. Malta’s growth in the service sector in the period 2005–2011 was
16 percent, compared to 9.3 percent in Germany over the same period. Malta’s export base of
services is less diversified than Germany’s. The highest share of export services in Malta is occupied
by the category ‘others’ which mostly reflects exports of personal, cultural and recreational services,
including online gaming. However, compared to Germany, the export growth to almost all the



Counterfactual 1: Malta’s growth of services exports, but Germany’s composition of

of services exports as Germany?” Malta’s average export growth for the period 2005–11
would have been 24.1 percent, much higher than its 16 percent realized growth.



Counterfactual 2: Malta’s composition of services exports, but Germany’s growth of
services exports. What would be the export growth in Malta with German growth rates?
Malta’s export growth would have been 7.8 percent, lower than Malta’s actual number. This
suggests that supply factors have weighed in the trade performance of Malta’s goods but
not of its exports. In other words, Malta’s new niches of services exports are relatively
competitive. This is consistent with the findings in Appendix VI, which suggests that wage
growth in the newer industries has not outpaced productivity growth, as in more traditional
sectors.

The comparative exercise with Germany suggests that Malta could improve its export
growth performance by further reorienting its export, both in terms of products and
destinations, and by reducing the cost of the goods it produces. With the euro area in recession
and future domestic demand growth likely to be coming from emerging markets like BRICs and
Indonesia, successful geographical diversification is warranted to preserve the continued positive
performance in the trade sector. Similarly, diversification toward new types of services could also
improve trade performance. However, one has to also acknowledge that, given the size of the
economy compared to Germany’s and its economic structure, it might be difficult to expand the
composition of tradable goods and services. Finally, increased effort to align wage and productivity
developments at the sectoral level could reduce the cost of producing Maltese goods and services,
increasing their competitiveness in international markets.
7.
Despite less favorable supply factors compared to Germany, Malta has benefited from
a strong demand for its exports, particularly services. Malta’s large improvement in the trade
balance reflects strong external demand for Maltese services. This is evident from the evolution of
the terms of trade in the past years. The overall terms of trade of goods and services has fallen in
the past years, but the terms of trade of services has increased remarkably, outperforming Germany
and euro area, indicating increase in foreign demand for Malta’s service sector. In addition, the real
GDP of trading partners has grown in line with that of Germany, and in some years, has
outperformed Germany. This has also boosted the country’s trade performance. The service sector
has not been affected from the relative lag in competitiveness of the supply side due to the strong
external demand factor.

Appendix III. International-Oriented Banks

1

1.
Malta has been an important international banking centre in the past 25 years. A
special offshore regime for banks (and other non-bank institutions) was promoted since the late
1980s. Like in several other European jurisdictions (Cyprus, Ireland, Luxembourg, or Switzerland), the
main incentives offered to foreign investors at that time included exemptions from various
regulations imposed on onshore banks and a favorable fiscal treatment.
2.
The separate offshore supervisory framework was eliminated in 2002. As part of the
planned accession into the EU, Malta was required to amend its financial policies to treat local
businesses the same as international companies. In the mid-1990s, Malta started abolishing its
offshore banking. In 2002, the legal amendments to the Banking Law removed an offshore banking
option. Since then, all banks operate under the same regulatory and fiscal frameworks.
3.
However, Malta maintained a substantial tax incentive for attracting foreign investors
in its banking and other businesses. This was achieved through tax refunds based on the
dividends that a local bank distributes to its shareholders. While the headline corporate income tax
rate in Malta is 35 percent, the application of a tax refund system positions Malta as the country
with one of the lowest effective tax in the EU, which ranges between 0 and 12 percent. The quantum
of the tax refund depends on the nature of income and is generally equal to 6/7th of the underlying
tax (35 percent), resulting in a 30 percent tax refund of the taxable profits.
4.
In addition, the EU accession in 2004 and the euro adoption in 2008 boosted
international banking and non-bank financial sector activities in Malta. Several large banking
groups from various countries around the world (Australia, Germany, Saudi Arabia, etc) established
their presence in Malta since the mid-2000s. The EU and euro area memberships inspired
confidence; the former also allowed non-EU investors an easy access to European markets, while the
latter facilitated transactions for EU-based investors. The availability of skilled people and the use of
English as the official language also contributed to making Malta an attractive place for doing
business by the multinational banks.
5.
As a result, the internationally-active banks have become large compared to the size
of the Maltese economy. As of October 2012, there were 13 non-core domestic banks and
8 international banks, with assets of respectively €5.3 billion (80 percent of GDP) and €33.1 billion
(500 percent of GDP). The majority of these banks are subsidiaries of EU banks offering a range of
services to non-residents that include trade finance, investment banking, and group funding
operations.
6.
Unlike some other EU countries with a big international financial centre (for example,
Cyprus or Ireland), Malta has not experienced any deleveraging pressures in recent years. As a
result, measured by the total bank assets to GDP ratio, Malta now ranks higher than Cyprus or
Ireland, and is second only to Luxembourg among all EU countries.

Finally, the AML/CFT regime in Malta remains largely untested, and the rapid growth
in financial sector activities calls for further strengthening it. Most of the right laws and
regulations are in place in Malta, and progress in strengthening the AML/CFT regime has been
achieved in recent years. The 2012 report of MONEYVAL (the Council of Europe Committee of
Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures) notes that the money laundering
offences in Malta are broad and fully cover the elements of the Vienna and Palermo Conventions.1
The legal base for financing of terrorism is also broadly in line with the international standards, and
even goes beyond the minimum required by the Terrorist Financing Convention in some areas.
However, the framework remains largely untested, and the AML/CFT laws and regulations have not
been sufficiently used. As a result, the MONEYVAL concluded that the effectiveness of the system is
difficult to assess. Some of the conclusions of the 2012 MONEYVAL Report are:

2

The AML/CFT framework in Malta is periodically assessed by MONEYVAL. A comprehensive MONEYVAL
assessment of the compliance with the FATF 40 Recommendations and 9 Special Recommendations was
conducted in 2007. Since then two progress reports were made to MONEYVAL and a follow up targeted
assessment was performed in June 2011 (4th assessment visit) which focused on key and core FATF
Recommendations as well as those for which Malta had received non-compliant and partially compliant ratings
in the 2007 assessment. The report on the 4th assessment visit was adopted by MONEYVAL in March 2012. The
2007 MONEYVAL Report, the progress reports and the 2012 4th Assessment Report can be found at



While the comprehensive reporting obligations are now in place in Malta, the level of
reporting of suspicious transactions for both money laundering and terrorism financing
remains relatively low.



The current Maltese legislation provides for broad measures in terms of powers of
sanctioning of subject persons for non compliance, but these sanctions have not been
sufficiently used, and the financial penalties that have been imposed were not necessarily
dissuasive. No sanctions have been imposed on the financial institutions.



The practice of joint inspections carried out by MFSA and FIAU (the financial intelligence unit
of Malta) is a welcome step that has certainly contributed towards strengthening the
supervisory regime. However, the number of the on-site visits remains low and not
commensurate with the size of the financial market.



The absence of a national risk assessment to identify the most risky areas for money
laundering/terrorist financing gives rise to concerns with regard to the effective
implementation of risk based supervisory activity.

Appendix IV. Restructuring Enemalta in the Context of a New
1
Energy Reform Plan
1.

The delicate financial position of the national utility company, Enemalta2, has added to
Malta’s fiscal pressures. The budget has been providing subsidies to cover the company’s
losses, and government-guaranteed debt has been rising in line with Enemalta’s increasing debt.
The company’s losses amounted to 70 million euro (1 percent of GDP) in 2012, 36 percent of
which were covered by the budget. In turn, Enemalta’s total debt in 2012 grew to 836 million
euro (12.4 percent of GDP), of which 85 percent is guaranteed by the government.

2.
Enemalta’s poor financial performance reflects the company’s exposure to oil prices,
the lack of timely and cost-reflective adjustments in electricity tariffs, and inefficiency costs.
Enemalta’s operations have been consistently loss-making for two reasons. First, the company has
had to assume losses ensuing from the increase in international oil prices. About 75 percent of
Enemalta’s costs are fuel-related and the company is not allowed to pass oil price increases to final
consumer tariffs, as electricity prices for industrial customers in Malta are among the highest in
Europe. Indeed, to avoid further tariff hikes, the government has been supporting Enemalta through
subsidies. This situation reflects the fact that Malta is highly dependent on energy imports. Its
energy dependence ratio is 100 percent, which is above the Euro Area average of 68.9 percent. On
the other hand, Enemalta also has important inefficiency costs. The technical losses in distribution
are estimated at 4.6 percent, and an additional 5.2 percent arises from unbilled electricity in relation
to meter deficiencies and theft.

3.
In December 2012, Parliament approved a plan to restructure the company’s
debt to ensure payment of outstanding obligations, while avoiding increases in tariffs.
The restructuring plan involves setting a special purpose vehicle (SPV) - Vault Finance. The SPV is
a financing intermediary that would allow Enemalta to reschedule debt repayments by aligning
available cash flows from tariff income, and smooth the effects of bullet repayments by
transforming loan repayments into a rental expense of about 20 million euro per year. Enemalta
has contributed to the asset side of the SPV by selling and leasing-back from the SPV two power
stations and other properties. On the the liability side, the utility company initially transferred
243.5 million Euros worth of debt by settling the loan and taking out a new loan, for the same
amount, in the name of Vault Finance. A further 75 million worth of debt will be transferred to
the SPV in 2015, to settle a loan due, on that date, to its German creditor, Depfa. To sum up,
Enemalta’s interest payments on the debt transferred to Vault Finance and the depreciation
expenditure of the assets sold and leased-back from it are substituted with a rental charge. This
rent is meant to cover both principal and interest payments of the SPV’s new loan.
4.
Enemalta’s debt restructuring is an essential part of a larger energy reform
plan, which aims at reducing electricity generation costs, lowering tariffs, and diversifying
energy sources. The energy agenda of the new government seeks to lower the cost of
electricity generation by reducing the dependence on oil and the costs emanating from
operational inefficiencies. The government pledged to pass the savings brought about by these
measures to the final consumer in the form of lower electricity tariffs. In this context,
households’ electricity tariffs are expected to be reduced by 25 percent, starting in March 2014.
Tariffs charged to industrial customers are expected to be reduced in March 2015. To lower the
cost of electricity generation, Enemalta has embarked on several major investment projects that
need financing. Some projects will be financed through private public partnerships (PPP), and
other investments require funding from European Investment Bank (EIB).


50

Enemalta will widen its energy mix through the interconnector to Sicily, which is scheduled
to be completed by 2014. Connecting the Maltese electricity grid to the European grid will

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALTA

allow Malta to secure energy supplies by reducing its dependency on a single fuel and its
exposure to fuel price shocks. Further, Malta will benefit from economies of scale of larger
plants with more competitive prices, and the increased capacity will allow the old Marsa
power station to be phased out. This will reduce the costs associated with the operational
inefficiencies.


The new government is also pursuing various projects to reduce electricity generation costs
by shifting towards natural gas power generation and renewable energy sources.



A new gas-fired power plant will be built and is expected to become fully operational by
2015. This new plant will be configured so as to operate exclusively on natural gas. In turn,
the supply of natural gas requires the construction of infrastructure for receiving, storing,
and re-gasifying liquefied natural gas.



The new gas-fired plant and gas supply infrastructure will be financed through public private
partnerships (PPP). In April 2013, the government issued an Expressions of Interest and
Capability (EoIC) to enter into a power purchase agreement and a gas supply agreement
with the private sector. The successful tenderer(s) will build, own, and operate the gas and
power plants at Enemalta. Enemalta will lease properties to the private partner(s), and the
latter will make an upfront payment to the utility company. Enemalta will use this sum to
pay the SPV rent until profitability is restored.



The liquefied natural gas infrastructure will supply power to Enemalta’s old heavy fuel oil
power plant, but the latter will eventually be converted to run on natural gas. This project
will be undertaken by Enemalta.



Malta’s current renewable energy production is 0.4 percent of its gross final consumption,
which is the lowest in the EU and below the targets foreseen for 2012. To meet the EU 2020
target of producing 10 percent of energy through alternative sources, the government has
engaged in large wind farm energy projects, but progress has been slow. The uptake of
projects such as the installation of photovalvic power and solar water heaters has exceeded
the government targets, but the contribution of these initiatives is small. In response to
these challenges, the government will launch a comprehensive renewable energy policy
framework by the end of summer 2013.



The policy framework will include measures to promote the purchase of solar panels and
bio-fuel transport, improved management of street lighting, and government support for
private investment in renewables.



Finally, the government has implemented several measures to contain the operational and
efficiency losses of the company. To enhance revenue collection and avoid theft, Enemalta
has invested in activating a large number of smart meters. Moreover, operational
inefficiencies are being addressed through a cost rationalization program. Together, these

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

51

MALTA

measures could improve the company’s cash-flow position by around 40 million in 2013,
and about 20 million in the following year.
5.
The government’s plans to restructure Enemalta’s debt, reduce electricity
generation costs and diversify energy sources are appropriate. However, the risks ensuing
from these initiatives warrant close monitoring. The government expects Enemalta to breakeven
by 2015. To meet its financial obligations, including the SPV rent, during the bridge years, the
utility company is expected to rely on government subsidies, operational efficiency savings,
energy reduction costs brought about by the Sicily interconnector, and the upfront payment
from the PPP private tender. It is crucial that electricity tariffs are only reduced once electricity
generation and transmission costs are successfully lowered and the company’s financial health is
restored. In this regard, the timely completion of the interconnector to Sicily is essential.
Furthermore, it is important to make Enemalta’s financial reporting more timely and enhance
transparency by issuing progress reports on Enemalta’s restructuring and the government’s
energy reform plan. This would contribute to the identification of inefficiencies and
vulnerabilities that could put additional strain on the company’s financial position and the
budget, thus allowing authorities to act promptly.

Appendix V. Pension and Health Care Reform

Medium-Term Risks of Ageing-Related Spending
The fiscal impact of an ageing population is expected to be significant in Malta.

14
According to the 2012 Ageing Working
12
Group (AWG)2 report, the expected
10
increases in age-related government
8
spending in Malta could pose significant
6
risks to the sustainability of public
4
finances. Under the reference scenario,
2
which focuses on the budgetary impact of
0
demographic developments, strictly-age-2
related public spending3 will increase by
8.2 percentage points of GDP
between 2010 and 2060. In turn, under the
risk scenario4, Malta will experience the
second highest increase in age-related
spending within the EU, which will amount to
11.3 percentage points of GDP between 2010
and 2060.

2.
The main challenge for Malta is to
curb the expected increase in public pension
and health care spending. Between 2010
and 2060, public pension expenditure will
increase by 5.5 percentage points of GDP,
reaching a level 15.9 percent of GDP in 2060. In
turn, the share of health care age-related
expenditure is expected to reach 8.3 percent of
GDP in 2060, up from a level of 5.4 percent of
GDP in 2010.

The Ageing Working Group (AWG) is commissioned by the European Commission and mandated by the
Economic Policy committee, and does not incorporate reforms legislated after December 2011. For countries
that have implemented reforms since December 2011, the report estimates are not the latest projections
3

In contrast to total age-related spending, strictly age-related spending excludes unemployment benefits. This
is due to the fact that the latter are driven by cyclical factors

4

The AWG risk scenario takes into account the impact of non-demographic drivers of health care and longterm care expenditure (such as technological changes and institutional mechanisms). The risk scenario assumes
a more dynamic spending growth in the beginning of the projection period in line with past trends for the EU
as a whole. This scenario puts more pressure on public budgets.

Pension and Health Care Reform by Authorities
3.
The path for future reforms to the public pension and health care systems is not yet
well-defined. The 2006 reform initiatives to the public pension system started being implemented
in 2007. However, some of the legislated changes, most notably the increase in the retirement age,
have been slow. What is more, the consultation process following the launch of the 2010 report of
the Pensions Working Group, presented a number of recommendations for further reform. But the
government has yet to agree on the reform agenda going forward. With respect to the health care
system, as far as population coverage is concerned, no changes have been made through
legislation. Nevertheless, the benefit packages have been modified in ways that have not
contributed to restrain public spending.
4.
The Maltese public pension system consists of a mandatory earnings-related
framework, which is financed on pay-as-you-go (PAYG) basis. The system covers all strata of the
Maltese society5, and contributions are payable on a weekly basis by all gainfully occupied persons
between the age of 16 and the retirement age (employees, self-occupied or self-employed persons).


In the early 2000’s, basic demographic trends suggested that the system had become
unsustainable. Between 2003 and 2050 the share of the population aged 61 and above is
expected to grow, while the share of those aged between 16 and 61 is set to decline. By 2050,
each person in the working age population is expected to support 0.8 non-active persons,
compared to 0.6 non-active persons in 2003. Further, while in 2003 there were around 4 persons
in employment for every retired person; by 2050 this estimate is expected to drop to 2
employed people per retired person6.



To address these concerns, a pension reform was enacted in 2006. The main measures are
listed in Table 1. In addition to these measures, every 5 years the Ministry of Social Security is
committed to prepare a report reviewing the Public Pensions System, upon which further
recommendations could be made.



From the first of these reports, 45 additional recommendations were issued, thus
suggesting that a second reform is warranted. The recommendations made by the Pensions
Working Group in December 2010 are summarized in Table 1. To date, these recommendations
have not yet been legislated, and the consultation process following the 2010 strategic review
report of the Pensions Working Group continued through 2012.

5

The system includes the provision of retirement pensions as well as survivor’s benefits and invalidity pensions.

6

These estimates correspond to the results reported in the 2007 EC Occasional Papers Series No. 35, pp. 246,
http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/publication_summary10175_en.htm. The results were based
on the World Bank's pension reform options simulation toolkit–PROST, which was run by the Economic Policy
Division of the Ministry of Finance.

Public health care expenditure in Malta is relatively low compared to other EU
countries. This is partly explained by the fact that Malta has fewer hospital beds and fewer
1
physicians per 100,000 inhabitants than other countries in the European Union . Further, the system
is highly centralized and operates within a small jurisdiction that is densely populated.

1

As of 2009, Malta had a similar number of beds per 100,000 inhabitants as Greece, Netherlands and Slovenia.
Germany and Austria had a higher number of hospital beds. There have been various efforts, across EU
member states to decrease the number of hospital beds, since a lower number of beds is meant to lead to
financial and operational efficiency.



The public health care system is mainly funded through taxation and operates through
public hospitals and health care centers. 65 percent of total health expenditure is financed
through general taxation. This is complemented by private financing expenditure (33 percent)
and private health insurance (2 percent). The latter is a voluntary system that provides
supplementary financing and does not replace mandatory statutory contributions. Public
hospitals and health care centers are available to all residents and offer primary, secondary and
2
tertiary health care services free of charge . Primary health care is offered by the public and
private systems, although they function independently. Secondary and tertiary care is mainly
provided by specialized public hospitals of varying size and function.



The Government is facing an increasing burden from health care expenditure. The Maltese
are ageing and living longer, and the private health insurance sector is small. Private insurance
coverage is becoming more unaffordable due to spiraling health care costs, while public hospital
care has been upgraded. Hence, fewer people are seeking private full insurance coverage, and
more individuals are shifting to public health care in spite of the insurance cover available.3



Health care reform in Malta has focused on quality issues, but it has ignored the need to
curb public spending. Under the previous government, there was political controversy
regarding the effects that the planned reduction in public current spending could have on the
health care sector. The measures that have been implemented include an increase in the number
of medicines provided, and the introduction of new services which, previously, were only offered

2

Provisions include free medical services at Health Centers and free hospitalization. No user charges or copayments apply. There are a few services that are provided subject to means testing. These include dental
treatment, optical services and certain formulary medicines. Patients are sent overseas for highly specialized
care required for rare diseases. The private sector acts as a complementary mechanism for health care
coverage, funded by out of pocket payments and private health insurance.

This private health insurance rate is estimated at 21 percent of the population, the same as in 2002. Further,
only 10 percent of the population benefits from an extensive refund plan. The rest subscribe to policies for very
limited refunds. Those covered by basic plans find their policy useful when paying for low-valued medical
consultations, but private hospitalization exceeds their benefit limits. In addition, patients with a full refund
scheme choose to use public hospitals, as treatment offered there is more intensive and sophisticated.

in the UK. Efforts to reform primary health care by giving doctors more access to patient
information have been implemented. These measures are expected to improve efficiency and
possibly alleviate health care costs, but the benefits are likely to materialize only in the long run.
Staff Assessment and Further Recommendations
6.
The Malta-2012 IMF Article IV Concluding Statement supported the main
recommendations of the Pensions Working Group. The staff judged that further pension reform
would contribute to address the anticipated long term fiscal imbalances ensuing from an ageing
population, while supporting medium-term growth. In particular, the staff favored the proposals of
indexing retirement age to longevity, accelerating the planned increase in retirement age, and
introducing a mandatory privately funded second pillar and voluntary third pillar.
7.
Further recommendations include measures to increase the involvement of the private
sector and to encourage labor participation. In the absence of second or third pillar pension
schemes, and given the existence of a number of voluntary long-term savings products,
private/funded pensions could complement the PAYG system if accompanied with fiscal incentives
for savers. Addressing existing bottlenecks in labor market participation is also important. Some
progress has been achieved in retaining older workers in employment, and measures to encourage
female labor participation have been implemented. Yet, further efforts are warranted as the female
employment rate in Malta remains the lowest in the EU.
8.
The sustainability of the health care system requires measures that increase the role of
private health care providers and improve the efficiency of the system. Since public financing is
prevalent, sources of funding other than general taxation should be explored. Public Private
Partnerships (PPPs) could be considered for undertaking business operations and care delivery.
Further, since the private health insurance market is small, the government could intervene to
stimulate and regulate the buying of insurance. The health care market is highly concentrated. Over
95 percent of hospital beds are publicly owned, which implies that there is considerable scope for
increasing private sector involvement. This requires the setup of control mechanisms and the
provision of proper incentives. Regulatory reform is also necessary to control costs by changing the
behavior of practitioners and patients.

Appendix VI. Factors Influencing Wage Determination in
1
Malta
1.
The recent crisis has brought to the fore the negative consequences of the
misalignment of wage and productivity growth. Wage growth in Malta has surpassed
productivity growth resulting in increases in unit labor costs. The current discussion on structural
reforms to increase competitiveness and decrease labor cost in the euro area periphery has
underscored the need for a better understanding of the determinants of wage growth, and reforms
needed in the labor market in Malta. As discussed in Appendix II, Malta has lagged other euro area
peers in terms of price competitiveness measures and, despite progress in narrowing differentials,
increases in unit labor costs continue to outpace the euro area average. This note discusses possible
ways of reforming the wage determination process in Malta so that wage growth is more in tune
with productivity growth.

The productivity and compensation
gap differs amongst sectors. The lack of
sectoral productivity data makes it difficult to
identify the sectors where the labor market
inefficiency is the highest, in terms of the gap
between productivity and wages. We use
gross value added as a proxy for productivity
and find that the gap is the highest for the
agriculture, forestry, and fishing sectors,
industry, and construction. On the other
hand, the gap is the lowest for arts,
entertainment, professional, and financial
services.

MALTA

3.
Wage indexation and collective agreements are two key features of Malta’s wage
determination. In Malta, wages are predominantly regulated by collective agreements at the
company level, and a cost of living adjustment (COLA) is imposed by legislation. COLA is added to
the pay of all workers based on the average inflation rate of the previous 12 months, as calculated
by the Retail Price Index (RPI). Wage indexation is a feature of Malta’s labor market, which is present
in only three other euro area countries, namely Cyprus, Belgium, and Luxembourg. The idea of wage
indexation is to link wages to the living costs with the aim of preserving the real wages, and thereby,
the living standard of people. In Belgium, Cyprus and Luxembourg, the cost of adjustment is
calculated using the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The wage adjustment is done every year in Malta
and Belgium and every six months in Luxembourg and Cyprus. In Luxembourg, the wage indexation
is applied only if the CPI rises above 2.5 percent.

5.
The current wage setting process may be partly responsible for the downward rigidity
of wages and inflation during economic slowdowns. Excessive wage increases can trigger risk of
inflation spirals—a process when the rise in inflation causes wages to increase, and as a second
round response, the rise in wages in turn increase inflation further. Although there is no sign of selfperpetuating inflation spiral in Malta, the inflation differential vis-à-vis the euro area has been high.
The growth in compensation of employees, headline and core inflation, relative to their historical
averages, in the year after economic slowdown, for the period 2001-2012, was higher in Malta,
Belgium, Cyprus and Luxembourg than in other euro area economies (excluding the four countries
with wage indexation mechanism). However, the fall in output, relative to historical average, was also
lower in these countries than the euro area countries during economic slowdown episodes making it

of the collective agreement. As emphasized by the
incorporated, but that the result of the negotiations was to lower
wages a bit in exchange of labor hoarding.
Governor of Malta in a recent speech1, rather than
imposing it on the collective agreements, the COLA increase due to wage indexation should form
part of the negotiation process. This would ensure that the COLA increase is to some extent
included in the wage rise due to productivity growth, and make the wage negotiation system more
efficient.

difficult to assess whether the stickiness of wages
and inflation can be completely attributable to the
wage indexation mechanism.
6.
A recent survey commissioned by the
Central Bank of Malta also shows evidence of
downward wage rigidity. A recent survey2 of 161
firms in 2008 revealed that firms usually opt to
reduce the cost of production by decreasing nonlabor costs during negative economic shocks,
rather than decreasing wages. The labor market
inflexibility is also exhibited by the fact that firms
opt for a freeze in wages as opposed to a cut in
wages. Even during periods with high labor supply,
firms usually do not lower wages due to the
implicit impact on work effort.

Malta’s wage setting process could also lead to higher mismatch in the labor market.
The job vacancy rate in Malta is one of the highest in the euro area. Moreover, for a given job
vacancy rate, the unemployment rate is one of the highest in the euro area, indicating less efficiency
and more mismatch in the labor market. The fact that the unemployment is relatively high during
periods of high vacancy rate or high demand for labor suggests that the employers may hesitate in
recruiting due to the wage setting mechanism, which results in higher wages and less downward

The COLA should be part of the negotiation process. The staff condones the Governor’s
recommendation that the COLA should be part of the negotiation process, rather than imposed on
collective agreements by legislation. In that light, it is a positive development that a number of
collective agreements already incorporate the COLA increase. This would prevent from
compounding the problem of misalignment of productivity and wage growth due to the addition of
COLA on the company level collective agreement.
10.
Wage negotiations should take productivity at the firm or enterprise level into
consideration. The analysis on the gap between sector gross value added and compensation
suggests that this gap is not same all across sectors, and wage negotiation needs to take this into
account. The authorities should take initiative to produce productivity data on sectoral levels so that
the issue of productivity can be discussed during wage negotiation. The wage indexation
mechanism could only be implemented to sectors where the compensation is lower than the gross
value added by that sector. The other alternative would be to complement the wage determination
process in certain sectors with better measures to improve productivity in such sectors. The
negotiated wage could be conditional on the improvement of productivity to provide incentives to
make the production process more efficient.
11.
The wage setting process should not hinder job creation. The fact that Malta has one of
the highest vacancy rates in the euro area and the highest unemployment rate for the level of
vacancy rate strongly hints that wage setting mechanism possibly has a detrimental impact on the
hiring of employees. Measures and initiatives should be taken to make the labor market more
flexible, and to give more leeway to the employers in setting the pay of their workers. The supply
side factors also need to be improved so that there is a better match between the jobs offered by
the employers and the skills offered by the employees.

12.
Reforms in wage indexation could help in aligning productivity with wages in Malta.
While the abolishment of wage indexation may not be politically feasible and may also raise social
equitable considerations, a gradual moderation in the indexation mechanism could help in making
the labor market more efficient and competitive. Some of the possible reforms that the authorities
could take are listed below:

Scope of coverage: The wage indexation mechanism could only be applied for wages less than a
certain threshold. Such a mechanism would assure the social equitable issues while not making
the entire labor market inefficient.


Index wages only if inflation is above a threshold level. Instead of applying wage indexation for all
inflation levels, the mechanism could be operated only when the inflation rises above a
threshold level. This is practiced in Luxembourg where the wage indexation is implemented
when the inflation is above 2.5 percent.



Adjust RPI weights more frequently to reflect current standards of living. The wage indexation in
Malta is done using the retail price index as the benchmark of the cost of living adjustment. The
RPI measures price changes but does not take into account the manner in which households
change their pattern of expenditure. Consequently, newly significant goods are not included in
the RPI. According to documents released by Malta’s National Statistics Office, the weights are
updated almost once every decade. The last update was done in 2000–01. To make the wage
indexation more relevant, the RPI weights should be adjusted on a more regular basis. This
would ensure that the COLA accurately reflects the impact of prices on the living standards of
people.

Appendix VII. Debt Sustainability Analysis
1.

The public debt to GDP ratio has been on a rising path since 2007. The general
government debt-to-GDP ratio increased from 60.9 in 2008 to 72.1 in 2012. Besides financing
the deficit, since 2010 the Government has also issued debt to fund the loans made to the
countries affected by the crisis through the European Financial Stability Facility and the
European Stability Mechanism. Under the baseline scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected
to peak in 2015 at a level of 74.5 percent. Under current policies, the primary balance is only
expected to turn into surplus in 2016. This will help stabilize debt below 74 percent of GDP by
2018.

2.

The stock of contingent liabilities, largely in the form of government debt guarantees,
continued to increase. Government guaranteed debt amounted to 17.6 percent of GDP in
2012, 6.1 percentage points higher than in 2008. About 60 percent of the guaranteed debt
corresponds to Enemalta (the national utility company), which has been facing financial
problems for a number of years.

3.

In order to assess the sustainability of debt a number of adverse shocks are
considered.



A ½ standard deviation permanent shock to economic growth is expected to place debt on an
increasing path, whereby it would reach a level of 84 percent of GDP by 2018.



A ½ standard deviation shock to the general government primary balance would stabilize debt
at 75 percent of GDP, slightly above the baseline forecast.



A one-time shock to contingent liabilities is also assessed, because the latter are sizeable and
essential to the dynamics of public debt. The shock is assumed to amount to 10 percentage
points of GDP and to be originated in 2014. This shock captures the case where some
contingent liabilities are called upon and recorded on the government’s balance sheet. Under
this scenario, the debt–to-GDP ratio increases sharply to 84 percent, and then remains roughly
at that level.

4.

The structure of public debt (Figure 2) is predominantly in the form of long-term securities
excluding financial derivatives and held by resident credit institutions and households.

e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on
GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels

STATISTICAL INFORMATION
(As of May 28, 2013)
Data provision is adequate for surveillance purposes. Significant progress in improving
macroeconomic statistics has been made in close cooperation with the European Central Bank (ECB)
and Eurostat while upgrading statistical systems to meet the euro area standards1. Most
macroeconomic statistics can now be accessed through Eurostat. The country has been a participant
in the GDDS since September 11, 2000, with the metadata posted on the IMF’s Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board.
Real sector statistics: Data on retail and consumer prices, labor market indicators, and tourism
arrivals are released monthly, usually with a short lag. These data are available through Eurostat and
via the Internet at the Central Bank of Malta (CBM) and the National Statistical Office (NSO)
websites. Presently the NSO releases national accounts data in euros with one quarter lag. However,
national accounts data have remained subject to substantial revisions, often affecting several years.
The reasons for revisions generally include (i) large statistical discrepancies (captured under stock
building), particularly on the first release, (ii) changes in data classification for large shipments of oil
exports and imports, and (iii) revisions of deflators. Furthermore, supply-side GDP estimates by type
of economic activity are only available at current prices. The producer price index for manufacturing
has been published, but that for services sector is still under discussion. National accounts imports
and exports data are not disaggregated into goods and services. The harmonized index of consumer
prices was first published in May 2004. It is recommended that the Maltese authorities start to
compile the financial balance sheets and transactions by sectors, household debt, and saving rate.
Government finance statistics: Fiscal statistics meet basic requirements, with quarterly accrualbased data on general government operations compiled in accordance with the ESA95 methodology
and disseminated with a one-quarter lag. The general government comprises data from the
consolidated fund of government adjusted to include other accounts of government, the accruals
elements, and the financial performance of the Extra Budgetary Units and of the Local Councils. The
NSO also publishes monthly statistics on the cash operations of the central government, for which
the authorities plan to utilize the targeted timeliness flexibility option in light of additional time
required for the final month of the fiscal year.
Monetary and financial statistics: Monetary statistics are timely and of good quality. Since the
entry into the euro area in January 2008, monetary data for IMF statistical publications are now
obtained through a gateway arrangement with the ECB, thus reducing the reporting burden of the
country. The country participated in the pilot project—Coordinated Compilation Exercise—for

1

The 2007/08 Eurostat peer review on the implementation of the European Statistics Code of Practice found
that the NSO had reached a remarkable compliance with large parts of the Code despite its small size, but
underscored the need to improve adequacy of resources and data quality management.

Financial Soundness Indicators and submitted indicators as of end-2005 along with metadata, which
are now available to the public through the IMF’s website (http://fsi.imf.org).
External sector statistics: Summary data (merchandise trade, current account balance, and selected
financial account data) are released on a quarterly basis with a lag of about three months. More
detailed BOP and IIP data are released annually, the latter with a lag sometimes exceeding one year.
The balance of payments data are usually subject to large revisions. Summary trade statistics are
released monthly with a lag of about 40 days. The CBM also publishes the external debt templates in
line with requirements of the SDDS, including both gross and net external debt.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Malta
On June 19, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Malta.1
Malta has shown remarkable resilience in the face of a major crisis in Europe. Since the
beginning of the crisis, the average growth of the Maltese economy has been one of the best
in the euro area and the unemployment rate remains one of the lowest. This resilience was
underpinned by robust service sector export growth and a sound banking sector. As a result,
the current account balance has improved gradually in recent years, turning into surplus in
2012. However, economic growth slowed in 2012 and remains below potential, reflecting a
weak external environment and subdued domestic demand. Although activity is expected to
pick up moderately going forward, uncertainties abound. A protracted period of slower
growth in Europe or re-emergence of euro area financial stress would negatively affect the
Maltese economy.
The performance of Maltese banks has been satisfactory, despite turbulence in the euro area.
All banks report adequate capitalization, liquidity, and profitability and are well positioned to
transition to the Basel III regime. In contrast to many European countries, domestic banks’
deposits and credit to the private sector continued to increase in 2012, albeit at a slower pace
than in 2010-11. However, these banks are heavily exposed to the local property market and
loan loss provisions are low. The large international banking segment and smaller group of
non-core domestic banks have limited balance sheet exposures to the Maltese economy, but
recent events in Europe have heightened perceptions about risks of hosting a large banking
segment in a small country. In response, the authorities have strengthened supervision and
monitoring of banks’ liquidity positions.
After notable progress in 2011, the fiscal position deteriorated in 2012 amid the election
cycle, and the high level of public debt and guaranteed debt constrains the fiscal space in the

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary
is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found

event of further shocks. Against this backdrop, the European Commission has recently
decided to initiate the excessive deficit procedure for Malta. The government’s deficit target
of 2.7 percent of GDP in 2013 appears unattainable in light of expansionary discretionary
measures, optimistic revenue targets, and developments so far. The new government is
committed to restructure Enemalta, the loss making and highly indebted public utilities
corporation, and has embarked on a major energy reform program to reduce energy costs and
diversify energy sources.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Malta’s resilience through the global and European crises,
which has been underpinned by solid macroeconomic and financial fundamentals.
Nevertheless, with the growth outlook vulnerable to external and fiscal risks, Directors
encouraged the authorities to continue to pursue prudent policies and deepen structural
reforms.
Directors noted that the banking system is sound and that risks from its large international
bank segment appear contained because of limited balance sheet exposures to the domestic
economy. However, they called for stronger efforts to monitor developments in all banks,
given the size of the banking sector relative to GDP, some weakening in asset quality, and
concentration of loans to the real estate and construction sectors. Directors welcomed the
progress in strengthening the regulatory framework for banks and the recent establishment of
the Joint Financial Stability Board. They encouraged additional steps to shore up the
resilience, including by tightening rules on loan loss provisioning and boosting the funding of
deposit insurance. The increasing complexity of Malta’s financial sector also warrants further
strengthening of the anti-money laundering regime. Looking ahead, Directors encouraged the
authorities to participate in Fund’s Financial Sector Assessment Program.
Directors underscored the importance of reducing the fiscal deficit this year and achieving a
balanced budget over the medium term. In this context, they generally emphasized the need
for stronger measures to rein in current expenditure, particularly the wage bill, and to
advance pension and health care reforms. Restoring the profitability and viability of public
corporations would also help reinforce Malta’s fiscal position.
More broadly, Directors agreed that fiscal governance would benefit from a clear rules-based
multi-year policy framework that would reinforce the linkage between annual budget laws
and the medium-term target. An independent fiscal council would also support the credibility
of the government’s consolidation plans.
Directors underscored that steady implementation of structural reforms is essential to achieve
a higher growth trajectory and enhance competitiveness. Priority should be given to
diversifying the economy, improving the business environment, encouraging female
participation to the labor force, enhancing education attainment, and strengthening
wage-setting mechanisms by better aligning wages with productivity growth. Timely
implementation of the energy reform will also be helpful.

Statement by Andrea Montanino, Executive Director for Malta and
Antonio Bassanetti, Senior Advisor
June 19, 2013
The Authorities of Malta thank staff for the useful discussions during the IMF mission
and for a broadly fair and objective Report. The assessment points to the strong
fundamentals of the Maltese economy. Some challenges emerge, in particular on the
fiscal side, but Authorities reiterate their strong commitment to reduce the deficit-to-GDP
ratio within the EU limits already in 2013.
Outlook
The Maltese economy proved to be notably resilient since the onset of the global crisis.
Authorities broadly agree with staff’s outlook projections anticipating an acceleration of
GDP in the current and coming years, mostly driven by the strengthening of domestic
demand. Exports are foreseen to expand and the current account balance should maintain
a positive sign. Inflation is expected to moderate. While taking into account the
significant degree of uncertainty surrounding macro projections, we consider risks to
GDP forecasts to be broadly balanced.
Fiscal Policy
The fiscal slippage recorded in 2012 was partly attributable to a rather prolonged period
of political uncertainty culminating in the rejection of the November 2012 budget and the
subsequent call for elections. Such uncertainty was a factor behind the weaker domestic
demand, with signs that private consumption was postponed. This deterioration was in
contrast with fundamentals – particularly wages and employment growth – further
suggesting that such developments were likely to be transitory. This also created cash
flow constraints on a number of private operators. As a result revenue, especially from
indirect taxes, was significantly weaker than expected. Authorities are convinced that
now that the democratic process has taken its due course and a new administration is in
place, economic activity will recover in line with fundamentals. Together with a number
of structural measures this should influence positively the public finance situation in
2013.
In particular, Authorities remain firmly committed to close the current year with a deficit
below the 3 percent threshold. To pursue the goal, several initiatives are being
implemented, both on the expenditure and, mostly, on the revenue side.
On the expenditure side, a Spending Review Unit has already been set up within the
Ministry of Finance to identify cost savings through the elimination of waste and
inefficiencies. Further, the 2006 reform of the pension system is estimated to reduce
expenditure and increase revenues from social contributions. The stepping up of the

2
efforts to curb fiscal abuse and to increase efficiency in revenue collection will also
provide a support. This shall be achieved through the acceleration of the process of
consolidating the various functions of Government revenue into one authority. The
largest part of the fiscal improvement, however, is estimated to reflect a tax revenue
buoyancy supported by the favorable composition of growth projections, the stronger
economic recovery and the easing of the above mentioned temporary cash flow
constraints.
Still, Authorities take note of the more pessimistic deficit projections of both staff and the
European Commission, mainly rooted in less favorable revenue developments. However,
on June 1, 2013 the Government launched a new Malta residence programme for non-EU
nationals, called Global Residence Programme. This scheme could have a positive impact
on the revenue side.
Further, in order to ensure the achievement of the target, Authorities will be monitoring
the fiscal situation on a month-by-month basis and be ready to intervene when and as
required. They are also in the process of implementing the necessary reforms to the fiscal
framework, including the introduction of numerical rules, independent fiscal institutions
and a binding medium term budgetary framework. Malta has also just ratified the Fiscal
Compact.
Finally, as noted by staff, the ongoing restructuring of Air Malta, the structural reforms in
the energy sector and the financial restructuring of Enemalta should minimize the risk of
a call on the contingent liabilities emanating from these major state-owned enterprises.
Financial Sector
Authorities concur with staff that the risks stemming from the relatively large Maltese
banking sector are contained. Core domestic banks, which are systemically important,
operate along traditional lines and have limited exposure to the countries which are under
pressure. Non-core domestic banks play a more restricted role. International banks, which
account for the largest share of the sector, have virtually no links with the domestic
economy and are therefore of low systemic significance. As a whole, the structure of the
Maltese banking sector is thus much different than those of stressed member States.
Further, as highlighted by the staff’s report, the sector is sound and robust. Capital
adequacy ratio, profitability, and liquidity measures are higher than the EU average.
Malta’s household wealth - the third largest in the euro area - contributes to the stability
of the retail deposit base. The absence of funding distress is confirmed also by the modest
recourse to Eurosystem financing.
Still, Authorities concur with staff that further improvements have to be achieved. In
particular, they will continue to call for more prudent dividend policies in order to: i)
further increase the banks’ capital base; ii) strengthen the Depositor Compensation
Scheme; iii) enhance loan loss provisioning. On the latter issue we note that, while loans
are mostly backed by real estate as collateral, the level of collateralization in Malta is

3
very high and a fairly conservative haircut is usually applied. Concentration risk is, to
some extent, unavoidable given the small dimension of the country. This
notwithstanding, the real estate market proved notably resilient in recent years and
currently there are no signs of overvaluation; in addition, as already emphasized, the
banks’ liquidity position is very good and should shield them from shortages of liquidity.
Authorities remain highly vigilant to preserve financial stability, as proved by the daily
monitoring of the liquidity position of banks that have been put in place since the onset of
the crisis in Cyprus. They are determined to maintain high supervisory standards. Further,
they aim at strengthening and updating the institutional framework: the establishment of
the Joint Financial Stability Board (JSB) early this year is a step forward to a closer
coordination among financial and monetary Authorities and responds to the European
Systemic Risk Board recommendation regarding the macro-prudential mandate at the
national level. So far, during its monthly meetings, the JFSB has devoted particular
attention to the NPLs issue to verify the possibility to improve on directives. In this
context, a revised Banking Rule (BR/09) will be implemented aiming at a more
conservative approach to accounting impairment provisioning. The BR/09 encompasses
also the implementation of conservative triggers to identify losses as early as possible;
moreover it will require institutions to allocate additional capital buffers to address
heightened levels of non-performing loans.
An FSAP will be required in due course. It is relevant to note that currently an asset
quality review is being planned in association with the Single Supervisory Mechanism
which is being set up by the ECB.
As regards the Anti Money Laundering regime, Authorities argue that most of the right
laws and regulations are in place in Malta, as noted by staff. Furthermore, the legal
framework for preventing terrorism activities is adequate and in line with international
standards; Authorities stress that, however, it has never been used because no suspicious
activities of terrorism financing have occurred in the country.
Competitiveness and structural reforms
The search for diversification of economic activities and market niches, especially in the
service sector, has been a key factor for the resilience of the Maltese economy. The
economic attractiveness of the country cannot be attributed just to a favourable tax
regime, though this element clearly plays a role given the very small scale of the
economy and its scanty endowment of natural resources. Other factors are crucial: the
stability of the country, its strategic geographical location, well developed
telecommunication infrastructures, relatively low costs of production, and the use of
English as an official language also in legislation.
Still, competitiveness needs to be continually strengthened. To this purpose, a national
reform agenda has been adopted. In particular, the new Government has set as top
priorities: the increase of the participation rate, especially of the female component;
higher educational attainments and improved labour force skills; a more efficient energy

4
production system. The latter, as acknowledged by the staff’s report, implies a broad
energy reform that will bring first results already in 2014 in terms of diversified sources,
with a much reduced dependency on oil, lower costs and tariffs, enhancement of the
energy company’s financial soundness.
Authorities take note of the staff’s suggestion to reform the wage setting mechanisms, in
particular its cost-of-living adjustment component. At the same time, they emphasize
that, according to a recent in-depth analysis, the current setting does not appear to have
resulted in major erosion of competitiveness in Malta and had only a marginal impact on
developments in the labour market. Indeed an important factor underpinning these results
pertains to the partial indexation feature of the wage setting mechanism as applied in
Malta.
As regards pensions, Authorities consider that the gradual increase in retirement age
adopted in the 2006 reform remains valid and do not think there is an urgency in further
accelerating the process. However they remain vigilant to ensure the long term
sustainability of the system. Legislation for a voluntary third pillar of private pensions
has already been approved and it will come into force in due time. Further, a Pensions
Strategy Group is being set up with the task of reviewing the recommendations outlined
by the Pensions Working Group, drawing a holistic strategy aimed at addressing the
adequacy and sustainability of pensions.
As concerns health care, Authorities take note of recommendations made by staff and
remain firmly committed to continue working on tightening controls on spending. In this
context, various internal control mechanisms and the monitoring of operational costs will
be introduced. Work is also underway on the setting up of a Health System Performance
Assessment Framework that links inputs with outputs and outcomes, to check for the
efficient use of resources.
Finally, Authorities are considering the establishment of a Development Bank to meet
medium and long-term financing needs, particularly for infrastructural, social and
environmental purposes. On this regard, they appreciate the useful suggestions put
forward by staff and will take them in due consideration.
