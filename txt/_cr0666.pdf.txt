The 2005 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Gaborone during
February 22–March 8, 2005. The staff met with Minister Gaolathe, Assistant Minister
Mlazie, and Permanent Secretary Tumelo of the Ministry of Finance and
Development Planning (MFDP); Governor Mohohlo of the Bank of Botswana (BoB);
other senior government officials; and representatives of the private sector, NGOs,
and the diplomatic and academic communities.

The staff team comprised Mr. Heytens (head), Mr. Akatu, Mr. Iimi, Ms. Kim (all
AFR), and Ms. Mbabazi-Moyo (MFD).

•

The Executive Board concluded the 2003 Article IV consultation on March 24, 2004.
Directors noted that Botswana’s sound macroeconomic policies and good governance
had contributed to sustained growth and low inflation, but emphasized the need to
step up efforts to diversify the economy and allocate adequate budgetary resources to
combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic while preserving macroeconomic stability.

•

Botswana has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4, and
maintains an exchange system free of restrictions in the making of transfers and
payments on current international transactions, except for a multiple currency practice
that is expected to expire in 2006 as discussed in paragraph 45. Botswana also
maintains a liberal regime for capital account transactions.

•

Botswana’s relations with the Fund, including recent technical assistance, and the
World Bank group are summarized in Appendixes I and II, respectively. Statistical
issues are discussed in Section IV and Appendix III, while the external and public
debt sustainability analyses are presented in Appendixes IV and V, respectively.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Notwithstanding Botswana's strong track record of macroeconomic performance, the
plateauing of diamond production and spread of HIV/AIDS are undermining past
achievements. One of the key challenges facing Botswana is to facilitate the transition away
from diamonds—which account for over one-third of GDP, 75 percent of exports, and
45 percent of government revenue—to a diversified economy that harnesses private sector
initiative and makes more rapid progress in employment creation and poverty reduction
while preserving macroeconomic stability. Compounding the difficulty of this task is the
rapid spread of HIV/AIDS—the prevalence rate among adults could exceed 35 percent—
which is necessitating increases in health spending at a time when budgetary resources are
becoming more constrained.
Botswana's long-term growth prospects, therefore, hinge critically on efforts to
accelerate structural reform and combat HIV/AIDS. The authorities are strengthening
their structural reform agenda and moving ahead with sector-specific development programs
(e.g., in tourism, agriculture, and mining outside the diamond enclave) with a view to
sustaining annual growth in the 5–6 percent range as targeted in their current medium-term
development plan. An interagency working group has initiated the integration of an updated
strategy to address HIV/AIDS based on the National Strategic Framework into the mediumterm budgetary framework. An allocation of about 1½ percent of GDP was made for
HIV/AIDS programs in the 2005/06 budget (April–March), and annual spending levels could
rise further over the next five years.
The authorities recognized the importance of fiscal adjustment to maintaining
macroeconomic stability. They reiterated their commitment to achieving balanced budgets
over the medium term and agreed with staff that significant additional fiscal adjustment (on
the order of 4–5 percent of GDP) may be necessary to achieve this objective. In this context,
the authorities indicated that fiscal adjustment would be stepped up in the context of the
2005/06 budget. To this end, cost recovery in the provision of some government services will
be increased through the imposition of user fees, efficiency in the civil service enhanced by
the introduction of a performance management system, and domestic tax collections
increased by further developing the institutional framework of the recently established
Botswana Unified Revenue Service.
The authorities have no plans to move away from the exchange rate peg in the nearterm, but are exploring their options with regard to the monetary policy framework.
They recognize that the conditions that have allowed them some measure of monetary
independence—especially the limited arbitrage by economic agents owing to the embryonic
state of financial market development—are unlikely to be sustained given the financial sector
reforms that are now under way. The authorities have initiated efforts to better understand the
monetary transmission mechanism, improve the functioning of the money market, and
strengthen their inflation forecasting capacity in anticipation of this eventuality.

To facilitate comparisons across countries and over time, social indicators from the United
Nations and the World Bank’s WDI database—which, in some instances, differ from national
data—are generally used in this report.

2

Botswana’s Gini coefficient was estimated at 0.57 in the latest Household Survey
(2002/03). Income distribution in countries with similar per capita income levels tends to be
more equal, with coefficients in the 0.3–0.4 range.

Box 1. Botswana’s Development Process
Botswana’s growth performance over the past 40 years has been exemplary by
global as well as regional standards. Botswana transformed itself from one of the
poorest countries in the world at independence in the mid-1960s to middle-income
status with a per capita GDP of over US$4,500. Through a combination of prudent
economic policies and sound governance—Botswana is ranked 31 out of 146 countries
globally in terms of transparency by Transparency International—the country has been
able to avoid the “resource curse” that has befallen other similarly favorably endowed
countries in Africa. In reflection of this, Botswana has been accorded the highest
sovereign credit rating (A) in the region.
However, Botswana has not fully escaped the symptoms of “Dutch Disease,”
which has constrained growth outside the diamond enclave. In particular, the
persistent tendency toward appreciation of the real exchange rate resulting from the
large inflows of diamond receipts has hurt the country’s competitiveness as both an
exporter and a foreign investment destination. Botswana’s unique geographic and
demographic features—being a sparsely populated, mostly arid, landlocked country
with a small domestic market—have also contributed to the lack of foreign investment
and slow growth outside the mining sector. In addition, agro-climatic conditions are
generally unfavorable to crop production, which has limited income-earning
opportunities in smallholder agriculture and informal sector trade.
The growth process has therefore been driven by the capital-intensive diamond
enclave, which has muted the socioeconomic benefits that typically result from
rapid growth. While social indicators have improved, this was not as broad-based or
as deep as in other countries with similar growth records (e.g., the newly industrialized
countries of Asia). In particular, the capital intensity of diamond mining and lack of
backward/forward linkages has meant that employment growth—the mining sector
employs less than 5 percent of the labor force—was not commensurate with that of
production. In addition, the slow development of labor-intensive industries as well as
labor market rigidities and low skill levels have also contributed to persistently high
unemployment and a skewed distribution of income. Further, foreign labor has also
filled jobs at both the high and low ends of the skill mix, with the latter coming
primarily from Botswana’s lower-income neighbors (e.g., Zimbabwe).
Botswana’s development process has also been hit hard by the HIV/AIDS
pandemic. The incidence of HIV/AIDS is among the highest in the world, and
Botswana’s social indicators have declined over the past decade to levels broadly
similar to those of countries with much lower per capita incomes. While the
authorities’ response to the pandemic thus far has been praised by the international
community and held up as a model for other countries to follow, it is likely to be quite
some time before these efforts will reverse the deterioration in social indicators.

spread of HIV/AIDS, which has sharply increased the number of orphans. As a result,
Botswana’s Human Development Index has fallen over the past decade from 0.675 in 1990
to 0.589 in 2002 (UN, Human Development Report 2004).
3.
At the same time, the leveling off of diamond production and the spread of
HIV/AIDS are undermining past achievements. Despite some recent progress in
diversifying the economy and

Botswana’s main challenges are to diversify the economic base and adapt fiscal
policy to sustain high growth and reduce poverty while maintaining macroeconomic
stability. These challenges will have to be addressed in tandem with efforts to combat
HIV/AIDS. The key questions in this regard include:
•

In the near term, how to initiate progress toward a balanced budget in view of
rising fiscal pressures and keep inflation low in the face of ongoing pressures for
real effective appreciation in the context of a fixed exchange rate regime?

•

How to adapt fiscal policy over the medium term given a declining revenue base
(diamond receipts) and rising expenditure pressures (from HIV/AIDS and poverty
reduction programs)?

•

How to sustain high growth and reduce poverty through structural reforms to
develop the private sector and increase Botswana’s competitiveness and
attractiveness as an investment destination (e.g., by increasing labor productivity)?
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

5.
The political situation has remained stable in the wake of the recent elections.
The ruling Botswana Democratic Party won 44 out of 57 seats in the National Assembly, and
its presidential candidate, incumbent President Festus Mogae, was reelected in the October
2004 election. This was the first election that a member state of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) conducted under new guidelines on democratic elections,
and it was deemed to have been “free and fair” by international observers.

recent AIDS impact survey undertaken by
the Central Statistics Office (CSO) suggests that the incidence of the disease may be lower
than earlier believed—25.3 percent of the population aged 15–49 years, in comparison to
previous estimates that range over 35 percent for the same age group—but the survey results
probably underestimate the true incidence.3
7.
Economic activity has slowed over the past year. Real GDP growth decelerated to
5.7 percent in 2003/04 (July–June), from 7.8 percent in 2002/03, and is expected to slow
further to 4–5 percent in 2004/05 as the productivity improvements from enhancements in
the diamond-sorting process continue to level off (Tables 3 and 4). Growth in the nonmining

sectors—including agriculture, manufacturing, trade, and tourism—has also slowed over the
past year, reflecting a slowdown in public investment and the effects of the weak U.S. dollar.
8.
Inflationary pressures picked up in late 2004. The rise in inflation was triggered by
the pass-through of higher oil prices, increased public utility charges, and the 7.5 percent
devaluation of the pula in February 2004. While inflation declined to 7.3 percent in February
and subsequently to 6.5 percent in March, from 8.0 percent in January, it still remains outside
the Bank of Botswana’s (BoB) target range of 3–6 percent.

24,000) who agreed to voluntary testing.

The budget deficit is estimated to have widened from about 2½ percent of GDP
in 2003/04 (April-March) to over 4 percent in 2004/05. In 2003/04, revenue shortfalls—

of the earlier cutbacks in capital
spending. Cutbacks in current
expenditure helped to contain the deficit, which was financed through a drawdown of
government deposits.4
10.
The fiscal position is targeted to return to broad balance in 2005/06. A small
deficit of about ½ percent of GDP is targeted in the 2005/06 budget, predicated on a recovery
of mineral receipts in pula terms (equivalent to 3 percent of GDP) owing to more favorable
exchange rate developments and a new revenue sharing agreement on the proceeds of
diamond exports, improvements in tax administration (½ percent of GDP), and efforts to cut
nonpriority expenditures, as outlined below.

Botswana’s total public debt amounted to 10.2 percent of GDP, of which external debt was
4.4 percent of GDP, at end- 2004. Domestic public debt comprises bonds that were issued in
2003 to facilitate development of a domestic bond market (see paragraph 12), while external
public debt largely reflects concessional borrowing incurred more than a decade ago prior to
Botswana’s emergence as a middle-income country.

The BoB lowered its inflation target to 3–6 percent in February despite the rise
in inflationary pressures.5 Following an easing of monetary policy in late 2003, the
overnight policy (or bank) rate was maintained at 14.25 percent until late April 2005, when it
was lowered to 14 percent. Private sector credit growth has remained broadly within the
BoB’s target range of 12–15 percent over the past year, despite rapid growth in credit to
households (Table 6). The BoB also continued to mop up excess liquidity from the ongoing
privatization of the public pension system by issuing Bank of Botswana Certificates.

The authorities have also taken steps to develop a domestic bond market. In
2003, the government floated 2-, 5-, and 12-year bonds with a value of P 2.5 billion aimed at
developing the domestic capital market.6

in recent years, but share prices have risen steadily.
13.
The external current account strengthened significantly in 2004. Preliminary
estimates indicate that the current account surplus widened to about 9¾ percent of GDP in
2004, up from 6½ percent of GDP in 2003, underpinned by continued growth in diamond
exports in US dollar terms (partly reflecting higher world prices) and tourism revenues as
well as a large increase in Southern African Customs Union (SACU) receipts associated with
the transition to the new agreement and increased regional trade (Table 8).7 Imports also rose
sharply, driven in large part by higher global oil prices.

with predevaluation levels.8 While the impact of the February 2004 devaluation

has been partially offset—as a result of the weak U.S. dollar and the rise in inflation above
trading partner levels—the REER remains about 5 percent more depreciated in comparison
with predevaluation levels. The benefits of the devaluation to nondiamond exporters appear
to have been limited, but the sharp appreciation of the pula against the US dollar eroded
profit margins in any event, forcing some businesses to adjust (including through layoffs),
particularly in the textile industry. In contrast, diamond exports continued to benefit from
strong global demand, which has helped to counteract the impact on profitability.

The deficit on the capital and financial accounts has remained sizable. In
particular, private pension managers continued to move funds abroad given the limited
investment opportunities in domestic financial markets, though at a slower pace than in

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Overview
16.
The discussions took place as the authorities were embarking on the midterm
review of the National Development Plan for 2003/04–2008/09 (NDP 9), which sets out
their medium-term economic strategy. The authorities explained that the midterm review
would provide them the opportunity to reassess their strategies and policies to ensure that the
challenges ahead would be effectively addressed, in particular combating the impacts of
HIV/AIDS and accelerating progress in poverty reduction and employment generation.
17.
Botswana’s policies have generally been consistent with Fund advice over the
years. In particular, the authorities have adhered to a prudent fiscal policy and have initiated
steps to integrate a comprehensive strategy for HIV/AIDS into the medium-term budgetary
framework. However, they have not made much headway in creating an environment
conducive to private business, which has been underscored in previous discussions.
18.
Against this background, the discussions focused on (i) short-term macroeconomic
policies; (ii) the medium-term fiscal stance, including efforts to integrate a comprehensive
strategy for HIV/AIDS into the budgetary framework; (iii) the appropriate monetary policy
regime for Botswana; (iv) potential systemic risks in the financial system; and (v) the need to
address structural impediments to growth so as to foster stronger private sector activity and
combat high unemployment.

9

The government initiated privatization of the public pension system in 2001, which set in
motion the transfer to private fund managers of P 10.5 billion (corresponding to about
27 percent of GDP) of accumulated pension benefits of civil servants opting to join the new
system.

- 13 -

B. Economic Prospects
19.
The authorities expect annual growth to be sustained at 5–6 percent over the
medium term as projected in NDP 9. Such performance was predicated on Botswana
making significant progress in diversifying the economy away from diamond production by
accelerating structural reforms, continuing trade integration, and further exploiting its
potential as a regional financial services hub. The authorities expect growth to become more
broad-based, bolstered by greater activity in agriculture, manufacturing, services, tourism,
and mining outside diamonds. Toward the end of the current decade, growth could also
benefit from the anticipated development of a coal-fired power station.
20.
Staff noted that growth would slow to the 3–4 percent range over the medium
term (Table 9) if the pace of structural reform was not accelerated and efforts to
combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic were not successful.10 The authorities and staff agreed
that the pace of economic activity outside the mining sector would need to pick up
considerably to sustain rapid growth, given the expected plateauing of diamond output. They
also agreed that lower growth would intensify pressures on the fiscal position and complicate
efforts to reduce the high unemployment rate and accelerate progress on the MDGs. The
authorities were nevertheless confident that the structural reform agenda and sector-specific
development programs being formulated in the context of the midterm review of NDP 9
would facilitate achievement of the envisaged growth performance.
21.
The debt sustainability analysis undertaken by staff does not point to any
immediate concerns about Botswana’s external or public debt position (Appendixes IV
and V). Current indicators of financial and external vulnerability suggest the same
conclusion (Table 10).
C. Fiscal Policy
The authorities reiterated their commitment to achieving balanced budgets over
the medium term as set out in NDP 9. Staff agreed that aiming for overall balance was a

Staff estimated that the impact of HIV/AIDS, if unchecked, could reduce GDP growth by
1–2 percentage points over the medium term, primarily through lower labor productivity

position (Box 2). However, in view of the uncertain impact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic on
the future income of younger generations (many of whom have been orphaned), there was
also agreement that a large erosion in the government’s net asset position, implying a smaller
cushion to absorb future shocks, would not be an optimal response.
23.
Botswana’s fiscal challenges are intensifying as receipts from the country’s main
revenue sources plateau and expenditure pressures from HIV/AIDS increase. The
authorities and staff agreed that significant additional fiscal adjustment would be necessary
over the medium term to achieve balanced budgets. Staff estimates that diamond revenue
could decline by 2 percent of GDP relative to the 2005/06 budget target even under relatively
optimistic assumptions on production and prices, while SACU receipts could erode by
1½–2 percent of GDP as a result of the new revenue-sharing agreement and the effects of
trade liberalization. With HIV/AIDS-related expenditure still to be fully integrated into the
medium-term fiscal framework, adjustment on the order of 4-5 percent of GDP may be
required over the next five years to finance priority expenditure programs while gradually
bringing the budget back into overall balance.
24.
Staff urged the authorities to begin taking measures in the context of the 2005/06
budget given the recent fiscal slippage. The authorities recognized the urgency of fiscal
adjustment and indicated that measures

given the anticipated need for supplementary spending to address the impact of the drought
and based on a more conservative assessment of the potential for revenue gains in the near
term from improvements in tax administration. Such an outcome would still represent
significant progress toward the balanced budget objective given the starting point.

- 15 -

Box 2. Medium-Term Fiscal Outlook
Staff explored two scenarios for the medium-term fiscal outlook. The baseline scenario
assumes growth of about 3–4 percent due to slow progress on economic diversification. With no
significant policy changes, only modest improvement in domestic revenue mobilization is
envisaged, and the slight decline in current expenditure is more than offset by increased capital
outlays on essential infrastructure that can no longer be postponed and higher spending on
HIV/AIDS. Under this scenario, overall deficits in the 3–4 percent range would result and the
government would virtually exhaust its deposits at the BoB by the end of the five-year period.
The alternative adjustment scenario illustrates the merits of proceeding with fiscal
consolidation to achieve broad budget balance over the medium term. The scenario also
benefits from higher annual growth of 5–6 percent, resulting from more vigorous structural
reforms, though domestic revenue buoyancy from income growth is assumed to be neutral. The
adjustment encompasses significant savings on nonessential current expenditure as well as
increased cost recovery on some public services, which would provide greater fiscal space to
accommodate higher HIV/AIDS spending. This would also allow for higher capital outlays,
which would in turn enhance overall investment and growth. Under this scenario, government
deposits would remain substantial at over 10 percent of GDP over the medium term.

25.
The authorities intend to initiate steps to enhance expenditure efficiency and
prioritization in the coming year. In this context, staff commended plans to expand cost
recovery in the provision of some government services, including through the broader
imposition of means-tested user fees. Staff also encouraged the authorities to move quickly to
strengthen budget systems and enhance their capacity to track expenditure on priority areas.
The authorities indicated that their immediate priority was to complete the rollout of the new
Government Accounting and Budgeting System. Once this was completed, they would
consider the merits of establishing an expenditure-tracking system as recommended by staff,
but noted that they would not be unduly constrained from reprioritizing expenditure in the
meantime.
26.
The authorities intend to finish integrating an updated strategy for HIV/AIDS
based on the National Strategic Framework into the medium-term budgetary
framework in the coming year. A joint working group drawn from the Ministry of Finance
and Development Planning (MFDP) and National AIDS Coordination Agency has been
established for this task in the context of the midterm review of NDP 9. An allocation of
about 1½ percent of GDP was made for HIV/AIDS programs in the 2005/06 budget, which
includes initiatives to expand the network for distributing free antiretroviral (ARV) drugs.11
Preliminary estimates suggest that annual spending levels could rise by an additional
1 percent of GDP over the next five years, though MFDP was hopeful that the integration
process could be made more cost-effective. The authorities reported that significant progress
had also been made in accessing external financing, including from President Bush’s
Emergency Plan for HIV/AIDS and the Global Fund, as well as in identifying cheaper
sources of ARV drugs.
27.
Staff advocated a clearer and more ambitious road map on public sector reform
in order to support the reorientation of spending. While supporting the recent

reform as an immediate priority,
given the public sector’s predominance in the labor market. In the near term, they noted that
wage levels would not be increased, and expected additional savings through a hiring freeze
on nontechnical positions and a tighter government travel budget. Over the medium term, the

- 17 -

authorities expected to achieve expenditure savings through a more streamlined social safety
net and greater efficiency in the delivery of government services. Staff concurred that better
targeting of the social safety net and more cost-effective provision of public services,
particularly in tertiary education, could result in significant expenditure savings over the
medium term.12
28.
The authorities have unveiled their Privatization Master Plan and other
initiatives to improve the performance of enterprises that remain in the public sector.
Staff welcomed these initiatives, but cautioned that progress in this regard (based on
experience in other countries) could prove to be problematic in the absence of a
comprehensive legal framework for the sale of government assets. The authorities pointed
out that various pieces of legislation that supported divestiture were in place and that the
Master Plan had been endorsed by the Cabinet and should be able to proceed unimpeded.
They also emphasized that it would be important for all citizens to benefit from privatization
and that a measured pace of divestiture would be required to achieve political consensus.
29.
On the revenue side, the authorities indicated that sustained efforts were being
made to strengthen tax administration and broaden the domestic tax base. They noted in
this regard the recent establishment of

compliance through strengthened

Staff welcomed these efforts, but noted that there could also be a need for additional
measures—such as an increase in the VAT rate—to boost domestic revenues over the
medium term.

12

South Africa’s efforts to improve expenditure management and reprioritize spending in the
post-apartheid period could be a useful model in this context.

- 18 -

D. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
30.
In the near term, the authorities were focused on bringing inflation back within
the target range. The authorities and staff discussed the case for preemptive tightening
given that core inflation (at 7.8 percent in January) was also outside the target range and the
fiscal stance had been loosened recently. The authorities saw no need in the near term to raise
interest rates to bring inflation down, noting that the recent rise in headline inflation stemmed
primarily from factors other than domestic demand pressures (e.g., adjustments in
administered prices and the impact of the pula devaluation). Staff concurred that inflation had
been affected by one-off factors over the past year, but cautioned that interest rates should
not be lowered until inflation has been brought down durably to within the target range. Staff
noted in any event that the authorities should stand ready to raise interest rates in the event
that inflation does not decline as they expect in the coming months.13
31.
Monetary policy continues to be anchored by an exchange rate pegged to a
basket of currencies comprising the South African rand and the SDR. The authorities
have at the same time sought to support the national objectives of economic diversification
and export competitiveness by setting an inflation target range based on average inflation in
trading partner countries in an attempt to keep the real effective exchange rate stable. Given
the authorities’ success in maintaining relatively low and stable inflation, staff observed that
the exchange rate peg has provided a credible nominal anchor for monetary policy and has
thus served Botswana well.
32.
The authorities were nevertheless exploring their options with regard to the
monetary policy framework, including a possible move to inflation targeting. They
recognized that the conditions that have allowed some measure of short-term monetary
independence are unlikely to be sustained given the financial sector reforms that are under
way—e.g., the privatization of the public pension fund and the creation of an offshore
financial center. In this context, the authorities were developing a short-term inflation
forecasting model and undertaking a study to improve their understanding of the monetary
transmission mechanism. While staff supported these efforts as well as the BoB’s recent
progress in developing leading indicators to better inform the conduct of monetary policy,
they emphasized there was no compelling need to move away from the exchange rate peg.
33.
The authorities indicated that any exchange rate regime change would require
further development of the interbank market for foreign exchange in any event. At
present, the interbank market is largely dormant, due to the lumpiness of Botswana’s foreign
exchange flows—e.g., diamond receipts are transmitted directly to the BoB in only a couple
of tranches per year—and the narrow bid/ask spread. The authorities were investigating the
scope for widening the pula’s trading band around the peg with a view to facilitating a more
active interbank market.
13

Following the discussions, the BoB in late April cut interest rates by ¼ percent, citing what
it termed “generally positive” inflation prospects (see paragraph 11).

- 19 -

34.
Finally, the authorities noted that the tendency toward appreciation of the
REER was an ongoing challenge. The authorities and staff agreed that this pointed to the
need for an acceleration of structural reforms to facilitate external competitiveness and
economic diversification over the medium to long term. In the interim period as these
reforms were taking hold, competitiveness concerns would have to continue to be addressed
through adjustments in the exchange rate level, which appeared to be broadly appropriate at
present. The authorities agreed, in line with past staff advice, that realigning the weights in
the currency basket to trading partners might also help to maintain competitiveness.
E. Financial Sector Policies
35.
Overall, the banking sector appears to be generally sound and prudential
supervision broadly adequate. Key financial soundness indicators up to end-2004 indicate
that the banks are well capitalized as evidenced by a regulatory capital to risk-weighted
assets ratio of 20.6 percent, well in excess of the statutory 15 percent, while nonperforming
loans are low at 2.8 percent (Table 11). However, the high exposure of the banking sector to
households (loan concentration is about 58½ percent) needs to be monitored closely. The
authorities confirmed their interest in the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP),
though they could not commit to a specific time frame for their participation.
36.
An area of concern that needs to be addressed with some urgency is the
establishment of a financial supervisory authority (FSA) for nonbanks. Initial work in
this regard under the Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening initiative has been
completed and its recommendations are under consideration by MFDP. The drafting of
legislation to establish the FSA is expected to begin in July 2005 following formal
endorsement of the recommendations. Given the rapid growth of the nonbank sector—
particularly of the pension funds, where total assets now exceed those of the onshore banks—
it is imperative that this process proceed without delay.
37.
Staff supported the BoB’s vigilance in vetting applications for the International
Financial Services Center (IFSC), an offshore financial center. The IFSC was established
in 1999 with a view to making Botswana the financial services hub for sub-Saharan Africa.
However, its development has been slower than the authorities expected, with only
26 companies accredited to date, of which only 11 are operational. Staff urged the BoB to
continue to closely vet applications for the IFSC in order to avoid reputational damage.
38.
The authorities have developed a draft AML/CFT strategy to bring their legal
framework more in line with international standards. The authorities have not yet
decided whether to extend the mandate of the Directorate on Corruption and Economic
Crime (DCEC) to address money laundering activities. Staff noted that, in the event that they
do so, priority would need to be accorded to the DCEC’s restructuring and strengthening so
that it could operate as a full-fledged financial intelligence unit fulfilling both its AML/CFT
role as well as its anti-corruption mandate.

- 20 -

F. Structural Issues
39.
There was agreement that the pace of structural reform needed to accelerate
significantly to sustain Botswana’s strong economic performance. The authorities noted
that this was a major focus of the midterm review of NDP 9, and that the National
Employment, Manpower and Incomes Council had been reformulated to devise a more
intensive reform program. In formulating an agenda, staff encouraged the authorities to pay
particular attention to the recommendations set out in a recent Foreign Investment Advisory
Service review of the business environment.
40.
The authorities acknowledged that rigidities in the labor market were an
impediment to private sector activity. They noted in particular that a lack of skilled labor
and skill mismatches were a significant barrier, particularly from the perspective of foreign
investors, and indicated that steps were being taken to reorient the educational system toward
vocational training and establish a technical university. In addition, procedures have been
developed to expedite the processing of work and residence permits to facilitate the import of
skilled labor. The authorities were also hopeful that the introduction of a performance
management system in the civil service and public enterprise divestiture would translate into
greater flexibility and productivity in the labor market.
41.
The authorities also acknowledged that there are other impediments to private
business. Key among these is the shortage of serviced land—i.e., with utility connections
and other supporting infrastructure (e.g., road access, telecommunications links)—and a
multiplicity of regulations and required permits. On the former, steps were being taken to
accelerate land development in urban centers and broaden private sector provision of basic
services (including telecommunications), particularly through the formation of public/private
partnerships. On the latter, the authorities were reviewing the regulatory environment in
order to streamline procedures and enhance efficiency.
42.
At the same time, programs have been created to facilitate private
entrepreneurship. Budgetary funds were allocated in 2002 to launch three such programs
managed by the Citizens Entrepreneurial Development Agency (CEDA) aimed at supporting
small and medium-scale enterprises. Under its main program, CEDA provides credit at
highly subsidized interest rates along with managerial training and mentoring services to
domestic enterprises. A venture capital fund that provides credit at commercial interest rates
and a credit guarantee fund to encourage bank lending to small businesses have also been
established. Total lending by CEDA through August 2004 amounted to P 674 million
(1½ percent of GDP), with nonperforming loans accounting for just over 2 percent of
outstanding credit.
43.
The authorities have also stepped up various development programs in
agriculture and tourism. Efforts to improve agricultural productivity, as articulated in a
national development plan launched in October 2002, have been focused on increasing
investment in irrigation and water recycling systems. The Botswana Meat Commission is
being restructured, and a tracking system created, to facilitate compliance with the EU’s

- 21 -

“food origin” requirements in order to maintain market access for beef exports. Finally, a
Tourism Board was launched last October to promote Botswana as a travel destination.
G. Trade Policy and Exchange Regime
44.
Botswana is committed to further trade liberalization along with other SACU
and SADC members (see Country Report No. 05/97, January 27, 2005, www.imf.org).
Botswana’s simple average tariff has been reduced to 11.4 percent, compared with over
20 percent a decade ago, and has been accompanied by a simplification of the tariff structure.
However, Botswana maintains a number of nontariff barriers, including a state monopoly on
beef exports, import permit requirements for a range of food products, and seasonal
agricultural trade bans that should be removed.
45.
The authorities confirmed their intention to eliminate the multiple currency
practice arising from the Foreign Exchange Risk-Sharing Scheme (FERS). The scheme
was abandoned in 1990, and the last loan under the arrangement matures in 2006.
IV. DATA AND OTHER ISSUES
46.
While economic data are generally adequate for surveillance purposes, there is
significant room for improvement (Appendix III). In particular, national accounts and
final (as opposed to provisional) balance of payments data need to be more timely. As in past
consultations, the authorities were strongly encouraged to synchronize the data accounting
periods for the government sector and national accounts with those of the financial statistics
and balance of payments, and to establish an autonomous CSO to further improve the quality
and transparency of the statistical base. Staff also encouraged the authorities to adopt as
quickly as possible the 2001 GFS methodology in compiling fiscal data.
47.
Staff saw merit in Botswana continuing to receive technical assistance (TA) in
the establishment of a FSA for nonbanks and in inflation modeling. The authorities were
very grateful for past Fund TA and wished to see ongoing initiatives continued.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
48.
Botswana has been among the world’s fastest-growing economies over the past
three decades, but the leveling off of diamond production and the spread of HIV/AIDS
are undermining its considerable achievements. Real GDP growth has averaged over
8 percent per annum since the 1970s, facilitating Botswana’s evolution from one of the
poorest countries in the world to middle income status and the highest sovereign credit rating
in Africa. This success can be attributed to sound policies, particularly in the management of
Botswana’s vast diamond resources, as well as a stable political environment and strong
commitment to good governance. Nevertheless, despite some progress in diversifying the
economy and generating private sector activity, the diamond sector continues to dominate
macroeconomic activity and the formal sector of the economy. At the same time, the
prevalence of HIV/AIDS has risen, steadily eroding social indicators and intensifying

- 22 -

pressures on health expenditures at a time when budgetary resources are becoming more
constrained.
49.
The key challenge is to preserve macroeconomic stability while facilitating the
transition to a more diversified economy that harnesses private sector initiative and
makes deeper inroads into poverty reduction. In the near term, progress will have to be
initiated toward a balanced budget despite rising fiscal pressures and inflation kept low in the
face of persistent pressures for real effective appreciation in the context of the fixed exchange
rate regime. Over the medium term, fiscal policy and the composition of expenditure will
have to be adapted as revenues decline and spending pressures increase. Structural reforms to
develop the domestic private sector and attract foreign direct investment will also have to be
accelerated, and broad-based efforts to prevent and combat HIV/AIDS reinforced, to sustain
rapid growth, further reduce poverty, and reverse the decline in social indicators.
50.
The authorities’ commitment to achieving balanced budgets over the medium
term is commendable. As the government’s net asset position is very comfortable, with
little prospect for complete exhaustion of diamond revenues, there does not appear to be
compelling need for Botswana to run fiscal surpluses. At the same time, given the uncertain
impact of HIV/AIDS on future generations, large deficits would also not be prudent at this
stage. The authorities’ first response should therefore be to significantly strengthen fiscal
efforts, beginning with the 2005/06 budget, and aim for overall balance over the next several
years, in anticipation that small deficits may be inevitable over the longer term. For 2005/06,
a deficit target of 1½-2 percent of GDP might be more realistic given the anticipated need for
supplementary spending due to the drought and the limited prospects in the near term for
significantly raising domestic revenue collections.
51.
Significant additional fiscal adjustment will be necessary to achieve budget
balance over the medium term. With HIV/AIDS-related expenditure still to be fully
integrated into the medium-term fiscal framework, fiscal adjustment on the order of
4–5 percent of GDP may be required—starting in the current fiscal year—over the next five
years to finance priority expenditures while bringing the budget back into balance.
52.
To this end, clearer road maps for expenditure reprioritization and public sector
reform are needed. Botswana’s wage bill is high by international standards, which
constrains the scope for reprioritization. Efforts to strengthen budget systems and track
expenditure need to be strengthened with some urgency to facilitate efficient and effective
reprioritization of spending.
53.
Sustained efforts will also be needed to strengthen tax administration and
broaden the domestic tax base. The establishment of the BURS is a welcome step, but
further efforts are needed to strengthen its administrative capacity and round out its
institutional framework, including establishment of a large taxpayers’ unit. Concerted efforts
must also be made to improve tax compliance through strengthened audit and enforcement
procedures, including stronger legal actions against tax evaders.

- 23 -

54.
There is a need to be cautious on monetary policy in the near term given the
recent fiscal loosening. The authorities should avoid lowering interest rates until inflation
has been brought down sustainably to within the target range. In this context, staff believes
the recent rate cut was premature.
55.
The exchange rate peg to the currency basket has provided a credible nominal
anchor for monetary policy and there is no compelling need for a regime change. Staff
nevertheless supports the authorities’ efforts to better understand their future options in terms
of a possible transition to an alternative monetary framework. Over the medium to long term,
competitiveness concerns will need to be addressed through deeper structural reforms,
though there may be a need for periodic exchange rate adjustments in the interim.
56.
The financial system appears to be broadly sound and adequately supervised,
with no apparent systemic risks. In particular, the available data suggest that banks are well
capitalized and nonperforming loans low, with adequate provisioning. However, the high
exposure of the banking sector to households as indicated by the high loan concentration
merits close monitoring. An area of concern that also needs to be addressed with some
urgency is the establishment of a FSA for nonbanks. The authorities are encouraged to
participate in the FSAP.
57.
Botswana’s commitment to trade liberalization is commendable. The new SACU
framework will provide Botswana with the opportunity to help shape trade negotiations and
policies. The staff welcomes the progress made in negotiating free trade agreements and
lowering tariffs, but urges the authorities to remove nontariff barriers.
58.
The staff notes the authorities’ intention to eliminate by 2006 the multiple
currency practice arising out of the FERS. In light of this, staff recommend that the Board
approve the retention of the measure until June 30, 2006, or the conclusion of the next Article
IV consultation with Botswana, whichever is earlier.
59.

It is proposed that Botswana remain on the standard 12-month consultation cycle.

Contribution to funding of the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility

In July 1994, Botswana deposited with the Fund, as trustee, an amount equivalent to
US$10 million for the benefit of the subsidy account of the Enhanced Structural Adjustment
Facility (ESAF). In April 1997, Botswana made a five-year deposit of SDR 14.6 million in
the ESAF-Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Trust.
VIII. Exchange rate arrangements
The exchange rate of the Botswana pula is determined on the basis of a basket of currencies.
As of April 29, 2005, the exchange rate was US$1 = 4.5331, and the exchange rate of the
South African rand to the pula was R 1 = P 0.7431.

Article IV Consultation

The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on March 24, 2004.
The Executive Board took the following decision:
1.
The Fund takes this decision relating to Botswana’s exchange measure subject to
Article VIII, Section 3, in the light of the 1999 Article IV consultation with Botswana
conducted under Decision No. 5392-(77/63), adopted April 29, 1977, as amended
(Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies).

- 36 -

APPENDIX I

2.
Botswana maintains a multiple currency practice arising from the Foreign Exchange
Risk-Sharing Scheme (FERS) applicable to outstanding external loans obtained by certain
public enterprises before October 1, 1990, which is subject to Fund approval under Article
VIII, Section 3.
3.
In view of Botswana’s discontinuance of the FERS scheme in 1990, and of its
intention to eliminate the multiple currency practice, the Fund encourages the authorities to
allow the multiple currency practice to expire in 2006, when the last loan under the scheme
will mature.

APPENDIX II

Botswana: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of February 28, 2004)
1.
Botswana became a member of the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA) in 1968, and is
now a contributor to IDA. Cumulative commitments from IDA to Botswana include
US$17 million for six development credits for infrastructural development and the livestock
sector. The last credit was extended in 1974. Cumulative commitments from the IBRD to
Botswana amount to US$281 million for 22 loans, of which US$54 million was canceled.
The loans were extended for infrastructural development, the financial sector, land
management and livestock development, as well as for education and health projects. The
last loan was extended in 1987. Currently, there are no active IBRD/IDA projects in
Botswana.
2.
Since the late 1980s, the Government of Botswana has not required external
borrowing owing to its strong financial and international reserve position based on diamond
mining receipts. Therefore, the Bank’s involvement in Botswana has shifted to analytical and
advisory activities. Recent analytic and advisory activities include: an IDF grant for homebased care of AIDS patients, which closed on August 5, 1999; an analysis of the
development impact of HIV/AIDS on the economy in 2001; sharing of HIV/AIDS related
information at technical meetings of the multi-country HIV/AIDS Programs; and a review of
Botswana’s experience in economic management in 1999. In 2003, an ESW on economic
diversification and trade was initiated with the government and a local research group,
Botswana Institute of Development Policy Analysis. In mid-2004, the Government, with
analytical and advisory support from the Bank, launched a study on the viability and longterm development strategy for the livestock (beef) subsector. By request of the Government,
the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility launched a study on reform of the
regulatory framework for public utilities in 2003/04.
3.
Botswana joined the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in 1979. There has been
little private sector interest in Botswana in IFC financing as excess liquidity, brought about
by the inflow of foreign exchange resources from diamond exports, which has made it
relatively easy for the small private sector to raise funds in the domestic market. Cumulative
IFC equity and loan commitments to Botswana total US$10.72 million in five tourism,
financial, and mining enterprises. In FY99 and FY00, the IFC made two loan commitments
amounting to US$1.75 million to Abercombie and Kent (Botswana) for accommodation and
tourism services projects in the Okavango Delta. In FY01, the IFC made a quasi-equity
investment of US$3 million in the African Banking Corporation aimed at diversifying its
range of financial services and increasing its geographical coverage. In FY03, the IFC
approved a US$2 million equity investment in Kalahari Diamonds Limited for diamond
exploration in Botswana's Kalahari desert. The most recent IFC commitment, at the end of
2004, was an equity stake of US$3.97 million in a consumer finance company, which
provides short- to medium-term micro loans to employees of governmental, quasigovernmental and private sector companies in Botswana. The IFC rendered advisory services

- 38 -

APPENDIX II

to the Government of Botswana on privatization of enterprises, and in FY03/04, the Public
Enterprises Evaluation and Privatization Agency gave the IFC the privatization mandate for
Air Botswana. In 2004, the Foreign Investment Advisory Services completed a review of the
commercial legal framework, administrative and registration costs, and barriers to investment
in Botswana.
4.
Botswana joined the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) in 1988;
MIGA has neither any exposure nor any active applications in Botswana. MIGA and the
Botswana Export Development and Investment Authority (BEDIA) signed a cooperation
agreement in July 2003. Specifically, BEDIA is providing investment information content to
MIGA for distribution to potential investors via the FDI Xchange and other MIGA online
services.

APPENDIX III

Botswana: Statistical Issues
1.
The core statistical data required for surveillance are reported to the Fund with an
acceptable degree of regularity and promptness. In general, the quality of these data is
adequate to conduct surveillance. However, the time lag in compiling the national accounts
and labor market data needs to be reduced. In addition, the current arrangements—according
to which the balance of payments statistics are compiled on a calendar-year basis, and the
national accounts and the budget on July-June and April-March bases, respectively—
continue to impede the preparation of an integrated set of economic data. The data module of
the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) was conducted in October
2001. Among the priority recommendations of general applicability to the statistical system
were to prepare GDDS metadata on current statistical production and dissemination practices
and on detailed plans for improvements for all sectors; and to strengthen data sharing and
coordination among major agencies, especially with a view to reconciling major data sets
with different accounting periods.14 A factual update to the data ROSC and an update of the
response by the authorities to the original data ROSC were disseminated in March and July
2004, respectively.15
National Accounts and Prices
2.
Annual and quarterly national accounts based primarily on the concepts and
definitions recommended by the 1968 System of National Accounts (SNA) are compiled using
both the production and expenditure approaches. The authorities have indicated their strong
commitment to strengthening national accounts data, including moving to the 1993 SNA, and
have been receiving Fund technical assistance. However, differences in the accounting
periods and in the timing of recording between the national accounts, balance of payments,
and the government finance statistics impair the accuracy of the estimates compiled. Staff has
encouraged the authorities to step up the efforts to harmonize the accounting periods over the
medium term as has been planned. As a priority measure, the data ROSC mission
recommended advancing the work program for implementing 1993 SNA with an increased
focus on conceptual adherence, with implementation initially limited to GDP estimates.
14

In July 2004, the authorities provided an update of their initial response to the data ROSC
that set out recent actions taken to implement the staff recommendations; see:
http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2004/cr04229.pdf.

15

Botswana is participating in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) regional
project for Anglophone African countries that is funded by the Department for International
Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom. The authorities have prepared an initial set of
metadata that include detailed plans for improvement over the short and medium term; these
were posted on the Fund’s Data Standards Bulletin Board in October 2002. These metadata
were subsequently updated in October/ November 2003.

- 40 -

APPENDIX III

3.
The consumer price index is comprehensive and provides a breakdown of the index
between urban and rural areas, as well as between tradables (domestic and imported) and
nontradables. However, the authorities recognize the need to rebase the index to a more
recent year and have indicated their intention to update the weights based on the 2002/03
Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) by the second quarter of 2005. With
respect to the producer price index, the data ROSC mission recommended redesigning the
producer price index to accord with international standards as regards the sample size and
validation procedures. Efforts should also be made to collect more comprehensive source
data and adopt best practices for data compilation.
Labor statistics
4.
Annual employment and wage information are available but are rarely reported to
STA for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS). Employment data are
collected periodically thorough a variety of sources, such as the HIES, the Demographic
Survey, and the Labor Force Survey covering formal and informal sectors with different
levels of comprehensiveness and scope. While the authorities have made efforts toward
standardization among the surveys, more frequent and coherent data provision is needed to
analyze employment and unemployment trends on a regular annual basis. For example, the
latest 2002/03 HIES result was published 15 months after the fieldwork was completed.
Indicators of wages, particularly average monthly earnings, are also provided with a
considerable time lag, significantly diminishing their value for tracking recent developments.
Over the medium term, the authorities plan to increase the frequency of employment and
unemployment data from the present biannual to quarterly basis.
Fiscal accounts
5.
Central government finance data are produced monthly, with a lag of three to four
weeks, for use in the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning (MFDP). However, the
level of accuracy is less than for audited annual fiscal data, and they are reported for
publication in the IFS with a two- to three-month lag. Comprehensive annual government
finance statistics on consolidated central government are published by the authorities with a
12-month lag after the end of the reference year in MFDP’s Annual Statements of Accounts.
However, no annual government finance data for publication in the GFS Yearbook (GFSY)
have been reported since 1996.
6.
The compilation and dissemination of central government finance data are largely
based on the methodology of the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM
1986) and cover all central government activities, including balances of financial assets and
liabilities of central government units. The classification of revenue, expenditure, and
financing data are broadly consistent with the 1986 GFS methodology, with a few
exceptions. Most detailed data of the accounts are sufficiently detailed for GFS purposes, but
source data could be improved to allow consolidation of general government statistics. In
general, the published data have been audited by the Auditor General. Accuracy and

- 41 -

APPENDIX III

reliability are clearly favored at the expense of timeliness. As a priority, the data ROSC
mission recommended the dissemination of monthly budgetary central government statistics
within one month of the end of the reference period and central government debt data within
one quarter of the end of the reference period. The authorities have indicated that they intend
to move to the 2001 GFSM in the course of the 2006/07 fiscal year.
Monetary accounts
7.
In compiling the monetary survey, the Bank of Botswana broadly follows the
methodology recommended in the Fund’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual
(MFSM). Following two technical assistance missions in August 2003 and August 2004,
commercial banks started to implement the recommendation of the ROSC mission to classify
their accounts into resident and nonresident accounts according to the principle of center of
economic interest rather than nationality of the account holder as had been the practice.
However, the monetary survey still does not cover three deposit-taking institutions (one
merchant bank, one building society, and one savings bank), which account for about five
percent of system deposits.
8.
Monetary data for publication in IFS are reported on a regular basis. The timeliness of
reporting has improved since 2002. However, data for the monetary authorities are still being
reported to STA with a longer lag (one additional month) than those for the deposit money
banks, and the published monetary data are still to be fully aligned with IFS. The authorities
are working on a format that would eliminate these discrepancies.
External trade and balance of payments
9.
Botswana reports data annually on the balance of payments and the international
investment position. With Fund assistance during 1997 to 2000, Botswana has established
Balance of Payments Manual 5 as the basis for balance of payment statistics. However,
delays in supplying source data are a major concern and hamper efforts to improve the
timeliness of statistics. Delays with trade data in particular continue to lead to large revisions
in published balance of payments data. Balance of payments statistics are compiled in
conformity with internationally accepted statistical frameworks, but estimation methods need
to be updated. As a priority, the data ROSC recommended the accelerated development of
quarterly balance of payments statistics. An essential feature of this effort would be to put in
place timely compilation of monthly merchandise trade statistics.
10.
Technical assistance in the context of the GDDS project for Anglophone Africa
enabled Botswana to establish a quarterly balance of payments framework, resolve
discrepancies between the balance of payments and the national accounts, improve coverage
of investment flows, and resolve issues on SACU-related payments in the balance of
payments. The Bank of Botswana has advised the Fund that sufficient progress has been
made in preparing reliable trade data and has requested further technical assistance to
introduce quarterly balance of payments estimates and extend survey-based techniques for
estimating trade in services.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
BOTSWANA
Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the African Department
(In consultation with the Policy Development and Review Department)
Approved by Sharmini Coorey and Anthony Boote
June 17, 2005
1.
This supplement provides an update on developments since the issuance of the
staff report16 and reflects discussions with the authorities and private sector
representatives during a staff visit from June 9–10. The staff appraisal (see below) has
been updated in light of these discussions and recent policy changes.
VI. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES
2.
Headline inflation fell further to 6.2 percent in April (from 6.5 percent in
March), just above the upper end of the Bank of Botswana’s (BoB) inflation target
range of 3–6 percent. The decline in the price index was driven primarily by a fall in food
prices, which moderated to 2.5 percent year-on-year from 3.0 percent in March. However,
administered prices of fuel, which directly affect nearly a quarter of the consumer price
index, were raised by an average of about 5 percent in early May.
3.
Fiscal data through February 2005 suggest that the budget deficit for 2004/05
(April–March) will be considerably smaller than the 4.1 percent of GDP projected
earlier. Preliminary staff estimates indicate an overall deficit on the order of about 1 percent
of GDP, with both current and capital spending running well below earlier projections. The
lower spending results in part from transitory factors, including a mandated 5 percent acrossthe-board reduction in recurrent expenditure, as well as slower-than-expected implementation
of investment projects. Mineral revenue and domestic tax collections were also somewhat
below earlier projections. These developments do not alter staff’s view that significant fiscal
adjustment will be required over the medium term to achieve broad budget balance.
4.
On May 29, the authorities announced that the pula would be devalued by
12 percent against the currency basket effective the following business day, citing the
need to maintain a “stable and competitive real exchange rate.” The authorities also
announced in this context that the exchange rate of the pula would be adjusted continuously
16

May 13, 2005.

- 47 -

rather than in discrete steps against the basket in a “crawling peg” type of arrangement. The
rate of crawl will be forward looking and aligned with the differential between expected
inflation in Botswana and that in major trading partner countries. Finally, the spread between
the buy and sell rates of the pula was widened from 0.125 percent to 0.5 percent in order to
encourage further development of the interbank market for foreign exchange.
VII. DEVALUATION AND EXCHANGE RATE REGIME CHANGE
A. Impact on Near-Term Economic Prospects
5.
The economic effects of the recent devaluation and change in exchange rate
regime are likely to be mixed (Table 1). Staff estimates a direct inflation pass through from
the devaluation of 4–6 percentage points over the next 12 months, with further knock on
effects on the order of 1–2 percentage points from the exchange rate crawl, which could push
inflation up to the 10 percent level over the next 12 months. The impact on growth and
exports is expected to be modest, given that trends in key sectors (e.g., diamonds, beef,
textiles, and tourism) have largely been driven by structural factors in recent years. The
production of import substitutes, such as poultry and bricks, could rise more significantly in
the near-term as import prices rise. The medium-term macroeconomic outlook would remain
essentially as described in the staff report, provided the authorities tighten monetary and
fiscal policy and follow through on their strategy to raise productivity through structural
reform.
6.
The authorities have not yet fully assessed the impact on the 2005/06 budget, but
staff’s preliminary assessment suggests a broadly neutral effect relative to the
projection in the staff report. The impact on revenues is expected to be positive, given their
large foreign currency component. However, pressures on spending could also potentially be
significant, given that a number of high-priority expenditure items (e.g., antiretroviral drugs)
are imported. Further, government-financed development projects also tend to have a high
import component, which could push capital spending above budgeted levels if project
implementation proceeds as planned.
7.
The recent devaluation caught the business community, wage earners, and
foreign investors by surprise. In discussions, private sector representatives indicated that
they were unclear about the reasons for the devaluation and how the crawling peg regime
would be implemented, as well as its implications for inflation.
B. Policy Discussions
8.
Staff inquired into the rationale for the devaluation, given that recent
developments—in particular, declining inflation and the continued strength of the
external position—did not appear to warrant such a move. The authorities explained that
a devaluation had been under consideration for quite some time, and was aimed at reversing
the erosion in Botswana’s international competitiveness over the last several years, which
would in turn enhance the country’s growth prospects and facilitate more rapid progress on
poverty reduction and employment generation. In making this move, they were mindful of

- 48 -

Botswana’s still very favorable balance of payments prospects and the benign inflation
outlook for 2005, but were more concerned to lay a solid foundation for strong growth over
the medium to long term against the backdrop of slowing economic activity.
9.
With regard to the exchange rate regime change, the authorities acknowledged
that the fixed peg had provided a credible nominal anchor and achieved a measure of
success, but noted that it had not adequately stabilized the real effective exchange rate.
They explained that sizeable periodic adjustments in the exchange rate level had therefore
been necessary over the years, which had tended to be disruptive to economic activity. The
crawling peg, by contrast, would involve continuous and more predictable adjustments in the
exchange rate level, and would therefore facilitate a more stable economic environment for
growth and investment. The authorities explained that the devaluation was not an intrinsic
element of the regime change, but nevertheless would put it on a solid foundation by
eliminating the cumulative overvaluation of the pula.17
10.
Staff cautioned the authorities against using monetary and exchange rate policy
to pursue multiple objectives and stressed the need to define a nominal anchor for
prices. In particular, the rate of crawl itself could translate quickly to inflation given
Botswana’s highly open economy (see paragraph 8 of the staff report) and in the absence of a
clearly defined nominal anchor. In this context, staff strongly encouraged the authorities to
pre-announce the rate of crawl in order to guide monetary policy and anchor inflation
expectations. In addition, staff noted that the rate of crawl would need to be low enough to be
consistent with maintaining low inflation. The authorities replied that the BoB’s current
inflation target range could possibly play a role in anchoring expectations, but indicated that
the matter was still under review and that they remained open to staff’s advice in this regard.
11.
Staff noted that Botswana’s strong real exchange rate to a large extent reflected
a strong diamond sector (see Box 1 of the staff report)—possibly compounded in recent
years by fiscal deficits. Concerns about the competitiveness of the small non-diamond
private sector and the need to sustain high growth were better addressed through structural
reform to diversify the economic base, develop the private sector, improve labor force skills,
and attract foreign direct investment (see paragraphs 39–43 of the staff report).
12.
Staff also emphasized the need for tighter macroeconomic policies in order to
contain inflation as well as to lend credibility to the new exchange rate regime. In
17

The authorities’ estimate of the extent of overvaluation was based on the appreciation of
the real exchange rate relative to its average level during 1991–2000, which was considered
to be a period when the exchange market was in broad equilibrium. They indicated that a
similar exercise based on measurements of shifts in purchasing power parity had yielded
comparable estimates. However, it should be noted that the appreciation of the real exchange
rate could reflect the strong diamond sector and the emergence of fiscal deficits in recent
years.

- 49 -

particular, interest rates would need to be raised and fiscal policy tightened to achieve
balance in 2005/06.18 A coordinated set of monetary, fiscal, and structural policies would be
required in this context, including steps to reassure the private business community that the
BoB has sufficient operational independence to pursue low inflation. The authorities replied
that their policy responses were still being formulated, but reassured staff that they remained
committed to timely policy action to minimize the second round effects on inflation. The
BoB expected to set out the implications for the conduct of monetary policy in the context of
its mid-year policy statement, which might be advanced from its usual late July time frame,
while the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning indicated that it remained
committed to achieving a balanced budget in the current fiscal year.
13.
The authorities indicated that the adoption of the crawling peg as well as the
widening of the trading band around the pula was a first step toward greater exchange
rate flexibility. The BoB has identified additional changes in practices and regulations that
would help to foster further development of the interbank foreign exchange market and is
discussing their implementation with commercial banks. As discussed with staff during the
Article IV mission in February-March, the authorities will continue to explore their options
with regard to the monetary policy framework in the period ahead, including whether the
necessary pre-conditions can be put in place for an eventual move to formal inflation
targeting at some point in the future.
VIII. STAFF APPRAISAL
14.
With Botswana’s inflation rate still above the authorities’ target range and in
light of the April interest rate cut, there is a need for decisive policy action to contain
inflationary pressures from the recent devaluation. In particular, monetary policy should
be tightened promptly, including through higher interest rates, to minimize the second round
effects on inflation. The authorities should also redouble efforts to achieve fiscal balance in
2005/06, in particular through cuts in nonessential expenditure, in order to minimize any
upward pressures on aggregate demand and the real exchange rate. Staff supports the need to
sustain growth and underscores its earlier view that, over the medium to long term,
competitiveness concerns outside the diamond sector will have to be addressed through
deeper structural reform in order to raise productivity.
15.
The authorities also need to move quickly to put in place a supportive policy and
operational framework to establish a clear nominal anchor and to lend credibility to the
new more flexible exchange rate regime. Indeed, the early establishment of such a
framework will enhance transparency and smooth the transition toward greater exchange rate
18

Such a tightening is consistent with the staff report’s support for a broadly-balanced
medium-term fiscal position. With regard to the medium-term fiscal outlook, while broad
balance will be achieved a year earlier than indicated in the alternative scenario set out in
Box 2 of the staff report, the need for significant adjustment remains owing to the erosion of
mineral revenue and to accommodate higher HIV/AIDs expenditure (see Table 2).

- 50 -

flexibility. Staff strongly encourage the authorities to pre-announce the rate of crawl—set at a
pace consistent with maintaining low inflation—in order to provide the new regime with a
credible nominal anchor. It will also be important to ensure that fiscal and monetary policies
are closely coordinated and kept consistent with the rate of crawl in order to sustain low
inflation.

IMF Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with Botswana
On June 22, 2005 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Botswana.19 The Botswana authorities’ view is published in a
bundle together with this notice.
Background
Botswana has been among the world’s best performing economies over the past three
decades. Real GDP growth averaged over 8 percent per year, facilitating Botswana’s evolution
from one of the poorest countries in the world to middle income status and the highest
sovereign credit rating in Africa. This success can be attributed to sound economic policies,
particularly in the management of its vast diamond resources, as well as a stable political
environment and strong commitment to good governance. However, the leveling off of
diamond production and the spread of HIV/AIDS—which has resulted in the erosion of key
social indicators, such as life expectancy and mortality rates—threaten to undermine past
achievements. The diamond sector—which presently contributes about one third of GDP and
75 percent of exports—continues to dominate macroeconomic activity. At the same time, the
prevalence of HIV/AIDS has risen over the past decade, intensifying pressures on
expenditures at a time when budgetary resources are becoming more constrained.

19

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed
during the June 22 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

- 54 Economic activity has slowed over the past year. Real GDP growth decelerated to 5.7 percent
in 2003/04 (July–June), from 7.8 percent in 2002/03, and is expected to slow further to
4–5 percent in 2004/05 as the productivity improvements from enhancements in the diamondsorting process continue to level off. Growth in key nonmining sectors—including
manufacturing, trade, and tourism—has also slowed over the past year, reflecting a slowdown
in public investment and the effects of the weak U.S. dollar. Inflationary pressures picked up in
late 2004, reflecting the impact of higher world oil prices, increased public utility charges, and
the pass through from the 7.5 percent devaluation of the pula in February 2004. Inflation has
declined in recent months, falling to 6.2 percent in April, from a peak of 8.0 percent in January.
The budget deficit is estimated by staff to have narrowed from about 2½ percent of GDP in
2003/04 (April–March) to about 1 percent in 2004/05. In 2003/04, revenue shortfalls—
reflecting problems in VAT administration—were partly offset by scaling back capital
expenditure, but not sufficiently to achieve the budget target of a small deficit. The improved
outturn in 2004/05 stems primarily from lower-than-projected current and capital spending. The
lower spending results in part from transitory factors, including a mandated 5 percent acrossthe-board reduction in recurrent expenditure, as well as slower-than-expected implementation
of investment projects. The expenditure savings were partially offset by lower mineral
revenues resulting from the weak U.S. dollar and shortfalls in domestic tax collections.
The Bank of Botswana lowered its inflation target to 3–6 percent in February 2005 in
anticipation of an improved inflation outlook. The Bank rate was maintained at 14.25 percent
from late 2003 until late April 2005, when it was lowered to 14 percent. Private sector credit
growth has remained broadly within the BoB’s target range—which was lowered to 10-13
percent in February 2005, from 12–15 percent—over the past year, despite rapid growth in
credit to households. The BoB also continued to mop up excess liquidity from the ongoing
privatization of the public pension system through issuance of Bank of Botswana Certificates.
External performance has remained very strong. The current account surplus widened to
about 9½ percent of GDP in 2004, up from 6½ percent of GDP in 2003, underpinned by
continued growth in diamond exports in U.S. dollar terms (partly reflecting higher world prices)
and tourism revenues as well as a large increase in Southern African Customs Union receipts
and increased regional trade. Foreign reserves were US$5.7 billion at end-2004 (about
18½ months of imports).
On May 29, the government of Botswana announced that the pula would be devalued by
12 percent against the currency basket effective the following business day, citing the need to
maintain a “stable and competitive real exchange rate” and to “achieve sustained and
diversified growth.” The authorities at the same time announced that the exchange rate of the
pula would be adjusted continuously rather than in discrete steps against the basket in a
“crawling peg” type of arrangement. The rate of crawl will be forward looking and aligned with
the differential between the inflation objective in Botswana and expected inflation in trading
partner countries. The spread between the buy and sell rates of the pula was also widened
from 0.125 percent to 0.5 percent in order to encourage further development of the interbank
market for foreign exchange.

Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the Botswana authorities for their sound economic policies, continued
prudent management of Botswana’s vast diamond resources, and commitment to good
governance, which have underpinned the country’s remarkable growth performance over the
past three decades. They also welcomed the authorities’ recent efforts to increase resource
commitments in the fight against HIV/AIDS. At the same time, however, diamond production is
leveling off, while the spread of HIV/AIDS has steadily eroded social indicators and intensified
expenditure pressures at a time when budgetary resources are becoming more constrained.
Against this background, Directors underscored the importance of strengthened efforts to
diversify the economic base and to build on Botswana’s sound macroeconomic fundamentals
and positive economic prospects to achieve broad-based social improvements and poverty
reduction. They therefore welcomed the ongoing assessment of Botswana’s economic policies
and reform agenda in the context of the mid-term review of the National Development Plan
(NDP 9). In particular, Directors called for structural reforms aimed at developing the domestic
private sector and attracting foreign direct investment, coupled with broad-based efforts to
prevent and combat HIV/AIDS. They noted that fiscal policy would also have to be adapted as
revenues decline and spending pressures increase.
Directors commended the authorities’ continued commitment to a prudent fiscal policy aimed
at achieving balanced budgets over the medium term. While the net asset position of the
government is set to remain comfortable, they agreed that a move toward overall balance
would be desirable in anticipation that small deficits may be inevitable over the longer term,
given the uncertain impact of HIV/AIDS on future generations.
Directors stressed that significant additional fiscal adjustment will be needed to maintain
budget balance over the medium term. They urged the authorities to set out clearer road maps
for expenditure reprioritization and public sector reform, including a reduction in the public
sector wage bill. Efforts will also need to be accelerated to strengthen budget systems and
improve capacity to track expenditure in priority areas, particularly on HIV/AIDS. In this regard,
Directors welcomed steps to integrate a comprehensive strategy for HIV/AIDS into the
medium-term budgetary framework. On the revenue side, Directors stressed the need to
strengthen tax administration, improve tax compliance, and broaden the tax base. The
institutional structure of the Botswana Unified Revenue Service should be further developed,
and stronger legal sanctions should be taken against tax evaders. Consideration should also
be given to the establishment of a large taxpayers unit and an increase in the value-added tax
rate.
Directors noted that the recent devaluation of the pula and move to a “crawling peg”
arrangement would need to be accompanied by appropriate supportive measures to minimize
the near-term costs and enhance the longer-term benefits for sustained economic growth and
poverty reduction. With Botswana’s inflation rate still above the authorities’ target range and in
light of the interest rate cut in April, they urged decisive policy action to contain inflationary
pressures from the devaluation. In particular, monetary policy should be tightened

- 56 expeditiously, including through higher interest rates, and efforts should be stepped up to
achieve fiscal balance in 2005/06, through cuts in nonessential expenditure, in order to
minimize any upward pressures on aggregate demand and the real exchange rate.
Directors also urged the authorities to move quickly to put in place a supportive policy and
operational framework that would establish a clear nominal anchor and lend credibility to the
new exchange rate regime. They encouraged the authorities to pre-announce the rate of
crawl—set at a pace consistent with maintaining low inflation—and to ensure that fiscal and
monetary policies are closely coordinated and kept consistent with the rate of crawl. Going
forward, a move toward greater exchange rate flexibility will require the development of tools
and institutions for effective monetary policy management.
Directors agreed that Botswana’s banking sector is generally sound and prudential supervision
broadly adequate. They welcomed the initial progress made under the Financial Sector
Reform and Strengthening Initiative, and commended the authorities for their vigilance in
overseeing the activities of the offshore financial center. Directors noted, however, that the
high exposure of the banking sector to households warrants close monitoring. They urged the
authorities to expedite action on establishing a financial supervisory agency for nonbank
financial institutions, given their rapid growth in recent years. They also looked forward to
continued efforts to bring the AML/CFT regime more in line with international standards.
Directors encouraged the authorities to participate in the Financial Sector Assessment
Program at an early opportunity.
Directors highlighted the importance of faster and deeper structural reforms to promote an
enabling environment for private business activity and facilitate economic diversification, by
increasing productivity and addressing competitiveness concerns in the nondiamond sector.
Directors welcomed efforts to remove labor market rigidities and encouraged the authorities to
deepen labor market reforms to enhance flexibility and skills. Comprehensive reform of the
legal and regulatory framework will also be crucial to the successful development of
public/private partnerships and implementation of the Privatization Master Plan.
Directors commended the authorities’ continued commitment to trade liberalization, and the
progress made in negotiating free trade agreements and lowering tariffs, while calling for faster
progress with the removal of nontariff barriers. They also welcomed the authorities’ intention to
eliminate the multiple currency practice arising from the Foreign Exchange Risk-Sharing
Scheme in 2006.

Statement by the Botswana Authorities
Right of reply document
The published report of the discussion of the IMF Executive Board contained in the Public
Information Notice (PIN) is a short summary of the many issues raised by Board members and does
not cover all aspects of the discussion. However, while much of the assessment is positive and
supportive, in this instance it is the view of the Botswana authorities that the Notice does not truly
reflect the economic situation in the country in important respects. For this reason, the authorities
have taken the decision to issue a separate statement.
In doing so, the authorities stress the high value that is placed on the annual Article IV consultations
and, more generally, the various areas of successful cooperation between Botswana and the Fund.
As part of the Article IV process, it is fully recognised that the Executive Board should make an
objective and independent assessment including policy advice, and that this cannot be expected
always to coincide with the views of the national authorities.
It is also recognised that the Botswana economy currently faces difficult challenges, the extent of
which should not be downplayed, and which must be met if the process of development is to
continue successfully. Growth has slowed and remains overly dependent on the mining sector; and
there are concerns that unemployment is an increasingly serious problem. Moreover, there are
substantial costs that are required to effectively tackle the HIV/AIDS pandemic and this is placing a
severe strain on the resources available to the public sector at a time when slower revenue growth is
anticipated.
However, the assessment of the Board, as recorded in the PIN, goes too far in painting a picture of
economic malaise and this is reflected in the accompanying policy recommendations which call for
major adjustments at the macroeconomic level. In particular, suggestions that the government
should consider raising the rate of VAT and reducing the public sector wage bill would be
appropriate for a situation of severe fiscal imbalance. However, while the period where the
government budget in Botswana was consistently in surplus may have passed, so far there is no
need for the significant fiscal adjustment called for in the Board assessment. Recently, there have
been some technical difficulties experienced in the timely collection of fiscal data. It is clear,
nevertheless, that the final budget for 2004/05 was in approximate balance. The Government has
made a strong commitment to maintain a balanced budget over the course of the economic cycle,
and institutional measures to support this are being put in place.
Policy formulation in Botswana has consistently been based on careful consideration of the relevant
issues and consultation, and this approach will continue, as indicated by the presentation of the MidTerm Review of National Development Plan 9 to Parliament, in November 2005. In line with this
approach, the decision taken in May 2005 to devalue the Pula was a measured reaction to a situation
where all the evidence pointed to a serious overvaluation of the Pula. The consequences for both
fiscal and monetary policy had already been considered carefully, in particular the need to ensure

- 59 that inevitable upward pressures on costs were constrained from developing into broader
inflationary pressures. The authorities’ subsequent actions have been consistent with this, with the
necessary adjustments to monetary policy being made in the context of the scheduled mid-year
review of the annual monetary policy statement. In contrast, the Board’s assessment that there is a
need for ‘decisive policy action’ was more relevant to an unforeseen economic shock where the
appropriate policy response has to be developed quickly. Moreover, since the devaluation was
undertaken in order to help improve national competitiveness in support of economic
diversification, rather than to correct external imbalance, the call for additional fiscal restraint to
curb domestic demand does not seem appropriate, especially given the direct impact of the
devaluation on purchasing power.
The Board’s assessment is correct to focus on areas where further structural reform could improve
the functioning of the economy and encourage private sector development. However, the call for
comprehensive reform of the legal and regulatory framework as a necessary precursor to
privatisation is too sweeping. This is especially so in the context of the more detailed Staff Report,
which explicitly noted progress on necessary legal reforms. Such a judgment could cast doubt on
the Government’s capacity to implement a privatisation programme, especially as the Botswana
Privatisation Masterplan, which was published in August 2005, includes an extensive list of public
enterprises which are explicitly identified as being ready for privatisation without further work in
these areas.
The authorities look forward to continued good relations with the Fund, including the discussions
during the next Article IV consultation that will take place in 2006.

- 60 Statement by Peter Gakunu, Alternate Executive Director for Botswana
and Bhadala T. Mamba, Advisor to Executive Director
June 1, 2005
Introduction and Background
1.
The Botswana authorities would like to thank the Fund management and staff for the
valuable advice provided over the years, the open dialogue and the frank exchange of views
during the 2005 Article IV consultation discussions. The government, though not a user of
Fund resources, has benefited immensely from the Fund technical assistance, which has
helped it hone the policies that have been essential for the achievements made in continued
macroeconomic stabilization of the economy and consistently charting a positive growth
path.
2.
Botswana has been among the top economic performers in the world during the last
three decades. This occurred despite initial adverse conditions, including minimal investment
during the colonial period. Over the years, Botswana has been able to balance provision of
social services with good economic management as evidenced by the high sovereign credit
ratings awarded by both Moody’s and Standard and Poor’ rating agencies in the A grade for a
third year in a row. Botswana’s ratings, which are the highest in Africa, are indicative of the
firm commitment of Government to prudent fiscal and monetary policy, as well as continuing
political and macroeconomic stability.
3.
Notwithstanding this accomplishment, the authorities are aware that the country faces
difficult developmental challenges, including further diversification of the economic base,
the pressing challenge of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, further reduction of the prevalence of
poverty by maintaining high economic growth rates so as to meet the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) and the country’s vision 2016 objectives. The authorities have
already made good progress in responding to these challenges, and their strategy going
forward is sound. The ruling party was re-elected and formed a new government in the latter
part of 2004 and has re-committed itself to continue pursuing sound macroeconomic policies,
ensure stability and build on the achievements already made.
Recent Economic Developments and Prospects
4.
The economy has continued to register positive growth rates in 2003/04 albeit at a
lower pace than the previous years and growth is expected to decelerate further in 2004/05.
Economic performance is expected to fall slightly in 2004 to 4 percent compared to
5.7 percent the year before, largely due to a general decline in the performance of the mining
and the non-mining sectors. The fiscal position is expected to improve with the budget deficit
set at 0.5 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2005/06. The fiscal performance will be supported by
an expected improvement in mineral receipts and improvement in tax administration.
5.
Employment has been growing and about 11 000 formal sector jobs were added to the
labor market in 2004, which is double the additional formal sector jobs added in the previous

- 61 year. This positive development notwithstanding, unemployment estimated at 23.8 percent,
remains a major challenge that the authorities are addressing actively. They believe that
sustained economic growth and development can only be achieved through a greater degree
of self reliance by the private sector and through the reduction of the role of the state in
economic activity.
6.
It is in this vein that the Botswana Development Corporation (BDC) has promoted a
number of new projects in several sectors including concrete crushing, electrical cable
manufacturing, plastic recycling amongst others and has a number of projects being finalized.
Every effort is being made to diversify the economy and accelerate the structural reforms
necessary to support this initiative. Consequently, economic growth is forecast to be between
5-6 percent in the medium term as projected in the ninth National Development Plan (NDP
9). They are committed to regional economic integration efforts particularly on the trade
front and further developing the country as a regional financial hub.
Fiscal Policy
7.
The Botswana authorities will continue to pursue prudent fiscal management based
on the overarching principle of fiscal sustainability. The authorities’ fiscal strategy is
premised on achieving a balanced budget while they are also willing to run minimum and
manageable budget deficits under given unique circumstances in future. The authorities,
however, recognize the challenges they face arising from dwindling revenues as a result of
the gradual slowdown of the diamond sector, projected further declines in SACU receipts and
increased expenditure on HIV/AIDS. The fiscal position is expected to improve with the
budget deficit estimated to be 0.5 percent of GDP in the 2005/2006 fiscal year. The fiscal
performance will be supported by an expected improvement in mineral receipts and
improvement in tax administration.
8.
A new budget has been introduced that captures all expenditures and ensures that they
are brought in line with the NDP 9 objectives. The authorities are in the process of rollingout
the Budget Accounting and Budgeting System. This is part of a broader effort to improve
public sector productivity, including the introduction of Performance Management System
(PMS) and computerization of government activities. The authorities recently established a
Unified Revenue Service (BURS), which will assist in improving revenue administration
capacity.
Monetary, Exchange Rate and Financial Sector Issues
9.
While the country’s monetary stance is anchored on the exchange rate peg, the
authorities are exploring ways to further strengthen the monetary policy framework including
a possible move to inflation targeting, which would aim at arresting inflationary pressures,
maintain competitiveness and rein in macro economic stability. In this regard, the authorities
have initiated efforts to improve the understanding of the monetary policy transmission
mechanisms while developing management systems in the short-term inflation forecasting
capacity. The effects of the devaluation were temporary and did not cause any significant
disruption to the economy. The inflation rate has been declining since November 2004, with

- 62 the six month annualized average inflation hovering around 5 percent. The authorities
achieved their inflation rate target of 4-7 percent, hence feel that their decision to lower the
bank rate recently from 14.25 to 14 percent was appropriate.
10.
The authorities are working tirelessly to improve the financial sector and deal with
the sizeable deficit on the capital and financial account. Efforts to develop the domestic bond
market are still on-going though the economy is still experiencing excess liquidity arising
from the privatization of the public pension system. Moreover, the Bank of Botswana is
using monetary policy tools to deal with the excess liquidity by issuing central bank
certificates. In line with its objective of building a prosperous and innovative nation, the
government has established the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) aimed at
attracting sustainable investments into the country. To improve the quality of supervision
and reduce vulnerability in the finance sector, the authorities intend to establish a Financial
Supervisory authority for non-banks. In this respect, they have recently completed a
Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening Initiative and the recommendations are currently
under consideration by the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning. The country has
completed its draft AMLC/CFT strategy aimed at bringing the framework in line with
international standards, and is considering the merits of applying for an FSAP to further
strengthen the financial system.
Structural Issues
11.
The Botswana authorities remain committed to structural reforms in order to achieve
the transformation of the economy and set a sustainable growth path. In this respect, the
National Employment, Manpower and Incomes Council, an umbrella body with the
responsibility to oversee the structural reform process as enshrined in the NDP 9, has been
reconstituted with a broader reform agenda. The authorities have announced a Privatization
Master Plan and other initiatives aimed at improving performance of the public enterprises.
They believe that the privatization process should be orderly and that it should benefit all
citizens through garnering political consensus on the pace of the divesture process.
12.
To also improve tax administration and revenue collection, the authorities have
embarked on an extensive follow-up on tax evaders and are improving the legal framework
to ensure that more people are brought into the formal tax net and comply with the laws of
the land. In this regard the authorities intend to improve the audit and enforcement
procedures.
13.
Special focus and support has also been given to small scale enterprises through the
Citizens Entrepreneurial Development Agency (CEDA). During 2004, the government
undertook a study to review Revised National Policy on Incomes, Employment, Prices and
Profits of 1990. The government is currently considering the recommendations of the study
before they are presented to Parliament.
14.
The government is committed to creating an enabling environment necessary to
attract Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) into the country. The authorities are forging links
with other regional partners on trade and investment, and have adopted a Foreign Direct

- 63 Investment Strategy, a new Competition Policy and are revising the legal operating
environment supportive of this initiative. Several other pieces of legislation aimed at
improving the country’s image as an attractive investment destination are currently being
introduced, reviewed or modernized. The authorities are also in the process of implementing
the recommendations of the FIAS study on administrative barriers to investment.
Health and HIV/AIDS
15.
The country launched its Millennium Development Goals Status Report in September
2004, which indicated that a lot needed to be done to improve the country’s health situation,
most notably with regards to HIV/AIDS and malaria. The authorities have committed
themselves to providing a comprehensive and accessible health care and services to its
populace throughout the country. The authorities are also committed to achieve the target of
reducing mother to child HIV infection by 2015. In this respect, they have devised a
comprehensive strategy to deal with the pandemic, which includes catering for orphans,
sourcing and distribution of drugs, provision of food for affected vulnerable groups, clothing
and school uniforms and other related necessities. Thanks to the authorities determined
efforts and assistance of the international community, there are currently encouraging signs
that the incidence rate of HIV/AIDS may have already begun to level off as the latest official
statistics show that the incidence of the disease among those 18 months of age and older is
17.3 percent, while the incidence for the population aged 15 to 49 years is 25.3 percent. The
country, while focusing on fighting the HIV/AIDS pandemic, has had to deal with a rising
mortality rate. The authorities have embarked on a country-wide endeavor to provide health
services and are introducing a number of infrastructural developments, including building
new facilities and upgrading existing ones. The government has intensified its efforts to train
nationals in the health sector to deal with the acute shortage.
Other Issues
16.
The government is committed to fight poverty. Though some gains have been made
in recent years, there still remains a substantial number of people (23.4 percent of the
population) below the poverty line. The government has established a Rural Development
Council whose work is guided by the Revised National Policy for Rural Development and
supported by a substantial allocation of the development budget to ensure that the plight of
the rural poor are properly addressed and that rural development institutions are adequately
funded so that they can play their rightful role in this effort.
Conclusion
17.
The authorities are fully cognizant of the changing economic environment and are
committed to taking appropriate steps to deal with these challenges driven by the need to be
self reliant and meet the MDGs. Not only is the international environment unpredictable, but
the domestic economic environment has also been equally challenging as shown by the
decline in the contribution of the diamond sector and the deteriorating social indicators
exacerbated by the HIV/AIDS pandemic. It is in this respect that the authorities have
embarked on a broad-based structural reform agenda, realigned the budget with a focus on

- 64 social issues and fight against poverty, while ensuring that it remains balanced and does not
pose long-term threats to the economy. The authorities recognize the need to prioritize
government expenditure and foster prudent fiscal management of public resources given the
limited resource envelope, while promoting growth and diversifying the economy.
