BELIZE
Staff Report for the 2003 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2003 Consultation with Belize
Approved by Christopher Towe and G. Russell Kincaid
March 5, 2004

•

Background: Belize is a small, export-based economy dependent on tourism, shrimp farming, and
agriculture (citrus, sugar, and bananas). As a result, the economy is vulnerable to exogenous and
weather-related shocks, as well as changes in preferential market access. Since taking office in
1998, the current government has sought to accelerate economic growth through highly
expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. While growth has been strong and inflation low, the
fiscal deficit is likely to reach 8 percent of GDP in the current fiscal year, public debt rose above
90 percent of GDP by end-2003, while the external position remained under significant pressure
with the external current account deficit at about 16 percent of GDP.

•

2002 Article IV consultation: At the conclusion of the 2002 Article IV consultation on
November 1, 2002, Directors expressed concern with the deterioration in the fiscal and external
current account positions and with the rapid increase in public debt. They welcomed the policy
shift announced by the authorities in June 2002 that was aimed at forestalling the emergence of a
balance of payments crisis and urged the authorities to sustain this sound macroeconomic policy
stance.

•

Discussions: A staff team comprising B. Fritz-Krockow (Head), E. Jenkner, I. de Carvalho, and
P. Rabanal (all WHD) visited Belize during December 3–15, 2003. Mr. O’Loghlin (OED)
participated in the policy discussions. During the mission, the staff supported the authorities’
proposed sharp correction of the fiscal position, but raised serious questions about the consistency
of the authorities’ projections and the depth of the envisaged measures, especially in light of past
budget overruns.

•

Fund relations: Belize accepted the obligations of Article VIII in 1983; its last arrangement with
the Fund ended in 1986. Belize maintains an exchange restriction and multiple currency practices.
The authorities have not been receptive to Fund policy advice in the past, except for a brief period
in 2002 when the country faced a balance of payments crisis and the exchange rate peg appeared
threatened.

•

Statistics: Belize’s statistical information is reported with long delays and with a quality and
frequency that render some economic statistics inadequate for monitoring purposes.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Real GDP growth recovered in 2003. The economy recovered from the effects of
hurricanes, a tourism slump, and a shrimp virus epidemic in 2001-02 on the back of a
strong expansion of exports. Inflation remains low.

•

However, the underlying macroeconomic position remained worrisome. The fiscal
and external current account imbalances remained at unsustainable levels. Net
international reserves covered about half of public short-term debt service on a remaining
maturity basis at end-2003, while public and publicly guaranteed debt (mostly
nonconcessional external debt) reached 92 percent of GDP.

•

The authorities are committed to the exchange rate peg, which they consider a
critical anchor for expectations and confidence. The staff noted that in addition to the
urgent need for a fiscal correction, a tightening of monetary policies was needed to
sustain the peg. The staff also recommended measures to make the exchange rate regime
more transparent and market-determined with a view to an eventual unification of the
markets.

•

The authorities agreed that present fiscal and monetary policies were unsustainable.
In this context, policy discussions focused on the extent and depth of adjustment
measures to correct the current policy stance.

•

The authorities have announced a number of policy measures. The central
government budget for FY 2004/05 (fiscal year begins April) calls for a reduction of the
deficit from around 8 percent of GDP in FY 2003/04 to below 3 percent of GDP, based
mainly on an increase in land taxes and a further compression of capital expenditure.
They also plan to tighten monetary policy in line with staff recommendations.

•

The staff supported the proposed tightening of policies, but questioned the
consistency of the authorities’ fiscal plan. The authorities’ revenue measures appear
likely to fall significantly short of their estimated yields and the staff recommended a
broader range of revenue and expenditure measures. The staff also urged the authorities
to act swiftly and to sustain their adjustment efforts, pointing to the comprehensive but
short-lived policy adjustment undertaken in 2002.

I. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
1.
The economy recovered in 2003 from several exogenous shocks in recent years.
The economy is estimated to have grown by 5.5 percent in 2003 following growth of
4.3 percent in 2002, rebounding from the effects of hurricane damage, a shrimp virus
epidemic, and the drop in tourism revenue after September 2001 (Figure 1). Agricultural
output grew by more than 20 percent in the first half of 2003 relative to the same period in
the previous year, while the fishing sector (including shrimp aquaculture) expanded by more
than 300 percent. Tourism receipts grew by 25 percent in 2003, driven by a recovery in stayover arrivals and a marked increase in cruise ship tourist arrivals.
2.
Inflation has remained low. Inflation has remained at around 2½ percent in 2003,
reflecting the currency peg and low international inflation. The real effective exchange rate,
calculated using the official exchange rate, depreciated by about 4 percent during 2003,
mainly owing to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar vis-à-vis the Euro (Figure 2).

The fiscal deficit remained large in FY 2003/04. After a short-lived policy
adjustment in mid-2002 to avoid a balance of payments crisis, the authorities increased
budget-financed capital expenditure rapidly in the run-up to the March 2003 elections

is projected to decline only to 8.1 percent of GDP, from 9.6 percent in FY 2002/03. 1 This
adjustment reflects a compression of capital expenditure from 12.6 percent of GDP in
FY 2002/03 to 9.9 percent of GDP in FY 2003/04, which would be partly offset by the
effects of tax exemptions on the revenue ratio, as well as sizeable wage increases and
payments for the installation of new telephony services.2
4.
The FY 2003/04 central government deficit is
being financed mainly through substantial external
100
borrowing. Net external disbursements to the
central government are projected to amount to
90
12½ percent of GDP in FY 2003/04, contracted
80
mostly on commercial terms, and public and
70
publicly guaranteed debt rose to around
60
92 percent of GDP at end-2003 (Figure 4).3
About 6 percent of GDP was onlent domestically 50
to the DFC to enable it to repay external
40
creditors. The substantial borrowing requirement
30
led to increasing difficulties in accessing capital
markets in 2003. Foreign banks cancelled credit
20
lines and borrowing costs have increased.

The staff report for the 2002 Article IV consultation reviews the staff recommendations and
the authorities’ policy response to the balance of payments difficulties, which arose from
exogenous shocks, expansionary fiscal polices, and the rapid expansion of DFC credit. The
authorities implemented Fund staff recommendations to reduce the fiscal deficit sharply and
tighten monetary policy in mid-2002.
2

A three-year labor agreement signed in early 2003 calls for 8 percent annual wage increases
beginning in April 2003. Generous tax exemptions to growth sectors and the proliferation of
export processing zones have severely reduced the buoyancy of the tax regime. To prevent a
more pronounced erosion in tax revenue, the authorities have increased the variable import
duty on petroleum products, which accounts for about half of the nominal increase in tax
revenue since FY 2000/01.

Including a US$100 million 12-year global bond, at an interest rate of 9.75 percent, with an
85 percent CAC. This follows a US$125 million, 10-year global bond, with an interest rate of
9.5 percent, no CAC, issued in mid-2002.

-8-

5.
The state-owned Development Finance Corporation (DFC) continued to
represent a major drain on public finances. The government provided transfers of
around 2 percent of GDP to the DFC during 2003 to help fund its credit expansion and
investment projects. In addition, the government provided about 6 percent of GDP to
refinance external liabilities of the DFC.4 Nonetheless, the DFC still suffers from a
24 percent nonperforming loan ratio, a severe maturity mismatch in its balance sheet, and a
large stock of unsold physical assets (mainly houses) that comprise about a third of its
balance sheet. Corrected for problems of loan classification, asset valuation, and inadequate
provisioning, the staff estimated that the DFC has a negative capital position.
6.
Monetary policy was accommodative in 2003. The Central Bank of Belize (CBB)
repurchased about BZ$50 million of short-term government securities held by commercial
banks and used moral suasion to encourage banks to lower lending rates. These measures,
together with increasing delays in public sector payments to private suppliers and
contractors, helped cause an expansion in credit to the private sector of about 12 percent in
2003. At the same time, however, M2 has continued to fall in relation to GDP, and

the loan-to-deposit ratio rose from 74 percent by end-2001 to 98 percent by end-2003,
reflecting the movement of deposits offshore as a result of legislation allowing companies in
export processing zones to move deposits to international banks, but also resulting from an
erosion in confidence (Figure 5).5 Nonetheless, indicators for the financial sector (excluding
the DFC) have generally remained strong.6
7.
The balance of payments weakened
despite a substantial growth in exports in
2003. Merchandise exports and tourism receipts
grew by about 12 percent and 25 percent,
respectively, in 2003 as a result of the recovery
from exogenous shocks and a continued
capacity expansion. However, imports rose by
about 9 percent owing to increased public
sector demand and the rapid growth in private
sector credit (Figure 6). As a result, the current
account deficit only narrowed by
1.4 percentage points of GDP in 2003 and
remained high at 15.8 percent of GDP. With
public sector net disbursements falling from
US$122 million to around US$52 million,
gross reserves fell by US$30 million (about
⅓ of total reserves) during 2003, dropping to
US$76 million or about half of public shortterm debt service on a remaining maturity
basis.7

Domestic banks are only authorized to accept foreign currency deposits or provide foreign
currency loans to exporters, and balance of payments data also do not allow a detailed
analysis of private deposit flows.

The ratio is about unchanged from the previous year despite lower reserves and larger debt
stocks due to 2002-03 debt refinancing operations that reduced the 2004 debt service burden.

8.
The exchange rate peg remained under pressure. The parallel market spread
remained around 10 percent despite the substantial recovery in foreign exchange receipts in
2003, reflecting increasing private capital outflows. The CBB continued to sell foreign
exchange to commercial banks on an ad-hoc basis to prevent the parallel market rate spread
from rising.
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
9.
The discussions focused on the policy measures needed to address short-term
vulnerabilities and to place the economy on a sustainable medium-term path. The
authorities agreed that the current fiscal and monetary policies were unsustainable over the
medium term, and noted that the central government budget for FY 2004/05 calls for a
reduction of the deficit to below 3 percent of GDP, based mainly on an increase in land taxes
and a further compression of capital expenditure. They also stated their willingness to
implement, if necessary, further revenue and expenditure measures beyond those currently
envisaged and noted that monetary policy would be tightened in line with staff
recommendations.
10.
Nonetheless, important risks remain. The staff stressed that forceful, immediate,
and sustained measures were needed to avoid a rapid and accelerating erosion of confidence
and a loss of access to international capital markets. Moreover, the staff also cautioned that
revenue would probably fall significantly short of the authorities’ projections and noted that
expenditure overruns in the past suggested further risks on the spending side. The staff urged
the authorities to move quickly to introduce the additional measures necessary to ensure the
targeted fiscal correction and—especially in light of the short-lived policy correction of
2002—emphasized the importance of sustaining the adjustment effort over the medium term.
A. Macroeconomic Framework
11.
A sharp and front loaded fiscal correction would leave the short-term
macroeconomic outlook manageable. Notwithstanding the impact of the fiscal adjustment
on public and private demand, the economy would grow by about 3½ percent in 2004,
supported by strong export growth, in turn related to the boost provided by recent investment
in tourism facilities, shrimp farming, and agriculture. Export growth and the dampening
effect of fiscal and monetary tightening on imports would help reduce the external current
account deficit, which would fall to around 8½ percent of GDP and rebuild reserve coverage.
Public and publicly guaranteed debt would remain about unchanged at around 93 percent of
GDP at end-2004.

12.
This frontloaded adjustment effort would also lay a solid foundation for the
medium term. The staff projections assume that the overall central government balance
would narrow by about 8 percent of GDP in the coming two year-period, with most of the
adjustment taking place in FY 2004/05 and the primary fiscal surplus would remain at around
6 percent of GDP thereafter. As a result, public and publicly guaranteed debt would decline
from 92 percent of GDP at end-2003 to around 67 percent in 2008 (Figure 7), while net
international reserves would continue to increase gradually.8 As a result of the sharp
improvement in the public savings-investment gap, the external current account would also
improve steadily, with the deficit falling from 8.4 percent of GDP in 2004 to 3.8 percent of
GDP by 2008. Supported largely by a continued expansion in exports, GDP growth would
average about 4½ percent over the projection period.
13.
Weak or unsustained policy adjustment would subject the outlook to
considerable risk. Staff debt sustainability analysis illustrates that a continuation of present
policies would push public debt to 137 percent of GDP by 2008, leaving the debt ratio highly
vulnerable to exchange rate or other shocks (Table 10).9 Moreover, even with a rapid and
sustained correction of the fiscal imbalance, the economy would remain highly vulnerable to
exogenous shocks in light of the already high levels of external debt and debt service, the
economy’s exposure to natural disasters such as hurricanes and flooding, and its reliance on

Fiscal data is presented on a fiscal year basis, except in the medium-term debt sustainability
analysis (Table 10), which is on a calendar year basis.
9

The staff’s work follows the methodology laid out in “Sustainability Assessments–Review
of Application and Methodological Refinements,” (07/01/2003). An external debt
sustainability analysis cannot be carried out due to the lack of sufficient information on
private sector external debt and debt service obligations.

preferential trade access for its exports of sugar and bananas. The staff stressed that these
risks underscored the importance of achieving and sustaining the policy corrections planned
for the coming year, and possibly argued for even more ambitious adjustments in subsequent
years in order to build up a margin of resilience to withstand future exogenous shocks.
B. Fiscal Policy
14.
The authorities aim to reduce the fiscal deficit to below 3 percent of GDP in
FY 2004/05. They project revenue to increase by about 2 percent of GDP, mainly as a result
of improvements in tax administration and the introduction of a new land tax. In addition, the
authorities plan to revise various taxes during 2004 to shift the emphasis from duties on
international trade to taxes on domestic consumption. However, most of the adjustment
would result from a further compression of capital expenditure. The authorities also noted
that they would undertake a comprehensive public expenditure review during 2004.

15.
The staff expressed reservations about the authorities’ revenue projections and
the depth of the envisaged adjustment measures. They pointed to the probable low yield
of the land tax in the absence of a collection agency or a functional database of taxpayers and
they also noted the lack of buoyancy of the tax regime, which would continue to depress
revenue in FY 2004/05. They emphasized the need for wider-ranging tax measures and for
supplementing the envisaged cuts in capital expenditure with a freeze of current expenditure.
The staff also expressed their concern that the deficit had exceeded the budgeted level by
about 3 percent of GDP in the previous fiscal year.

- 14 -

16.
In this context, the staff suggested additional measures. These measures would
total around 2 percent of GDP and would be needed to achieve the authorities’ deficit target.
Specific recommendations included:
•

Strengthening taxes: This would include eliminating tax exemptions, streamlining
and increasing sales tax rates, raising or imposing excise taxes, and reducing the basic
income tax exemption. The staff estimated that these measures would increase
revenue by about 0.6 percent of GDP in FY 2004/05 and about 1½ percent of GDP on
a long-term basis, bringing tax revenue in relation to GDP closer to levels of other
English-speaking Caribbean countries.

•

Freezing current outlays: The staff estimated that the expenditure freeze would
generate savings of about 1.4 percent of GDP in FY 2004/05. This would include a
freeze in the public sector wage bill, which would require a review of the current
public sector wage agreement and the level of public sector employment. Outlays for
goods and services would also decline with the completion of payments to the new
telephone company for the installation of services, and would offset the increase in
interest payments in 2004/05.

•

Limiting budget-financed investment: Capital outlays would be reduced in line
with the authorities’ projections, but should focus on limiting budget-financed
investment projects to the completion of those currently in progress, while new
investment projects could be financed by foreign donors and multilateral agencies. 10

•

Improving monitoring: Budget execution should be monitored closely to avoid
expenditure overruns as had occurred in previous years.

17.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to contain the fiscal deficit at the
budgeted level. Although they did not see an immediate need for additional measures, they
agreed to reassess their budget projections and would consider more comprehensive tax
measures if necessary to bring the fiscal adjustment path back on track. Noting the staff’s
concern that expenditure had exceeded the budget limits significantly in previous years, they
agreed to monitor budget execution closely in order to ensure that deviations are detected
early.
18.
The authorities are restructuring the DFC. They stated their intention to return the
DFC to its original mandate as a small development bank with an emphasis on the export
sector and education. After having refinanced most of the DFC’s external debt, the
10

Government capital expenditure includes both donor-financed (multilateral lenders and
donors, including counterpart funds) and budget-financed capital expenditure, as well as
some current outlays (about 1½ percent of GDP in FY 2002/03), such as transfers to
decentralized public sector entities.

- 15 -

authorities are offering some of the DFC’s assets for sale, namely housing and a portion of its
unencumbered loan portfolio.11 The authorities have issued a prospectus prepared by an
international accounting firm and have received several expressions of interest. The staff
urged the authorities to seek technical assistance in restructuring and reorganizing the DFC
and to provide an equity injection if necessary for the DFC to fulfill its mandate properly.
The staff cautioned, however, that the DFC was still expanding its loan portfolio before
completing the restructuring and reorganization, which could lead to a misallocation of
resources and higher fiscal costs. The staff welcomed the authorities’ decision to place the
DFC under the banking supervision of the central bank beginning January 2004.
C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
19.
The authorities stressed their commitment to the exchange rate peg as an anchor
for confidence and inflation expectations. They noted that the strength of foreign direct
investment and exports suggested that Belize remained competitive, that wage pressures in
the private sector were moderate as a result of labor migration from neighboring countries,
and that the business community strongly favored the certainty provided by the peg.
Nonetheless, the authorities agreed that the present
Figure 8. Belize: Central Bank Sugar
stance of macroeconomic policies was not consistent
Receipts and Interest Payments
with the maintenance of the peg, and
(In millions of U.S. dollars)
emphasized their commitment to adjusting demand
80
policies as necessary. The staff cautioned that
delaying this adjustment risked accelerating the
Sugar e xport proce e ds
loss of confidence and the eventual loss of the
70
exchange rate peg.
60
20.
The authorities agreed on the need to
tighten liquidity to contain credit growth and
reduce pressures on the exchange rate. In
50
particular, public sector external interest
obligations exceeded the CBB’s only recurrent
40
source of foreign currency (sugar export
receipts), and would have to be met by either
30
official reserves or CBB purchases of foreign
currency in the private foreign exchange market
(Figure 8). Against this background, the
20
authorities agreed that an adjustment in monetary
policies was needed to help alleviate pressure on the
parallel foreign exchange rate and

- 16 -

intended to increase cash reserve requirements from 6 percent to 7 percent for all types of
deposits effective April 2004. Combined with the fiscal adjustment, this was projected to
contain growth of the CBB’s net domestic assets and slow growth in credit to the private
sector to 6.4 percent in 2004. The authorities acknowledged the need to stand ready to protect
the balance of payments position by further adjusting monetary policy if the fiscal adjustment
were to fall short of the target, but were concerned that this could have an adverse effect on
economic growth.
21.
The staff and the authorities also agreed that the CBB should move towards a
unified reserve requirement. The authorities are committed to gradually transforming the
liquidity ratio to a prudential requirement, while maintaining the existing cash requirement
ratio as a monetary policy instrument. In this context, the authorities intend to exclude
mortgages from the definition of “approved liquid assets” to avoid unduly encouraging
lending in the residential sector.
22.
The staff called for a more market-determined and transparent exchange rate
system. Specifically, the staff recommended a gradual widening of the band in the cambios
system and the removal of some of their operating restrictions and implicit taxation, with the
objective of integrating the parallel market transactions in the cambios, and eventually
unifying the foreign exchange markets (Box 1).12 The staff also urged the authorities to
define clear rules for central bank sales of foreign exchange to the private sector, in order to
limit the potential for resource misallocation and rent-seeking. The staff noted that the
existence of several foreign exchange markets with rates that differ by more than 2 percent
from the official rate gives rise to multiple currency practices, and that the selective sales of
foreign exchange by the central bank constitute an exchange restriction. Both are subject to
Fund approval, which could not be forthcoming in the absence of a clear timetable for their
elimination.
23.
The authorities were unconvinced regarding the need to liberalize the cambios
regime. They emphasized instead the need for tighter controls to prevent illicit transactions,
despite the staff’s concerns that this would encourage market participants to move
increasingly to the parallel market. Nevertheless, the authorities agreed on the need to review
the functioning of the cambios and have commissioned a report from the CBB, which is due
by end-April 2004.

12

Issues Paper.

- 17 -

Box 1: The Foreign Exchange System
The foreign exchange system comprises three markets: The official market, the private
foreign exchange houses (cambios), and a parallel market.
Official market. The central bank conducts operations at the official peg with the public sector
and commercial banks. The CBB’s only recurrent source of foreign exchange is from sugar
exports, which are subject to surrender requirements. The CBB sells foreign exchange to the
public sector and to commercial banks. Sales to commercial banks are limited to private sector
transactions deemed essential (oil and flour imports or private sector debt service) and to adhoc sales aimed at preventing the parallel market rate from depreciating. Commercial banks
purchase and sell foreign exchange from the public and are required to do so at the official rate
with a small trading spread. However, commercial banks have begun to levy fees to depreciate
the effective selling rate in view of the large parallel market and the exchange rate spread.
Foreign exchange houses (cambios). The authorities allowed the establishment of the cambios
in mid-2002, with the intention of drawing transactions from the parallel market into supervised
and controlled channels. The cambios are only authorized to buy foreign exchange in the
tourism sector and have to sell 5 percent of their gross purchases to the CBB at the official rate.
They are required to pay an annual fee of US$5,000, cannot trade at a rate of more than
BZ$2.15 per US$ or buy or sell in one transaction or in related transactions more than
US$10,000 a day, and are subject to CBB supervision. Reported trading volume of the cambios
is insignificant due to the restrictions and implicit taxation.
Parallel market. Foreign exchange trading outside the official market and the cambios is
illegal, but the establishment of the cambios was perceived as a decriminalization of parallel
market trading, and led to some integration and transparency of the previously highly
fragmented parallel foreign exchange market.

D. Structural Policies
24.
The authorities are adopting measures to enhance competitiveness and
productivity. The authorities have privatized all public enterprises in an effort to improve
their provision of services and have deregulated in recent years (the telecommunications
monopoly was eliminated in 2003). The authorities are considering donor-financed projects
to enhance the competitiveness of the export sector through cost-reduction (e.g., transportation and storage, and logistics consulting), and training (e.g., for ancillary tourism services),
and product diversification. The authorities shared staff’s concern about the impact of the
expected erosion of preferential trading regimes for sugar and bananas in 2006 and were
particularly concerned about the lack of competitiveness in the sugar industry, which would

- 18 -

face severe difficulties at prevailing world market prices (Box 2). In response, the authorities
have sought to bolster the competitiveness of the sugar and banana sectors, including by
introducing higher yielding crops, improving marketing and technology, and encouraging
diversification through changes in the regulatory environment. The authorities have also
supported selective import substitution projects, e.g., for domestic soybean production and
hydroelectric power generation.

Box 2: Vulnerability to Preference Erosion
Belize is among the most vulnerable middle-income countries to the potential effects of a loss in
preferential market access on exports. Notwithstanding the recent diversification in current account
receipts, Belize’s exports are dominated by sugar and bananas, which in turn are highly dependent on
preferential access to the EU and U.S. markets.
Staff estimates suggest that a 40 percent reduction in Belize’s preference margin would cause export
revenue to drop by 10-12 percent. This estimate assumes constant volumes as there are no reliable
estimates of supply or demand elasticities for the banana and sugar sectors. However, the estimates
took into account Belize’s composition of exports and direction of trade, and assumed full utilization
of preferences and that all rents from preferential access accrue to exporters.

25.
Belize’s trade regime remains relatively restrictive as non-tariff barriers are
pervasive.13 While the authorities have moved to dismantle tariffs on CARICOM goods,
revenue replacement duties and a comprehensive import-licensing regime remain in place
covering 29 groups of goods. The authorities did not agree with the staff’s assessment that
import restrictions should be phased out in favor of tariffs with a view to improving resource
allocation, citing food security concerns and the possibility of severe price volatility.
26.
Improvements in debt management are key to enhancing the sustainability of
public debt. The staff noted that debt statistics—including publicly guaranteed debt—
needed to be harmonized and updated regularly. The staff also recommended setting clear
objectives for debt management, developing a legal framework governing the issuance of
public debt and guarantees, training of debt managers, and improving the technological
infrastructure.

13

Belize has a rating of 5 in the Fund trade restrictiveness index, which indicates a
moderately restrictive regime.

- 19 -

27.
Efforts are underway to improve the supervision of both onshore and offshore
financial institutions. Efforts have intensified since December 2003 with the support of a
long-term advisor from the Fund and technical assistance in the context of an Offshore
Financial Center (OFC) Assessment, and from the IDB. The staff noted in particular the
efforts to correct weaknesses in the central bank’s supervisory department such as
understaffing or the lack of administrative, legal, and political independence to enforce
existing prudential norms. The staff noted also that the supervision of the various financial
entities is fragmented, and that credit unions are not effectively regulated or supervised. In
this respect, the staff welcomed the recent decision by the CBB to study improvements in and
coordination of the supervision of financial agencies through the long-term technical
assistance provided by the Fund. The staff welcomed also the efforts to prevent money
laundering and combat the financing of terrorism, particularly through the creation of a
Financial Intelligence Unit that serves as a central coordinator for domestic and cross-border
efforts against financial crime.
E. Statistical Issues
28.
Belize’s statistical information is insufficient to monitor economic developments
on a timely basis. The staff noted that economic data is reported with long delays and with a
quality and frequency that render some economic statistics inadequate for monitoring
purposes (Appendix V). The staff welcomed the substantial improvement in the GDP
statistics, which were rebased from 1984 to 2000 and the ongoing efforts to prepare quarterly
GDP indicators (Box 3). The authorities expressed their appreciation for the technical
assistance that the Fund has provided in the past and expressed their interest in receiving
further assistance to continue to improve the quality of their data.
Box 3: Statistics: National Accounts
Until recently, national accounts data in Belize was unreliable and provided with long delays.
The Central Statistical Office (CSO) produced national accounts only annually and with significant
lags, which severely hampered the quality and timeliness of financial planning and budget
preparation. Quarterly indicators of economic activity were also unavailable. National accounts at
constant prices were also unreliable due to an obsolete base year (1984).
The authorities improved the quality of Belize’s national accounts with the assistance of Fund
staff advice and technical assistance in 2002-03. The major changes to the national accounts are:
constant prices estimates based on a more recent year (2000); two independent methodologies to
calculate GDP at market prices; sector by sector methodological improvements; calculation of export
and import price indexes; methodology for measurement of investment based on imports of capital
goods and input costs; and the introduction of a quarterly GDP measurement. The improvements in
the national accounts benefited from advice and technical assistance from Fund staff and Statistics
Sweden.

- 20 -

III. STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
There is an urgent need to re-establish a viable external position through a
comprehensive, swift, and sustained policy adjustment. Fiscal and external current
account deficits remain at unsustainable levels, leading to severe pressures on international
reserves and high and rapidly growing levels of public and publicly guaranteed debt. These
imbalances and the short-lived adjustment efforts in the past have also undermined
confidence and access to international capital markets, and have raised questions about the
sustainability of the exchange rate peg. A comprehensive and sustained fiscal correction will
be a critical cornerstone of any adjustment strategy, but will need to be supported by tight
monetary policies and structural measures to enhance the long-term competitiveness of the
economy.
30.
The fiscal adjustment will need to rest on both wide-ranging tax revenue
measures and substantial expenditure restraint, including a freeze of current
expenditure. Although the authorities’ intention to contain the FY 2004/05 deficit below
3 percent of GDP is welcome, the measures envisaged leave this target subject to
considerable risk. A more stringent fiscal effort seems necessary, which could include a
nominal freeze in central government current expenditure, a comprehensive tax revenue
effort aimed at widening the tax base and reducing excessive exemptions, a curtailment of
budget-financed projects, and improvements in budget monitoring and control. Especially in
view of past budget overruns, the authorities will also need to stand ready to introduce
additional corrective measures to bring fiscal performance back on track, if necessary. The
staff also urges the authorities to design and implement a debt strategy.
31.
The staff welcomes the authorities’ decision to restructure the DFC. However,
there remains an urgent need to control lending and investment operations of the DFC in
advance of the completion of the restructuring and disposition of its assets in order to reduce
the risk of further misallocation of resources. The staff welcomes the authorities’ recent
decision to subject the DFC to the prudential regulations applicable to commercial banks and
to banking supervision.
32.
The staff welcomes the authorities’ decision to tighten monetary policy. This is
essential to support the exchange rate peg, including by discouraging deposit flight, and
would also help strengthen the banking sector by reversing the recent increase in the system’s
loan to deposit ratio. The authorities’ decision to eliminate mortgages as approved liquid
assets will assist the move toward a system of unified reserve requirements.
33.
The authorities need to strengthen their capacity to oversee financial institutions
and bolster the independence of the bank supervisory authority. In this regard, the staff
welcomes the authorities’ recent efforts to improve banking supervision and the decision to
study possible improvements in the legal framework for supervision of non-bank financial
institutions.

- 21 -

34.
Existing import restrictions should be eliminated or converted into tariffs to
improve resource allocation, increase revenue, and reduce administrative costs. In
addition, Belize benefits significantly from preferential trade access for sugar and banana
exports, and will need continued efforts to improve competitiveness or substitute crops in
order to cope with the eventual loss of these preferences.
35.
A modification of the foreign exchange regulations would increase the
transparency and efficiency of the exchange regime. Combined with an adjustment in
demand policies to prevent an accelerating loss of confidence and to validate the peg, there is
a need to modify the regulations concerning the foreign exchange houses to increase the
transparency of the private foreign exchange market and to create incentives to incorporate
transactions from the parallel market, with the eventual goal of integrating the foreign
exchange markets.
36.
Belize maintains an exchange restriction and multiple currency practices, which
are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII. As the authorities have not agreed to a
timetable for their removal, the staff does not recommend their approval.
37.
Belize statistical information is inadequate to monitor macroeconomic
developments sufficiently. While the staff notes the authorities’ continued efforts to
improve the statistical base, the development of a set of high frequency indicators to monitor
developments on a timely basis is a critical need.
38.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Since 1976, the Belize dollar has been pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at
the rate of BZ$2 per U.S. dollar. Since the second quarter of 1995, the central bank has been
resorting to the rationing of its sales of foreign exchange to commercial banks on an ad-hoc
basis, except for some essential import items, which has given rise to restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. The existence of a
parallel exchange market that trades at rates that differ by more than 2 percent from the
official rate and foreign exchange houses that can trade at rates that differ by more than
2 percent from the official rate give rise to multiple currency practices.

I. Projects
A five year Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was completed for Belize in August 2000
(Report No. 20708-BEL), which identified only modest project assistance. The Bank
currently has two active projects in Belize: one loan with net commitments of approximately
US$13 million, and a Community-Managed Sarastoon-Temash Conservation Project for
$0.8 million financed with grant funds from the Global Environmental Facility.
The loan finances a Roads and Municipal Drainage Project designed to rehabilitate or
construct drainage infrastructure in six municipalities to reduce flooding caused by
hurricanes, provide institutional strengthening of services to relevant Ministries, and support
the formation of a Transport and Road Safety Strategy.

III. Economic and Sector Work
The new 2004–08 IDB-Country Strategy with Belize (expected approval: first trimester
2004), aims at assisting Belize in its transition towards private sector-led growth and
development. Accordingly, the Bank’s strategy will focus on one major objective: “support
private sector-led growth” by financing interventions oriented to (i) improving the public
sector’s institutional capacity to foster an enabling environment for private sector
development; (ii) supporting private sector capacity-building and specific initiatives.
Sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction are considered the overarching goals of
the strategy.
From 1998 to 2003, the Bank approved seven operations in Belize: Rehabilitation of the
Southern Highway (1998); Modernization of Agriculture Health Services and Hurricane
Reconstruction and Emergency Preparedness (1999), Tourism Development, Health Sector
Reform and Hurricane Keith Emergency Reconstruction (2000); and Land Administration II
(2001). There were no loan approvals during 2002–03. However, the Bank has been very
active through technical cooperation projects from the Multilateral Investment Fund, which
approved five (5) operations for a total of US$3.5 million during the same time period.

The CDB Country Strategy Paper (CSP) on Belize was presented to the Board in May 2000.
The strategy covered the period 2000 to 2002 and proposed an allocation of US$39.5 million
to projects in tourism development, bridge construction/rehabilitation, human resource
development, and health sector reform. It also included a line of Credit to the DFC and about
US$0.4 million in technical assistance. The TA activities include a study on service exports
expansion, family health survey, land use plan for northern Belize, restructuring of the public
enterprise sector, a study on health sector institutional restructuring and a review of education
sector financing. In 2003, a loan for the Social Investment Fund and a loan for the funding of
the Caribbean Court of Justice were also approved, which are both additional to resources
that had been allocated under the CSP.

APPENDIX V

BELIZE: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1. Outstanding statistical issues
In general, the quality, coverage, and timeliness of Belize’s statistical information do not
permit an adequate monitoring of economic developments. There are shortcomings in
national accounts, prices, external trade and debt, government finance, and labor statistics.
The authorities have indicated that they would be interested in receiving technical assistance
in all these areas. The Central Bank of Belize publishes, in irregular intervals, a quarterly
bulletin covering developments in the real, fiscal, monetary, and external sectors, as well as
an annual report and a statistical digest.
2. External debt
There are discrepancies between the data reported by the central bank and those reported by
the ministry of finance, particularly with respect to gross external disbursements of the
central government. In addition, the data reported by the central bank and the ministry of
finance on the external debt of the public enterprises are incomplete and inconsistent with the
information provided by the public enterprises. The authorities are seeking to reduce the
discrepancies and inconsistencies by fostering greater cooperation among the agencies
involved.
3. Balance of payments
The compilation of Belize’s balance of payments is based on the fifth edition of the Balance
of Payments Manual (BPM5). Belize has recently completed the transition to the BPM5. In
addition, the authorities are refining the process for collecting relevant data that will enable
the presentation of quarterly balance of payments statistics. As for the coverage, currentness
and reporting of data for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS) and in the
Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY), Belize has reported annual data on
balance of payments statistics albeit with some lags. An STA mission visited Belize in April
2001 to provide assistance on balance of payments data issues.
4. Real sector
A new national accounts system has been phased-in. Under the new system, national
accounts are produced quarterly, instead of annually. The base year for the compilation of
national accounts will move from 1984 to 2000, with consequent quality improvement of
estimates at constant prices. The CPI market basket is based on a household expenditure
survey conducted from June 1990 through March 1991 and needs to be updated, as does the
reference base which currently is November 1990. Also, the CPI is calculated only four times
a year (February, May, August, and November), with a lag of about three months. Labor
market statistics are scant and available at irregular intervals.

- 38 -

APPENDIX V

5. Fiscal accounts
Classification of expenditure into current and capital does not conform to international
standards. The resumptions of reporting annual data for the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook and sub-annual data for the International Financial statistics are highly
recommended. The most recently reported annual data were for 1997.
6. Development Finance Corporation
The accounts of the DFC, which is a major instrument of the government’s economic policy,
are not well integrated into monetary or fiscal accounts.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
March 24, 2004
This note provides additional information on recent developments in Belize since the
issuance of the staff report. The statement does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
•

The authorities have recently introduced additional tax measures. Parliament
approved a package of revenue enhancements in February, including a 1 percentage
point increase in the general sales tax. The staff estimates that the measures will yield
just under 1 percent of GDP more during FY 2004/05 than the measures envisaged in
the budget. While providing a welcome step toward achieving the authorities’ deficit
objective, further measures may still be required given the underlying lack of
buoyancy of the tax regime and the risk of expenditure slippage.

•

The government recently nationalized the largest phone company. This company
had been privatized three years ago, and the government’s action was in response to
the company’s inability to resolve a dispute with a competing operator regarding
interconnection fees. The authorities have indicated their intention to reprivatize the
company once the interconnection issue is settled.

•

The financial position of the Development Finance Corporation appears to have
weakened further. Following last week’s bankruptcy of one of the DFC’s largest
borrowers—which accounted for 9 percent of the DFC’s outstanding loans as of end2003—the DFC’s nonperforming loan ratio is estimated to have increased to
32 percent.

•

As discussed in the staff report, the Central Bank of Belize (CBB) has moved to
tighten monetary policy. On March 26, 2004 the Board of the CBB will consider an
increase to the cash reserve requirement from 6 percent to 7 percent, to be effective
May 1, 2004. In addition, mortgages will be eliminated from the list of approved
liquid assets, effective April 1, 2004.

Statement by Mr. Charles X. O’Loghlin, Executive Director for Belize
March 24, 2004
At core, the Staff Report accords with my authorities’ assessments and intentions …
1. The forward-looking, wide-ranging, and frank nature of the Article IV discussions in
Belize last December was much appreciated by my authorities. They wish to
acknowledge that the broad thrust of its analysis and recommendations accords with their
own assessment and policy intent – even if they would not subscribe to each and every
sentiment in the resulting Staff Report. Hence, as the staff suggest in the Report and
confirm in their supplemental Statement, my authorities’ recent budget – and monetary
policy action – incorporates substantial steps consistent with those recommendations.
They view the US$ exchange peg as critical, and are committed to its maintenance …
2. My authorities are absolutely committed to preserving the exchange peg to the US dollar,
in view of the importance of stability to economic progress – especially in an economy
as open as that of Belize. They are keenly aware of the potential implications for the peg
of any continuation of the substantial public deficits – largely prompted by growing
investment - and of the increasing indebtedness of recent years.
3. To this end, my authorities are targeting a reduction in the overall fiscal deficit of some 5
percent of GDP in the 2004/05 (April-March) fiscal year. As indicated later, their recent
budget incorporates a significant slowdown in hitherto-high public investment, and
substantial tax measures. My authorities are absolutely committed to achieving this
target, and stand ready to take further measures should that prove necessary. They have
also tightened monetary policy, in line with the staff recommendations, in support.
High deficits and borrowing fell less than foreshadowed to the Board in late 2002 …
4. The Belize government acknowledges that, in the event, through 2002/03 and 2003/04
the fiscal deficit was scaled back less than foreshadowed at the time of the last Board
discussion. The larger deficits primarily reflected stronger public investment (to
complete the developmental program begun in 1999) and shortfalls in expected revenue
receipts – in part as a result of growth-oriented tax policy measures, but also some
underperformance against budgeted yields.
5. It is critically important, however, to assess those developments in a broad perspective.
My authorities would particularly note that the high public investment of recent years has
restored business-oriented infrastructure seriously damaged by hurricanes in 2000/01,
strengthened the country’s economic infrastructure more generally and – with tax policy
developments – has promoted enterprise, in addition to enhancing social capital.

-2-

But if debt rose, growth potential was clearly expanded …
6. The capacity of Belize for economic progress, as evident from the Staff Report, has been
greatly strengthened by the policies of recent years:
• Real GDP was 40 percent higher last year – when Belize became a billion-US$
economy – than in 1998;
• Although output had not fully recovered from recent adversities (mainly, hurricane
damage), visible exports reached US$345m last year, up from US$195m in 1998;
• Private investment into and in Belize has continued apace; and
• Imports related to this and other investment – natural in a country without an
advanced manufacturing sector – were a significant contributor to the declining, but
admittedly still substantial, deficit on the current account of the balance of payments.
7. Unsurprisingly, then, my authorities continued to enjoy the confidence of international
private lenders through 2003 (gross loan disbursements exceeded US$173m), albeit at a
significant premium over comparable US Treasuries.
8. The social element of that public investment, of course, has also been invaluable. It has
helped to underpin socio-political stability in a region which, unfortunately, has seen far
too much unrest. This is a key strength which helps to explain why, notwithstanding an
estimated 1¼ percent of GDP fiscal tightening in the budget year ending on March 31,
Belize’s economic growth in 2003 could exceed 5 percent. Growth was assisted by a
further recovery of output from the adverse impact on agriculture of natural disasters and
on tourism of 9/11 – as well as by the easing US$/Euro parity. But the staff prognosis
for 2004, economic growth of 3½ percent despite the intended five percentage points of
GDP fiscal tightening, affirms my authorities’ view of Belize as an economy with
potential – in substantial measure the product of recent heavy public investment.
My authorities’ growth expectations for 2004 are close to those of the staff …
9. That estimate is close to my authorities’ assessment of 4 percent in the recent budget.
The difference reflects slightly divergent views about the impact of recent and planned
business investment. Like the staff, my authorities are confident that further expansion
in tourism, and fish-farming production in particular (with recent investment coming
fully on stream), will deliver further strong export growth in 2004. The hurricane-hit
citrus industry should complete its recovery, barring the unexpected. The sugar industry
is negotiating linkage to the national power grid, and should expand biomass electricity
generation beyond its own power needs this year – helping respond to the unwinding of
sugar trade preferences and coincidentally reducing fuel import dependence.
With determined fiscal action supporting confidence …
10. Since the Article IV discussions, my authorities have adopted their 2004/05 budget. It
targets a reduction of some 5 percentage points in the fiscal deficit, to below 3 percent of
GDP. Three key elements contribute:

-3-

•
•

•

The major infrastructure effort to date allows reduced public investment this year.
Central government investment is budgeted at 1½ percent of GDP less than last year
(although remaining about twice that of developed countries generally);
It also allows my authorities to restore the Development Finance Corporation [DFC]
to its traditional, primarily (small) enterprise support, role, for a similar saving. This
year, net DFC outlays will be just ½ percent of GDP, to be fully financed by normal
cash-flow and new (concessional) multi-lateral loans – instead of budget lending; and
New tax measures – again focused on assets and consumption rather than enterprise
and effort – are anticipated to yield in excess of 1½ percent of GDP.

11. Monthly monitoring has been put in place to ensure control of expenditure to budget.
The staff feel that revenue may fall significantly short of target – notably on foot of
concern about yield from a land tax “in the absence of a collection agency or a functional
database of taxpayers”. My authorities agree that past land tax revenue collections have
disappointed. However, they would note three recent key, relevant, policy steps. Early
this year, oversight of collection was transferred to the Minister for Finance from the
Department of the Environment. A new collector has been employed. Large landholders
have already been invoiced for this tax, just weeks after it came into law. Nonetheless,
my authorities emphasize that they stand ready, if a revenue shortfall appears threatened,
to implement further revenue and/or expenditure measures to fully compensate. They are
committed to carrying through the announced fiscal adjustment without fail.
An asset-disposal program amplifying the positive impact on debt …
12. My authorities also plan to ease the debt ratio directly. A part-disposal of DFC assets
was foreshadowed at the last Board discussion. It is now well-advanced. Initial offers
have been received. They are still being evaluated, but my authorities are pointing to a
yield of a few percentage points of GDP. They wish to assure the Board of their absolute
intent to apply all such divestment proceeds to paying down existing debt.
13. On this basis, taking the prospective fiscal deficit into account, a downward trend in the
debt-burden should be firmly established in 2004.
And supportive monetary policy, in line with the staff recommendations …
14. Fiscal action will be supported by monetary policy, as noted in the Staff Statement:
• From April 1, new residential construction loans will not count as part of banks’
liquid assets. There will be a neutralizing reduction in the liquid asset requirement.
• And the Board of the Central Bank will consider, on March 26, a proposal to raise
the cash reserve requirement from 6 percent to 7 percent, effective May 1, 2004.
15. My authorities welcome the assessments (noted in the accompanying Selected Issues
paper) that “the [domestic] banking system appears sound and profitable”, “financial
soundness indicators for international banks also appear solid” and “domestic insurance
supervision deals adequately with the products offered in Belize”. Nonetheless, they

-4-

acknowledge the scope to further improve supervision. As suggested by the staff during
the Article IV discussions, the DFC has been subjected to Central Bank supervisory
oversight since January. And a technical expert is preparing recommendations, for
delivery by end-April, for the coordination of supervision of Belize’s financial system
(including credit unions, insurance companies and other non-bank institutions).
16. The Central Bank has sought the extension of its legal remit to allow it to publish
financial statements of international banks – which it is not currently empowered to do.
My authorities are actively considering this proposal. The Central Bank is seeking the
agreement of those banks to voluntary disclosure in the meantime, and is increasingly
confident that this will be forthcoming.
Excepting their advice concerning “cambios” – licensed exchange bureaux …
17. My authorities understand the staffs’ desire for steps to be taken which would promise to
unify the foreign exchange market. At this juncture, however, they are not disposed to
implement the suggestion to widen the allowable band in the cambios. Their preference,
and aim, is to so adapt macroeconomic policies as to diminish, and in time to eliminate,
incentive to/need for parallel market transactions. They view the two-stage process
envisaged by the staff as carrying unacceptable risks to the exchange peg by cementing,
for however short a time, “acceptability” of wider “official” spreads than now obtain.
18. Meanwhile, existing legislation is being revisited with a view to tightening control over
the reporting and supervision of cambios, to provide better monitoring of their impact on
the financial system.
While advances in producing key economic and budget data ...
19. Efforts to improve the comprehensiveness, quality and timeliness of economic and
budgetary statistics will continue – adding to recent advances on statistics for monitoring
purposes. Quarterly balance of payments data are available since 2002. Development of
quarterly national accounts is underway. Although these have not reached publication
stage, preliminary results have been provided to Fund staff since 2003. Monthly central
government budget data are now reported to Fund staff within 2-3 weeks of each endmonth, and arrangements are in place for related financing data to follow shortly after.
Enhance the basis for my authorities to monitor implementation of their resolve ...
20. In sum, the staff analysis and recommendations accord with my authorities’ assessments
and intentions. The exchange peg is crucial to retaining the confidence which recent
policies have engendered in Belizean growth potential, exemplified by average annual
economic growth of 7 percent over the past five years. The actions necessary to sustain
the peg are in train. My authorities are adamant that they will be implemented in full.

IMF Concludes 2003 Article IV Consultation with Belize
On March 24, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Belize.1
Background
Since taking office in 1998, the current government embarked on a program to accelerate
economic growth. The measures adopted included tax cuts, a sharp increase in government
investment, and subsidized credit to the private sector through the state-owned Development
Finance Corporation (DFC). The exchange rate has been pegged at BZ$2 per US$1 since
1976, and the authorities consider its maintenance a primary policy objective.
Real GDP growth increased to 12 percent in 2000, but slowed to 4-5 percent thereafter as a
result of the effects of several hurricanes, the tourism slump that followed the terrorist attacks
in the United States, and a shrimp virus epidemic. However, there has been a loss in
confidence as the fiscal and external current account deficits remained at unsustainable levels.
The central government deficit remained at levels of around 9 percent of GDP since
FY 2000/01 (fiscal year begins April) and is projected to decrease only slightly in FY 2003/04.
Sharply increased interest payments, continued support for the de facto insolvent DFC, and a
lack of buoyancy of the tax regime are straining the public finances, making it more difficult to
reduce the deficit despite a severe compression of investment expenditure. Net international
reserves fell by about a third during 2003, while public and publicly guaranteed debt has

Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country’s authorities.

-2reached 92 percent of GDP, contracted mostly as external debt on commercial terms.
The large and continued fiscal imbalance and the accommodative monetary policy are
threatening the sustainability of the exchange rate peg.
There is an urgent need to put in place comprehensive fiscal adjustment measures and tighten
monetary policy to prevent a balance of payments crisis, return Belize to a sustainable policy
path, and enable the country to regain a margin of resilience to exogenous shocks.
The authorities agree that the central government deficit should be reduced to below 3 percent
of GDP in FY 2004/05. Nonetheless, to achieve this target, there is a need implement a
comprehensive tax reform to restore buoyancy to the system, freeze current expenditure, and
reduce budget-financed capital expenditure further. Combined with a tightening of monetary
policy, this adjustment in demand policies could halt the loss in international reserves in 2004.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed the recovery of Belize’s economy and exports from the recent external
shocks, including hurricanes, in an environment of price stability. However, Directors
expressed concern that Belize’s fiscal and external current account deficits have remained
unsustainably large, putting pressure on international reserves and generating high and rapidly
growing levels of public and publicly guaranteed indebtedness. The serious economic
imbalances have also contributed to increasing costs in accessing international capital
markets.
Directors agreed that, to re-establish a viable economic and financial position and help ensure
the sustainability of the exchange rate peg, Belize will need to embark urgently on a
comprehensive and sustained fiscal correction, to be supported by tight monetary policies and
structural measures aimed at enhancing the long-term competitiveness of the economy.
They were encouraged by the authorities’ renewed commitment to adopt corrective policy
measures, but stressed that these will need to be implemented vigorously and further
strengthened in the period ahead.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to contain the fiscal year 2004/05 deficit to below
3 percent of GDP, as well as the recent adoption of a package of revenue enhancements.
Against the backdrop of past budget overruns, Directors nevertheless considered that
additional measures—beyond those currently envisaged—will most likely be needed to
achieve the fiscal target as planned. To pave the way for a durable strengthening of the public
finances, Directors urged the authorities to curtail nonpriority central government expenditures,
freeze the wage bill, widen the tax base and reduce excessive and distortionary tax
exemptions. Improvements in budget monitoring and control as well as in the management of
Belize’s public debt should also be given a high priority.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ decision to restructure the Development Finance
Corporation and to subject it to the supervision of the central bank. To contain the burden on
the budget and limit further drain on scarce resources, it will now be important to curtail the

-3lending and investment operations of the DFC in advance of the completion of its restructuring
and partial disposition of its assets.
Directors supported the authorities’ decision to tighten monetary policy and contain credit
growth. A firm monetary stance will be helpful in the short run to reduce pressures on the
exchange rate. It will be essential in the longer run, along with a strong fiscal adjustment, to
protect the balance of payments and support Belize’s exchange rate peg, which the authorities
rightly continue to view as a critical anchor for confidence and stability.
Directors urged the authorities to take steps to increase the transparency and efficiency of the
foreign exchange regime, in particular by adopting clearer rules for foreign exchange
transactions by the central bank and the foreign exchange houses. They noted that progress in
this area will help improve the efficiency of the foreign exchange system, and support the
eventual unification of the exchange markets.
Directors encouraged the authorities to strengthen the oversight capacity and independence of
the bank supervisory authority. In this regard, they welcomed the ongoing efforts to improve
banking supervision and the decision to consider improvements in the legal framework for
supervision of non-bank financial institutions. They also welcomed the authorities’ efforts to
combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and the authorities’ decision to
include a collective action clause in their last bond.
Directors urged the authorities to continue to give consideration to phasing out the existing
import restrictions by converting them into tariffs, which will improve resource allocation,
increase revenues, and reduce administrative costs. In view of the anticipated loss of Belize’s
preferential trade access for sugar and banana exports, Director underscored the importance
of continuing strong efforts to improve competitiveness and diversify the export base.
They welcomed the progress on privatization.
While welcoming recent improvements in Belize’s statistical base, Directors encouraged the
authorities to continue to work—with Fund technical assistance—to improve the quality and
timeliness of data reporting, including by developing a set of high frequency indicators.

Public Information Notices (PINs) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the
conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the
public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member
countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF's assessment of these policies; and (ii) following
policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board. The Staff Report for the 2003
Article IV Consultation with Belize is also available.
