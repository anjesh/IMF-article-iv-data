REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 9, 2011

KEY ISSUES
Estonia has experienced a sharp export-led recovery in its first year in the euro area.
But price pressures have emerged—largely reflecting global food and fuel prices—and
unemployment, while declining, has remained high with increasing long-term
joblessness. In 2012, the economy is set to slowdown in line with weakening export
markets but the output gap will continue to close. With increased downside risks,
Estonia faces the continuing challenge to implement policies preserving
macroeconomic policy credibility, while enhancing sustainable growth.
Fiscal policy: Estonia’s enviable fiscal position will remain strong even though a deficit
of about 2¼ percent of GDP will emerge in 2012. This will imply a fiscal stimulus at a
time when a neutral stance would be appropriate. Adhering to the budgetary
allocations would be appropriate. Should downside risks materialize, automatic
stabilizers should be allowed to operate while preserving credibility. Looking forward,
the authorities’ medium-term target of a small surplus can be supported by a fully
fledged multi-year fiscal framework, which would allow fiscal buffers to be rebuilt.
The financial sector: On balance, risks to the financial sector appear manageable. But
potential contagion from the euro area or parent banks requires continued vigilance.
Further improvements in cross-border supervision and crisis resolution, preparing for
Basel III, and continuing efforts to increase deposit guarantees will be essential. Also,
reforms expediting Estonia’s bankruptcy process are necessary.
Long-run growth: Besides safeguarding Estonia’s competitiveness, increasing
sustainable long-run growth will require moving up the value chain, addressing
long-term unemployment, and enhancing human capital. Fostering a business-friendly
environment by building R&D capability and enhancing cross-border infrastructure can
attract tradable sector FDI. Further improvements in vocational training and higher
education can alleviate long-run unemployment and boost human resources.

CONTEXT
1.
A vibrant recovery has marked
Estonia’s first year in the euro area, albeit
with nascent tensions. A proven track record
of prudent macroeconomic policies—
underpinning successful euro adoption and a
recent credit rating upgrade—has provided a
firm grounding for the strong rebound. Still
coming on the heels of one of the EU’s
deepest economic contractions, the recovery
has exposed underlying difficulties. Price
pressures have emerged (albeit still mainly
imported) and overall unemployment, while
declining, remains high with long-term
joblessness on the rise.
2.
Estonia’s growth has been among
the highest in the EU in 2011. Following a

2¼ percent expansion in 2010, activity has
strengthened considerably with growth
reaching almost 9 percent in the first half of
2011. While it has been predominately export
led—exports now exceed pre-crisis levels
following six quarters of double-digit growth—
final domestic demand has also increased in
recent quarters (Figure 1). Capacity constraints
have begun prompting investment and an
improving labor market has boosted consumer
sentiment until recently and increased
long-suppressed household consumption. The
contribution to growth from inventories has
been erratic, largely reflecting initially
component imports for subsequent exports.

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

3.
Inflation has risen and is the highest
in the euro area. While price increases have
moderated to about 5½ percent in September,
inflation has remained well above the euroarea average since April, 2010. The
disproportionate impact of food and energy
prices explains the bulk of Estonia’s higher
inflation. The HICP-based measure of core
inflation (excluding energy, food, tobacco and
alcohol) has remained low, but other measures
have been higher (Figure 2). Real wages have

continued declining despite nominal wage
increases. The latter, in part, have reflected a
rebound in bonus and profit sharing—
squeezed in the downturn—despite doubledigit unemployment. The unemployment rate
has declined from its peak of almost
20 percent in early-2010 to about 13¼ percent
in the second quarter of 2011. Still, long-term
unemployment has continued rising reflecting
jobs-skills mismatch (Figure 3).

Credit developments have been
driven primarily by demand factors.
Commercial real estate and mortgage
borrowing—almost 60 percent of domestic
credit—has continued to be weighed down by
the legacy of Estonia’s real estate bust, as a
about a quarter of mortgages have loan-tovalue ratios above 100 percent. In addition,
while household debt (as a share of disposable
income) has declined by about 8 percentage
points from its peak, it remains elevated at
about 92 percent. On the supply side, the
banking sector returned to profitability in the
third quarter of 2010, as narrowing interest
rate margins have been offset by lower cost
funding through local deposits. Banks’ usable
liquidity (i.e., liquid assets net of required
reserves) increased substantially in 2011
reflecting the lowering of Estonia’s reserve

requirements to the euro area levels, even as
substantial amounts of liquidity were
repatriated to parent banks—a further
indication of Estonia’s weak credit demand.
Banks have tightened credit standards in the
aftermath of the bubble, but narrower margins
and generally lower interest rates following
euro adoption suggest that supply conditions
have not inhibited credit.1

6.
Estonia’s long-standing
commitment to fiscal prudence has
continued in 2011. The 2011 budget had
envisaged a small general government deficit

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

(about 1.5 percent of GDP), but state budget
data for the first half suggest that another
small surplus is possible in 2011. This has
reflected continuing higher-than-expected
revenues, including from the sale of CO2
emission rights that more than offset the initial
unwinding of previous “one-off” measures
namely, partly restoring pillar II pension
contributions temporarily diverted to the
budget. Estonia’s public debt has remained the
lowest in the EU and its fiscal buffers were
about 11½ percent of GDP at end-June 2011.
7.
In line with competitiveness gains,
the external current account balance was
broadly in balance in the first half of 2011.
The merchandise trade deficit narrowed by
about 1½ percentage points of GDP with

robust export growth more than offsetting a
recovery in imports in the first half of 2011
(Figure 4). Net income outflows have been
robust owing to dividends paid to foreign
investors. Competitiveness has continued to
improve and the real exchange rate is broadly
in line with fundamentals (Box 1). In the first
half of 2011, the financial account recorded a
deficit as banks further reduced liabilities to
foreign parent banks associated with liquidity
freed up by the harmonization of reserve
requirements. As a result, gross external debt
has declined from about 125 percent of GDP
at end-2009 to about 110 percent of GDP at
end-June 2011. The external DSA suggests that
external debt dynamics remain sustainable in
plausible risk scenarios.

OUTLOOK
8.
Following a spike in growth in 2011,
economic activity is set to moderate in
2012. Given the better-than-expected
economic performance in the first half of the
year, growth is set to triple to 7½ percent in
2011. Growth is projected nonetheless to slow
to about 3 percent in 2012. Abstracting from
inventories’ temporarily large contribution to
growth in 2011, a smaller contribution to
growth from net exports—in line with slowing

global markets—is expected to be partially
offset by final domestic demand. Fixed
investment and, to a lesser extent,
consumption are projected to continue
gradually strengthen as the economy nears
capacity and employment continues
expanding. Leaving aside measurement
uncertainties, the output gap will continue
narrowing in 2012.

9.
Inflation is projected to slow in
2012. Price increases are expected to exceed
5 percent in 2011, but should moderate to
about 3¼ percent in 2012 as the impact of
global food and fuel prices shocks dissipate.
Core inflation’s outlook remains uncertain in
part given wage pressures largely from skill
mismatches and increasing capacity utilization.
So far, wages increases have not exceeded
productivity gains nor have real wages risen.
While these trends are likely to broadly
continue as activity moderates, pressures may
remain on core inflation in 2012.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

10.
With continued volatility in global
financial markets, downside risks to the
outlook have risen at end-2011. With
two-thirds of Estonia’s exports going to the
EU, recent European and global developments
have tilted risks to the downside. Besides the
domestic risk that the unwinding past real and
financial sector imbalances be more protracted
and weigh on domestic demand, external risks
prevail. In addition to the aforementioned
global trade developments, a generalized
confidence fallout from the euro area
sovereign debt crisis could spill over to Estonia
through Swedish parent banks. The Swedish
banks and authorities appear well-prepared to
deal with liquidity pressures, but Swedish

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

banks rely heavily on short-term wholesale
market funding. In an extreme tail-risk event
engulfing core EU, Estonia could however face
financial distress despite its strong
fundamentals.
11.
The authorities broadly concurred
with the outlook. While official projections
had not yet been revised, the authorities
agreed that growth would slow in 2012. They
noted that, in contrast to the previous
downturn, domestic and external imbalances
have been greatly reduced. Regarding
inflation, they noted that recent increases have
been predominately driven by food price
increases, partly reflecting limited retail

competition and would keep core inflation
developments under close review. They
confirmed that exporters have been
increasingly facing difficulties in filling
vacancies due to a lack of skilled labor.
Moreover, the shift of labor toward the
tradable sector has been slowed by
employment opportunities for construction
workers in nearby Nordic economies. Both
developments were thought to contribute to
recent increases in wages. Regarding the
financial sector, the authorities agreed that,
given the extensive real estate adjustment and
rebound in employment, external risks
outweigh domestic risks.

POLICY CHALLENGES
12.
Estonia must stand ready to address
short-term risks, while medium-term
polices should focus on sustainable growth
and increased employment. The authorities’
policies have been in line with Fund advice
(Box 2) and, going forward, uninterrupted

income convergence to EU levels will require
continued focus on three key areas.

Box 2. Implications of Fund Advice
Relations between Estonia and the Fund have remained excellent. Policies have been characterized by a high
degree of ownership—a key factor in Estonia’s economic success—and these have been generally consistent
with Executive Board recommendations. But large increases in current spending resulted in an ill-timed
loosening of the fiscal stance in the boom years. Since then, corrective actions, including expenditure
reversals and increased indirect taxation, have been in line with Fund advice. Most of the key
recommendations of the 2009 FSSA update have been adopted, including a domestic bank resolution
framework to facilitate rapid bank restructuring. Also, the authorities have been discussing enhancements to
their medium-term framework to further entrench their strong fiscal position.

A. Enhancing Estonia's Fiscal Framework
13.
Estonia’s fiscal position will likely
remain strong. The authorities target small
budgetary surpluses starting in 2013. These

would be used, when feasible, to reverse crisisrelated increases in unemployment
contribution rates, cut the personal income tax

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA

rate, cap the amount of incomes subject to the
social tax excluding health insurance and
rebuild fiscal buffers (Figures 6 and 7).
14.
Nonetheless, the 2012 budget will
entail a deterioration in the fiscal balance.
In contrast to a small surplus in 2011, the 2012
budget before Parliament shows a deficit that
staff estimates to be about 2¼ percent of GDP.
The deterioration reflects a decline in revenues
associated with the fall of CO2-emission permit
receipts (equivalent to 1 percent of GDP) and
pension pillar II contributions previously

diverted to the budget (½ percent of GDP).
The budget also shows a limited increase in
expenditures, notably a 4.4 percent increase in
basic pensions (about ¼ percent of GDP) and
increases in public investment (roughly
1 percent of GDP) tied to obligations from
previous sales of CO2 permits. It also foresees
an unchanged public sector operating
expenditures (including the wage bill) and
does not include revenue measures with the
exception of small increases in excise taxes on
tobacco and alcohol.

15.
In the central scenario, efforts will
be needed to limit the budget’s stimulative
impact, albeit uncertainties abound. The
budget implies a positive fiscal impulse, largely
from CO2-related investments as there is no
expansionary impact from the lost revenue
related to restoring pillar II contributions. With
the output gap continuing to close in the
central scenario, fiscal stimulus is not needed
and a neutral stance would be appropriate.
With further compression of current
expenditure unrealistic, adherence to
budgetary allocations will help in this regard.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Consideration could be given to under
executing the budget using existing margins.
Should revenue windfalls emerge, these should
be saved consistent with the authorities’ longstanding fiscal restraint. But if downside risks
materialize automatic stabilizers should be
allowed to operate while maintaining
credibility, which can require adhering to the
Stability and Growth Pact.
16.
Estonia’s fiscal buffers provide a
comparative strength, but volatile global
markets call for caution. Estonia’s liquid fiscal
reserves could be used to finance the fiscal

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

deficit. But in the context of heightened
financial market uncertainty, this would leave
Estonia with potentially fewer and more
expensive options should the global shock
persist or tail risks materialize. In this
connection, alternative sources of financing
should be considered, possibly including credit
lines with liquid domestic commercial banks
and European Investment Bank resources as
were previously tapped.
17.
Looking forward, the authorities’
medium-term target (a small surplus) can
safeguard Estonia’s fiscal position but
achieving it will require unwavering
expenditure restraint. The authorities have
maintained strict expenditure control, but
spending pressures will intensify as income
convergence to EU levels proceeds.
Specifically, the public sector wage freeze—
instituted following nominal wage cuts—and
the deep cuts in operational spending to meet
the Maastricht criteria will likely be tested.
Also, medium-term pressures have emerged
for the cohort of pensioners that remain in the
pre-reform system, as well as from increases in
disability pensions. The time-bound nature of
CO2 permit-related investment can help limit
spending increases. Still, to achieve the fiscal
target without raising taxes, staff estimates
that expenditures on nonwage goods and
services would need to decline by at least
2 percentage points of GDP during 2011–15. In
this connection, the pace of consolidation
should be mindful of long-term investment
needs and cyclical developments.
18.
Establishing a fully fledged multiyear fiscal framework can further enhance
credibility by supporting the medium-term
target and limiting pro-cyclical policies. An
array of frameworks has been considered in

the European context. The successful
implementation and operation of such a frame
in Estonia will require that it reflect its tradition
of simplicity and transparency, which have
facilitated monitoring and accountability
(Annex I). Its central element would be multiyear expenditure ceilings. These ceilings could
be announced, for instance, when a new
government takes office, as in Finland, or on a
rolling basis, as in Sweden. These would be set
to be consistent with the medium-term fiscal
target and macroeconomic prospects.
Automatic stabilizers should be allowed to
operate in the face of moderate economic
cycles. The framework could be established
possibly as a reform of the State Budget Act
and be mindful of evolving EU obligations,
including the forthcoming legislation on
economic governance.
19.
Fiscal buffers should continue to be
an integral part of Estonia’s fiscal
framework. Estonia thus faces the question of
how large these should be and how quickly to
rebuild them. During the downturn, fiscal
buffers allowed the authorities to minimize the
needed extent for contractionary pro-cyclical
fiscal policy without relying on financial
markets (Annex II). Buffers should in principle
be commensurate with the volatility and risks.
Estonia’s recent output and fiscal revenue
volatilities suggest that higher buffers would
be justified. But judging by Estonia’s low
financing needs, the opposite would be true.
Regardless, liquid assets entail costs as well as
benefits. A speedy accumulation of buffers
could run the risk of weakening domestic
demand and lowering long-run growth. On
balance, given increased global uncertainty
gradually rebuilding buffers to their pre-crisis
level would be appropriate.

20.
The authorities stressed that the
2012 budget addresses the dual goals of
maintaining Estonia’s favorable economic
environment and increasing stability.
CO2 emission-related investments would help
address the risks from an uncertain global
environment, as would increases in basic
pensions exceeding the indexation rule. On the
other hand, the freezing of state operating
expenditures would accelerate structural
reforms and further improve the state’s
efficiency. Under their risk scenario (growth of
1 percent), the deficit was projected to
increase to 2.9 percent and automatic
stabilizers would be allowed to operate. The
authorities noted that they would consider
expenditure and revenue measures as needed
should the slowdown be larger or more
protracted. As to its financing, the authorities
intended to largely rely on the still-sizable
fiscal buffers but did not rule out alternate
options.

21.
In the medium term, the authorities
underscored that a small surplus was
needed to maintain stability and support
broader economic and social objectives. In
the central scenario, they would target a small
surplus in 2013 when the EU obligations of
CO2–related investments would expire. Future
growth-supporting cuts in labor taxation
(including unemployment insurance
contributions and capping the base for the
social tax) were intended to promote
employment, while tight expenditure controls
would allow for a gradual rebuilding of fiscal
buffers. While discussions remained in an early
stage, the authorities saw merits in enhancing
their fiscal framework to accommodate more
formally a multi-year framework, by perhaps
amending the “organic” State Budget Act. The
merits of expenditure ceilings were
acknowledged, with some preference
expressed toward rolling ceilings as in the
State Budget Strategy. A monitoring role was
envisaged for the State Auditing Office in
verifying compliance with such a framework.

B. Locking-in Financial Sector Resilience
22.
The mostly Nordic-owned banking
system has weathered the global financial
crisis. Non-performing loans (NPLs, loans at
least 60 days past due) rose steadily in the
aftermath of the Estonian housing market bust,
hastened also in the aftermath of the Lehman
Brothers collapse (Figure 8). Still, provisioning
against loan losses has kept pace with the
deterioration of asset quality. NPLs have
started declining recently, mainly due to
write-downs and, to a lesser extent, from a
strengthening economy. Moreover, Estonian
banks’ average capital adequacy ratios have
continued to exceed international norms

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

(including the EC’s decisions in mid-October
and future Basel III capital requirements).2
Also, banking sector profits turned positive in
the second quarter of 2010, following losses in
six consecutive quarters, but these remain
below their pre-crisis levels.

2

The declines in the second and third quarters of 2011
are associated with the restructuring of the Swedbank
ownership structure mentioned in footnote 1.

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

that have proven to be a stable financing
source. Still, these parent banks have
remained largely reliant on short-term
wholesale funding3 and are exposed to a
booming Swedish housing market as well
as indirectly to the euro area periphery
through assets in other euro area
economies.

Even though asset quality has
improved, risks remain and continued
vigilance will be needed. Specifically,


Domestic risks. The bulk of household
debt comprises floating-rate eurodenominated mortgage loans with rates
based on the six-month euribor. Given
euro adoption, these loans do not face
exchange rate risk but still face interest
rate risk. Furthermore, with about a
quarter of mortgages in negative equity,
organic improvement in the health of
banks’ assets with individuals depends
primarily on house price increases.



External risks. Estonian banks have
continued to rely on foreign funding,
currently about 30 percent of total
liabilities. The bulk of this financing
consists of Swedish parent-bank deposits

24.
On balance, financial sector risks
appear manageable. A number of mitigating
factors are at play. Specifically,


Domestically, Estonian banks’ comfortable
prudential ratios provide a risk-weighted
assets buffer of almost 9 percentage
points before breaching the current Basel
tier 1 capital ratio minimum (4.5 percent).
Furthermore, banks now have access to
the ECB’s liquidity facilities providing a
solid liquidity backstop. Market indicators
suggest broadly stable borrowing costs.
Specifically, average interest rates have
not yet trended up and eonia forward
interest rate swaps through four years do
not point to higher interest rates. In



Externally, Swedish parent banks are well
capitalized and their liquidity
management and capital buffers have
improved. Recent Fund staff assessment
of Sweden’s financial sector indicated that
risks were contained, reflecting only a
limited potential of external contagion via
financial channels to Estonian banks.4
Moreover, Fund staff estimates that a
40 percent drop in Swedish housing
prices—compared to an estimated
overvaluation up to 25 percent—would
be required to reduce banks’ collateral
below the face value of outstanding
covered bonds. In addition, foreign
parents view their Estonian investments as
strategically important as a significant
source of profits, and thus are less likely
to be significantly withdrawn. Finally,
Estonia is not directly exposed to the euro
area periphery and its indirect exposure
through parent banks is small, about
0.5 percent and 3.5 percent respectively
of total Swedish and Danish banking
sector assets, with the latter mostly
consisting of exposure to Ireland.

25.
The European Banking Authority’s
(EBA’s) and Eesti Pank’s stress tests support
this assessment. Under the EBA’s adverse
scenario, Swedish banks’ average tier I capital
ratio would be 9.5 percent in 2012. Danish and
Finnish banks have even higher tier I ratios in
2012 under the adverse scenario. Also, The
Eesti Pank’s stress test from early-2011 shows
that NPLs would increase but that capital ratios
would remain adequate.5 Similarly, a more
recent exercise by Eesti Pank and Estonia’s
Financial Supervision Authority (FSA)
recreating the 2008 shock, suggests that
capital would remain above statutory
minimums. These tests do not reflect, however,
the impact of a sharp deterioration in investor
confidence nor cross-border contagion in an
extreme tail event.
26.
Going forward, safeguarding
financial stability will require continued
efforts in an increasingly challenging global
financial environment. In this regard, the
authorities should pursue:

Further Improving cross-border
supervision. While the 2010 Nordic-Baltic
Memorandum of Understanding is
non-binding, it provides a framework for
regional prudential information sharing
and crisis resolution. Continued progress
to implement its key elements, including
defining criteria for burden sharing and
establishing a shared financial database,
will be needed to ensure its effectiveness.
In addition, the authorities, in cooperation
with other supervisors, should consider
conducting joint cross-border stress tests,

Continuing preparations for Basel III. Early
institutional adoption of Basel III
requirements, particularly regarding the
liquidity framework and higher quality
capital, should continue and would
reduce funding risks and avoid possible
credit supply interruptions in times of
heightened stress. But this should be
balanced against the potential costs of
reducing banks’ margins and creating
headwinds for the credit recovery. In this
regard, understanding the anticipated
impact of Basel III on prudential ratios will
be needed to ensure that forward-looking
capital buffers serve to reassure markets.
Coordination with home supervisors will
be essential as will be consistency with
forthcoming EU directives.

These efforts can also be supported
by further improvements in Estonia’s
bankruptcy law and restructuring
framework. The Estonian Supreme Court’s
May 2011 decision on the Reorganization Act
for corporations provided a number of
clarifications to enhance its effectiveness.7
Also, the FSA has been provided the authority
to expeditiously resolve problem banks
through nationalization since early 2011.
However, the authority for bank resolution
through a flexible asset separation tool—
before and after nationalization—and
framework for cross border resolution could
be considered. The bankruptcy regime could
be further strengthened to, inter alia, speed up
the process. Finally, reforms are needed to
facilitate out-of-court debt restructuring and a
pre-packed, expedited bankruptcy process
could further reduce costs.

commitment to continue bolstering
financial stability. They stressed the

implementing the Baltic-Nordic MOU. The

authorities noted that progress in this regard
also depends on their regional partners and, in
this connection, pointed to the forthcoming
December high-level meeting of the BalticNordic Financial Stability Group. They noted
that capital and liquidity buffers above Basel III
thresholds would support financial stability,
and welcomed banks increased funding
through local deposits. The authorities agreed
that additional tools for bank resolution—

notably asset separation and cross-border
coordination—were needed and planned, but
would this require progress at the EU level and
coordination with regional partners. Regarding
the bankruptcy process, they noted ongoing
the work to identify bottlenecks and, while
reform efforts were in their early stages, they
hoped to address this by 2013.

C. Tapping Estonia's Sustainable Growth Potential
29.
Besides safeguarding
competitiveness gains, bolstering
sustainable growth will entail enhancing
Estonia’s attractiveness for FDI. In addition
to the ongoing rebalancing the economy
toward the tradable sector, Estonia will need to
move up the export value chain. In this regard,
the authorities’ recently approved “Estonia
2020 Competitiveness Strategy” provides a
welcome roadmap. Specifically, it targets

further improving the business environment to
attract FDI with export potential. This will be
achieved by building R&D capability,
improving education in technical fields, and
enhancing infrastructure with continued use of
EU funds. Doing so has become increasingly
pressing as Estonia’s high trade integration
with Nordic countries means it faces growing
competition for Nordic FDI from emerging
markets, particularly in Asia (Annex III).

Fully drawing on Estonia’s resources
and developing their potential will also
require addressing emerging labor market
tensions. While its flexible labor market has
enabled rapid declines in unemployment, the

neighbors have resulted in labor shortages and
increases in manufacturing job vacancies
(Annex IV). In this regard, the authorities’
ongoing efforts to harmonize vocational
education with the needs of the labor market,
increase voucher training programs, and
improve job-matching through a new onestop IT platform are welcome. Looking ahead,

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

continued attention will be required to foster
development of human resources in technical
fields as well as to attract highly-trained
individuals from abroad.
31.
The authorities stressed
commitment to further enhance Estonia’s
business friendly environment and address
emerging labor market tensions. In this
regard, they underscored their commitment to
safeguard competitiveness by increasing
human capital and productivity as elaborated
in the competitive strategy as well as by
lowering labor taxation. The authorities noted
that active labor market policies, including
targeted wage subsidies for problem
populations, have contributed to lower

unemployment. In this regard, they pointed to
the doubling to €2,000 of the ceiling of the
voucher training program for the unemployed.
Also, the Public Employment Services
introduced a new IT platform providing
one-stop services in early 2011, thereby
improving the efficiency of the job-matching
process. Regarding rising long-run
unemployment, the authorities noted that the
success in reducing short-term unemployment
had also contributed to its rise. In addition to
increases in manufacturing job vacancies, they
noted that increases in cross-border
construction jobs had lowered unemployment
but contributed to pressure wages, which may
continue in the medium-term.

STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
Estonia faces an increasingly
challenging environment as it looks to
continue implementing policies preserving
macroeconomic policy credibility and
safeguarding sustainable growth. Following
a strong recovery in its first year in the euro
area, Estonia’s economic activity will likely slow
in 2012. In the central scenario, nonetheless,
Estonia’s economy will continue to approach
its potential. Inflation is poised to slow even
though pressures on core inflation can remain.
Recently, downside risks to the outlook have
increased. In addition to a slowdown in
exports, a generalized confidence fallout from
the euro area sovereign debt crisis could spill
over to Estonia despite its strong
fundamentals.
33.
Estonia’s fiscal position will remain
strong but there will be a need to limit the
stimulative impact of the 2012 budget in
the central scenario, albeit uncertainties
abound. Time-bound increases in public

investment underlie the budget’s positive
impulse, while a neutral budget would be
appropriate. Recognizing that further
significant compression of current
expenditures is unrealistic, observance of
budgetary allocations will be helpful in this
regard. But if downside risks materialize,
automatic stabilizers should be allowed to
operate while maintaining Estonia’s
hard-earned fiscal credibility. In addition, given
the uncertainty regarding the extent and
duration of the global slowdown, fiscal buffers
should be preserved and alternative sources of
financing be considered.
34.
Looking beyond the current
conjuncture, the authorities’ medium-term
target can safeguard Estonia’s strong fiscal
position. This will require continued
expenditure restraint to counter spending
pressures that are likely to emerge. The
authorities’ ongoing efforts to enhance central
government productivity through

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 17

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA

centralization of accounting and personnel
management can help. Still without raising
taxes, achieving the fiscal target on a
sustainable basis, implementing the
authorities’ plan to reduce labor taxation, and
restore fiscal buffers will require reducing
non-wage goods and services by at least
2 percentage points of GDP in the medium
term. The pace of consolidation should be
mindful of long-term investment needs and
cyclical developments.
35.
A fully fledged multi-year fiscal
framework can support the medium-term
target, bolster Estonia’s high fiscal
credibility, and limit pro-cyclical policies. A
successful framework should reflect Estonia’s
fiscal tradition of simplicity and transparency,
which has facilitated monitoring and
accountability. The central element of such a
framework would be multi-year expenditure
ceilings and their strict observance while
revenue collections adjust to cyclical
conditions. In addition, fiscal buffers should
continue to be an integral part of Estonia’s
fiscal framework. While there are benefits as
well as costs of holding liquid assets, gradually
rebuilding buffers appears appropriate given
increased global uncertainty.
36.
For the financial sector, the
challenge entails safeguarding stability in
the context of heightened global financial
tension. Estonian banks have scant direct and
indirect exposure to euro area sovereign debt,
while at the same time capital and liquidity
buffers have increased substantially since 2007.
However, the legacy of the previous crisis
continues to burden balance sheets and
dependence on financing from parent banks
remains high, although both of these factors
are declining. The latter has proven a stable
source of financing, but parent banks in turn

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

rely on short-term wholesale funding. Limiting
potential contagion will thus require continued
improvements in cross-border supervision.
Developing regional crisis resolution tools—in
close cooperation with relevant authorities—
can provide critical backstop to Estonia’s
sizable fiscal and financial buffers. The
scheduled December high-level meeting of
Nordic regulators provides an opportunity to
make progress in this critical area. In addition,
an early and gradual institutional adoption of
Basel III requirements can reduce funding risks
but its implementation should avoiding
creating headwinds for credit conditions.
37.
Financial resilience can also be
supported by further enhancing the
regional and domestic resolution
frameworks for banks and addressing
weaknesses in Estonia’s bankruptcy law. The
recent adoption of a domestic resolution law
provides a welcome tool to minimize the cost
of a bank failure. This could be supplemented
by introducing a bank-asset separation
authority as well as by developing crossborder bank resolution tools in coordination
with the EU and regional partners. In addition,
legal clarifications regarding the
Reorganization Act for corporations have
improved its effectiveness, while the recent
adoption of an analogous law for individuals
ensures broader coverage. Still, reforms are
needed to shorten the lengthy and costly
bankruptcy process.
38.
More broadly, sustainable growth
will entail enhancing Estonia’s
attractiveness for FDI, addressing skill
mismatches, and increasing human capital.
Estonia’s 2020 Competitiveness Strategy
highlights the need for further improvements
in the business environment to continue to
draw FDI. The urgency of boosting knowledge-

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

based activities and remaining an attractive
destination for FDI has been heightened by
growing competition from emerging markets.
Furthermore, fully drawing on Estonia’s
resources and developing their potential will
also require addressing skill mismatches and
continuing attention to foster human
resources in technical fields as well as to

attract highly-trained individuals to support
sustainable income convergence to EU levels.
39.
It is recommended that the next
Article IV consultation with Estonia be held
on the standard 12-month cycle.

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Annex I. A Fiscal Framework for Estonia
1.
The success of Estonia’s long-standing
currency board arrangement and its accession
into the euro area has been predicated on,
inter alia, fiscal prudence. Budgetary surpluses
were the norm, resulting not only in the lowest
level of general government debt in the EU but
also in an accumulation of sizable liquid
government assets, and sizable cuts in direct
flat tax rates.
2.
Despite Estonia’s sound fiscal
reputation, surging revenue growth during the
recent boom period resulted in pro-cyclical
expenditure growth, which exacerbated the
boom and the following pro-cyclical
retrenchment measures once the bust set in.
Estonia’s favorable economic circumstances
boosted perceptions of the speed of real
income convergence and of permanent
incomes. This in turn led in the mid-2000s to
higher expenditures on public wages (in order
to compete with the private sector), and on
social benefits, especially pensions, to promote
social cohesion and limit income disparities. In
addition, rising government surpluses and
fiscal buffers during this period increased
pressures to boost public infrastructure
expenditures to facilitate further income
convergence. These pro-cyclical policies, along
with income tax cuts motivated and further
fueled the unsustainable expansion, requiring
contractionary policies once the bust began.
3.
In this connection, Estonia’s fiscal
framework can be improved further to limit
pro-cyclical fiscal policy. The European
Commission has noted that performance and
accrual budgeting have been gradually

introduced in 2010–11.1 Limitations have also
been tightened recently regarding the
contracting of loans by local governments.
Plans are also underway to enhance Estonia’s
“soft” medium-term balanced budget rule,
possibly by amending the State Budget Act.2
Still, the counter-cyclical operation of the
budgetary framework can be improved by
introducing binding expenditure ceilings in a
multi-year context.
4.
The usefulness of fiscal rules has
become increasingly recognized, and lies at
the heart of recent EU-wide efforts to
strengthen economic governance (the socalled legislative “six pack”). In light of the
sizable deterioration of overall balances and
debt levels during the recent crisis , a number
of economies have or are considering
enshrining a medium-term objective fiscal
target (MTO) in some legal (such as in the
“organic” State Budget Law) or constitutional
framework for longer-term sustainability.
Other economies with a tradition of prudence
(Sweden and Finland, for example), in contrast,
have found medium-term political
commitments to be sufficient to provide the
necessary discipline.
5.
In Estonia, achieving the medium-term
target for the overall balance could usefully be
supplemented with a multi-year expenditure
rule. The rule would be based on a medium1

Programmes,” European Economy Occasional Papers

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 37

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

term macroeconomic forecast consistent with
achieving the ultimate fiscally sustainable
target. Revenues would be allowed to vary
with deviations of actual developments from
initial forecasts in order to prevent pro-cyclical
policies, thereby enabling automatic stabilizers
to operate (with due respected accorded to
the Stability and Growth Pact). Consideration
could be given to the advice of outside
“experts” to monitor the accuracy of the
macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts and
outcomes. In the Estonian context, the State
Auditing Authority already fulfills some of
these functions.
6.
While multi-year expenditure rules can
help minimize pro-cyclical policies, they are
not without their own operational difficulties.
Expenditure rules should cover as broadly as
possible governmental economic activities
(e.g., at the general government level), but this
may need to be traded off against the cost this
exacts in the timeliness of their monitoring.
Another tradeoff emerges when specifying the
fiscal targets in cyclically adjusted terms, even

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 38

after possibly excluding some cyclically
sensitive components, as this entails
estimating output gaps and underlying
potential output developments. This poses a
greater challenge for economies, such as
Estonia, undergoing significant economic
changes and real income convergence, as
trends and cycles are often difficult to
disentangle. The costs that these intrinsic
measurement difficulties pose for the
transparency and the monitoring of framework
must be weighed against potential benefits in
economic policy making. A non-cyclically
adjusted framework would be simpler to
monitor but would be unable to account for
movements of a purely cyclical nature.
7.
While the use of MTOs, supplemented
by medium-term expenditure rules, and
possibly by independent fiscal authorities are
valuable additional mechanisms, the success of
achieving and maintain a sustainable fiscal
position will ultimately depend upon political
commitments of elected authorities to
formulate and deliver prudent policies..

Annex II. A Rationale for Fiscal Buffers and Their Size
1.
Fiscal buffers can serve as
self-insurance in the event of extreme distress
during crises. The higher the degree of
uncertainty in output, fiscal revenues, and
cyclically-related expenditures (such as social
benefits), the larger potential need for
insurance for smooth fiscal operations. Larger
buffers could also be justified by a higher
probability of being shut out of markets or of
banking sector recapitalization.
2.
Fiscal buffers nonetheless entail
opportunity costs. For highly advanced
economies, costs will boil down to the
foregone interest on higher yielding (nonliquid) assets. In this regard, the size of fiscal
Government Liquid Financial Assets

buffers would be determined as part of public
sector’s asset management. For countries with
infrastructure needs, growth-enhancing
physical infrastructure investment would be
the relevant alternative use of liquid assets.
Resources devoted to fiscal buffers would thus
be weighed against the benefits of
infrastructure development.
3.
In Estonia, fiscal surpluses during the
economic boom had given rise to sizable
buffers, which are among the largest in the EU.
This reflects its comparatively prudent fiscal
policy—a requirement under its previous
currency board arrangement—as well as a
legacy of the economic boom.

1/ Fiscal buffers are measured as a percentage of government deficits and short-term

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 39

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

During 2001–07 general government surpluses
averaged about 1.8 percent of GDP, which
were saved as liquid assets (i.e., currency and
deposits, and securities other than shares).
Over this period, liquid assets rose at their
peak roughly seven-fold to about €2 billion
and had tripled as a share of GDP by end2007. After a temporary decline during the
crisis, liquid assets have recovered to about
€1.8 billion in the second quarter of 2011. The
bulk of the buffers has been held at the central
government level, with social security and local
governments holding the remainder.

nonetheless do not appear to be out of line
(Figure A1). The association of economic
volatility and fiscal buffers generally suggest
that more volatile countries have larger
buffers. In this regard, Estonia’s buffers in
relation to its volatility fall below the average
(as expressed by the regression line), when
measured as a share of GDP. The deviation
from the average should not be taken
literally—it would imply increasing buffers
substantially—but does suggest that some
increase might be justified by Estonia’s
volatility.

4.
During Estonia’s sharp economic
downturn in 2008-09, fiscal buffers were
mainly used to finance fiscal deficits and
largely eschewing financial markets. The
combined 2008–09 general government deficit
totaled €783 million, with the state budget
borrowing €215 million in financing from the
EIB and a local bank (with the latter, totaling
€50 million, has already been repaid).

7.
But judging by Estonia’s low financing
needs, fiscal buffers appear above average.
There is, however, only a weak relation
between fiscal buffers and financing needs,
with significant outliers.

5.
While fiscal buffers have declined, they
remain above the euro area average. At
roughly 2 percentage points of GDP above
average, Estonia’s buffers as a share of GDP
rank fifth among the 17 euro area at end-2010.
Estonia’s liquid assets nonetheless rank among
the highest when compared to fiscal financing
needs (fiscal deficit plus short-term debt falling
due).1 With the exception of Finland, whose
buffers include pension pillar II assets, only
Luxembourg’s buffers are larger than Estonia’s.

Considering Estonia’s economic and
fiscal revenue volatility, fiscal buffers

The size of Finland’s large fiscal buffers reflect their
publically mandated, and partly funded, pay-as-yougo pillar II pension system, and thus are not strictly
comparable to those for Estonia.

8.
Turning to fiscal buffers and market
access, the relation is weak. Countries with
higher probability of accessing markets
(proxied by higher credit ratings) hold buffers
that if all are slightly less than those with lower
probability. This weak relation, however, could
be associated with the impact that fiscal
buffers have in turn on the probability of
market access. A country with higher buffers
appears to be deemed more credit worthy and
thus would have a higher credit rating.

Annex III. Trade and FDI Linkages
A. Trade Structure and Linkages
1.
Estonia’s export performance has
benefited from its high integration with Nordic
countries, particularly by being part of the
Finnish and Swedish global supply chains
(Table 1). Finland and Sweden account for
33 percent of Estonia’s exports. Estonia
processes imported intermediate inputs and
exports these to Finland and Sweden, which in
turn export the final goods to third markets.
Estonia’s other export markets—the Baltics (14
percent) and Russia (10 percent)—represent a
smaller share of Estonia’s exports.
2.
Estonia’s trade exposure to EU
countries thus includes a significant indirect
linkage through Nordic markets. Specifically, in
total commodity exports, the indirect Nordic
linkage accounts for about ⅓ of Estonia’s total
EU exposure. Similarly, Estonia’s exposure to
Brazil, India, and China (BRICs) is greater than
its direct linkage. In machinery and equipment
exports, 17 percent of is actually exported to
BRICs, with about 12½ percent exported
directly. Such secondary linkages are mostly
absent in the Baltic peers as they are not
currently part of global supply chains; their
main exports are mineral and wood products
whose productions processes are less likely to
be vertically integrated..

Estonia’s trade pattern reflects a large
share of intra-industry trade. Machinery and
equipment and mineral product exports
represent about 40 percent of Estonia’s
exports, which mirrors imports of these
products. Exports of machinery and equipment
mainly entail processing intermediate goods,
but a large share of exports of mineral
products reflects transit trade of oil: Estonia reexports its Russian oil imports to the Baltics.

B. FDI Linkages
6.
Estonia’s exports have been supported
and enhanced by FDI from the Nordic
countries. Financial sector FDI from Sweden
has accounted for the bulk of total FDI in
Estonia. The manufacturing sector is the
second largest FDI-receiving sector, which
comes primarily from Finland. Finland
proximity may explain why it is the largest
foreign investor in Estonia.
7.
Manufacturing FDI has been found to
be linked with a host country’s export

performance. This comes about by
augmenting domestic capital, helping transfer
of technology and new products, and
providing training for the local workforce and
upgrading technical and managerial skills (text
figure).1,2

Higher FDI in the tradable sector leads to better
export performance and an improvement in external
balance (Kinoshita , Yuko, 2011, “Sectoral Composition
of FDI and External Vulnerability in Eastern Europe”,
IMF Working Paper, WP/11/123 ).

8.
Estonia faces competition for Nordic
FDI from other emerging markets particularly
in Asia. Even though Finland’s outward FDI
bounced back in 2010, Estonia’s share has
declined. Finnish FDI has been increasingly
directed towards China and India, while
Estonia’s share has remained roughly
unchanged. In nominal terms, Finnish FDI in
Estonia has been stagnant since mid-2000,
with Finland’s FDI in China surpassing that in
Estonia in 2006. This partly reflects a loss of
Estonia’s price competitiveness and rising unit
labor cost during the boom years. During the
crisis, recessions had prompted further Finnish
and Swedish manufactures to expand overseas
production in Asia to cut costs. Estonia
continues to attract manufacturing FDI but
green-field investments are increasingly from
small and medium-sized firms located in
Finland.

9.
Estonia’s ability to attract FDI will be a
central element in boosting long-run growth.
In particular, FDI can be a catalyst for a country
to climb up the value chain via transfer of new
technology and skills. Estonia has been the
best performer in exports compared to the
Baltic countries, but it has been caught up by
the CEE countries in 2010 (Figure 5). In
addition, FDI in the tradable sector
(manufacturing) as a share of GDP had
declined in Estonia during the boom years.
Enhancing human capital and infrastructure
would help tilt capital inflows more towards
the tradable sector in line with the ongoing
rebalancing of the economy.

Reflecting its flexibility, Estonia’s labor
market has adjusted quicker than its neighbors
(Figure A2). According to survey data, Estonia
has the lowest collective bargaining coverage
among EU countries, its wage changes are
among the most frequent, and its share of
bonus pay ranks among the highest.1
Relatively low level of employment protection
legislation (EPL) may also contribute to a high
turnover of labor force in Estonia

Labor market conditions have
improved steadily since the first quarter
of 2010. Employment growth has
increased by 7¾ percent (year-on-year)
and the unemployment rate has declined
to about 13¼ percent in the second
quarter of 2011 from its 20-percent peak.
Likewise, youth unemployment has fallen
(Figure A2). Still, long-term
unemployment has been rising.

4.
Despite a decline in overall
unemployment, long-term unemployment—
accounting for about half of joblessness—has
been rising.2 Labor force surveys show that
Estonia’s long-term unemployment has been
more prevalent among the youth (people
between the ages of 15 and 25 years) lacking
higher education. Still job vacancies are rising
particularly in the manufacturing sector
reflecting mismatched skills.
5.
While the unemployment rate has
remained in the double-digits, gross wages
have started to increase again. This could
reflect a number of factors. Given that wage
increases have been more pronounced in
manufacturing, labor shortage appear to be

B. Skill Mismatches in Labor Market
6.
Addressing skill mismatches in the
labor market is one of the main challenges
facing Estonia. During the real estate and
construction booms, a bloated demand for
labor in the construction sector served to
divert workers away from other sectors
through rapidly increasing wages. The latter
peaked in September 2008 and were
60 percent higher than in March 2006. During
the bust, labor shedding took place in the
construction sector, with about 43 percent of
total jobs lost was in the construction sector.
With no corresponding pick-up in
manufacturing employment, unemployment
increased rapidly. While the recovery has
strengthened, laid-off construction workers
have not been able to secure jobs in the
manufacturing sector—where vacancies have
increased—mostly due to the lack of needed
skills
7.
Recent trends in the relationship
between vacancy and unemployment rates
suggest that job matching has become more
difficult. During March 2008 and March 2010,

the recessionary phrase in the business cycle
can be traced as a movement to the right
along the Beveridge curve3. The
unemployment rate had started to fall since
March 2010 as job vacancies started to pick
up. More recently, however, there was an
uptick in unemployment despite an increase in
the vacancy rate.
8.
The job-skill mismatch is more visible
in the manufacturing sector. Wages have
3

The job vacancy rate is negatively related to the
unemployment rate in a pattern known as the
“Beveridge” curve. Movements along the curve trace
the business cycle. In the expansionary phase, for
instance, one moves along the curve in a northeast
direction as vacancy rates rises and the unemployment
rate falls. Shifts in the curve represent changes in
structural unemployment. A rightward shift of the
Beveridge curve implies a a decline in the labor
market’s efficiency: i.e., the job matching process has
become less efficient due to mismatches between the
unemployed and available jobs (Rodenburg, Peter,
2011, "The Remarkable Transformation of the UV
curve". European Journal of the History of Economic
Thought 18 (1): pp.125-153).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 47

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

9.
In Estonia, labor market developments
suggest that the Beveridge curve could have
shifted up in March 2010. Specifically in a
simple regression line, a shift dummy is
statistically significant and it increases the
regression’s explanatory power; the adjusted
R2 increases about 50 percentage points to
0.83 compared to a regression without the
dummy. The outward shift could reflect a
cyclical factor in the early stages of a recovery,4
but it could also imply a structural change in
the efficiency of job matching associated with
worsening skill mismatches.
10.
The job-skill mismatch is more visible
in the manufacturing sector. Wages have
started to increase in manufacturing despite
rising job vacancies, while wages are still
stagnant in the construction sector. A risk of
the high unemployment rate would become
entrenched unless the mismatches are further
addressed by retraining and improving
education. On this front, there have been a
number of measures put in place to reduce
unemployment. Wage subsidies targeting
high-risk groups have contributed to reduce
youth and long-term unemployed.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Estonia’s data provision to the Fund is
generally adequate for surveillance purposes.
A May 2001 data ROSC mission found that the
quality of macroeconomic statistics was
generally good. The 2009 fiscal transparency
ROSC indicated that Estonia now meets nearly
all of the requirements of the transparency
code, and approached best international
practice in some areas. Estonia subscribed to
the SDDS on September 30, 1998, with
metadata posted on the DSSB on January 27,
1999, and met SDDS specifications on March
30, 2000. The latest (2010) annual observance
report for Estonia for the SDDS was posted on
the Fund’s website in May 2011.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
the Republic of Estonia
On November 28, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Estonia, and considered and endorsed the
staff appraisal without a meeting on a lapse-of-time basis2.
Background
A vibrant recovery has marked Estonia’s first year in the euro area, albeit amid nascent
tensions. The economy’s strong rebound has been grounded in a proven track record of
prudent macroeconomic policies, which also underpinned a successful euro adoption
and a recent credit rating upgrade. But coming on the heels of one of the EU’s deepest
economic contractions, the recovery has exposed underlying difficulties. Price pressures
have emerged (still mainly imported) and unemployment, while declining, remains high
with long-term joblessness on the rise. The latter has mostly reflected mismatched skills.
Following strong growth in 2011—among the highest in the EU—the pace of economic
activity and price increases are set to moderate in 2012. In line with weakening export
markets, growth is projected to slow to about 3 percent. This is expected to be only
partially offset by stronger final domestic demand. The output gap will nonetheless
continue to narrow in 2012. Inflation should also moderate as the impact of global food
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

and fuel prices shocks dissipate. Core inflation’s outlook remains uncertain given wage
pressures largely stemming from labor shortages and mismatched skills. So far, wages
increases have not exceeded productivity gains. As a result, economy-wide profitability
and external competitiveness have improved. These trends are likely to broadly
continue but pressures can remain on core inflation.
With continued volatility in global financial markets, downside risks to the outlook have
risen at end-2011. With two-thirds of Estonia’s exports going to the EU, recent European
and global developments have tilted risks to the downside. Besides the domestic risk
that the unwinding past real and financial sector imbalances be more protracted and
weigh on domestic demand, external risks associated with the euro area sovereign debt
crisis prevail.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2011 Article IV consultation with Estonia, Executive Directors
endorsed the staff’s appraisal as follows:
Estonia faces an increasingly challenging environment as it looks to continue
implementing policies preserving macroeconomic policy credibility and safeguarding
sustainable growth. Following a strong recovery in its first year in the euro area,
Estonia’s economic activity will likely slow in 2012. In the central scenario, nonetheless,
Estonia’s economy will continue to approach its potential. Inflation is poised to slow
even though pressures on core inflation can remain. Recently, downside risks to the
outlook have increased. In addition to a slowdown in exports, a generalized confidence
fallout from the euro area sovereign debt crisis could spill over to Estonia despite its
strong fundamentals.
Estonia’s fiscal position will remain strong but there will be a need to limit the stimulative
impact of the 2012 budget in the central scenario, albeit uncertainties abound. Timebound increases in public investment underlie the budget’s positive impulse, while a
neutral budget would be appropriate. Recognizing that further significant compression of
current expenditures is unrealistic, observance of budgetary allocations will be helpful in
this regard. But if downside risks materialize, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to
operate while maintaining Estonia’s hard-earned fiscal credibility. In addition, given the
uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the global slowdown, fiscal buffers
should be preserved and alternative sources of financing be considered.
Looking beyond the current conjuncture, the authorities’ medium-term target can
safeguard Estonia’s strong fiscal position. This will require continued expenditure
restraint to counter spending pressures that are likely to emerge. The authorities’
ongoing efforts to enhance central government productivity through centralization of
accounting and personnel management can help. Still without raising taxes, achieving
the fiscal target on a sustainable basis, implementing the authorities’ plan to reduce

3
labor taxation, and restore fiscal buffers will require reducing non-wage goods and
services by at least 2 percentage points of GDP in the medium term. The pace of
consolidation should be mindful of long-term investment needs and cyclical
developments.
A fully fledged multi-year fiscal framework can support the medium-term target, bolster
Estonia’s high fiscal credibility, and limit pro-cyclical policies. A successful framework
should reflect Estonia’s fiscal tradition of simplicity and transparency, which has
facilitated monitoring and accountability. The central element of such a framework would
be multi-year expenditure ceilings and their strict observance while revenue collections
adjust to cyclical conditions. In addition, fiscal buffers should continue to be an integral
part of Estonia’s fiscal framework. While there are benefits as well as costs of holding
liquid assets, gradually rebuilding buffers appears appropriate given increased global
uncertainty.
For the financial sector, the challenge entails safeguarding stability in the context of
heightened global financial tension. Estonian banks have scant direct and indirect
exposure to euro area sovereign debt, while at the same time capital and liquidity
buffers have increased substantially since 2007. However, the legacy of the previous
crisis continues to burden balance sheets and dependence on financing from parent
banks remains high, although both of these factors are declining. The latter has proven
a stable source of financing, but parent banks in turn rely on short-term wholesale
funding. Limiting potential contagion will thus require continued improvements in crossborder supervision. Developing regional crisis resolution tools—in close cooperation
with relevant authorities—can provide critical backstop to Estonia’s sizable fiscal and
financial buffers. The scheduled December high-level meeting of Nordic regulators
provides an opportunity to make progress in this critical area. In addition, an early and
gradual institutional adoption of Basel III requirements can reduce funding risks but its
implementation should avoiding creating headwinds for credit conditions.
Financial resilience can also be supported by further enhancing the regional and
domestic resolution frameworks for banks and addressing weaknesses in Estonia’s
bankruptcy law. The recent adoption of a domestic resolution law provides a welcome
tool to minimize the cost of a bank failure. This could be supplemented by introducing a
bank-asset separation authority as well as by developing cross-border bank resolution
tools in coordination with the EU and regional partners. In addition, legal clarifications
regarding the Reorganization Act for corporations have improved its effectiveness, while
the recent adoption of an analogous law for individuals ensures broader coverage. Still,
reforms are needed to shorten the lengthy and costly bankruptcy process.
More broadly, sustainable growth will entail enhancing Estonia’s attractiveness for
Foreign Direct Investments (FDI), addressing skill mismatches, and increasing human
capital. Estonia’s 2020 Competitiveness Strategy highlights the need for further
improvements in the business environment to continue to draw FDI. The urgency of

4
boosting knowledge-based activities and remaining an attractive destination for FDI has
been heightened by growing competition from emerging markets. Furthermore, fully
drawing on Estonia’s resources and developing their potential will also require
addressing skill mismatches and continuing attention to foster human resources in
technical fields as well as to attract highly-trained individuals to support sustainable
income convergence to EU levels.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
