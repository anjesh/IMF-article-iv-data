Executive Summary


Discussions for the 2010 Article IV consultation were held in Moscow during June 2–15. The
mission comprised Mr. Thomsen (head), Mr. Kähkönen, Ms. Kozack, Messrs. Hofman and Tiffin,
Ms. Zakharova (all EUR), Mr. Tuya (MCM, external expert), and Mr. Brekk (senior resident
representative). Mr. Mozhin, Executive Director, also participated in the discussions. The mission
met with Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Kudrin, Central Bank of Russia (CBR)
Governor Ignatiev, other senior officials, and representatives of financial institutions, corporations,
and think tanks.



Summary. The Russian economy has improved after a deep recession, but the recovery is fragile.
Inflation has come down rapidly in the context of a large output gap, and should remain in check in
the near term. The banking system is still under strain and credit is expected to recover only
gradually. With Russia likely to emerge from the crisis with lower potential growth, the key policy
challenge facing the authorities will be to withdraw the large fiscal stimulus as cyclical conditions
normalize to avoid a renewed bout of rapid real appreciation and high inflation. Against this
background, staff made the following recommendations:


On the response to the recession, the authorities acted forcefully, taking full advantage of the
buffers afforded by the pre-crisis policy of taxing and saving much of the oil revenue and the
attendant large reserves. In this regard, the stabilization fund mechanism has served Russia very
well and should be preserved.



On fiscal policy, the expansion of some 9 percent of GDP has almost entirely taken the form of
permanent measures, suggesting that fiscal consolidation will require reinvigorating longstalled public-sector reforms, including in the areas of pensions, health care, and social
protection. Staff believes that consolidation should begin in 2010 and gather pace in 2011–12.



On monetary policy, the focus should be on inflation control in the context of a flexible
exchange rate. The recent greater exchange rate flexibility is welcome, but political resolve in
this regard remains to be tested in an environment involving a starker tradeoff between inflation
and nominal ruble appreciation.



On financial sector policies, improved provisioning standards are needed to reduce risks to bank
balance sheets. In addition, the CBR’s authority to conduct consolidated supervision—
including over connected lending—should be enhanced.



On structural reforms, the overarching challenge is to improve the investment climate.



Exchange rate regime. Russia’s exchange rate is classified as “other managed arrangement”
effective November 1, 2008. The Russian Federation accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF Articles of Agreement with effect from June 1, 1996. The exchange
system is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions.



It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

I. CRISIS RECOVERY
A. A Gradually Improving Economy
The Russian economy is improving, but the recovery is fragile. Inflation has come down
rapidly. High oil prices and a return of risk appetite have strengthened the balance of
payments. Nonetheless, the banking system is still under strain and financial markets remain
vulnerable to shifts in investor sentiment and oil price declines.
1.
Hit hard by the global financial crisis, the Russian economy contracted by
7.9 percent in 2009. Domestic demand fell sharply in the first half of 2009, following
plunging oil prices and an abrupt reversal of capital flows that brought a multi-year credit
boom to an end. Private consumption and fixed investment declined strongly, with the effects
on growth compounded by a large rundown of inventories. The contribution of net exports,
meanwhile, turned positive as imports contracted.
2.
The economy has improved, but the
recovery remains fragile. After some
temporary softness in the first quarter, shortterm indicators point to a strengthening of the
recovery (Figure 1). While all components of
demand now appear to be expanding, growth is
becoming increasingly driven by consumption,
reflecting to a large extent the recent 45 percent
cumulative increase in pensions and other policy
support.

Inflation has been coming down
rapidly. Against the background of a large
output gap, falling food prices, and an
appreciating ruble, headline inflation has fallen
from 14 percent (y-o-y) in early 2009 to 6 percent
in May 2010. Core inflation—which excludes
administered prices as well as fruits and
vegetables—has fallen to around 4¼ percent.

Labor market conditions have
improved. The unemployment rate, which
shot up in the second half of 2008, has
recently been coming down rapidly, to about
7½ percent in May from a peak of 9 percent.
At the same time, real wages and real
disposable income have strengthened,
underpinning the recovery in private
consumption.

surplus fell to 4 percent of GDP in 2009,
from about 6 percent in 2007 and 2008. On the export side, lower oil prices and weak
external demand led to a 36 percent decline in export values. This, however, was partly offset
by a 35 percent drop in import values that reflected the fall in domestic demand. The current
account recovered in the second half of 2009 and preliminary data indicate that it
strengthened appreciably in 2010 thus far, reflecting high oil prices and a continued recovery
in export volumes. At the same time, the capital account has stabilized amid periods of
intermittent outflows and inflows.

The overall balance of payments has remained in surplus, and the ruble has
appreciated. Reserves increased by some $60 billion over the past 12 months. The ruble has
appreciated by about 20 percent in real effective terms since its trough in February 2009,
bringing it broadly back to its pre-crisis level. Although the appreciation since the Fall 2009
CGER exercise exceeds the rise in long-term oil prices over the same period, the CGER
estimates—as well as the mission’s assessment—still suggest that the ruble is broadly in line
with medium-term fundamentals.

7.
Financial indicators rebounded in 2009, but the recent turmoil has roiled
markets. As global conditions recovered over the course of 2009, financial market indicators
in Russia improved markedly. Russia’s stock market index more than doubled last year,
making it one of the best performers among emerging markets. Sovereign spreads, which had
peaked at over 850 bps in late 2008, fell to below 140 bps in mid-April 2010. Since then, in
the wake of the crisis in Europe and the renewed decline in oil prices, markets have been
volatile: the ruble has depreciated by 7 percent against the dollar, Russian sovereign spreads
have risen by some 120 bps, and the stock market surrendered its gains for the year
(Figure 2).
8.
The banking system is highly liquid, but banks have been strained by bad loans
and credit has remained stagnant. Overdue loans have continued to rise and now stand at
6½ percent of total loans under Russian reporting standards. Reflecting weak demand for
credit and the continuing efforts by banks to restructure their balance sheets, credit to the
economy has remained largely unchanged in nominal terms since January 2009. There are
signs, however, that the accumulation of overdue loans is now decelerating, and that banks
are scaling back efforts to boost provisions and capital. Indeed, some of the larger banks,
citing an improvement in asset quality, have signaled that they may release provisions to
fund new loans later in the year. Although banks’ pre-provision income was relatively
healthy in 2009, falling interest rates have squeezed interest margins and increased pressure
on banks to begin lending. In this context, credit growth picked up modestly in March and
April, reflecting an improvement in credit demand and moderating credit supply constraints.

B. Policy Response to the Recession
The Russian authorities responded forcefully to the recession. 1 The pre-crisis policy of taxing
and saving much of the oil windfall created significant space for fiscal expansion, monetary
easing, and extraordinary liquidity support to the banking system.
Fiscal Policy
9.
There was a dramatic discretionary fiscal relaxation in 2009. The general
government nonoil deficit increased from 8¼ percent of GDP in 2008 to 15 percent of GDP
in 2009, almost entirely on account of higher spending. This was one of the largest fiscal
stimuli in the G-20. However, much of the expansion was targeted at low-multiplier areas,
such as strategic sectors and defense and security. Moreover, most of the stimulus was
implemented in the

10.
The headline deficit was easily financed. Russia’s prudent past management of its
oil wealth left the country with large international reserves and low public debt. This created
room to monetize the deficit—which swung from a surplus of 4¼ percent of GDP in 2008 to
a deficit of 6¼ percent of GDP in 2009—by drawing down the oil funds held at the CBR
without significant risks to external stability. Russia’s public debt ratio is below 11 percent.

Monetary Policy
11.
Against the backdrop of a more stable external outlook and falling inflation, the
CBR has steadily reduced interest rates. It cut its refinancing rate by 525 bps to
7¾ percent from its peak in April 2009. However, given the uncertain economic outlook and
reflecting increased risk aversion, nominal interest rates remained stubbornly high for most
borrowers throughout much of 2009. In this context, the decline in inflation has turned
average real interest rates positive for the first time in many years. Only recently have deposit
and lending rates begun to fall more quickly. By contrast, interbank rates have remained
within the CBR’s policy corridor, reflecting the high liquidity of the banking sector
(Figure 4).
12.
The exchange rate has become more flexible. This has, however, occurred in the
context of a weaker balance of payments and a sizeable output gap, which has reduced the
tradeoff between inflation and nominal exchange rate objectives. Since March 2009, the
ruble has appreciated by around 15 percent against the exchange rate basket, with short-run
movements sometimes exceeding 4 percent in a single week. Nonetheless, the CBR
continues to intervene to avoid abrupt changes in the exchange rate, while still allowing a
markedly greater degree of day-to-day volatility. While a further increase in international
reserves is not the goal of the CBR’s interventions, it is clearly a byproduct of this policy in
an environment of high oil prices, involving sterilization and opportunity costs.

The authorities have been exiting
from extraordinary liquidity support
extended during the crisis. With banks
highly liquid, repo demand has effectively
disappeared, and banks have used excess
funds to repay their debt to the CBR ahead
of schedule. This withdrawal of liquidity,
together with the issuance of new CBR
bonds and a pick-up in money demand,
largely sterilized the monetary impact of the
fiscal expansion in 2009 (Figure 5). Also,
one bank has partially repaid the public
capital injection it received during the crisis.

Other support mechanisms are also gradually being withdrawn. As of July,
regulatory forbearance, in the form of easier provisioning requirements,2 will be gradually
brought back in line with pre-crisis norms. Lending limits for uncollateralized loans were
reduced in February, and interbank market guarantees are being unwound. Moreover, having
expanded the “Lombard list” used for repo transactions during the crisis, the CBR intends to
tighten eligibility over time. Collateral rules for nontraded assets used for CBR refinancing
are also being strengthened. Finally, an earlier-planned public bank-recapitalization scheme
has been scrapped. At the same time, the CBR stands ready to reactivate these facilities
should the banking system come under renewed pressure in the face of adverse shocks.

II. NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK AND RISKS
15.
The near-term economic outlook is for a moderate recovery. While the recent
rebound is still dependent on policy support, a self-sustained consumption-led recovery is set
to gradually take hold, not least because the adjustment of bank balance sheets now appears
to have run its course, with banks poised to cautiously expand lending. Gradually rising real
wages and lower unemployment should provide additional support to consumption. As a
result, GDP growth is projected to reach 4¼ percent in 2010, supported by a boost to
consumption and a turn in the inventory cycle (and also reflecting large base effects).
However, absent sustained increases in oil prices, underlying growth momentum is expected
to recover only gradually, causing annual growth to fall back to around 4 percent in 2011.
Reflecting the output gap, still-weak demand, and continued ruble appreciation, inflation is
projected to remain subdued, reaching 6 percent (y-o-y) at end-2010 and 5½ percent at end2011.
16.
Short-term risks are broadly balanced. On the upside, more favorable external
developments—particularly higher oil prices and greater capital inflows—or a more rapid
recovery in credit could push growth higher. On the downside, external shocks—for
example, those emanating from sovereign vulnerabilities in Europe with effects on oil prices
or investor sentiment—present the key risk. There are few direct financial linkages, owing to
the relatively modest role of foreign banks in Russia’s financial system. However, an abrupt
drop in oil prices and a retrenchment in risk appetite could result in larger-than-projected
capital outflows given the liquidity overhang in the banking system. A worse-than-expected
growth outcome in Russia would have knock-on effects throughout the region, mainly
through remittances and trade (Box 1).

15
Box 1. Regional Spillovers from the Economic Slowdown in Russia*
The deep recession in Russia had a substantial impact on its regional partners.


Remittances. The remittance link is especially strong with the countries in the Caucasus
and Central Asia (CCA), as well as Moldova, Belarus, and Ukraine. In the boom years
preceding the crisis, Russia was an important employer of migrant workers from these
countries, primarily in the flourishing construction sector. As Russia’s real estate bubble
burst, however, flows to these countries declined considerably. Individual remittances
from Russia to the CIS dropped by more than 30 percent in total—Armenia, Georgia, the
Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan each experienced a drop in inflows, mainly
from Russia, by up to a third in 2009, while remittances to Moldova declined by almost
40 percent.



Trade. Countries with strong trade links
with Russia also saw a significant decline
in their exports, owing to subdued demand
in Russia. Exports to Russia from CIS
countries started declining in the final
quarter of 2008 and dropped by more than
a third in 2009. Other neighboring
countries experienced a similar pattern—
Finland, for which Russia is the thirdlargest export market on account of transit
trade, saw its exports to Russia drop by
almost 50 percent in 2009.

Financial. Over the course of 2008-09, facing a significant depreciation of the Russian
ruble vis-à-vis the dollar, many of Russia’s trading partners were compelled to follow suit.
Armenia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan all devalued their currencies
by almost 25 percent. However, high dollarization levels in some of these countries left
their financial sectors vulnerable to exchange-rate movements—depreciation impacted the
balance sheets of local banks with FX exposures to unhedged borrowers, with negative
knock-on effects on lending. Real credit growth has declined on average by over
60 percent in CCA countries since end-2007.

As Russia gradually recovers from the crisis, 5
its regional partners stand to benefit. There
are signs that the nascent recovery in the region 4

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Medium-term fiscal consolidation is the overarching policy priority for Russia. With
continued large oil price increases unlikely, achieving balanced growth will depend critically
on an appropriately countercyclical fiscal policy aimed at mitigating pressures for real
appreciation and inflation.
17.
The oil fund mechanism has served Russia well, creating room for a forceful
crisis response. The authorities took full advantage of the ample room for maneuver
afforded by the prudent pre-crisis policy of taxing and saving much of the oil revenue and the
attendant large reserves. Thus, even after a large drawdown of reserves and a sizeable fiscal
stimulus, Russia faces no solvency or financing concerns. Still, the years before the crisis
also saw important and growing weaknesses that were manifested in an increasingly
inflationary policy mix. The steady rise in the nonoil deficit as more of the oil wealth was
spent caused fiscal policy to become ever more procyclical, as private demand was very
buoyant. Meanwhile, the attempt to resist the resulting upward pressures on the ruble through
foreign exchange interventions caused monetary policy to become accommodative.
18.
Against this background, the key challenge facing Russia is to withdraw fiscal
stimulus as cyclical conditions normalize. There is a concern that, with spending pressures
intensifying, fiscal policy could quickly become procyclical once again as the economy
recovers, putting renewed pressure on the real exchange rate and inflation. Such concerns are
heightened by the fact that most of the fiscal expansion relative to pre-crisis levels has
involved permanent measures, notably large pension increases. This suggests that fiscal
consolidation cannot be achieved unless urgent progress is made on long-stalled public sector
reforms. Moreover, the authorities’ room for maneuver is further constrained by the fact
that—with limited prospects for large increases in oil prices over the medium term—the
nexus of strong growth in investment, productivity, real wages, and consumption that
powered Russia’s pre-crisis growth is unlikely to return. In these circumstances, a return to
an unfavorable macroeconomic policy mix of procyclical fiscal policy and monetary
accommodation—coupled with continued slow progress on structural reforms—would likely
take a larger toll in terms of rapid real appreciation, lower growth, and higher inflation than
in the past.
A. Fiscal Policy: Consolidation through Reform
Increased pressures to spend more of the oil wealth, alongside a highly inflexible budget
structure, suggest that withdrawing the fiscal stimulus is the key policy challenge facing the
authorities. Meeting this challenge will require a reinvigoration of structural reforms.
19.
Withdrawing the very large fiscal stimulus will be a formidable task. The
underlying nonoil deficit of the federal government is projected to remain some 9 percent of
GDP above its pre-crisis level in 2010. At the same time, the budget has become increasingly
inflexible—three-quarters of the increase in the nonoil deficit relative to pre-crisis levels

17
reflects higher permanent measures, with half of the increase attributable to higher pensions
alone. Nonstatutory spending is now only 9 percent of GDP—equal to the size of the
consolidation needed to reverse the stimulus and achieve the government’s own long-term
target for the nonoil deficit of 4.7 percent of GDP by 2015.
20.
Fiscal policy is likely to be relaxed further. The original 2010–12 medium-term
budget appropriately targeted a gradual withdrawal of stimulus—the nonoil deficit was slated
to decline to 9½ percent of GDP in 2012. However, in June, the government passed a
supplementary budget which—in addition to previously-announced tax expenditure
measures—would lead to a slight increase in the federal nonoil deficit in 2010, compared to
reduction of some ¾ percent of

consolidation.
21.
Staff recommended that the fiscal consolidation start now, and be stepped up
in 2011–12. With recovery underway, and given the magnitude of the fiscal consolidation
needed to reverse the stimulus, striking an appropriate balance between short-term cyclical
considerations and medium-term consolidation suggests that the withdrawal of stimulus
should begin in 2010. In this context, staff disagreed with the expansion of the federal
government’s nonoil balance implied by the 2010 supplementary budget, and warned against
another supplement in the fall. In staff’s view, the previously-planned target of reducing the
nonoil deficit to 9½ percent of GDP by 2012 remains broadly consistent with the current
outlook for economic activity. Looking further into the future, the target of a nonoil deficit of
4.7 percent of GDP implied by the government’s long-term fiscal framework remains an
appropriate long-term fiscal anchor.
22.
The authorities and staff agreed that fiscal consolidation could only be achieved
through a reinvigoration of long-stalled public-sector reforms. However, such reforms
had been idle for several years and the authorities acknowledged that there was little
momentum for restarting them at this stage. Nonetheless, they were hopeful that progress
could be made following the elections in 2012. In this regard, they indicated that a gradual
increase in the retirement age and a rationalization of social protection benefits through more
rigorous means-testing were being contemplated. The authorities are also considering
revenue measures. In particular, they saw scope to: (i) further raise excise taxes and the
extraction tax on gas; (ii) introduce market-based valuation for property tax; and (iii)
streamline tax-breaks and privileges. Staff expressed concern that delayed implementation of
reforms would make it impossible to withdraw the stimulus in a timely manner, noting that
the associated macroeconomic risks would increase as cyclical conditions improved. It

18
agreed that an increase in the retirement age was needed to strengthen the viability of the
pension system, and indicated that cross-country comparisons suggest that significant savings
can be achieved in health and social protection without compromising the quality of service
delivery. Staff welcomed the revenue measures under consideration, but noted that most of
the adjustment would need to take place on the expenditure side, through reforms and
reductions in discretionary spending.
23.
Staff and the authorities also concurred on the need to strengthen the fiscal
policy framework.


Staff underscored that the policy of taxing and saving much of the oil wealth through
the Reserve and National Welfare Funds had served Russia well, and created room
for a large countercyclical response to the crisis and recession. Preserving this policy
would be key to macroeconomic stability.



The mission urged the authorities to avoid the use of supplementary budgets. Such
budgets have been passed in every year since the 1998 crisis, reflecting persistent
spending pressures. Since 2004, with the exception of the recent crisis, the changes
implied by the supplementary budgets have invariably increased the procyclicality of
fiscal policy.



Staff encouraged the authorities to refocus fiscal policy on the nonoil deficit. Use of
the nonoil deficit provides an anchor for fiscal policy, given the volatility of
commodity prices. Moreover, to ensure an effective countercyclical fiscal response,
focusing fiscal policy firmly on the nonoil deficit would help to ensure that spending
does not rise and fall with commodity prices. In this regard, staff expressed concern
about the use of less conservative oil prices in the 2011‒13 medium-term budget.



Ministry of Finance officials agreed that the supplementary budgets reflected
underlying pressures to spend more of the oil wealth. Nonetheless, while
acknowledging that such budgets had increased the procyclicality of fiscal policy,
they noted that the Ministry of Finance had had some success in limiting spending
pressures. Still, they concurred that it would be preferable to strengthen the fiscal
policy framework by avoiding the use of supplementary budgets and focusing on the
nonoil deficit. In the area of fiscal risk management, the authorities explained that
they intend to develop a methodology for assessing the sustainability of borrowing by
quasi-sovereign enterprises, reducing borrowing costs, and introducing limits on the
size and profile of external borrowing.
B. Monetary Policy: Focusing on Inflation

The CBR’s policy of allowing greater exchange rate flexibility is a welcome step toward
focusing monetary policy more firmly on inflation control. However, the authorities’
commitment to this policy remains to be tested.

19
24.
The authorities and staff agreed that the monetary easing cycle should now be
paused. At its June meeting, the CBR kept policy interest rates unchanged. Staff concurred
and suggested that the next move should likely involve initiating a tightening cycle. The
authorities felt that, as yet, such a move was premature, and expressed concern about the
possible impact of higher interest rates on capital inflows. However, they pointed out that
monetary conditions were indeed being tightened—given the gradual unwinding of crisis
support to the banking system—and that the CBR stood ready to raise reserve requirements,
if necessary, in the event of a resurgence of inflation pressures. In this context, staff urged the
authorities to aim for a further reduction in inflation from current levels. Finally, the CBR
agreed that the continued monetization of the fiscal deficit would pose additional challenges
to monetary policy, but considered these to be manageable. In this regard, CBR officials
highlighted their recent success in sterilizing excess liquidity through the issuance of central
bank bonds (OBRs).
25.
Staff reiterated its recommendation that monetary policy be focused on inflation
control, in the context of a flexible exchange rate. The mission welcomed the CBR’s more
flexible exchange rate policy, and stressed that low inflation would be critical in expanding
the availability of long-term ruble financing and reducing dependence on foreign funding.
However, with weak cyclical conditions and low capital inflows, the CBR’s commitment to a
flexible exchange rate policy still remained to be tested. In this regard, staff felt that the
authorities’ monetary policy framework was unclear. It expressed concern that—should
pressures on the ruble intensify—the authorities might once again resort to a policy of
resisting nominal appreciation, leading to rapid growth of money and credit. These concerns
were heightened by the lack of a clearly articulated inflation objective. Indeed, CBR officials
conceded that exchange-rate considerations might again be given priority if tensions arose
between the objectives of achieving low inflation and limiting appreciation. They felt that—
given Russia’s dependence on global commodity prices—the economy was not yet ready to
cope with the exchange rate volatility implied by a completely free float.
26.
The mission supported the authorities’ technical preparations for an eventual
move to formal inflation targeting. Recent enhancements in the CBR’s public
communications were playing a key role in preparing the public for such a move. These
included regular, preannounced monetary-policy meetings and the issuance of press releases
describing the rationale for policy rate decisions. The CBR noted that they were steadily
putting in place other key technical prerequisites for a successful transition to inflation
targeting. However, in line with the view that the economy was not yet prepared for a
flexible exchange rate policy, they did not foresee the adoption of formal inflation targeting
in the near future.
27.
The authorities and staff agreed that the more flexible exchange-rate regime,
alongside cuts in policy interest rates, had helped deter speculative capital inflows. They
concurred that a return of capital inflows to pre-crisis levels was unlikely. However, should
persistent, large-scale inflows resume, the authorities noted that they might consider the
reintroduction of differentiated reserve requirements—by residence and currency—to prevent

20
the accumulation of vulnerabilities in the banking system. They were also taking steps to
reduce tax incentives for foreign borrowing, and were discussing ways in which the
borrowing plans of state-owned enterprises might be more closely aligned with the
authorities’ macroeconomic stabilization goals. Staff agreed that there were circumstances—
such as a period of surging inflows caused by persistent and large oil prices increases—
where such measures, including capital controls, could be useful, but cautioned that they
were likely to lose effectiveness over time and could have undesirable multilateral effects. It
noted that exchange-rate flexibility should serve as a first line of defense against a renewed
increase in capital inflows, alongside strengthened prudential regulations and supervision
aimed at curtailing excessive credit growth (Annex). Both staff and the authorities agreed
that reserves were adequate.
C. Restoring the Health of the Banking System
Restoring the banking system to health is critical to ensuring a sustained recovery in credit
expansion. This will require decisive action to improve provisioning standards and enhance
the CBR’s supervisory powers.
28.
Despite improvements in recent years, weaknesses in the regulatory and
supervisory framework remain. Generous accounting and provisioning rules, and the lack
of comprehensive consolidated supervisory powers, continue to make it difficult to gauge the
extent of systemic risks, the severity of the deterioration of the loan portfolio, and the
adequacy of capital. In particular, given the sizeable pool of nonperforming and restructured
loans, some banks may not have sufficient provisions to deal with unexpected shocks.
Indeed, the stock of bad assets is likely to weigh on profitability going forward, making
banks vulnerable to an increase in interest rates or a deterioration in economic conditions.
29.
Staff urged the authorities to improve provisioning standards. In the mission’s
view, strengthening the loan classification and provisioning system is essential to gaining a
full understanding of banks’ capital adequacy. In particular, loan risk assessment should be
improved and provisioning should be made more forward-looking by taking into account
likely future loan losses. Doing so may reduce reported capital adequacy—and in this event,
undercapitalized financial institutions should be recapitalized, restructured, merged, or
closed. To the extent that better provisioning leads to healthier loan portfolios over time, the
risk that increases in interest rates would damage bank earnings and balance sheets will be
reduced. While noting the mission’s concerns, the authorities stressed that the situation in the
banking system had stabilized—the accumulation of overdue loans had slowed; bank
provisions had increased dramatically; and capital adequacy levels were high. Looking
forward, therefore, although a few banks might run into problems, the vast majority would be
able to handle shocks without much difficulty.
30.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ decision to unwind regulatory forbearance. The
mission noted, however, that grandfathered loans would require close monitoring and an
eventual return to stricter standards. The authorities concurred, but emphasized the

21
importance of avoiding abrupt changes to provisioning or classification requirements. In this
regard, they pointed out that most grandfathered loans had a relatively limited maturity, and
so would naturally cease to benefit from forbearance in the near future.
31.
The authorities and staff agreed that the CBR should be afforded greater
supervisory powers. They concurred that priority should be given to enhancing the CBR’s
authority to conduct consolidated supervision—including over connected lending.
Strengthening regulations on connected lending would be critical to compel appropriate
disclosure, ensure that suitable (market) terms are applied to such loans, and enable the
imposition of sanctions. The authorities noted that relevant legislation had been drafted or
was under preparation in these areas, and that they were proactively analyzing the extent of
connected lending in the banking system.
D. Reinvigorating Structural Reforms
Improving the investment climate remains the overarching structural reform priority for
Russia. Absent reform, and in an environment of moderate oil price increases, potential
growth is likely to be low.
32.
Russia’s economy remains heavily dependent on primary commodities. Structural
reforms have stalled in recent years, although there are increasing calls to modernize the
economy and reduce its dependence on oil. Russia’s nontradable sector is vulnerable to
overheating, given its low capacity, while the tradable sector has stagnated in recent years.
The crisis has further increased the dominance of the state in Russia’s economy, and
reducing inefficient and weak enterprises’ dependence on state support, accompanied by
significant restructuring, will be a central, yet difficult, challenge in the years ahead.
33.
Staff raised concerns that potential growth could remain low absent structural
reforms. Russia’s labor force is shrinking and its demographic trends are not auspicious.
Moreover, the unfavorable investment climate—confirmed by Russia’s low ranking on
international comparisons in this area—suggests that investment is likely to remain more
subdued than in the pre-crisis years. Finally, the scope for further catch-up gains in
productivity will inevitably decline over time. These factors point to the need for deep
restructuring of the economy, which can only begin once the investment climate is
significantly improved.
34.
In this context, staff stressed that the key structural reform priority is to
improve the investment climate. Civil service and public administration reforms are needed
to curtail the pervasive influence of government on economic decision making. Other
reforms would help assure investors that property rights will be protected and that the playing
field for investing is level. Moreover, moving ahead with the recently announced
privatization program would be a useful step toward rolling back the increased state
dominance of the past few years. Finally, WTO accession—alongside a reversal of crisis-

22
related emergency trade measures—holds the promise of making the investment environment
more predictable and rules-based, while reducing dependence on primary commodity sectors.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
The stabilization fund mechanism allowed a forceful response to the crisis. The
pre-crisis policy of taxing and saving much of the oil windfall and the attendant large
increase in reserves left significant scope for a vigorous response. Policy-makers took full
advantage of the room for maneuver by providing a dramatic countercyclical fiscal stimulus,
supported by monetary accommodation as the fiscal deficit was monetized. Moreover, they
helped the private sector cover large unhedged foreign exchange exposures by providing
massive liquidity injections and easing lending criteria, and above all by allowing a
substantial reserve loss, before undertaking a large step-devaluation well into the crisis. This
almost certainly averted severe distress in the banking system. Undoubtedly, the crisis has
shown that the stabilization fund mechanism is serving Russia very well.
36.
Looking forward, the main challenge is fiscal consolidation. With cyclical
conditions set to gradually normalize, and with lower potential growth, the authorities should
plan on fully withdrawing the large fiscal stimulus in the coming years. Given the scale of
this stimulus—some 9 percent of GDP—striking an appropriate balance between short-term
cyclical considerations and medium-term consolidation suggests that the withdrawal should
have begun already in 2010. The further increase in the federal government’s nonoil balance
implied by the supplementary budget is, therefore, regrettable, and another supplement in the
fall should be avoided. More worrisome, with most of the stimulus having taken the form of
permanent measures—not least higher pensions—advancing long-stalled public sector
reforms is now becoming critical to preventing renewed overheating and excessive real
appreciation as private demand recovers. The continued lack of support for such reforms and
the prospect of only limited, if any, progress before the 2011-12 elections pose major and
increasing risks to macroeconomic stability going forward.
37.
The fiscal framework needs to be strengthened. Supplementary budgets have been
adopted every year since the 1998 crisis—in some years there have been several such
budgets. With the exceptions of the recent crisis, the change implied by the supplementary
budgets have, since 2004, invariably run counter to what would have been required from a
cyclical perspective. Thus, to ensure an effective countercyclical fiscal stance and anchor
fiscal policy over the medium term, the authorities should eschew the use of supplementary
budgets, and firmly focus annual and medium-term budgets on the nonoil deficit.
38.
Monetary policy should give priority to controlling inflation, not the exchange
rate. The monetary easing cycle has appropriately been put on hold, and the next move
should likely involve initiating a tightening cycle. The increased flexibility of the exchange
rate during the past year is much welcome. However, the commitment to a flexible exchange
rate policy remains to be tested in an environment that involves a sharper trade-off between
inflation and the nominal exchange rate objectives. The mission’s discussions suggest that

23
the CBR is still not ready to commit fully to giving priority to inflation control. Risks in this
regard would increase significantly going forward absent decisive action to reduce public
expenditures.
39.
Strengthening banking supervision is critical. Much progress has been achieved
already, but loan risk assessment should be strengthened further and provisioning should be
made more forward-looking. Moreover, the CBR should be afforded greater supervisory
powers, particularly with respect to consolidated supervision and connected lending, which
remains a potentially serious threat. Given the significant stock of international reserves, the
authorities are well-positioned to continue to handle emerging threats to financial stability.
Staff’s main concern is that failure to decisively deal with the overhang of nonperforming
and restructured loans will deter economic growth by hampering banks’ ability to expand
credit on a sustained basis and by directing available resources to struggling clients, away
from dynamic enterprises seeking to boost investment.
40.
A key priority remains reinvigorating structural reforms. With a shrinking labor
force, adverse demographic trends, an unfavorable investment climate, and inevitably
declining scope for further catch-up gains in productivity, post-crisis potential output growth
is likely to be lower than pre-crisis levels. This points to the need for rapid and decisive
action to advance structural reforms, with a focus on improving the investment climate and
boosting the potential for productivity gains. Progress toward WTO accession is therefore
welcome, as it, coupled with a reversal of emergency trade restrictions imposed during the
crisis, would help to make the investment environment more predictable and rules-based.
41.
The overarching challenge facing Russia is to ensure that consumption of its
immense oil wealth does not get ahead of the expansion of its still-limited productive
capacity outside the primary commodity sectors. Russia’s record in this regard prior to the
recent crisis was somewhat disappointing as the steady increase in the nonoil deficit in the
face of buoyant private demand, combined with stalled structural reforms, caused rapid real
appreciation and attendant signs of “Dutch Disease.” Encouragingly, the sharp contraction in
output as a result of the crisis, and the prospect—absent another prolonged period of rapidly
growing oil prices—of Russia’s emerging from the crisis with lower potential growth, are
fuelling calls for change. Preventing an overvalued exchange rate by taxing and saving oil
revenues, while moving decisively to strengthen the investment climate, remain key to
modernization and diversification of the Russian economy.

ANNEX I. RUSSIA’S EXPERIENCE WITH CAPITAL FLOWS
Russia experienced large capital inflows in the run-up to the global financial crisis. Steadily
increasing oil prices, combined with a prudent policy of taxing and saving most of the oil
revenue, had significantly strengthened Russia’s external position. By August 2008,
international reserves had increased to almost US$600 billion and were the third highest in
the world. This apparent stellar performance—combined with a very favorable outlook for
oil prices—made Russia an attractive destination
250
for foreign capital.
Russia: Private Capital In flows
(Billions o f U.S. d o llars)

The boom years. Private capital inflows came
largely in the form of loans to corporates and
commercial banks, with a much smaller portion in
the form of portfolio and direct investment.
Buoyed by ever increasing oil prices, gross
private capital inflows increased from around
$70 billion in 2005 to $100 billion in 2006 to over
$200 billion in 2007.

Russia: Credit Growth and Real Interest Rates
(Percent)

Credit growth averaged nearly 50 percent per
year from 2006 until mid-2008, as the
banking system—flush with liquidity from
capital inflows and deposit growth—lent
generously to Russian households and
corporates.

50

Domestic demand growth reached
13½ percent in 2007, driven by booming
consumption and investment. With the
economy at full capacity, real wages rose by
close to 20 percent that year.

Procyclical macroeconomic policies and structural weaknesses contributed to excessive
capital inflows and overheating.


Fiscal policy was expansionary. The general government nonoil deficit deteriorated
from 2.9 percent of GDP in 2004 to 8.3 percent of GDP in 2008. However, the
headline balance continued to show large surpluses as a result of surging oil revenues.



Monetary policy became increasingly geared toward managing the exchange rate.
Rising oil prices and capital inflows put pressure on the ruble to appreciate.

35
Concerned with the impact of exchange rate appreciation on competitiveness, the
central bank intervened to resist these pressures. The resulting policy of controlled
and predictable ruble appreciation encouraged one-way currency bets and speculative
inflows. As oil prices approached record highs and capital inflows surged, the
unsterilized interventions contributed to negative real interest rates and high,
entrenched inflation—which reached 15 percent in mid-2008.


Finally, long-standing weaknesses in banking supervision and regulation allowed
rapid credit expansion and the build-up of large unhedged foreign exchange
exposures in the run-up to the crisis.

Despite these similarities with the rest of emerging Europe, Russia is distinct in three key
areas: (i) the role of oil; (ii) the lower share of foreign ownership; and (iii) the significant
borrowing outside the banking system.






First, as an oil exporter, Russia’s capital
inflows came on top of very large current
account surpluses. This made Russia
especially vulnerable to an oil price shock,
coupled with a reversal of capital flows.

Second, nearly all of the foreign borrowing
by banks and nonfinancial corporates was 300
in the form of wholesale financing
200
(syndicated loans and bonds) rather than
transactions between parent banks and
their subsidiaries. This is explained by the 100
relatively low share of foreign ownership in
the Russian banking system (25 percent)

compared with some other emerging
European economies.

Third, capital did not just flow into Russia through the banking system. In fact, flows
to the banking system were relatively low in Russia, compared to other emerging
European countries. Direct flows to the corporate sector were much more important
in Russia. Large nonfinancial corporates had access to plentiful foreign financing
through both the syndicated loan market and the bond market. Low spreads—possibly
as a result of excess global liquidity and high sovereign ratings—alongside a heavily
managed exchange rate, encouraged corporates to borrow in foreign currency rather
than rubles. In addition, implicit government guarantees made it easy for state-owned
companies to engage in large-scale quasi-sovereign borrowing. As a result, in Russia,
it is the corporate sector—rather than the household sector—that has become heavily
indebted.

36
The crisis. The crisis hit Russia with particular
virulence. The dual shock of collapsing oil prices
and a reversal of capital flows put the heavily
managed exchange rate under extreme pressure.
Given large bank and corporate exposures in
foreign currency, the authorities allowed a
controlled depreciation of the ruble, while
providing significant ruble liquidity. The strategy
entailed the loss of one-third—$200 billion—of
the central bank’s reserves. The economy sank
into a deep recession. One year later, oil prices
are roughly double their trough levels, the
economy has begun to grow again, and the ruble
is appreciating. And capital is starting to trickle
back to Russia.

Policy challenges. Over the past year, greater exchange rate flexibility and low policy
interest rates have helped keep speculative private capital inflows to Russia in check. In the
current circumstances of moderately rising oil prices, these measures should be sufficient to
allow Russia to manage its capital inflows.


The first line of defense against renewed capital inflows should be an appropriate
macroeconomic policy mix geared to containing domestic demand once the economy
recovers. Fiscal policy should be the main tool for mitigating pressures on the real
exchange rate in the face of rising oil prices—it will need to be sufficiently
countercyclical to do so. Monetary policy should be squarely aimed at keeping
inflation low in the context of a flexible exchange rate. Greater exchange rate
flexibility (and, by extension, volatility) should help to discourage speculative
inflows.



Complementary policies will also be needed. Prudential regulations should be shored
up to limit the risks of credit booms. This could include counter-cyclical regulatory
requirements, restrictions on foreign currency lending, and differentiated reserve
requirements to reduce currency and maturity risks. Improved supervision will also be
key—this implies the need for greater powers for the central bank to supervise not
only banks, but also their affiliates. The Russian authorities are considering a number
of these measures.

In an environment of surging capital inflows, standard macroeconomic and prudential tools
may not be sufficient or appropriate. For example, an excessive appreciation of the exchange
rate could damage competitiveness. Reserve accumulation can be costly, and—if not
sufficiently sterilized—can stoke inflation. And a strong fiscal position, particularly if

37
accompanied by low public debt and robust international reserves, can perversely end up
attracting even greater inflows.
In such an environment, capital controls may be a legitimate component of a broader package
of policies responding to surges in capital inflows. However, controls are not a panacea—
they can be difficult to enforce (especially outside the banking system), they can be
circumvented, and their effectiveness is unclear. Moreover, they cannot serve as a substitute
for reforms that allow the economy to respond more flexibly to the macroeconomic impacts
of sustained capital inflows.

Exchange Arrangements: The de jure arrangement is other managed
arrangement—namely, a controlled floating exchange rate arrangement. The ruble
value of a bi-currency basket is used as the operating benchmark for transactions
on the internal currency market. The basket is currently composed of €0.45 and
$0.55. The target boundaries of its permissible fluctuations were revised based on

3
changes in fundamental factors governing formation of the country’s balance of
payments in accordance with the Uniform State Monetary Policy Guidelines for
2008, in response to a gradual transition to a more flexible exchange-rate-setting
policy. Following a period of significant controlled depreciation of the ruble, on
January 23 2009, the CBR announced that the upper boundary of permissible
fluctuation in the market value of the bi-currency basket would be set at Rub 41
and the lower boundary at Rub 26. The actual value of the bi-currency basket is
determined within this band under the influence of both market factors and
exchange interventions by the CBR. The CBR intervenes both in interbank
currency exchanges and on the over-the-counter interbank market to limit daily
fluctuations. The permissible fluctuations may be revised in response to changes
in macroeconomic indicators. As a result of these policy changes and the
continued control of the CBR over the exchange rate determination, the de facto
exchange rate arrangement is other managed arrangement. The Russian
Federation accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the
IMF Articles of Agreement with effect from June 1, 1996, and maintains an
exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
currents international transactions.

ANNEX II. RUSSIAN FEDERATION: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
World Bank Group activities are guided by the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
Progress Report endorsed by the Board of Directors on September 8, 2009. It extended the
CPS period (2007–2009) to 2011 and reiterated the relevance of four guiding objectives: i)
diversify the economy for sustainable development and growth; ii) improve public sector
management and performance; iii) improve the delivery of communal and social services;
and iv) enhance Russia’s global role as a donor.
Relations between the Russian Federation and World Bank Group are evolving in line
with socio-economic conditions. Given Russia’s strong fiscal position up until the global
financial crisis, traditional cooperation activities shifted from financing to knowledge
services. The portfolio declined from 22 to 13 projects ($1.3 billion), while fee-based
services (21 contracts valued at $9.5 million) and sub-national lending through the WBG
facility (8 loans for $154 million to date) emerged as new business lines.
With the emergence of pressure on Russia’s fiscal reserves and external position in
2009, Russia initiated discussions on new financing from the World Bank in FY11-12. The
Government aims to leverage international knowledge to help modernize the economy,
increase the efficiency of public expenditures, deepen the financial sector, and strengthen the
position of Russia in the post-crisis period. Given substantial developmental challenges at the
sub-national level, the federal government has encouraged the Bank Group to continue its
direct involvement with regions. A central theme of the extended CPS will thus be to
undertake more in-depth operations in selected regions in line with demand and the
partnership strategy.
IFC and MIGA operations are in very high demand and they must carefully manage
large exposures (Russia is IFC’s third largest and MIGA’s largest exposure). The Bank
cooperates actively with IFC, not only in subnational lending but also on key development
priorities such as energy efficiency and renewable energy.
Major areas of Bank Group activities by CPS strategic pillars
(a) Diversifying the economy for sustainable development and growth
1.
The World Bank Group is assisting Russia in various ways in meeting the
challenges of sustaining rapid growth, including participation in macro-policy debates,
monitoring the investment climate, supporting public investment and PPPs for growth and
diversification, working with regions to identify and overcome barriers to growth, supporting
investments in priority areas at the regional level, and providing direct assistance to the
private sector:


Macroeconomic policy, long-term fiscal sustainability, and the effective management
of Russia’s large external inflows: The Bank contributes to the macro-policy debate

5
in Russia through the periodic Russian Economic Reports, on-demand policy notes
and knowledge sharing. In addition, there is strong interest in the Bank’s technical
assistance in advising on the fiscal and broader economic implications of oil price
volatility. The Bank has finished a study on long-term fiscal risks and fiscal
sustainability for the Ministry of Finance highlighting alternative fiscal scenarios,
associated risks and strategies for achieving long-term fiscal sustainability. In
April 2008, the Bank of Russia and World Bank Treasury formally signed a fee-based
services agreement whereby Treasury will provide technical support in internal
investment management capacity for a period of 3 to 4 years.


Financial sector strengthening. In addition, the Bank helped strengthen the financial
sector through lending and TA for securities market regulation, development of the
Government’s financial sector strategy, development of new institutional
arrangements for management of government assets and liabilities, (including
reserves and stabilization funds), insurance and banking sector supervision,
assessment of the sustainability of the 2nd pillar pension system, management of the
increasing share of nonperforming loans (NPLs) accumulated through the system
during the crisis, strengthening of banking supervision, and assessment of their
resolution framework (notably insolvency and creditors’ rights system). On a fee
basis, the Bank provided TA to the Central Bank to support payments system
development and monitoring. In addition, the Bank is currently developing two new
investment operations with financial sector content—the Financial Literacy and
Education Project designed to strengthen financial literacy and enhance protection of
financial services’ consumers, and the Microfinance Project designed to strengthen
financial cooperatives and facilitate their integration into the country’s financial
system. IFC responded to the crisis-related needs of client banks through a rebalanced
product mix, combining short term liquidity (particularly trade finance) and risk
management instruments with financial support in the form of guarantees, quasiequity and subordinated debt to strengthen the capital bases of client banks,
contribute to the stability of the financial system and mobilize additional private
investment into the sector. IFC’s Russia Banking Advisory Program worked closely
with investment services and the IBRD to develop new crisis response tools to
address rising levels of NPLs and assist banks with risk management. IFC’s Housing
Advisory Program was refocused to help client banks manage exposure to real estate
and mortgage markets, and conducted seminars on mortgage portfolio management
and analytics for banks and financial regulators. IFC has also committed its first
regional investments in factoring and distressed asset management to support
corporate restructurings and single asset recovery situations. IFC’s longer term
priorities in the financial sector include increasing access to finance for SMEs,
particularly in the regions, promoting financial sector stability and environmental
sustainability, and leveraging IFC capital through mobilization and cooperation with
partners. In May 2010, IFC’s board approved IFC’s investment alongside the

6
Government of Russia in the Russia Bank Capitalization Fund (RBCF), which would
make equity and/or equity related investments to support private, mainly second-tier
banks, with an emphasis on regional banks.


Investment climate monitoring and policy advice: The Bank continues periodic
business environment and enterprise performance (BEEPS) surveys, regional
investment climate assessments (through sub-national Doing Business assessments),
and administrative barriers studies undertaken by FIAS for interested regions. The
Bank can work at the regional level on capacity building and the development of
investment promotion programs for attracting FDI, similar to the initiative currently
underway in Rostov Region. WBI will continue capacity-building activities related to
investment climate assessments.



Contributing to climate change mitigation. At present, the World Bank is discussing
an energy efficiency investment project with the Ministry of Energy, Russian Energy
Agency and systemic banks. The project would assist the Ministry and Agency in
building capacity on energy efficiency matters and provide funding to energy
efficiency credit lines at banks. IFC and the IBRD worked closely with Russian
policymakers to calculate the country’s energy efficiency potential and subsequently
to develop the federal law On Energy Efficiency Improvement and Energy Saving,
signed by President Medvedev in December 2009. IFC and IBRD are currently
advising the government on secondary legislation and related by-laws and institutions
(including at the sub-national level). IFC is currently implementing four integrated
advisory and investment projects to develop the market for investment in energy
efficiency, renewable energy and cleaner production in Russia. The Russia
Sustainable Energy Finance Program provides advisory services and financing to
partner banks to promote investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy.
IFC’s Russia Cleaner Production Program is focused on stimulating investments in
cleaner technologies to increase resource efficiency and reduce environmental and
social impacts in the real sectors. IFC is cooperating actively with IBRD and EBRD
on the Russia Residential Energy Efficiency Program, which aims to stimulate
investment in the energy-efficient renovation of multi-family residential buildings. In
April 2010, in conjunction with the IBRD, IFC launched the Russia Renewable
Energy Program, with a $10 million an advisory component funded by the GEF; IFC
expects to facilitate at least $360 million in renewable energy investment over five
years.



Supporting Government investment and public-private partnerships (PPPs) for
growth and diversification: On-going investment projects support land registration
and the development of a national cadastre for securing property rights and the
development of land markets. The Bank has provided technical assistance on a
reimbursable basis to support the development of PPPs, particularly in St. Petersburg
for transaction and strategic advice on large-scale infrastructure projects, including

7
Western High Speed Diameter, Orlovsky tunnel, and Pulkovo airport. Despite the
adverse investment environment caused by the global financial crisis, Pulkovo
reached financial close in April 2010, with IFC committing over $94 million to the
overall financing package for its own account. IFC and EBRD are currently arranging
an additional $220 million in syndicated loans. The Bank is cooperating with Russia's
Development Bank (VneshEconomBank - VEB) on both PPP joint activities and on
developing a partial credit guarantee of the Bank to VEB in support of its efforts to
raise funding for infrastructure investments. In addition, the Bank supported efforts of
the Higher School of Economics of Moscow to develop an e-learning program on
PPPs for federal and regional decision makers in Russia, as well as in other Russianspeaking countries in the region.


Working with regions to identify engines of growth, develop growth strategies, and
remove barriers to growth and labor mobility: The Bank held two major knowledge
events on regional development strategies in early 2008: an early discussion of the
World Development Report on regional disparities and its implications for Russia,
and Regional Development Strategies workshop for Russia’s regional governments
and other stakeholders of regional development. In addition, the Bank has finalized a
Country Economic Memorandum focused on barriers to growth at the sub-national
level and on issues of regional agglomerations. The development of fee-for-service
arrangements with the regions would provide another avenue for supporting
preparation of regional investment strategies and growth analyses, and provision of
other analytical services. As part of its anti-crisis work the Bank has intensified policy
advice on labor market monitoring and on the design of the active labor market
policies, that also support mobility. Also, the Bank is starting new analytical work on
internal migration in Russia as part of a broader, CIS-wide engagement on migration
issues and policies.



Supporting investments in priority areas at the regional level: The IFC/Bank SubNational Development Program is supporting priority public investments at the
regional and municipal level. To date, eight such sub-national operations have been
completed, including three projects in the Chuvash Republic, two projects in the
Republic of Mariy El, and projects in Petropavlosk municipality (Kamchatka), the
city of Mytischi, and the city of Ufa. IFC and IBRD are working directly with several
Russian regions (Oblasts) to develop three to five year regional energy savings
programs, using best global practices. MIGA can play a role in supporting foreign
direct investment in infrastructure at the sub-sovereign level, including in the
transportation, water and solid waste sectors. Regional infrastructure projects
supported by the Subnational Program are another area where the Bank and IFC
could partner with VEB for joint project preparation and support.



Providing direct support to the private sector: IFC will continue to promote the
growth of the private sector and the diversification of the Russian economy through a

8
combination of investment and advisory services. IFC’s selective medium to longterm strategy is to: (i) contribute to climate change mitigation and develop the
sustainable energy market through financing and provision of advisory services via
the Russia Sustainable Energy Finance Program, the Russia Cleaner Production
program, the Russia Renewable Energy Program, the Russia Residential Energy
Efficiency Program and through direct investments; (ii) invest in Russia’s
infrastructure, especially transport and logistics (ports, roads, warehousing) and subnational infrastructure (especially in Russia’s poorer regions), including through the
joint IFC/IBRD Sub-National Development Program; (iii) provide ongoing support to
the financial sector, in particular by increasing access to finance for SMEs, promoting
financial sector stability and environmental sustainability and through development of
the insurance, pension and risk management industries; and, across sectors (iv) invest
in Russia’s less-developed regions where significant developmental challenges
remain, and support projects contributing to Russia’s economic diversification,
including in value-added manufacturing such as machine building, and in hi-tech
sectors. IFC also aims to leverage its own capital through mobilization and
cooperation with partners, including through participation in jointly financed facilities
to target the banking sector and infrastructure development.


IFC advisory services will continue to focus on crisis recovery and climate change
mitigation: IFC’s advisory programs in Russia are closely integrated with investment
activities and address the following objectives: (a) improving the energy efficiency of
Russia’s economy and reducing its greenhouse gas emissions; (b) building the
capacity of private banks to deliver new product lines, such as energy efficiency,
residential energy efficiency and renewable energy finance; and (c) responding to the
crisis-related needs of the banking and real sectors, including risk and NPL/distressed
asset management, and managing exposure to real estate and mortgage markets.



MIGA will continue to support foreign investors through the provision of political
risk guarantees: Supporting foreign investment in infrastructure, in close
coordination with the Bank, will remain an important area of MIGA’s activity in
Russia. In the financial sector, the Agency will continue to explore opportunities to
support capital markets transactions, including asset-backed securitizations. MIGA
may also continue to promote the role and assist in the expansion of foreign banks in
the Russian banking sector. Areas for potential further involvement in Russia include
manufacturing, agribusiness and services sectors.

(b) Improving public sector management and performance
2.
Public sector management has been a particular area of strength of World Bank
work in Russia, which will be further deepened in coming years. The Bank remains engaged
in supporting programs for modernizing selected public sector institutions, improving
government administration, the judiciary, local self-government, and budgetary management

9
at federal and sub-national levels. The Bank will expand its engagement in regions in these
areas, in accordance with the federal priority for improving public sector performance at the
sub-national level.


Modernizing selected public sector institutions: The completion of on-going projects
will contribute to the modernization of public institutions and improved public
services. These include tax modernization, customs development, cadastre and
registration, fiscal federalism, performance-based budgeting, treasury development,
and a statistical development project.



Supporting the government program in administrative reform: The Bank will
continue its close engagement with the government in the area of administrative
reform at the federal and sub-national levels, including the coordination and
implementation of substantial donor funds. The primary goal will continue to be
bringing Bank and international expertise to bear on the implementation of the
government’s program for administrative reform, which currently places a strong
emphasis on encouraging initiatives at the sub-national level. So far, the Bank has
concentrated sub-national work in the Southern Federal Okrug and regions in the
North-West. A fee-based advisory service supported Khanti-Mansiysk Okrug-Yugra
on administrative streamlining and functional reviews. Similar fee-based advisory
services may also be developed with other regions. Support for public administration
and governance for selected regions which cannot afford fee-based services is being
provided through a DFID Trust Fund which runs from 2007–10.



Providing analytical support on effectiveness of public expenditures, transparency
and accountability. At the request of the Ministry of Finance, the Bank has advanced
work on a Public Expenditure Review (PER) focusing on the overall structure and
efficiency of public expenditures with particular focus on the wage bill and
transportation expenditures. The Bank is also providing advisory assistance to the
Ministry of Finance on the development of a strategy for increasing the efficiency of
public expenditures. The Bank is advising the Ministry of Economic Development on
improvements in public procurement legislation. In close coordination, it is pursuing
a Social Expenditures Review (SER) focusing on efficiency in use of public resources
in health, education and social assistance, with focus on sub-national level.



Supporting budgetary reforms: The Bank will continue to respond to the demands of
the federal and some regional governments for assistance in budgetary reform and the
development of performance-based budgeting. In particular, the Bank is using the
Regional Fiscal Technical Assistance Project to provide support to the MOF in its
transition towards program budgeting principles, in transformation of budgetary
institutions into autonomous entities, and in the reform of the systems of internal
control and external audit.

10


Promoting the reform of local self-government: The Bank will continue to bring
international experience to bear on this vital area of reform in Russia. A study has
been completed for monitoring and assisting the development of local-self
government in rural areas in the Perm, Penza, and Adygeya regions. On the
operational side the Bank is engaging three regions of Russia on practical expansion
of community-based development schemes, providing these regions technical
assistance through fee-based arrangements. A federal-level project is under
preparation to support and strengthen local self government in the weak regions of the
Northern Caucasus. It would also improve the quality of settlement-level social
infrastructure.



Investing in municipal development: On-going and possible future regional projects
have significance for overall municipal development and the quality of municipal
services. This includes the on-going Saint Petersburg Economic Development Project
and the Housing and Communal Services project, which became effective in February
2010. Cultural Heritage II, slated for negotiations in June 2010, is aimed at
developing cultural heritage tourism as a resource for socio-economic development in
the participating regions. Possible regional and municipal subnational projects are
under discussion on energy efficiency and water and heating system upgrades.



Stepping up engagement on judicial reform: Assistance on judicial reform also
involves the coordination of donor funds and special cooperation at the regional level.
A judicial reform project complements the 2007–11 Federal Targeted Program for
judicial modernization by improving the efficiency of dispute resolution and the
transparency of judicial functioning. A complementary grant from the Government of
Japan will provide support to Perm Krai and Leningradskaya Oblast on demand-side
justice sector issues such as legal aid to the poor and juvenile justice. In addition, at
the request of the Chairman of the Supreme Commercial Court the Bank plans to
partner with it and the Ministry of Economic Development to support the drafting of
framework legislation to strengthen administrative resolution of disputes and
complaints handling, as well as individual bankruptcy law.



Supporting anti-corruption initiatives: As a coherent national-level anti-corruption
program may begin to take shape, the Bank may explore avenues of possible
constructive contributions to such anti-corruption initiatives.

(c) Improving the delivery of social and communal services
3.
The Government has prioritized the social sector and social services in its mediumterm program. Given that the primary responsibilities and initiatives for reform in these
services will be at the sub-national level, the Bank will concentrate its focus on the regions.
Main activities include the continuation of work in the areas of poverty, education, and
health. Most recent additional activities include monitoring of labor market developments (at

11
the federal and regional levels), and technical assistance for design and monitoring of active
labor market programs. Monitoring of social trends and project design for improvement of
quality of social services at the local level will be continued in the Southern Federal Okrug
and in other regions under fee-based services arrangements. Another critical area for
improving living standards is provision of housing and communal services. The government
places high importance on improving the performance of the housing and communal services
(HCS) sector and on the delivery of high quality services by communal enterprises, and
closely links service provision with improving the quality of life.


Continuation of the poverty work: In addition to continued cooperation with Rosstat
and federal ministries, the emphasis of the Bank poverty work (in cooperation with
DFID) has moved to the regional level. The Bank is working, and will continue to
work, directly with regions on monitoring poverty and improving social assistance
programs aimed at better targeting. Regional social protection strategies were
elaborated for several regions. A program for modernization of Moscow city social
protection is under preparation. Successful models of cooperation can be scaled up to
similar regions.



Improving the health of the population: The Bank will continue its engagement with
the government on adult health, and the development of a national strategy to
improve the health of the population, with the goal of reversing the strongly negative
trends in premature mortality and morbidity and improving efficiency and quality of
service delivery. The Bank is engaging federal and regional authorities on important
agenda of health financing, health system organization and restructuring. Another
priority is to ensure knowledge transfer on modalities of appropriate risk pooling,
insurance, and sustainable health financing. The Bank is actively involved in
advocacy for public health agenda, including alcohol and tobacco taxation and
promotion of healthy life styles. Advice on road safety is supporting critical measures
to reduce the rate of fatality and injury on the roads. As a follow up to earlier child
welfare efforts and jointly with international donors the Bank will assist in design and
implementation of practical mechanisms for family support, preventive social welfare
and child care at federal and regional level. Additional advocacy, public awareness
and information sharing efforts jointly with government leaders, public figures,
private sector and NGOs will be undertaken in support of critically needed
government policies in this area. The Bank and IFC financed the first subnational
project in the health sector in 2009 in the Chuvash Republic. The development of
public-private partnerships in the health sector could be supported jointly by TA from
the Bank and direct financing by IFC, which will continue to explore opportunities to
finance private sector solutions to health sector challenges.



Modernization and improvement of the education system and vocational training:
Having completed several operations in education at the federal level, the Bank
continues to be actively involved in advising federal and regional authorities on

12
education policies and efficiency in education sector. The main focus of this work
includes early childhood development and all levels of professional education and
training. The Bank is actively engaging federal authorities through demand driven
knowledge services, and providing advice to regions on their early childhood
development policies and vocational education development. In parallel, the Bank is
supporting several leading national universities in Tatarstan and Moscow on design of
their modernization strategies and expansion of international linkages in research.
Regional TA and university work is focusing on improving the quality of local
professional labor supply in order to meet the needs of economic diversification and
increased productivity. In FY11, the Bank is delivering an innovative Financial
Literacy and Financial Education project ($110mln) that will strengthen the ability of
the population to take responsible financial decisions and reduce financial risks for
individual households.


Improvement in the provision of housing and communal services: The Bank’s support
in the infrastructure sector will largely focus on improving quality of utility services
and housing. The Bank has a large portfolio focused on improving heating, water,
wastewater, and other municipal services in selected regions. At present, the main
intervention of the Bank in this sphere is centered around the Housing and Communal
Services project that aims to promote reforms and provide financing in HCS on grant
basis allocated to regions competitively. The project is supported by a $200 million
loan that became effective in February 2010. In addition, the Bank and IFC financed
two projects in the utility sector through its sub-national lending instrument (namely,
wastewater treatment in Ufa and heating system modernization in Mytischi) and there
are a number of similar projects in pipeline. IFC helped develop the mortgage market
in Russia, providing advisory services and facilitating $6.8 billion worth of mortgage
loans from 2005-2008, and will continue to provide relevant products and services
with high developmental impact, including sustainable housing finance and mortgage
finance, with a focus on reaching underserved regions.



Residential Energy Efficiency Finance and Sustainable Energy Finance through
IFC's integrated advisory and investment platforms: IFC’s Residential Energy
Efficiency (REE) Program works with partner financial institutions to stimulate
investment in the energy-efficient renovation of multi-family residential buildings. To
date little investment in REE has occurred in Russia due to regulatory barriers, lack of
experience on behalf of financial institutions, and lack of awareness regarding the
economic benefits of such investment. IFC is cooperating actively with IBRD and
EBRD to maximize the impact on market development. IFC's Sustainable Energy
Efficiency Program makes credit lines available to banks for on-lending for energy
efficiency projects, and provides technical assistance to banks and private companies
in order to raise the lending volumes available for energy-saving projects.

13
(d) Enhancing Russia’s global role
4.
The Bank has a strong commitment to support Russia’s increasing global role, and
assist the country in fulfilling its global commitments. The Bank will continue cooperation
with the Russian government in support of its emergence as an international donor and active
member of multilateral organizations. In addition, the Bank will assist in establishment of
mechanisms and implementation of specific actions arising from Russia’s global
engagements, such as the Climate Change and Biodiversity Conventions, and pandemic
diseases initiatives. Specific areas for Bank’s engagement in Russia are:


Assistance in the formulation of an ODA system for Russia as emerging donor: The
Bank will continue to assist Russia as an emerging donor, and will cooperate on the
establishment of a national ODA system through training/capacity events,
information sharing, and advisory services. With support from the Russia as a Donor
Initiative DFID TF, the Bank is helping to strengthen statistics of development aid,
strategic communications and development aid training programs. An “externally
funded staff development program” will build Russian Government capacity for aid
policy development and aid management. After supporting an Emerging Donor
Meeting hosted by Russia in April 2006, the Bank and OECD contributed to
preparation and delivery of a February 2010 international conference in Moscow on
“New Partners in International Development Finance” that was attended by thirty-two
countries and twelve international organizations.



Providing access to the Bank’s instruments for channeling Russian developmental
assistance: The Bank will remain engaged with Russia on international policy
initiatives developed under Russia’s G-8 presidency, including on Russia’s priority
themes for international assistance—quality of education, improved access to energy
by vulnerable groups, and controlling the spread of infectious diseases. The Bank is
assisting in preparation of Russian contributions to multilateral TFs such as the
Global Emergency Food Facility, the Education-For-All/Fast Track Initiative, Rapid
Social Response TF, South-South Experience Exchange TF. The Bank will strengthen
cooperation with Russia on a program of joint Russia-Bank aid initiatives in support
of economic and human development in Central Asia, including support for labor
migrants, agriculture, water and energy. Russia increased its contributions markedly
to IDA15.



Fulfilling international obligations related to global goods: The Bank and IFC are
committed to help Russia implement its Climate Doctrine, which was adopted in May
2009. It includes a commitment by President Medvedev to cut up to 25% of
greenhouse gas emissions from the 1990 level by 2020, including through increasing
energy efficiency. The Bank and IFC have both submitted applications to Sberbank as
the Designated National Authority for implementation of the Kyoto Protocol
mechanisms. The World Bank’s Rosneft Gas Flaring Reduction Project (the largest

14
Bank JI project in ECA) is expected to produce 6.8 million tons of Emission
Reduction Units (ERU) for 3 years for an estimated US$75 million purchase contract
with Bank carbon funds, while the joint IFC and Core Carbon Group GHG reduction
project under the Netherlands European Carbon Facility would produce 2 to 3 million
ERUs. The Bank will continue participation and support for the Ministerial
Conference on Forest Law Enforcement and Governance in Europe and North Asia.


Linking Russian companies to global markets: IFC and MIGA activities are also
relevant to the expansion of Russia’s global role through facilitation of trade and
investment linkages between Russian firms and global markets. In keeping with its
global strategic objective to encourage investment across emerging markets (SouthSouth investment), IFC will continue to actively support strong, reputable Russian
clients in investments elsewhere in emerging markets. Consistent with its strategic
objective to support South-South investments through the provision of guarantees,
MIGA will continue to proactively engage Russian companies planning to invest in
emerging markets.

15
ANNEX III. RUSSIAN FEDERATION: STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. However, in the context of
emerging data demands for assessing external vulnerabilities, the scope for further data
improvements exists.
Russia is an SDDS subscriber, has a range of statistical dissemination formats, and reports
data for the Fund’s statistical publications. These sources inform surveillance.
National Accounts: Data are broadly adequate for surveillance, but the reliability of recent
quarterly GDP estimates (particularly for 2009 and the first quarter of 2010), and
inconsistencies between published headline GDP growth rates, level series, and seasonally
adjusted data are a concern expressed among a wide range of users, including Fund staff.
This may point inter alia to lags in the revision schedule of the various data formats. The
introduction of methodological changes in the compilation of important indicators, like the
industrial production index, without releasing backward revisions of the series on a timely
basis also impairs economic analysis. A historical revision of the industrial production index
is due to be released in July 2010. Consistent with the new series, a historical revision of the
annual and quarterly GDP series, which will also incorporate the results of the 2006
agriculture census as well as methodological improvements, is planned to be released during
the third quarter of 2010.
The Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) in general follows the 1993 SNA, although
scope exists for methodological improvements in the calculations of volume measures of the
production-based GDP estimates, including estimates of the output of financial
intermediation services indirectly measured (FISIM). The imputed rental services of owneroccupied dwellings are undervalued. Improvements in the coverage of source data are
constrained by an inadequate response to business surveys. The unavailability of balance
sheet data continues to be an obstacle for analyzing balance sheet vulnerabilities.
Price statistics: Data are broadly adequate for surveillance, but time series analyses
involving detailed CPI components are a challenge to perform because of limited time series
data on CPI weights. Monthly CPI and PPI, both compiled using the Two-State (Modified)
Laspeyres (2000=100), cover all regions of the Russian Federation. In addition to the general
CPI index, Rosstat also publishes indices for foodstuffs, non-food products, and services.
Detailed CPI weight data have been made available on the Rosstat website beginning in 2006
and in the publication Prices in Russia beginning in 1995. Since 2009, detailed consumer
expenditure data, used as the basis to develop the CPI weights, are posted on Rosstat’s
website annually. Earlier data on detailed household expenditures have been published in the
following publications: Prices in Russia 2004 and Prices in Russia 2006. Detailed PPI
weight data are not published, rendering time series analysis difficult; however, detailed data
on total annual sales, which are used to develop weights for the PPI, are published by
economic activity on the Rosstat website under the Entrepreneurship section, industrial
subsection. Like the CPI, detailed PPI weights should be published and easily accessible by

16
users. Further efforts to improve the treatment of seasonal items in the core inflation index
and a new household budget survey—which has been under consideration for some time—
could significantly strengthen data quality.
Government finance statistics: For surveillance purposes, the timeliness and level of detail
of the data disseminated can be improved. Data on the economic classification of
expenditures are available with a considerable lag, while the data on functional classification
of expenditure and financing differ from international standards. Historical data on the
maturity structure of domestic and external federal debt are not published, except the most
recent observation available through SDDS. Monthly data on the size and composition of
ruble guarantees are not available prior to 2010. Historical monthly data on foreign currency
debt are not available prior to 2009. In addition, there is no integrated debt monitoring and
reporting system. Reconciliation of different datasets of fiscal statistics (budget execution,
cash flow statement, GFSM 2001 format, SDDS) is difficult. The website where fiscal
statistics are disseminated can be made more user friendly by consolidating all statistical
links in a dedicated data dissemination page, available both in Russian and in English, and
supplementing the data with relevant definitions, description of compilation methodology,
and relevant analytical materials.
Monetary statistics: Since July 2008, the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) provides to the
IMF, in the MFSM-recommended format for the surveys, summarized data on (i) the Central
Bank Survey, (ii) the Other Depository Corporations Survey, (iii) the Depository
Corporations Survey, (iv) the Other Financial Corporation Survey, and (v) the Financial
Corporations Survey. In the context of the current global turmoil, analysis of balance sheet
effects has been hindered by a lack of comparable data on the currency and maturity
breakdown of banking-sector assets and liabilities. Adoption of data reporting in full detail of
the framework for Standardized Report Forms (SRFs), as recommended by an STA mission
in 2007, would provide information on the currency and instrument breakdowns of the
banking sector assets and liabilities. Starting in July 2010, the CBR plans to include in the
Surveys the breakdown of positions by currency.
External sector statistics: While balance of payments data are broadly adequate for
surveillance, and significant improvements have been made to enhance data quality, there
remains scope for improving the coverage of certain components of the current, capital, and
financial accounts. Improving the detail of supplemental data on the financial account would
facilitate the analysis of relatively complex flows. For example, supplemental data on gross
flows of long-term external debt (i.e., drawings and repayments) have been published for
non-financial enterprises and government, but similar data for banks are not available, which
have hampered staff efforts to analyze vulnerabilities resulting from external debt. The
balance of payments is compiled according to the framework of the Fund’s Balance of
Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5) and the CBR is actively implementing the
recommendations of the BPM6. Partial data from a variety of sources are supplemented by
the use of estimates and adjustments to improve data coverage. In particular, the CBR makes
adjustments to merchandise import data published by the Federal Customs Service to account
for “shuttle trade,” smuggling, and undervaluation. Statistical techniques are also used to
estimate transactions and positions of foreign-owned enterprises with production sharing

17
agreements, and these techniques are continuously being improved. At the same time,
Russian compilers are seeking to reconcile their data with those of partner countries.
Improvements have been made in the coverage and quality of surveys on direct investment,
and the CBR is participating in the Fund’s Coordinated Direct Investment Survey.
Headline data on reserves are reported to the Fund and the markets on a weekly basis with a
four-business day lag. Comprehensive information is reported in the Reserves Template with
a lag of 20 days, exceeding SDDS timeliness requirement of one month.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Subscriber to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since January 31, 2005.
SDDS flexibility option used for the timeliness of data on central government operations.
A data ROSC prepared in October 2003 was published on the IMF website on May 14, 2004.
A data ROSC reassessment in June-July 2010 concluded that Russia’s macroeconomic
statistics are generally of high quality. It found that compiling agencies have made significant
progress in adopting international statistical methodologies and best practices.
III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
Data are being reported for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS),
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, the Direction of Trade Statistics, and the Balance
of Payments Statistics Yearbook. Monetary data reported as the basis for publication in IFS
are in the format of summarized surveys rather than in the full detail of the SRFs that present
positions by financial instrument disaggregated by currency (national and foreign) and the
economic sector of counterparty.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Russian Federation
On July 23, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Russian Federation.1
Background
Following a deep recession, the Russian economy has improved, but the recovery remains
fragile. In 2009, GDP fell by 7.9 percent, as domestic demand contracted sharply in the first half
of the year, following plunging oil prices and an abrupt reversal of capital flows that brought a
multi-year credit boom to an end. The economy began to recover in the second half of 2009
amid a pick-up in exports and inventory accumulation. After some temporary softness in the first
quarter of 2010, short-term indicators point to a strengthening of the recovery. While all
components of demand now appear to be expanding, growth is becoming increasingly driven by
consumption, reflecting to a large extent the recent 45 percent cumulative increase in pensions
and other policy support. Inflation has come down rapidly in the context of a large output gap.
Labor market conditions have improved, with the unemployment rate declining and real wages
strengthening modestly. The overall balance of payments has remained in surplus, and the
ruble has appreciated considerably since its trough in February 2009.
The banking system is still under strain and credit is likely to recover only gradually. Until
recently, bank lending remained subdued, amid weak demand for credit and the continuing
efforts by banks to restructure their balance sheets. There are signs, however, that the
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

2
accumulation of overdue loans is now decelerating, and that banks are scaling back efforts to
boost provisions and capital. In this context, credit growth picked up modestly in March and
April, reflecting an improvement in credit demand and moderating credit supply constraints. The
authorities have been exiting from extraordinary banking sector support extended during the
crisis.
Significant fiscal stimulus was provided in 2009, and the relaxation is set to continue in 2010.
The general government nonoil deficit increased from 8¼ percent of GDP in 2008 to 15 percent
of GDP, almost entirely on account of higher spending. However, much of the expansion was
targeted at low-multiplier areas, such as strategic sectors and defense and security. By end2009, the underlying federal government nonoil balance was some 9 percent of GDP above
both its pre-crisis level and the government’s own medium-term target. In June, the government
passed a supplementary budget, entailing a further slight increase in the federal nonoil deficit
in 2010.
Monetary policy has been accommodative amid a more flexible exchange rate. Against the
backdrop of a more stable external outlook and falling inflation, the Central Bank of Russia
(CBR) cut its refinancing rate by 525 bps to 7¾ percent from its peak in April 2009. However,
given the uncertain economic outlook and increased risk aversion that persisted in 2009,
deposit and lending rates remained relatively high until recently. At the same time, the
exchange rate has become more flexible. This has, however, occurred in the context of a
weaker balance of payments and a sizeable output gap, which has reduced the tradeoff
between inflation and exchange rate objectives.
Against this backdrop, the near-term economic outlook is for a moderate recovery. GDP growth
is projected to reach 4¼ percent in 2010, reflecting a turn in the inventory cycle and a boost to
consumption from rising real wages and a gradual resumption of bank lending. However, absent
sustained increases in oil prices, underlying growth momentum is expected to recover only
slowly, causing annual growth to fall back to around 4 percent in 2011. Reflecting the output
gap, still-weak demand, and continued ruble appreciation, inflation is projected to remain
subdued, reaching 6 percent (y-o-y) at end-2010 and 5½ percent at end-2011. The current
account is expected to improve in 2010 before deteriorating modestly in 2011 as import growth
picks up.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ forceful response to the recession, noting that
the pre-crisis policy of taxing and saving much of the oil windfall in a stabilization fund had
created significant space for fiscal expansion, monetary easing, and extraordinary liquidity
support to the banking system, while also helping to prevent an abrupt ruble depreciation. Given
the near-term prospect of a recovery with lower potential growth, Directors agreed that the main
challenges will be to implement medium-term fiscal consolidation, mitigate pressures for real
appreciation and inflation, restore the health of the banking system, and improve the investment
climate through ambitious structural reforms.

3
Most Directors considered that, given the scale of the required fiscal adjustment, the authorities
should begin now to gradually withdraw the stimulus and step up the process in 2011–12.
Directors regretted the recently passed supplementary budget and cautioned against another
supplement in the fall. They emphasized that—with most of the stimulus having taken the form
of permanent measures, notably higher pensions—advancing long-stalled public sector reforms
will be critical to preventing renewed overheating and rapid real appreciation. Directors
encouraged the authorities to strengthen the fiscal framework. To ensure an effective
countercyclical fiscal stance and anchor fiscal policy over the medium term, they advised the
authorities to avoid the use of supplementary budgets and firmly focus annual and medium-term
budgets on the nonoil deficit.
Most Directors stressed that monetary policy should focus on controlling inflation, and advised
the authorities that the next move should begin a tightening cycle. A few other Directors
cautioned that a tightening at this stage would be premature and could lead to a resurgence of
capital inflows and greater exchange rate volatility. Directors noted the staff’s assessment that
the exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals. They welcomed the recent increase in
exchange rate flexibility. Most Directors considered that greater exchange rate flexibility could
help limit speculative capital flows and strengthen incentives for domestic borrowing. A few
Directors, however, thought that the economy is not yet ready to cope with the increased
exchange rate volatility that could accompany greater flexibility, in particular given the country’s
reliance on global commodity prices and the foreign exchange exposure of the financial sector.
Directors welcomed the progress achieved on banking supervision, and recommended that loan
risk assessment be strengthened and provisioning made more forward-looking. They
recommended that the CBR be given greater supervisory powers, particularly regarding
consolidated supervision and connected lending, which remains a potential risk. Given the high
level of reserves, the authorities remain well-positioned to safeguard financial stability.
However, Directors stressed the importance of dealing decisively with the overhang of
nonperforming and restructured loans, which could deter economic growth by hampering
sustained credit expansion.
Directors emphasized that reinvigorating structural reforms remains a key priority, given the
likely lower potential output growth going forward. They stressed the need to improve the
investment climate for private sector activity and boost the potential for productivity gains.
Directors welcomed the recent progress toward WTO accession. They underscored that such
reforms, alongside the policy of taxing and saving oil revenues, remain key to the modernization
and diversification of the Russian economy.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
