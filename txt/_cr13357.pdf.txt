STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND THIRD REVIEW UNDER THE EXTENDED CREDIT
FACILITY AND REQUEST FOR MODIFICATION OF
PERFORMANCE CRITERIA

KEY ISSUES
Context. Since the last Article IV Consultation in 2011, there have been significant macrostabilization gains and progress in structural reforms, underpinned by a Fund-supported
program. At the program midpoint, the economy faces two key challenges: political
uncertainty and strikes in the run up to national elections (due by January 2014), already
creating a visible slowdown; and a transition in the garment sector to higher wages and
more stringent labor and safety norms.
Macroeconomic policies. While adhering to the program target, fiscal policy should allow
for a continued increase in priority investments and social spending. To safeguard
stabilization gains, the current monetary stance should be maintained, as it strikes the right
balance between keeping inflation restrained and allowing for a recovery in private credit
to support domestic investment.
Structural reforms. The priorities for structural reforms going forward are:
(1) strengthening revenue collection and administration capacity, including through
implementation of the new value-added tax; (2) enhancing public financial management,
especially treasury cash management and financial reporting in state-owned enterprises;
(3) reforming the state-owned commercial banks through improved governance, credit risk
management and internal controls, complemented by recapitalization; and (4) boosting
growth and inclusion through better labor and safety standards, improved social safety
nets, and streamlined trade and investment regulations.
Program. The program remains on track. All performance criteria at end-June 2013 (the
third review test date) were met and all structural benchmarks have been completed. Staff
recommends completion of the review and modification of the performance criteria for
December 2013 (to lock-in the recent improvement in reserves). The authorities have
consented to publication of the Staff Report and the Letter of Intent.

CONTEXT
1.
Taking stock. Bangladesh successfully averted the balance of payments crisis that was
foreshadowed in the 2011 Article IV consultation by undertaking combined monetary and fiscal
tightening, supported by a three-year Extended Credit Facility (ECF) approved in April 2012. At
the program midpoint, macro-stabilization achievements and progress on structural reform have
been strong (Box 1). International reserves have doubled, underlying inflation has steadily eased,
and public debt has declined. Progress has been made in lowering poorly targeted subsidies,
raising development spending, laying the foundation for tax revenue increases, improving public
financial and debt management, and strengthening financial supervision. Meanwhile,
Bangladesh’s two-decade trend of poverty reduction continues and good progress has been
made toward the country’s Millennium Development Goals (see Appendix II and Table 1).
2.
Political context. Political tensions and associated nationwide strikes (hartals) have
intensified since February 2013 in the lead up to national elections, which are due by January
2014. Protests were further spurred by war crimes verdicts against leaders of two main
opposition parties and by political gridlock over establishing a transitional government to
oversee the election period.
3.
Program performance. All performance criteria and most indicative targets for end-June
2013 (this review’s test date) were met (Figure 1 and Table 1 in the accompanying Memorandum
of Economic and Financial Policies, MEFP). All 10 structural benchmarks scheduled between June
and September 2013 were completed, with passage of the Bank Companies Act amendments in
July a major legislative milestone.



Exchange rate. The bilateral taka/U.S. dollar exchange rate appreciated by 8 percent from
its low at end-January 2012 through end-May 2013, but has remained stable thereafter.2
Despite appreciating since the last Article IV consultation, the real effective exchange rate is
assessed to be close to equilibrium (Box 2), with the garment sector (which accounts for over
80 percent of exports) remaining highly competitive (Appendix III).



Monetary. Private credit growth continued to slow in 2013 as political uncertainties curbed
the demand for investment, contributing to ample systemic liquidity.3 Bangladesh Bank (BB)
has stepped up its sterilization operations and met the indicative target on reserve money at
end-June 2013 (Table 4). Since then, the central bank has taken advantage of the strong
balance of payments position to build reserves.



Fiscal. Hartal-related disruptions and weak imports over the year led to weaknesses in VAT,
supplementary duties, and other trade-related taxes, with total tax revenue falling short of
the program’s indicative target for June 2013 by about ½ percent of GDP. This, however, was
offset by better control of nonessential expenditures and lower-than-expected subsidy

The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics phased out the 1995/96 Consumer Price Index (CPI) base in August 2013. The
figures in this report are based on the 2005/06 CPI base. Under the revised CPI, the basket of commodities has been
updated and expanded, with slightly lower weights for rural areas, and for food and energy and rent-related items.

2

Bangladesh’s de jure exchange rate arrangement is “floating,” and the de facto exchange rate arrangement is “other
managed.”
3

The slowdown in credit by domestic banks has been partially offset, however, by an increase (though from a low
base) in term external borrowing by the local private sector.

The current and projected structure of external financing does not raise external vulnerability concerns.
Public sector borrowing, mostly on concessional terms, and foreign direct investment are the main sources of
external financing, ranging between 1–1½ percent of GDP in recent years. They are projected to increase
gradually to more than 3 percent of GDP over the long term. The overall net foreign asset position was

costs. Annual Development Program (ADP) project implementation improved noticeably,
executing 91 percent of the initial budget allocations (FY12: 79 percent). Overall, the budget
deficit (excluding grants) is estimated at 4.5 percent of GDP (Table 5), in line with the ECF
program.4
Financial sector. The financial position of the four state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs),
which account for a quarter of banking system assets and include the country’s largest bank,
deteriorated in 2012 but appeared to stabilize between March and June 2013 (Table 6).
Nonperforming loan ratios at SOCBs were driven up by poor credit decisions, bank frauds,
slower economic activity, and the end-2012 tightening of loan classification standards.
Performance at the state-owned specialized banks (about 5 percent of system assets) has
also deteriorated. Over the past few months, stock market performance and turnover have
been subdued as political uncertainties have dampened investor appetite. Recent volatility in
emerging markets has had no visible impact on Bangladesh, however, reflecting its relatively
closed capital account.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
5.
Challenges ahead. Over the next few years, the Bangladesh economy will face two sets of
challenges. Most immediately there are the disruptions and uncertainty associated with the
forthcoming elections. Over a longer horizon, Bangladesh will need to manage a transition in the
flagship ready-made garment (RMG) industry. Minimum wages are being increased, and following a
string of accidents (notably two factory fires and a building collapse), as well as the withdrawal of
the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) by the U.S. in June 2013,5 the Bangladesh government,
business and workers organizations, and international stakeholders have put in place several
initiatives to improve working conditions and factory safety standards in the RMG industry
4

This includes ½ percent of GDP in special bonds programmed for settlement of past subsidy commitments.

5

The direct impact of this is expected to be limited, as the privileges exclude RMG and only cover about 0.6 percent
of Bangladesh’s exports. However, the decision, based on labor rights concerns, carries an important message.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

(Appendix III). As a result of these changes, the RMG industry will face higher operating costs. It may
also face some moderate displacement of external demand as some buyers shift in response to the
industrial accidents. The short-term outlook will reflect the interplay of these two challenges.

migration restrictions in some Gulf countries.
Remittances are expected to remain weak in FY14 and the current account is projected to narrow but
remain in surplus in FY14. Private capital outflows are expected to increase with political uncertainty.
Overall, these developments are expected to lead to a slower pace of net international reserve
accumulation in FY14 compared to both FY13 and what had been previously programmed (but with
reserves starting at much higher level). Following the dissipation of political uncertainty after the
elections, a recovery in investment is expected as RMG factories upgrade machinery and public
infrastructure is expanded. This should create a rebound in imports. Notwithstanding slower
remittances, consumption in FY14 should be supported by higher minimum wages (a decision is
expected by November 2013) and a rise in civil servants’ allowances of about 20 percent (about
0.3 percent of GDP).7 Year-on-year inflation is expected to continue to ease on restrained macro
policies and a slowing economy, but there are upside risks from supply disruptions and wage increases.
7.

Medium-term outlook (Table 7).
Growth and inflation. From FY15, growth is expected to strengthen gradually, peaking at
7 percent and then returning to a long-run growth rate of 6.5 percent after FY19. This trajectory
is supported by the demand and supply-side effects of strong public investment to address
infrastructural bottlenecks, favorable demographics, and reforms to enhance the investment
climate and improve education and skills. Assuming a continued sound policy framework and a
gradual easing of supply constraints, inflation should decline to below 6 percent.



6

The decline in official remittance data may also be masking some capital flight ahead of the elections, as funds are
diverted from formal banking channels to informal channels. This phenomenon is typical in election years, and is
expected to normalize once political conditions settle.

7

Nominal salaries and allowances for civil servants were last adjusted in 2009.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



Balance of payments. Over the next few years, the RMG industry is expected to consolidate,
with smaller noncompliant factories closing or being acquired by larger companies that have
greater financial capacity to upgrade their premises and absorb the increase in operating costs.8
As a result of these adjustments, export growth may still remain somewhat subdued into FY15,
but recover thereafter as export supply is boosted by factory upgrading, improved power and
transport infrastructure, and an enhanced investment climate. Remittances are expected to
normalize from FY15, as demand for migrant labor improves, driven by expected infrastructure
investments in the Gulf countries. High investment demand in Bangladesh is likely to drive
import growth, returning the current account to a modest deficit from FY15. International
reserves are forecasted to continue to rise, albeit at a more moderate pace than that seen over
the past two years, underpinned by foreign direct investment and public external borrowing for
infrastructure.

8.
Risks. The principal near-term risk is an intensification of election-related uncertainty,
economic disruptions and violence, which would affect investment and growth, directly and through
confidence effects (Box 3). Balance of payments pressures could also reemerge if the disruption led
to a loss in exports and more abrupt capital

growth, potentially stalling important gains in
poverty reduction (Box 4). An abrupt US fiscal shock would have some effect through trade
channels, but the impact would likely be limited as Bangladesh’s exports are mainly in low cost,
basic garments with lower income elasticity of demand (as was evident in the 2008–09 global crisis).
9.
Spillovers from India (Box 5). The recent growth slowdown and currency market volatility in
India is expected to have relatively modest spillovers to Bangladesh in the near term. Export
exposure to India is very low and financial linkages are limited. Domestic inflation could actually
decline as a result of the depreciation of the rupee reducing the cost of imports from India.

Industry estimates suggest that up to 60 percent of Bangladesh’s garment factories (accounting for up to two-fifths
of total production) are housed in shared or converted buildings, rather than in purpose-built factories. These would
likely be the focus for compliance initiatives.

Box 4. Bangladesh: Exploring a Tail Risk Event: Trade Shock from the European Union
This box estimates the impact of a trade shock coming from the European Union (EU), Bangladesh’s
largest export destination. To explore a worst case shock, we consider a tail risk event in the form of loss of
preferential access to the EU market through the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). This shock could
have a sizable impact on economic growth through lower RMG exports. Overall, there may be a loss in real
output of about 1¾ percentage points in the first year after the shock.



In estimating the potential impact relative to the baseline scenario, a shock was calibrated based on the
estimated decline in exports. The latter assumes a reversal of the RMG market share gains made by
Bangladesh in the EU following the January 2011 relaxation of the GSP’s rules of origin in favor of
Bangladesh (Figure 2). The shock is estimated at about 2¼ percent of FY14 GDP worth of RMG exports
or about 16 percent of FY14 RMG export earnings.1



The effect of this shock on the external position is expected to be sizable, with both the current account
and reserve cover noticeably weaker than in the baseline scenario (although the impact on the current
account is dampened by the substantial import content of RMG exports).



The attendant loss of income from the export sector is also expected to curb private consumption and
private investment, the latter with a lag.2,3 The impact on real GDP, computed through expected changes
in net exports, household income and private investment, is estimated at 1¾ percent the first year and
an additional ½ percentage point in year 2.4



Notwithstanding this, only a levels effect on GDP is expected by the medium term, with export growth
expected to recover as Bangladesh maintains its significant cost advantage and with GDP growth
returning to the same fundamental path.


Under this scenario, Bangladesh’s external debt distress rating remains unchanged (low risk).
_______________________
1

The rule change in EU’s GSP in 2011 favoring Bangladesh is estimated to have increased Bangladesh’s share in EU’s RMG
imports by 2.5 percentage points by end-FY2013 relative to the underlying trend prevailing before the change. This
translates to about 2.2 percent of FY14 GDP worth of RMG exports.

A national marginal propensity to consume (MPC) was derived from Ghosh, Badal Kumar (2010): Rural-Urban
Consumption Patterns in Bangladesh, International Review of Business Research Papers, Vol. 6, No. 4, September 2010
(available at: http://www.bizresearchpapers.com/3.%20Badal.pdf), by aggregating urban and rural MPCs as a weighted
average of rural-urban expenditure shares from the 1995–96 Household Income and Expenditure Survey.

Reviewing six episodes of export-growth slowdowns since FY2003, it was found that private investment growth slowed
down about one year after the export growth slowdown, with an average elasticity of 0.2.

Box 5. Bangladesh: Spillovers from Recent Developments in India
Slowing growth and sharp currency depreciation in India have raised questions about possible spillovers to the
Bangladesh economy. Preliminary analysis suggests that the net impact may be positive in the short term, but
competitive effects may intensify over the medium term in the absence of other structural changes.
In the near term, Bangladesh is expected to benefit from developments in India through an improved trade
balance and lower inflation. The key transmission mechanisms are (see also table below):


Trade. Bangladesh runs a sizable trade deficit with India: while exports to its neighbor are almost negligible,
India is its second largest source of imports. These imports are predominantly raw materials for the garment
sector (mainly cotton), food and other consumer goods. Therefore, a sharp depreciation in India lowers input
costs for Bangladesh’s RMG sector and reduces the cost of imported consumer goods for households. In the
near term, imports are curbed because of the “J-curve” effect (quantities adjust slowly). Given the bulk of
imports from India are not locally produced, substitution effects should be marginal. Further, direct
competition in third markets is moderate, as Bangladesh’s exports to advanced economies are almost entirely
in apparels (about 97 percent), while India retains a large share of exports in textiles. Given the costs associated
with changing suppliers, the impact on Bangladesh’s apparel exports should be limited, at least in the short
term.



Other BOP flows. Official data suggest that remittances from India accounted for no more than 3½ percent of
total remittances on average over the past five years (though remittances from India sent through informal
channels, and thus not captured in these data, may be significant). As Bangladesh has a relatively closed capital
account dominated by official aid flows, private capital outflows are not a significant vulnerability. Official flows
from India are unlikely to be affected by recent developments and are relatively small anyway, with the most
significant being a US$1 billion bilateral credit line signed in October 2010, out of which US$200 million was
converted to a grant in 2012, with the bulk of the remaining amount yet to be disbursed.



Domestic inflation. Based on the share of goods from India in Bangladesh’s consumption basket, it is
estimated that a 20 percent appreciation of the Taka/rupee exchange rate could reduce inflation by about
0.5 percentage points.1

Over the medium term, if currency trends persist, India could emerge as a formidable competitor for
Bangladesh’s garment exports. While Bangladesh today still enjoys a substantial wage cost advantage versus
India (see Appendix III), India enjoys advantages in having local cotton supplies, a sizable labor force, and relatively
better infrastructure. If the weakness in the Indian rupee is prolonged, India’s garment export competitiveness can
add pressure to the gains Bangladesh has made so far. This reinforces the priorities for Bangladesh to raise worker
productivity levels and strengthen important power and transport infrastructure that are critical for the
manufacturing sector to sustain medium-term competitiveness.

Authorities’ Views
10.
The outlook. The authorities agreed that economic growth was slowing although viewed
staff projections as conservative. They also shared staff’s views on the prospect for weak remittances
in FY14. The authorities were more sanguine on exports, pointing to still-strong performance
through September (although they concurred that the full effects of recent industrial disasters had
yet to be felt given long garment order lead times), and anticipated a stronger recovery in imports
following the elections, leading to slower reserve accumulation from 2014. The authorities agreed
on the growth consequences of the ongoing adjustment of the RMG industry but were prepared to
provide policy support, particularly to small and medium enterprises. They also emphasized the
need to sustain competitiveness in this sector through productivity and education reforms.
11.
Risks. The authorities acknowledged that the risk of election-related disturbances was the
foremost concern. However, policymakers remained cautiously hopeful that a way forward would be
found and calm would soon return. They reiterated their commitment to address weaknesses at the
SOCBs and felt that disruptions from the banking sector were less of a risk to the economy. The
authorities were cognizant of the importance of moving ahead with agreed labor and safety action
plans, but also called for an appreciation of the scale and complexity of the garment sector reforms
required within a short timeframe. They also underlined the importance of the garment industry in
boosting inclusive growth and poverty reduction. The authorities agreed with staff’s analysis on the
nature of spillovers from recent developments in India.

MACROECONOMIC POLICIES
12.
Monetary and exchange rate policy. Program indicative targets keep reserve money
growth at around 16 percent in 2014, remaining relatively restrained while providing some room for
a recovery in private credit growth to finance the expected increase in private domestic investment.
With international reserves approaching adequate levels, BB has room to scale back foreign
exchange (FX) intervention in the coming months but will need to maintain its sterilization
operations to achieve program targets.
13.
Fiscal policy. The fiscal deficit (excluding grants) should adhere to the program target of
4.3 percent of GDP in FY14. This would allow for a continued rise in ADP spending but necessitate
continued restraint on less productive non-ADP capital spending and stronger tax collection efforts.9
Over the medium term, a moderate consolidation path (anchored by reducing the deficit, including
grants, to under 3 percent of GDP by FY18 and keeping public debt on a smooth downward path)
should continue to be pursued, while still increasing ADP spending.
14.
Policy responses for downside risks (Box 3). In case of temporary shocks, such as an
intensification of election-related turbulence, reserve buffers could be used through sterilized

intervention to finance the shock, smooth currency volatility, and avoid a sharp monetary tightening.
In case of adverse shocks of a more prolonged nature, such as a sustained trade shock, the
exchange rate should be allowed to adjust, and BB should be prepared to tighten monetary policy
to support the currency and contain pass-through effects from exchange depreciation to domestic
inflation, while ensuring an adequate supply of liquidity to the markets. These policies should be
complemented with moderate fiscal easing, including the expansion of well-targeted safety net
schemes to protect the most vulnerable.
15.
Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed with staff’s views on the needed policy settings
under the baseline (MEFP ¶3, 9), and the program’s quantitative targets through December 2014
(MEFP Table 1) are consistent with these objectives. Proposed modifications to December 2013
targets were designed to lock-in higher international reserves and further reinforce external buffers.

STRUCTURAL REFORMS
There has been strong performance on the structural reform agenda, which has helped to lessen
vulnerabilities and lay the foundations for sustainable high growth.

A. Safeguarding Fiscal Sustainability
16.
Revenue reforms. A slowing economy amidst hartal-related disruptions and political
uncertainty contributed to lower-than-programmed tax revenue outturns for FY13. With these
influences expected to unwind only gradually, and with somewhat more cautious assumptions about
near-term gains from revenue administration reforms, program projections for tax revenues have
been revised downward in relation to GDP. Thus, the tax-to-GDP ratio is projected to remain flat at
about 10½ percent of GDP between FY12 and FY14, with a decline of revenue from import-related
taxes of 0.4 percent of GDP offset by gains in income taxes, boosted by automation. The revenue
ratio is projected to increase slightly in FY15 and then more decisively beyond the program period
with the launch of the VAT. The revenue reform program is centered on the following elements:


Strengthened revenue administration. The National Board of Revenue (NBR) successfully
launched the automated issuance of taxpayer identification numbers (TIN) linked with the
national identification database (a June 2013 benchmark). As of end-September 2013, more than
530,000 taxpayers have obtained TIN registration, including over 90 thousand new taxpayers,
helping to boost income tax collection. To further strengthen tax collections in the future, the
authorities need to press ahead with the automation process, including through online reregistration of current VAT taxpayers, supported by increased staffing levels (MEFP, ¶5).



Maintain steady progress in VAT implementation. To secure a medium-term improvement in
the tax-to-GDP ratio, the authorities acknowledged it critical to move forward on the
implementation of the new VAT, which is running behind the plan approved by the Minister of
Finance in March 2013. In particular, the process for inclusion of the VAT implementation project
in the ADP took longer than envisaged, but was completed in October (a prior action). The
immediate priorities ahead are to issue the tender for the VAT software vendor (a new

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BANGLADESH

December 2013 benchmark) and to then select the vendor (a rescheduled June 2014
benchmark). The NBR will also continue public consultations on the draft regulations for the new
VAT, issued in September 2013 (MEFP, ¶4).
17.
State-owned enterprises (SOEs) (MEFP, ¶6). Efficiency audits of the three large subsidyrelated SOEs, namely the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC), Bangladesh Power Development
Board and Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation (June 2013 benchmark) identified significant
operational and financial deficiencies. The authorities now plan to focus their efforts first on
strengthening BPC, the largest nonfinancial corporation in the country. Professional staff will be
hired for financial management of BPC by March 2014 and automated financial reporting software
will be adopted by December 2014. A global audit firm, in association with a local firm, will also be
appointed to complete a financial audit of BPC by September 2014 (a new benchmark).
18.
Public financial management (PFM) (MEFP, ¶7). To further strengthen treasury cash
management and expenditure controls in line with Fund technical assistance recommendations, the
authorities committed to institutionalize cash flow forecasting, establish a system of quarterly fund
releases, and develop monthly cash plans consistent with those releases by March 2014. To reinforce
PFM discipline, the high-level Cash and Debt Management Committee issued a decision in October
(a prior action) to limit the amount of government borrowing from BB through the overdraft facility.
This will become effective in April 2014.
19.
Public debt management (MEFP, ¶8). To improve the oversight of nonconcessional
borrowing (NCB), the authorities revised the terms of reference for the Cabinet’s Standing
Committee on Non-Concessional Borrowing (SCNCB) (June 2013 benchmark).10 The SCNCB is
supported by its technical committee, which coordinates information gathering on the nonconcessional borrowing pipeline across agencies. The authorities also requested a Debt
Management Performance Assessment (DeMPA) from the World Bank. Its report, expected by end2013, will help inform further measures to strengthen debt management.
20.
Debt ceilings. The government has identified a revised pipeline of high priority investment
projects in power, transportation, telecommunications, and other infrastructure for which
concessional financing is not available (MEFP, ¶8, also text table below). This pipeline entails NCB for
the period between July 2013 and December 2014 of about US$3 billion. Staff supports this
borrowing program, which remains consistent with maintaining Bangladesh’s current low risk of
external debt distress.11 Continued close tracking of the infrastructure program, combined with the
steps taken to strengthen debt management practices, are expected to focus NCB on high valueadded projects. Consistent with the updated borrowing program, the ceiling on new,
10

The revision aims at ensuring that the SCNCB, previously called Hard-Term Loan Committee, oversees all
nonconcessional borrowing contracts and determines nonconcessionality based on the grant element of the credit.
For more details, see Second ECF Review Staff Report, IMF Country Report No. 13/157 (June 2013).

See the accompanying Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) Update. The authorities had been considering issuing a
sovereign bond of between US$500 million and US$1 billion, but a decision on this has been postponed until after
the elections. A hypothetical issuance of US$1 billion in FY15 is reflected in the DSA’s alternative scenario.

Greater scrutiny of fiscal risks (see Appendix IV).13 Quasi-fiscal expenditures (for instance
subsidy costs incurred by SOEs) should be brought fully on budget through timely transfers, while
contingent liabilities (for instance from loan guarantees, the state-owned banks, and the pension
system) should be reflected in the medium-term budget framework. Liabilities to the General
Provident Fund (GPF) should be fully recognized as debt, and plans laid out for funding the GPF in
the future. The authorities agreed to work on these issues, with Fund technical assistance as needed.

B. Strengthening the Financial Sector
22.
State-owned commercial banks (MEFP, ¶12).14 The special diagnostic examinations of the
SOCBs (a June 2013 structural benchmark) identified significant weaknesses in asset quality, liquidity
management, and internal audit and control (Box 6). To address these deficiencies, the memoranda
of understanding (MOUs) between BB and the SOCBS have been strengthened (September 2013
benchmark), following IMF technical assistance. Going forward, the authorities committed to
restoring the SOCBs to financial viability through:
Enforcement of the provisions in the revised MOUs, including: (i) adoption of a stronger credit
policy and credit risk management policy by November 2013; (ii) formulation of an internal
control and compliance policy for each bank by December 2013 (a new benchmark); (iii) prudent



12

The latter corresponds to cumulative NCB of 3¾ percent of GDP in the three years to end-2014.

13

For more details see Medina (2014), IMF working paper (forthcoming).

To address the weakening performance of the smaller and nonsystemic specialized development banks, the
authorities have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the second largest of these banks, affected by
a large fraud. The MOU aims at improving controls and credit risk management. The authorities also plan to
recapitalize these institutions.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BANGLADESH

credit growth ceilings (an indicative target under the program), differentiated according to each
bank’s performance and financial soundness, to remain in place while SOCB corporate
governance and credit risk management are improved. The revised MOUs also designate
strengthened sanctions for noncompliance.

Box 6. Bangladesh: Main Findings from the Diagnostic Examinations of the
State-Owned Commercial Banks
Bangladesh Bank completed special diagnostic examinations at the four state-owned commercial
banks (SOCBs) in June 2013. Against the backdrop of a deterioration in financial performance at all the
SOCBs in 2012 and the unearthing of some large lending frauds, the diagnostic examinations revealed
significant weaknesses in asset quality, liquidity management, and internal audit and control.
The examinations concluded that these deficiencies were caused mainly by significant governance
shortfalls (mostly related to oversight by bank boards and senior management):
Deficiencies related to asset quality:
 Credit policies not comprehensive, not reviewed regularly, and often not followed;
 No strategic planning for the credit portfolio;
 Loans extended without appropriate credit analysis or proper documentation;
 Problem loans not receiving enough attention; and
 Insufficient control over lending activities at the branches, exacerbated by an underdeveloped
management information system.
Deficiencies related to liquidity management:
 Boards not driving the development or implementation of liquidity management policies;
 Ineffective daily monitoring of liquidity situation; and
 Lack of contingency liquidity planning.
Deficiencies related to internal audit and control:
 Inadequate internal controls and absence of an independent internal audit system;
 Delay or absence of disciplinary actions for major irregularities;
 Non-compliance with certain regulatory requirements; and
 Inadequate qualifications for key responsibilities.



Recapitalization to restore the capital position of SOCBs in line with regulatory standards,
conditional on actions agreed under the revised MOUs and clear business plans approved by the
SOCB boards.



Automation to reduce operational and financial reporting risks at the SOCBs, with a detailed
action plan for SOCB automation to be completed by the Ministry of Finance, in consultation
with BB, by March 2014 (a new benchmark).



Reduced exposure to SOEs, with net lending from SOCBs to the three largest SOEs capped at
zero by a program indicative target. The stock of these loans has been reduced to Tk 24 billion
in September 2013 from Tk 92 billion at program approval.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

BANGLADESH

23.
Contingency planning framework (MEFP, ¶13). To further strengthen the regulatory
framework for the financial sector, the BB Board adopted a bank intervention and resolution plan, as
well as a lender of last resort policy (September 2013 benchmark).
24.
Securities market reforms (MEFP, ¶14). Based on the newly amended Bank Companies Act,
BB issued an order in September limiting banks’ capital market exposure to 25 percent of their
capital (a delayed June 2013 benchmark). Following passage of the Demutualization Act in April
2013, the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission approved demutualization models and
plans for both the Dhaka and Chittagong stock exchanges in September 2013 (a delayed June 2013
benchmark), to strengthen equity market governance.

C. Boosting Inclusive Growth
25.
Critical infrastructure. Promoting high, sustained growth in Bangladesh will require steps
to remove bottlenecks in essential infrastructure, particularly in power, transport and
telecommunications.15 This calls for cooperation with development partners and the private sector
to boost public and private investment in these areas. The authorities agreed to keep public external
borrowing, particularly if nonconcessional, focused on high-priority areas (MEFP, ¶8).
26.
Trade and investment climate (MEFP, ¶17–18). The authorities intend to reform the trade
regime, which includes a complex system of multiple taxes and levies. Also, following IMF TA, they
approved a strategy paper to review the 1947 Foreign Exchange Regulations Act, laying out a
roadmap towards gradual liberalization of exchange regulations with a view to improve the business
environment and attract foreign investment (September 2013 benchmark). In accordance with the
roadmap, BB is committed to reviewing and adopting the necessary amendments to all foreign
exchange regulations and reporting routines for current account transactions by December 2014 (a
new benchmark).
27.
Labor and safety standards (MEFP, ¶15). The authorities are putting in place a number of
measures to strengthen working conditions, particularly in the RMG industry. They formed a wage
board to revise the minimum wage for the garment industry (last revised in 2010), with a final
decision expected by November 2013. The Labor Act was amended in July to improve safety
standards and workers’ collective bargaining rights. Also, a high-level inter-Ministerial Committee
was formed, with worker participation, to examine working conditions and safety in the RMG
industry. With support from the International Labor Organization, development partners, and
international retailers, the authorities are strengthening the labor inspection system, including
through the recruitment of 200 additional inspectors by end-2013 and through safety assessments
of all active ready-made garment factories.
28.
Social spending (MEFP, ¶16). The June 2013 indicative target floor on social related
spending, which includes social transfers and education, was comfortably met. The authorities aim

to continue increasing budget allocations for well-targeted social safety net programs, and
strengthen the efficiency and transparency of all such programs. Steady progress on the World
Bank-supported program to enhance the targeting of social safety nets will be critical.16

MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES
29.
Financing assurances. The program remains fully financed (Tables 8 and 9), underpinned by
a strong balance of payments position and sound policies.
30.
Safeguards recommendations. In line with Fund recommendations from the July 2011
safeguards assessment, BB is on track to complete a full external audit of its FY13 financial
statements by a global audit firm (December 2013 benchmark), having received an unqualified
report from the auditors in August. Following from this, the BB Board will appoint a certified
chartered accountant as an advisor to the Audit Committee of the BB Board (a new March 2014
benchmark), until the committee is reconstituted to include such an expert. The authorities also plan
to engage a global firm to audit BB’s financial statements on an annual basis.17
31.
Request for modification of performance criteria. To lock in over-performance so far in
reserve accumulation, staff proposes to modify the targets for December 2013 for the performance
criteria on net international reserves (to set a higher floor) and net domestic assets of BB (to set a
lower ceiling).
32.
Exchange restriction. The exchange restriction on the transferability of proceeds of current
international transactions through nonresident taka accounts still remains. While the authorities
have a roadmap for reviewing exchange regulations (MEFP, ¶17), it does not provide a clear and
specific timetable for the removal of this restriction. Therefore staff does not recommend its
approval at this stage.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
Program achievements. Bangladesh has made commendable progress in macroeconomic
stabilization and structural reforms, supported by the ECF program.


The economy is in a better position to withstand adverse external shocks, with international
reserve levels now double the lows in late 2011.



Underlying inflation pressures have receded.

16

The World Bank approved in June 2013 a US$500 million credit in order to: (i) develop a poverty database;
(ii) provide support to key Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MoDMR) safety net programs; and
(iii) strengthen MoDMR administration and transparency.



Poorly targeted energy subsidies have been curbed, creating fiscal space to execute priority
development and social spending, while keeping public debt on a downward trajectory.



Revenue administration reforms and the new VAT law, which has moved into the
implementation phase, are expected to modernize the tax system and generate additional
resources over the medium term to further raise development spending, in support of growth
and poverty reduction.



Recent banking law amendments strengthen governance in the banking system and enhance
the supervisory powers of BB to safeguard financial stability.

34.
Outlook and risks ahead. However, the Bangladesh authorities need to remain vigilant. The
balance of risks to growth is to the downside, with domestic factors predominating. The economy is
slowing as election-related uncertainty lowers investment demand and an intensification of political
tensions around elections poses the most immediate risk. An upcoming transition in the flagship
garment sector to higher costs and upgraded labor and safety standards will create further
headwinds.
35.
Macroeconomic policies. Persevering to strengthen policy anchors and build policy buffers
in the run-up to elections and beyond will prove essential to navigate the challenges ahead. The
fiscal policy stance remains prudent and the authorities’ targets provide the space to raise public
investment and social-related spending. Restrained monetary policy since late 2011 has curbed
inflationary pressures and supported reserve accumulation. Reserves are approaching adequate
levels and the BB should scale back its FX intervention but continue its sterilization efforts to meet
its monetary targets.
36.
Fiscal structural reforms. Decisive revenue administration efforts are needed to improve
performance against the program’s indicative revenue targets, which have been adjusted to reflect
the more challenging near-term tax revenue outlook. Given that significant gains in tax revenues
relative to GDP are now expected only in the post-program period following VAT implementation,
preparations for the latter need to advance without further delays. Procurement of a VAT
automation system is now the foremost priority. The successful launch of the TIN automation and
the improved execution of priority capital spending are important developments. Improving treasury
cash management and cash flow forecasting is a priority. The efficiency audits at the three large
SOEs stress the need to strengthen financial reporting and professional management, particularly at
BPC. The planned external audit will be an important step in this regard.
37.
Debt management and fiscal risks. The recent strengthening of debt management
practices is a good step in reinforcing debt sustainability and the forthcoming DeMPA assessment
should usefully inform further reforms. The authorities should continue to seek maximum
concessionality in external financing and all nonconcessional borrowing needs to be focused on
high-impact projects, supported by improved investment selection processes. Such borrowing
should continue to be closely scrutinized and monitored to ensure full transparency and sound
governance. The authorities should carefully follow and report on potential fiscal risks, including
from quasi-fiscal expenditures and contingent liabilities.

38.
Central bank governance. The external and independent audit of the BB strengthens
controls at the central bank and should be undertaken on an annual basis, in conjunction with
reforms to strengthen BB board’s audit committee, improve the risk-based audit approach, and
continue to enhance the skills and qualifications of BB’s staff.
39.
Financial sector. The passage of the Bank Companies Act amendments in July is an
important milestone. Bangladesh Bank should fully utilize the enhanced powers it now has to
strengthen oversight and implement regulatory reforms that address vulnerabilities in the banking
system. The deterioration in the financial position of the SOCBs requires immediate attention. The
findings of the recent special diagnostic examinations point to significant weaknesses in asset
quality, risk management and internal audit and controls. The latest revisions to their MOUs with BB
provide a clear program of action and strengthened sanctions for noncompliance. Strict
enforcement of these MOUs, complemented by recapitalization, will be needed to strengthen
governance at the SOCBs and restore them to financial viability.
40.
Inclusive growth. Removing critical infrastructure bottlenecks is a necessary condition for
sustained high growth. Further streamlining of the trade regime and regulations, including on
foreign exchange, is also needed to improve the business climate. The imminent revision in garment
sector minimum wages and initiatives to strengthen labor and factory safety conditions are
welcome. Progress here would avert the risk of a potential withdrawal of trade preferences by major
trading partners. Reforms to review and better target social safety nets programs should move
ahead, with the support of development partners.
41.
Staff recommendations. All end-June 2013 (this review’s test date) PCs were met. All
structural benchmarks for June and September 2013 were also completed. On this basis, staff
recommends completion of the third review under the ECF arrangement and the approval of the
request to modify end-December 2013 performance criteria. As no specific timetable exists for the
removal of the remaining exchange restriction on the transferability of funds in nonresident taka
accounts, staff does not recommend its approval by the Executive Board.
42.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place within 24 months, subject to
the decision on consultation cycles (Decision No. 14747–(10/96), September 28, 2010).

1/ Fiscal year begins July 1.
2/ Imports are based on customs data.
3/ Excludes official capital grants reported in the capital account.
4/ Data on trade credits include service fees related to exports until FY11. To adjust for this inconsistency, an amount equal to 3 percent of exports is deducted from reported trade credits
and added to current account service payments. The net effect is a decrease in the current account, while the overall BOP balance remains unchanged.
5/ Net international reserves (NIR) reported at market exchange rates. Excluded from NIR are deposits held in offshore accounts of resident financial institutions, non-investment-grade
sovereign bonds, and foreign exchange overdrafts provided by Bangladesh Bank to domestic banks.

1/ From 2007, an adjustment is made to exclude special accounts set up in state-owned commercial banks' balance sheets, which contain the
accumulated losses arising from the difference in market and book value of assets. These amounts are deducted from state-owned commercial
banks' assets and regulatory capital.
2/ New loan classification and provisioning regulations became effective with the financial statement for end-December 2012.
3/ Bangladesh Bank defines return on equity (ROE) as the ratio of net income after provision and taxes to regulatory capital. State-owned commercial
banks' ROE in June 2013 reflect a combination of operating profit and lower capital base relative to end-2012.
4/ Bangladesh Bank defines return on assets (ROA) as the ratio of net income after provision and taxes to total assets.

Appendix I. Bangladesh—Letter of Intent
November 05, 2013

Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Ms. Lagarde:
The macro-economic environment in Bangladesh has improved considerably over the past
two years. We are now entering a period of national elections with the net international
reserve buffer at its historical peak. Despite a challenging global environment, exports have
remained resilient and underlying inflation pressures have continued to ease. While revenue
collection has fallen short of expectations, government borrowing remains restrained, and the
overall fiscal deficit is on target. Moreover, we have increased the execution rate of capital
spending under our Annual Development Program (ADP), and have protected social-related
spending.
Our Extended Credit Facility (ECF)-supported program is firmly on track. We met all the
quantitative performance criteria (PC) and all but one of the indicative targets for end-June
2013. Preliminary data indicate that we are on track for most end-September 2013 indicative
targets as well. We have also completed all ten structural benchmarks due between end-June
2013 and end-September 2013, and confirm completion of all the prior actions under the
third review of the ECF arrangement.
We are moving forward with the implementation of the new value-added tax (VAT) law. The
VAT implementation project has now been included in the ADP, and the procurement
process for automation software and related consultancies has begun, albeit somewhat
behind schedule. In addition, rules and regulations for the new VAT law have been drafted
and are now in public consultation. With Bangladesh Bank’s financial regulatory and
supervisory powers broadened under the newly approved amendments to the Bank
Companies Act, we are now focusing on strengthening the governance, internal audit and
controls, and risk management practices of state-owned commercial banks. These and other
details of our policy program are set out in the attached Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Policies (MEFP), which extends our commitments to end-December 2014.
To protect our international reserve buffer amid global and domestic uncertainties, we are
requesting an increase in the end-December 2013 PC on net international reserves of
Bangladesh Bank (BB), and a corresponding reduction of the PC on BB’s net domestic assets.

41

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BANGLADESH

We believe that our commitments, as outlined in the MEFP, are adequate to achieve program
objectives, but we may consider further measures, as appropriate, for this purpose. In this
context, the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh is requesting completion of
the third review under the ECF arrangement and access to the fourth disbursement in the
amount of SDR 91.423 million.
To ensure strong performance under the ECF arrangement, we will continue to maintain a
close policy dialogue with the IMF and pursue technical assistance, as necessary, from the
IMF and other development partners in support of our reform agenda. We will also consult
with the IMF on the adoption of measures and in advance of revisions to the policies
contained in the MEFP, in accordance with the IMF’s policies on such matters. Moreover, we
will provide the IMF with information in connection with our progress in implementing the
policies and achieving the objectives of the program. We also authorize publication of this
Letter of Intent and its attachments, as well as the accompanying staff report.
Sincerely yours,
/s/
Abul Maal Abdul Muhith
Minister of Finance
Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh

Understanding

Attachment 1. Bangladesh—Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Policies
November 05, 2013
This memorandum updates the May 13, 2013 Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
(MEFP) under the Government of Bangladesh’s three-year Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
arrangement. The memorandum extends quantitative targets, structural benchmarks, and other
reform commitments to end-December 2014.

I.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

1.
Macroeconomic performance. International reserves have continued to rise while
inflation pressures have been abating steadily in recent months, supported by our restrained
fiscal and monetary policies. However, political events and uncertainty in the run-up to elections
are affecting economic activity by curbing investment appetite, slowing private credit growth and
imports. While the external position remains strong, remittance growth is slowing, reflecting
lower outflows of manpower. To ensure a smooth transition through the election period, our
policies will remain prudent, safeguarding the macroeconomic stabilization gains achieved so far.

II.

FISCAL POLICY AND PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

2.
Fiscal performance in FY13. We met our FY13 fiscal target, with the overall budget
deficit (excluding grants) closing at an estimated 4.5 percent of GDP. We also met our
performance criterion (PC) on net credit to the central government (NCCG) by the banking
system at end-June 2013—the third test date of the ECF arrangement. This was no easy task, as
tax revenue has fallen short of program indicative targets (ITs) by 0.5 percent of GDP, led by
weaknesses in VAT, supplementary duties and other taxes on imports. Therefore, to maintain
fiscal policy on track, expenditures were kept under strict control. While implementation of
investment spending under the Annual Development Program (ADP) improved significantly, we
kept subsidy costs and non-ADP capital spending contained.
3.
Policy objectives. We maintain our commitment to a budget deficit (excluding grants)
target of 4.3 percent of GDP in FY14, anchored by restricting NCCG to Tk 242 billion over FY14.
To underpin revenue collection despite slowing economic activity, we will strengthen our tax
enforcement capacity by recruiting new staff; continue with progress in customs automation and
modernization and on-going reforms to boost taxpayer registration. In addition, we will keep
expenditures contained so as to achieve the overall deficit target. This notwithstanding, we will
continue to strengthen ADP implementation—including by utilizing the pipeline of committed
donor funding—and social-related expenditure (see paragraph 16 below). Over the medium
term, fiscal policy will be centered on the objective of putting public debt on a smooth
downward path.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

43

BANGLADESH

4.
Tax reforms. We have made further progress in VAT implementation by drafting rules
and regulations for the new VAT law, and commencing public consultation on them. However, it
has taken more time than expected to have the VAT implementation project included in the ADP
budget. This has caused delays in the process toward selecting a vendor for a VAT automation
system (a December 2013 benchmark, now rescheduled for June 2014), which will imply falling
behind the implementation schedule approved by the Minister of Finance in March 2013. To
minimize further delays, we expedited inclusion of the project for VAT implementation in the
ADP. The corresponding Development Project Proposal was approved by the Executive
Committee of the National Economic Council in October 2013 (a completed a prior action). The
publication of the tender for the selection of the automation software vendor will be completed
by December 2013 (a new structural benchmark).
5.
Revenue administration. We remain committed to further progress in modernizing the
tax administration system. To this end, we automated issuance of taxpayer identification
numbers (TIN) linked with the national identification database (a June 2013 benchmark), with
more than 530 thousand taxpayers having obtained TIN registration by end-September 2013,
including over 90 thousand new taxpayers. We will launch an online platform for re-registration
of VAT taxpayers, by December 2014.
6.
Subsidies and state-owned enterprise (SOE) reforms. We will continue to contain fuel
and electricity subsidies. In particular, we remain committed to keeping domestic average fuel
prices within Tk 10 per liter of international prices, and will adjust prices as needed to keep to
that target. We will continue making regular budgetary transfers to Bangladesh Petroleum
Corporation (BPC) to cover subsidy costs, as well as reducing its short term external borrowing
needs (an IT). Efficiency audits of BPC, Power Development Board (BPDB), and Chemical
Industries Corporation (BCIC), completed in June 2013 (a structural benchmark), revealed
significant operational and financial inefficiencies. We will focus our efforts first on strengthening
BPC, the largest non-financial corporation in the country. We will hire professional staff for
financial management of BPC by March 2014 and adopt automated financial reporting software
for BPC by December 2014. We will also appoint a global firm, in association with a local firm, to
conduct a financial audit for BPC for FY13, to be completed by September 2014, (a new structural
benchmark).
7.
Public financial management (PFM). The central government has continued to fully
fund, through timely transfers, the subsidy costs incurred by BPC, BPDB, and BCIC. In addition, we
have settled BPC’s past-due subsidy-related loans held by the SOCBs through the issuance of
special bonds for Tk 59 billion in June 2013. As a result, we met the IT for June on state-owned
commercial bank (SOCB) loans to these SOEs. To further strengthen cash and expenditure
controls, we will institutionalize cash flow forecasting, establishing a system of quarterly fund
releases and developing monthly cash plans consistent with those releases by March 2014. In
addition, the Cash and Debt Management Committee (CDMC) decided in September 2013 that
any government borrowing from Bangladesh Bank (BB) through the overdraft facility has to be
settled within 30 days. Building on this, and following the introduction of monthly cash flow

44

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BANGLADESH

forecasting plans, the CDMC issued in October 2013 a decision (prior action) to place limits,
effective from April 2014, on the amount of government borrowing from BB through the
overdraft facility.
8.

Public debt management. We will continue to strengthen public debt management by:



Focusing our external borrowing, including the contracting and guaranteeing of
nonconcessional external debt, on projects with a high development impact for which
concessional financing is not available, in order to meet our critical development needs.
In particular, projects in power, transportation, telecommunications, and other
infrastructures will receive the highest priority.



Streamlining debt management processes. In this regard, we revised the terms of
reference (TOR) for the Cabinet’s Hard-Term Loan Committee (a June 2013 benchmark),
now called Standing Committee on Non-Concessional Borrowing (SCNCB). The Technical
Committee on Nonconcessional Borrowing (TCNCB) also continues its work supporting
SCNCB by coordinating information gathering on the non-concessional borrowing
pipeline across agencies. We will strengthen reporting procedures further to keep the
TCNCB informed and engaged in ongoing and prospective negotiations for external
borrowing. We requested a Debt Management Performance Assessment (DeMPA) from
the World Bank, whose report is expected by November 2013. In addition, we will finalize
our medium-term debt management strategy, with approval by the Minister of Finance
by March 2014.

III.

MONETARY POLICY AND CENTRAL BANK OPERATIONS

9.
Monetary and exchange rate policy. As set out in our July 2013 Monetary Policy
Statement, we will continue to maintain a restrained monetary policy stance, anchored on a
reserve money target, to safeguard macroeconomic stability and keep inflation in check, while
allowing adequate space for private credit growth. We have continued to build up net
international reserves, meeting our end-June 2013 target by a comfortable margin. Going
forward, BB will adjust foreign exchange intervention to market conditions, while keeping up
sterilization operations to adhere to program targets.
10.
Central bank operations. A full external audit of BB by a global audit firm will be
completed before the December 2013 benchmark. Following up on the findings from this audit,
the BB Board will appoint a certified chartered accountant as an advisor to the Audit Committee
of the BB Board by March 2014 (a new structural benchmark), until the Audit Committee is
reconstituted to include such an expert. We will also continue to engage a global firm to audit
BB’s financial statements on an annual basis.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

IV.

FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORMS

11.
Banking system supervision. As a centerpiece of our efforts to strengthen the banking
system, amendments to the Bank Companies Act (BCA) were approved by Parliament in July
2013. Following this, BB issued an order in September 2013 limiting banks’ capital market
exposure to 25 percent of their capital, as set out in the newly amended BCA (a June 2013
benchmark, delayed due to lagged passage of the amendments).
12.
Strengthening the SOCBs. A key focus of our financial sector policies will be the
strengthening of the governance, credit risk management, and balance sheets of the SOCBs. To
this end, several measures are being undertaken:


Revised MOUs. BB completed special diagnostic examinations of the SOCBs in June 2013
(a structural benchmark), which identified significant weaknesses in asset quality, liquidity
management, and internal audit and control. To address these deficiencies, we have
revised the memoranda of understanding (MOUs) between BB and the SOCBS (a
September 2013 benchmark). The revised MOUs provide for the bank boards to adopt,
among others, a stronger credit policy and credit risk management policy by November
2013 (in line with BB’s credit risk management guidelines) and independent internal audit
programs. The boards of the SOCBs will formulate an internal control and compliance
policy for these banks by December 2013 (a new structural benchmark). Prudent credit
growth ceilings, differentiated according to each bank’s performance and financial
soundness, will remain while their corporate governance and credit risk management are
improved. We are committed to imposing the strengthened range of sanctions provided
for in the revised MOUs in case of noncompliance.



Recapitalization. We intend to gradually restore the capital position of SOCBs in line with
regulatory capital adequacy standards, conditional on progress on actions agreed under
the revised MOUs and clearly laid out new business plans approved by the SOCB boards.



Automation. To reduce operational and financial reporting risks, we will initiate an
automation plan for SOCB branches. A detailed action plan for automation will be
completed by the Ministry of Finance, in consultation with BB, by March 2014 (a new
structural benchmark).

13.
Contingency planning. To strengthen the financial sector framework, the BB Board
adopted a bank intervention and resolution plan, as well as a lender of last resort policy
(September 2013 benchmark). These papers set out detailed roadmaps for full-fledged
implementation of these policies by December 2014.
14.
Securities markets reforms. Following passage of the Demutualization Act in April 2013,
the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission approved demutualization models and

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BANGLADESH

plans for both Dhaka and Chittagong stock exchanges in September 2013 (a June 2013
benchmark).

V.

REFORMS TO BOOST GROWTH AND INCLUSION

15.
Labor and safety standards. We have formed a minimum wage board to revise the
minimum wage for the garment industry, with a final decision expected by November 2013. In
response to the Rana Plaza tragedy, we formed a high-level inter-Ministerial Committee, with
worker participation, to examine working conditions and safety in the ready-made garment
industry. In line with commitments set out in a joint statement signed in May, including employers’
and workers’ organizations, we have amended the Labor Act (in July) to improve safety standards
and workers’ collective bargaining rights. With support from the International Labour Organization,
development partners, and international retailers, we are also strengthening the labor inspection
system, including through the recruitment of 200 additional inspectors by end-2013 and through
safety assessments of all active ready-made garment factories.
16.
Social safety nets. We comfortably met the IT for June 2013 on social-related spending.
Under the ECF, we will continue to increase budget allocations for well targeted social safety net
programs, and strengthen the efficiency and transparency of all social safety net programs, with
support from the World Bank and other development partners.
17.
Reforms to foreign exchange regulations. With a view to facilitating business
operations and attract foreign investment, we have prepared a strategy paper laying out the
roadmap towards gradual liberalization of exchange regulations on current and capital account.
As a significant step in this direction, BB will review and adopt the necessary amendments to all
foreign exchange regulations and reporting routines for current account transactions by
December 2014 (a new structural benchmark).
18.
Trade and investment climate reforms. In line with our commitment to strengthen the
trade and investment climate, we will give special attention to the trade regime, which includes a
complex system of multiple taxes and levies. Our future trade liberalization program will focus on
reducing the dispersion and average level of protection; streamlining customs and border
procedures; and introducing a more efficient duty drawback system.

VI.

PROGRAM MONITORING

19.
Progress under our program will continue to be monitored through PCs and ITs,
structural benchmarks, and other necessary measures, with semi-annual program reviews.
Quantitative PCs and ITs for December 2013 and for March, June, September, and December
2014 are set out in Table 1, and structural benchmarks are set out in Table 2. They are guided by
the attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding, as amended. The fourth and fifth
reviews are expected to take place on or after May 1, 2014 and November 1, 2014.

Attachment 2. Bangladesh—Technical Memorandum of
Understanding
November 05, 2013

1.
This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) defines the variables subject to
quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
arrangement, as specified in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP). It also
describes the methods to be used to assess program performance and information requirements
to ensure adequate monitoring of the targets.
2.
Under the ECF arrangement, the program exchange rate is Bangladesh taka (Tk) 74.23 per
U.S. dollar, as agreed at the time of approval of the ECF arrangement in April 2012. Foreign
currency accounts denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and monetary gold will
first be valued in U.S. dollars as at the exchange rates and gold prices prevailing on June 30, 2011,
and then be converted to Bangladesh taka.
3.
The data listed in Table 1 will be provided for monitoring performance under the program
based on data templates agreed with IMF staff. Under each section, reporting responsibilities are
indicated. The best available data will be submitted, so that any subsequent data revisions will not
lead to a breach of quantitative performance criteria or benchmarks. All revisions to data will be
promptly reported to IMF staff.
I.

QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AND INDICATIVE TARGETS

4.
Quantitative performance criteria for end-December 2013 and end-June 2014 and
quarterly indicative targets for end-March 2014, end-September 2014, and end-December 2014
are set out in Table 1 of the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies. The continuous
performance criteria for each specific period are also set out in this table, and will be monitored
continuously during these periods.
5.

Performance criteria under the ECF arrangement have been established with respect to a:



Floor on the level of net international reserves of Bangladesh Bank (BB), calculated as an
end-of-period stock;



Ceiling on the level of net domestic assets of BB, calculated as an end-of-period stock;
and



Ceiling on the change in net credit to the central government from the banking system,
calculated as a cumulative flow from the beginning of the fiscal year (FY) (i.e., FY14 is
July 1, 2013–June 30, 2014).

B. Net International Reserves of Bangladesh Bank
14.
A floor applies to the level of net international reserves (NIR) of BB. The floor on NIR of BB
will be adjusted upward (downward) by the amount of budget support from bilateral and
multilateral agencies in excess (short) of the programmed level. The floor on NIR of BB will be
adjusted upward by the amount of suppliers’ credit and other short-term financing for oil imports

be notified to the IMF immediately and used to adjust monetary aggregates by an equivalent
amount, as deemed appropriate. Other NFA of BB includes:


Foreign assets related to holdings of foreign currency deposits and securities not included
in NIR of BB, and loans, shares, financial derivatives, or other accounts receivable with
nonresidents (including BB’s blocked account with the Central Bank of Iraq and deposits

and other short-term financing for oil imports, calculated cumulatively since end-June 2011, in
excess of the programmed level and by the amount of net lending by the central government to
the BPC and the BPDB short of the programmed level. The ceiling on NCCG by the banking
system excludes special bonds issued by the central government to the SOCBs for the
securitization of loans made by these banks to the BPC prior to FY12 to cover shortfalls in
government budgetary transfers for fuel subsidy-related costs incurred by the BPC. From March
2013, the ceiling on NCCG by the banking system will be adjusted downward by the amount of
budgetary transfers for settling fertilizer subsidy commitments incurred in FY12 short of the
programmed level. This ceiling will be removed from September 2013. From December 2013, the
ceiling on NCCG by the banking system will be adjusted upward (downward) by the amount of
budgetary transfers in FY14, calculated cumulatively from the beginning of the fiscal year, for

A.

EXTERNAL DEBT

Medium- and Long-Term External Debt

27.
A continuous ceiling applies to new nonconcessional external debt with nonresidents with
original maturities of more than one year contracted by the public sector and/or guaranteed by
the central government or BB. The ceiling applies to debt and commitments contracted or
guaranteed for which value has not yet been received. This applies to private debt for which
official guarantees have been extended and which, therefore, constitutes a contingent liability of
the central government or BB.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

55

BANGLADESH

28.
For program monitoring purposes, the definition of debt is set out in Point 9 of the
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt in Fund Arrangement Executive
Board Decision No. 6230-(79/140), as subsequently amended, including by Executive Board
Decision No. 14416-(09-91), effective December 1, 2009 (see Annex I). External debt is defined by
the residency of the creditor, excluding any taka-denominated treasury bonds and any U.S. dollardenominated bonds issued by the central government’s Directorate of National Savings that are
held by nonresidents (see TMU paragraph 29).
29.
Excluded from the ceiling are (i) the use of IMF resources; (ii) concessional debts; (iii) debts
incurred to restructure, refinance, or prepay existing debts, to the extent that such debt is incurred
on more favorable terms than the existing debt and up to the amount of the actually
restructured/refinanced/prepaid debt; (iv) any taka-denominated treasury bonds held by
nonresidents; and (v) any U.S. dollar-denominated bonds issued by the central government’s
Directorate of National Savings that are held by nonresidents.
30.
For program purposes, the guarantee of a debt arises on any explicit legal obligation of
the central government or BB to service debt in the event of nonpayment by the main obligor
(involving payments in cash or in kind).
31.
For program purposes, a debt is concessional if it includes a grant element of at least
35 percent, calculated as follows: the grant element of a debt is the difference between the net
present value (NPV) of debt and its nominal value, expressed as a percentage of the nominal
value of the debt. The NPV of debt at the time of its contracting is calculated by discounting the
future stream of payments of debt service due on this debt. The discount rate used for this
purpose is 5 percent.
B.

Short-Term External Debt

32.
A continuous ceiling applies to new nonconcessional debt with nonresidents with original
maturities of up to and including one year contracted by the public sector and/or guaranteed by
the central government or BB. The ceiling applies to debt and commitments contracted or
guaranteed for which value has not yet been received. This applies to private debt for which
official guarantees have been extended and which, therefore, constitute a contingent liability of
the central government or BB.
33.
For program monitoring purposes, the definition of debt is set out in Point 9 of the
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt in Fund Arrangement approved
by the Executive Board Decision No. 6230-(79/140), as subsequently amended, including by
Executive Board Decision No. 14416-(09-91), effective December 1, 2009 (see Annex I). External
debt is defined by the residency of the creditor, excluding any taka-denominated treasury bills or
BB bills held by nonresidents (see TMU paragraph 34).
34.
Excluded from the ceiling are (i) debts classified as international reserve liabilities of BB;
(ii) debts incurred to restructure, refinance, or prepay existing debts, to the extent that such debt

56

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BANGLADESH

is incurred on more favorable terms than the existing debt and up to the amount of the actually
restructured/refinanced/prepaid debt; (iii) taka-denominated treasury bills and BB bills held by
nonresidents; (iv) concessional debts; (v) normal import financing; (vi) suppliers’ credit and other
short-term financing for oil imports from the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) and other official
entities; and (vii) forward contracts, foreign currency swaps, other futures market contracts, and
short-term liabilities of the banking system. A financing arrangement for imports is considered to
be “normal” when the credit is self-liquidating.
C. Suppliers’ Credit and Other Short-Term Financing for Oil Imports
35.
A ceiling applies on the net change in suppliers’ credit and other short-term financing for
oil imports.
36.
For program monitoring purposes, suppliers’ credit is defined in Annex I. Other short-term
financing for oil imports comprises financing received for this purpose from the IsDB and other
official entities and through syndicated loans, which is contracted by the public sector and/or
guaranteed by the central government or BB.
VI. EXTERNAL PAYMENT ARREARS
37.
A continuous ceiling applies on the accumulation of new external payments arrears by the
public sector.
38.
For program monitoring purposes, external payments arrears comprise external debt and
debt-service obligations (principal and interest) that have not been paid at the time they are due,
as specified in the contractual agreements. However, for program purposes, overdue debt and
debt-service obligations that are in dispute will not be considered as external payment arrears.

Annex I. Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt
Excerpt from Executive Board Decision No. 6230-(79/140), subsequently amended, including by
Executive Board Decision No. 14416-(09-91), effective December 1, 2009.
9.
(a)
For the purpose of this guideline, the term “debt” will be understood to mean a
current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the
provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the
obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at
some future point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities
incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows:
(i)
loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the
basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future
(including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans and buyers’ credits) and
temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans
under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by
repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase
agreements and official swap arrangements);
(ii)
suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to
defer payments until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or
services are provided; and
(iii)
leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the
lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are
usually shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while the lessor
retains the title to the property. For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the
present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be
made during the period of the agreement excluding those payments that cover
the operation, repair or maintenance of the property.
(b)
Under the definition of debt set out in point 9 (a) above, arrears, penalties, and
judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual
obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is
not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to
debt.

Reinforcing the pro-poor nature of growth,
inequality (as measured by the Gini coefficient of consumption) remained broadly stable during
2000–2010, a decade when Bangladesh experienced accelerating growth. All this was achieved in
conjunction with improvements in a number of social indicators (Table 1), with Bangladesh
standing out on several fronts when compared to the averages in the South Asia region and lowincome countries.

This poverty headcount rate is based on Bangladesh’s national poverty line (also known as upper poverty line),
defined in monetary terms as the income needed to provide for sufficient caloric intake based on the 2010
Household Income and Expenditure Survey, and was about US$1.11 per day. The poverty headcount rate using the
World Bank’s US$1.25 per day (PPP-2005) showed a broadly similar declining trend over the past two decades,
from almost 70 percent of the population in the early 1990s to 43.3 percent by 2010.

Several factors have contributed to Bangladesh’s strong performance on poverty reduction
over the past two decades.


First, Bangladesh has broadly seen sustained economic growth over the period, albeit not as
rapid as the fastest growing frontier Asian economies. Part of the growth in incomes was
supported by rising worker remittances (with over 8 million Bangladeshis working abroad)
which now account for over 11 percent

growth more pro-poor and inclusive,
notwithstanding also impressive poverty
reduction in urban areas.3 Gains from rural poverty reduction were particularly evident during
2005–2010, driven in part by enhanced policy focus on agriculture and rural development, the
effects from the exogenous commodity food price increase that raised real wages in the
predominantly agricultural western regions, and in-migration from the western to the eastern
divisions (thus reducing surplus rural labor supply).



Second, over this period Bangladesh has seen significant improvements in the condition of
women. For this, policies have helped, including through the development of microcredit
(Grameen Bank’s loans, for instance, are targeted mainly at women) and family-planning
programs introduced after Bangladesh’s independence, which reduced fertility rates and
raised the status of women within the household by increasing their influence over household
size. The rise of the labor-intensive textile and garment industry, which has created almost
4 million unskilled and low-skilled jobs, with about 80 percent of workers being women, has
also been a reinforcing factor.



Third, the government has maintained basic social spending programs that have endured,
working in coordination with international and domestic development partners including
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Relative to other South Asian countries, social safety
net (SSN) spending as a share of GDP in Bangladesh4 is comparable to India, but higher than

Social safety net expenditures in the South Asia region ranged from about 0.8 percent of GDP in Sri Lanka to
about 2 percent of GDP in Bangladesh and India (based on 2010–11 estimates).

Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka (International Monetary Fund, 2012). These SSN programs
address poverty from a multifaceted perspective, including through education, health,
nutrition, employment, and disaster response, and were estimated to have reached almost
40 percent of the poorest quintile based on Bangladesh’s 2010 Household Income and
Expenditure Survey (HIES). A major portion of the support has gone to food assistance
covered through direct feeding programs, followed by cash transfer programs (including the
flagship Employment Generation Program for the Poorest that was set up in response to the
2008 food price crisis). The work of home-grown NGOs in Bangladesh has been another
influential factor in poverty reduction, with a number of them (e.g., BRAC, now the largest
NGO in the world) able to scale up operations since Bangladesh’s independence and work
successfully in partnership with the government.

While favorable economic growth helped reduce poverty systematically, overall inequality
rose till the mid-1990s as the country started to industrialize and urbanize, but has since
broadly stabilized, with internal regional inequality now a focus. Overall inequality trends
have broadly stabilized, driven by some decline in urban inequality following rapid growth in the
services sector where many of the urban poor were employed (Paci and Sasin, 2008).
Notwithstanding this, inequality remains a pressing government concern, as underlying the
national poverty story are significant differences between geographical regions, a phenomenon
known as the “East-West divide” (World Bank,

(FY2011–15) and reinforces the need for greater infrastructure connectivity for the economically
isolated southwest divisions (exemplified by the government’s centerpiece project for a bridge
across the river Padma, which would connect those divisions with the economic heartland in the
east, reducing transport costs).
Notwithstanding its progress, Bangladesh remains a poor country–with almost 45 million
people in poverty in 2010. Looking ahead, the challenge for continued poverty reduction would
be to achieve sustained high economic growth and preserve the characteristics that have
supported inclusiveness while more effectively reaching the poor by further improving the
targeting of SSNs, with the World Bank’s work on developing a poverty database a key step
toward this goal.

Appendix III. Bangladesh: Opportunities and Challenges for
the Ready-Made Garment Sector1
The ready-made garment (RMG) industry is of strategic importance to Bangladesh, providing
about 4 million jobs directly and millions of additional jobs indirectly. The industry is crucial for
the empowerment of women and economically disadvantaged households, with over 80 percent of
its workers being low-skilled women. The RMG industry started to expand as a result of European
and US apparel buyers moving their sourcing activities to low-cost countries in Asia, including
Bangladesh. From a humble beginning 30 years ago, the RMG industry has become the real
backbone of the Bangladesh economy. While there are several reasons favoring a continued
expansion, key challenges need to be resolved to maintain the strong growth momentum.

A. Opportunities
Bangladesh has two key advantages—cost and capacity.

Capacity. Leading apparel buyers in Europe and the US are now in the process of moving some
of their sourcing away from China because of labor shortages and increasing wages. Profiting
from its cost advantages, Bangladesh has the potential capacity to take over a significant share
of export markets vacated by China. China’s exports of RMG are more than five times as large as
exports from Bangladesh. Production of RMG in Bangladesh could, thus, more than double if
Bangladesh took over 20 percent of China’s current RMG export. Among low-cost producers,
Bangladesh and India have higher current production capacity than other low-cost RMG
suppliers in Asia and more room to expand production further. While Bangladesh still has, like

B. Challenges
Some critical factors hamper productivity in the RMG sector and create hurdles for the
potential expansion of the industry: (i) inadequate infrastructure (electricity and transport);
(ii) poor compliance with international labor and environmental standards in many factories; and
(iii) shortage of skilled workers in general and middle-management in particular. Addressing these
challenges is essential for the industry to remain competitive, despite emerging pressures from the
sharp currency depreciations in neighboring countries, all while boosting real wages and improving
labor conditions.
Infrastructure

combining the effect of the number of required procedures (9), time (404 days), and cost. Likewise,
about four out of five respondents to the World Bank’s 2007 Enterprise Survey quoted electricity as
a major constraint for their business and the average respondent estimated the loss from electrical
outages to about 10 percent of annual sales. Solving the electricity problem should boost
productivity in the sector. Electricity shortages seem likely to be significantly alleviated within the
next few years, as several new power projects are under construction. In the meantime, many RMG
factories have invested in their own generators to reduce reliance on public energy supply.

Inadequate transport infrastructure is also a growing impediment to the RMG sector.
Congested roads, limited inland transport alternatives, and lack of a deep-sea harbor add
inefficiencies to garment delivery times. With growing volumes, the transport network needs
investment to avoid a future collapse. According to the World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index,
Bangladesh scored a low 2.49 on quality of trade and transport-related infrastructure. Among key
competing RMG exporters, only Cambodia had a lower score. Bangladesh is unlikely to become a
producer of more fashionable, shorter lead time items unless it can offer reliable and fast transport.
In particular, a key constraint increasing export (and import) costs is the poor performance of
the Chittagong-Dhaka corridor. This corridor, connecting the industrial districts around Dhaka
with Chittagong, the country’s main port, is currently unsuitable for efficient operation of trucks
loaded with large containers. Most goods are, therefore, transported between the RMG factories
and Chittagong as loose cargo in 5-10 ton trucks. The stripping and loading of containers create
congestion in the port and 14 private off-dock container yards operated by local companies have
been established to reduce clogging. Loose cargo shipments from the factories are packed in
containers at the container yards. To resolve this bottleneck, it is crucial to increase the capacity to
move containers by rail, inland waterways, and road.
As a result of transport and bureaucratic hurdles, the cost to export is the second highest
among key competing RMG exporters. The World Bank’s Cost of Doing Business Survey estimates
the cost to export at $1,025 per container in Bangladesh, compared with $600 per container in many
other RMG-exporting countries. This survey measures the cost of exporting a 20-foot container and
it includes all fees associated with completing the export procedures, including costs for documents,

administrative fees for customs clearance and inspections, customs broker fees, port-related
charges, and inland transport costs. The cost does not include customs tariffs and duties, costs
related to sea transport, or potential bribes.

Compliance
Strikes due to labor unrest and political tensions have plagued the RMG industry repeatedly
in recent years. One of the reasons for labor unrest is legal and institutional failures to ensure labor
rights. The most common reasons of labor unrest are disputes over wage rates and unpaid wages.
Nationwide strikes (hartals) for political reasons also often trigger violence at the factories.
Following the Rana Plaza factory collapse earlier this year, compliance with international
standards on factory safety and labor conditions is getting more attention from consumers,
nongovernmental organizations, and apparel buyers. 2 International buyers are demanding
compliance with their “code of conduct” before placing any garment orders. Despite progress in
recent years, considerable gaps have remained in compliance between good factories and weaker
performers. Many RMG factories are housed in buildings that were not constructed to accommodate
factories and subsequent accidents have proven that several factories have no minimum safety
measures.
In response, the government has taken several measures to address existing deficiencies. The
government formed a high-level inter-ministerial committee, with worker participation, to monitor
working conditions and welfare in the RMG industry. A Joint Statement signed in May by the
government and employers’ and workers’ organizations set out a six-point response agenda aiming
to: (i) amend the labor law to improve safety standards and workers’ collective bargaining rights
(and the amended law was passed in July); (ii) strengthen the labor inspection system, including by
recruiting 200 additional inspectors by end-2013; (iii) start safety assessments of all active RMG
factories; (iv) provide education and training to workers and supervisors on health and safety

BANGLADESH

measures; (v) compensate victims of the Rana Plaza tragedy; and (vi) audit factory compliance with
international standards. Together with the International Labour Organization and the European
Union, the government launched a “compact” to improve labor rights, working conditions, and
factory safety in the RMG industry. International retailers organized either through the Accord on
Fire and Building Safety (99 mainly European retailers) or the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety
(22 mainly North American retailers) are providing active support to the RMG factory safety
assessment. The government has also set up a wage board to revise the minimum wage in the RMG
industry, with a decision expected in November 2013.
Compliance with higher wages and more stringent international standards will entail higher
operating costs and is likely to trigger a process of consolidation. About half of Bangladesh’s
RMG factories, mainly small and medium-sized, would need significant investment for complying
with international standards. These firms typically rely on sub-contracting from larger RMG factories,
operate with smaller profit margins, and lack the necessary financial resources to upgrade buildings
and management. Many of the small noncompliant factories are therefore likely to close or be
absorbed by larger RMG companies.
Skills and education
Skills are emerging as a major constraint for the RMG industry. One out of four respondents to
the World Bank’s 2007 Enterprise Survey quoted an inadequately educated workforce as a major
constraint. In particular lack of skilled middle management is a key factor limiting improvements in
productivity and working conditions. Poor relationships between workers and first line supervisors
are a common source of labor conflict. For jobs where higher skills are needed on entry, such as
supervisors and machine operators, there are insufficient training opportunities. Supervisors need
more rigorous training on industrial relations, human resource management, factory management,
occupational hazard management, and disaster management. Currently the RMG industry employs
less than 6,000 staff (about 0.2 percent of total employment in the sector) having relevant diplomas,
degrees, or higher qualification, and it is highly dependent on expatriate technicians and
supervisors.
Poor education makes skill acquisition and on the job training more difficult. Compared to
other Asian countries, Bangladesh has a low level of literacy and few average years of schooling.
Over 40 percent of the adult population is illiterate. Considering that about one fifth of young
people (15–24 years) still remain illiterate at this time, it may take many years before Bangladesh
approaches average Asian literacy rates.

C. Policy Implications
The government, suppliers, buyers, workers, and Bangladesh’s development partners need to
join forces and work together to deal with Bangladesh’s challenges:


Infrastructure needs require that the government reinforces efforts to boost investment in
critical infrastructure in power generation and transport. Against a background of limited

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

77

BANGLADESH

financial resources and implementation capacity, prioritization and transparency in project
selection and implementation are critical.


Compliance requires investing in new factories and upgrading of existing factories and
management by suppliers, and monitoring and enforcement of international standards by
the government and buyers. In addition, Bangladesh’s development partners could support
compliance by providing financing at favorable terms to small and medium-sized RMG
factories.



Lack of skills and education require close cooperation between the government, suppliers,
and workers. The government needs to establish facilities that provide the education and
training that meet the RMG industry requirements. Suppliers need to improve the human
resource skills of their top and middle management, provide more training for their workers,
and create incentives for workers to develop their skills.

Avoiding nationwide strikes (hartals) is also essential. Persistent strikes slow down economic
activity, affecting most industries, and discourage new investment. Suppliers have faced cancelled
orders and deferred payments as a result of repeated strikes in 2013. Ultimately, many people from
economically-disadvantaged households would lose their jobs if the existence of Bangladesh’s RMG
industry is put at risk.

Appendix IV. Assessing Fiscal Risks in Bangladesh1
Bangladesh faces a number of fiscal risks that could add pressure to the fiscal balance. These include
shocks to macroeconomic variables (such as growth, commodity prices, or interest rates), and calls on
explicit or implicit liabilities based on moral or expected obligations for the government. Preliminary
analysis suggests these risks are broadly manageable, and many of them are already being addressed
in the authorities’ policy framework.
Macroeconomic Shocks


Sensitivity analysis: Shocks to GDP growth (a two percentage point decline), interest rates
(a 200 basis points increase), and commodity prices (30 percent increase in oil and urea
prices), treated separately, would lower the overall fiscal balance by between 0.4 and
0.7 percentage points of GDP, with the debt stock increasing from 1.7 to 2.3 percentage
points of GDP between FY13 and FY18.2

the range of debt profiles that would
maintain Bangladesh at low risk of debt distress.

Specific Risks
Government loan guarantees against loans negotiated by state-owned financial and nonfinancial enterprises. Recent increases, from around 2.6 percent of GDP in FY11 to
5.7 percent of GDP in FY13, are mainly related to external guarantees for high priority energy
related projects. These external guarantees are regularly monitored and projected to be
contained under the authorities’ policy framework.

Shocks, defined as deviations from the baseline, are expected to impact the economy in FY14. The shocks to growth
and interest rate are assumed to last five years, while shocks to commodity prices last one year.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BANGLADESH



State-owned banks: Eight banks representing over 32 percent of banking system’s assets,
characterized by low capital and high nonperforming loan ratios. Their weak balance sheets
represent a tangible fiscal risk (potential recapitalization needs of between 1 and
3½ percentage points of GDP as of June 2013, depending on assumptions). Recapitalization
for the state-owned commercial banks is being addressed by the authorities, tied to a
comprehensive reform program for these banks.



The pension system: The government provides civil servants with a non-contributory,
defined-benefit pension with survivor benefits. The system is unfunded and outlays are
included in the budget. Around 1.2 million government employees; 30,000 to 40,000 retire
every year. Pension spending is projected to increase from 0.5 percent of GDP in 2013 to
roughly 2 percent of GDP in 2050. These increases are reflected in staff’s baseline scenario.
While this issue is not creating pressing fiscal pressures given Bangladesh’s favorable
demographics, the authorities should consider fully funding the current pension system for
government employees. Over the medium to long term, the authorities could also explore
options for a government-funded universal pension system to provide a minimum source of
income for the elderly poor.



Institutional limitations: (a) Deviations from budget. Significant deviations from budget
have been observed, with a systematic overestimation of both revenues and expenditures.
The risk that revenues do not materialize could affect spending commitments or lead to
fiscal slippages. (b) Data reporting. The uncertainty arising from lags and inconsistencies in
data reporting also creates risks. For instance, there is a significant discrepancy between
revenues reported by the Controller General of Accounts and the National Board of
Revenue. The authorities are working on these areas through IMF technical assistance on
public financial management and public financial statistics, and a World Bank-led multidonor trust fund that supports strengthening public expenditure management.

In line with the 2010 Staff Guidance Note, a full joint LIC DSAs is expected to be prepared once every three years for
PRGT-eligible IDA-only countries. In between, short annual updates are expected to be produced unless
macroeconomic conditions since the last full DSA have significantly changed. See Staff Guidance Note on the Application
of the Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries (www.imf.org) and IDA/SECM2010-0029.
2

The DSA presented in this document is based on the standard low-income countries (LIC) DSA framework. See Debt
Sustainability in Low-Income Countries: Further Considerations on an Operational Framework, and Policy Implications
(www.imf.org) and IDA/SECM2004/0629. Under the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), Bangladesh is
rated as a medium performer, with an average rating of 3.43 during 2009–11, and the DSA uses the indicative
threshold for countries in this category.

6½ percent (compared to 6 percent
in the previous DSA), on the assumption that investment in infrastructure and structural
reforms will increase potential long-term growth. All growth projections assume that the
authorities are pursuing policies that maintain macroeconomic stability, promote broadranging structural reforms, and strengthen the trade and investment climate. Foreign direct
investment is projected to remain at about 1 percent of GDP over the medium term and
then to increase to about 2 percent of GDP by FY24 and 2½ percent of GDP by FY34 as a
result of the improving business climate and further liberalization of the capital account.
Because of revised projections of real growth, and other minor revisions to near-term
inflation, nominal GDP measured in U.S. dollars is now 9 percent higher by FY18 and
29 percent higher by FY33.



Discount rate. The Executive Boards of the IMF and the World Bank approved in October a
decision to revise up the discount rate used for DSA calculations to 5 percent, from
3 percent. This DSA update reflects the new discount rate.



Grant element of new borrowing. The average grant element of new borrowing has
increased as a result of using a higher discount rate. However, this DSA update assumes a
steeper decline in the projected grant element of new borrowing (it declines from about
22 percent in FY19 to 10 percent in FY34, Figure 1.a), reflecting a gradual shift toward more
nonconcessional borrowing.



Remittances. Earnings from remittances have been revised downward, on the assumption
that domestic labor demand will be higher and migrant outflows consequently lower.
Remittances are now projected at just below 6 percent of GDP by the end of the forecast
period, compared to 9 percent of GDP in the previous DSA.



Primary fiscal deficit. The primary fiscal deficit is higher than in the previous DSA by about
¼ percent of GDP a year over the long term, mainly reflecting an increase in social-related
expenses as well as a demographics-driven rise in pension outlays to civil servants.

BASELINE SCENARIO
3.
External debt. The present value (PV) of public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt is
expected to fall slightly over the long run to 9 percent of GDP plus remittances by FY34 (from
10 percent in FY14). All external debt indicators remain well below the policy-dependent debt burden
thresholds (adjusted for remittances) under the baseline scenario and all bound tests (see Table 3).
4.
Public sector debt. The PV of the public sector debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to fall
gradually to about 27 percent of GDP by FY34 (from 33 percent in FY13).

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
5.

Alternative assumptions and outcome. This DSA update considers two alternative scenarios:



The first scenario (Figures 3 and 4) assumes a combination of shocks to PPG debt:
(i) issuance of a US$1.0 billion (0.6 percent of GDP) sovereign bond (with 10-year maturity)
in FY15; (ii) new nonconcessional borrowing of US$6 billion (2.5 percent of GDP in FY19) to
construct two 1,000 megawatt nuclear reactors during FY17–21;4 and (iii) beyond what is
already considered in the baseline, an additional recapitalization of state-owned banks of
about 2.2 percent of GDP over FY14 and FY15 (split evenly in the two years).5 Under this
scenario, the present value of PPG external debt as a share of GDP plus remittances
increases over the medium term, peaks at 14 percent in FY21, and then declines to 9 percent
by FY34. The present value of total public debt rises very slightly as a share of GDP over the
first two years, and then declines over the medium term. The risk of external debt distress
remains low in this scenario.6



The second scenario (Figures 5 and 6) is a robustness test on the sensitivity of the baseline
results to permanently slower growth. GDP growth in Bangladesh has averaged 6.2 percent
over the past 10 years, with a standard deviation of 0.3 percent. Given the relative stability of
growth in recent years, a temporary or even a permanent growth shock of one or two standard
deviations would have little impact on overall outcomes. This scenario considers a much larger
growth shock of 2 percentage points (more than six times the standard deviation) starting in
FY14 and throughout the entire projection horizon. The accumulation of new external debt is
assumed to be identical to the baseline. Even though there would be a considerable increase in
debt ratios, the risk of external debt distress remains low in this scenario.

4

While current cost estimates cited in Bangladesh are in the range of US$4–8 billion, these figures remain to be
verified by feasibility studies.

5

The baseline scenario includes recapitalization costs of state-owned commercial and specialized banks of
Tk 70 billion in FY14, and assumes a further Tk 75 billion in FY15. This alternative scenario assumes a full write-off of
all nonperforming loans (NPLs) as well as of fraudulent loans that have not yet been classified as NPLs, and the
additional recapitalization needs are estimated on the basis of what is needed to restore state-owned banks’ tangible
capital to the regulatory minimum.

6

If the sovereign bond and the external financing for the construction of the nuclear power plant were rolled over at
the time of maturity, external debt accumulation would increase but external debt ratios would still remain well
below the relevant thresholds.

Sources: Bangladesh authorities; and IMF staff estimates and projections.
1/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
2/ Central government gross debt, including debt owed to the IMF, plus external borrowing by public enterprises that is supported by central government guarantees, including short-term oil-related suppliers' credits. The years in the table refer to fiscal years. For example, 2014 refers to
July 2013-June 2014.
3/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
4/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
5/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
6/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ Reduced grant element in 2014 as a result of the issuance of a sovereign bond.
8/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
9/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Grant element assumed on residual financing (i.e., financing required above baseline) 6/
Sources: Bangladesh authorities; and staff estimates and projections.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt-creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Export values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Article IV Consultation
The previous Article IV consultation was concluded on October 28, 2011 (IMF Country Report
No. 11/314).
Safeguards Assessment


A safeguards assessment of Bangladesh Bank (BB) was concluded in July 2011. Since then, BB
has implemented a number of recommendations, including approval for incorporation of the
Security Printing Corporation (Bangladesh) Limited, a subsidiary of BB, in the audit plan of BB’s
internal audit department; and approval of Reserve Management Guidelines by the BB Board
and monitoring of investment of foreign exchange reserves by a committee headed by a Deputy
Governor. Most recently, BB received an unqualified audit report on its FY13 financial accounts
from a global audit firm.



Going forward, the authorities expressed their commitment to continue to engage a global firm
to audit BB’s financial statements on an annual basis. Further, by March 2014, the BB Board will
appoint a certified chartered accountant as an advisor to the Audit Committee of the BB Board,
until the committee is reconstituted to include such an expert. To further strengthen BB’s internal
audit function, the authorities are committed to improve the risk-based audit approach; develop
procedure manuals; establish a viable information technology (IT) audit; and recruit qualified
staff and skill enhancement of the existing staff. Bangladesh Bank is also in the process of
completing the integration of its dual IT platform for the financial management information system.
The safeguards assessment also recommended that the legal framework of the BB be strengthened.

Exchange Arrangement


Exchange regime. The de jure exchange rate regime is a managed float. Effective December 19,
2011, the de facto regime was reclassified from crawl-like to other managed.



Exchange restriction. At the last Article IV consultation, the Executive Board urged the
authorities to adopt a timetable to remove the remaining exchange restriction on the
convertibility and transferability of proceeds of current international transactions in nonresident
taka accounts. In September 2013, a strategy paper to review the 1947 Foreign Exchange
Regulations Act was approved, laying out a roadmap toward gradual liberalization of exchange
regulations. In accordance with the roadmap, BB is committed to reviewing and adopting the
necessary amendments to all foreign exchange regulations and reporting routines for current
account transactions by December 2014.

Resident Representative
The resident representative office was established in 1972. Ms. Eteri Kvintradze has been the
Resident Representative since February 2010.

IMF-WORLD BANK COLLABORATION
(October 2013)
1.
The IMF and World Bank Group (both International Development Association (IDA) and
International Finance Corporation (IFC) teams) work together to promote policies and critical
reforms that are essential for maintaining macroeconomic and financial stability and for sustained
high growth and poverty reduction in Bangladesh.


The Fund’s priorities for macroeconomic policies and structural reforms are anchored by the
US$1 billion, three-year Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement, approved in April 2012.
The program aims to safeguard macroeconomic stability; create fiscal space, through
revenue enhancement and spending reforms, to boost development spending; improve
public financial and debt management; strengthen the financial sector, including financial
supervision; and enhance the trade and investment regime.



The Bank’s strategy is reflected in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY11–14,
approved in July 2010. The strategy, which proposed a financial support of about
US$6 billion, focuses on increasing transformative investments to accelerate growth;
reducing vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters; improving social services
delivery; and strengthening accountability and inclusion.

2.
The teams note that collaboration between the Fund and the Bank is strong, both at
headquarters and in the field (through the IMF Resident Representative’s Office and the World
Bank’s Country Office). For instance:


There are frequent formal and informal exchanges of information on each other’s activities
and on assessments of developments, the outlook, and key policy issues.



The teams invite each other to participate in critical internal discussions, share key
documents, and seek comments on them. For instance, the Fund invites the Bank to its
policy consultation meetings and requests comments on the draft policy notes. The Bank
invites the Fund to concept note review meetings and to decision meetings, and also seeks
Fund’s staff views on the corresponding documents ahead of these meetings.



Staffs are also invited to relevant Board meetings.



The teams regularly discuss the division of labor between the two institutions, and
collaborate on joint papers, such as the Joint Staff Assessment Notes (JSAN) and the Debt
Sustainability Analysis (DSA).

3.
The teams agreed that the two institutions should remain focused on the following reform
areas, and based on the following division of labor:

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BANGLADESH



Tax policy and administration. Higher public investment in critical infrastructure is needed for
Bangladesh to accelerate economic growth. To create the necessary fiscal space to achieve this,
improved revenue generation is necessary. Development of a modern tax regime and a
strengthening of tax administration at the National Board of Revenue (NBR) are essential. At
present, the centerpiece of the government’s tax reform program is the introduction of a new
value-added tax (VAT), for which a law was passed in November 2012. Efforts to boost the
capacity of NBR focus on automation and recruitment. Division of labor: The new VAT law and
the VAT implementation plan received significant technical assistance (TA) from the Fund, and
the Fund assigned a resident advisor to assist NBR in VAT implementation. IDA has agreed to
finance most of the costs for acquiring and operating the new VAT computer system and for
designing organizational reforms and new administrative processes, which are urgent priorities.
The IFC will provide consultancy support for automation and other targeted implementation
tasks.



Public financial management (PFM). Sound PFM is important for maintaining fiscal discipline
and improving the quality of public expenditure. Division of labor: IDA is providing assistance
through its administration of the Strengthening Public Expenditure Management Program
(SPEMP), supported by a multi-donor trust fund. SPEMP focuses on core PFM issues in the
executive branch of government, as well as strengthening public expenditure oversight functions
in parliament and audit institutions. IDA is also taking the lead on public procurement reform
and capacity building. The IMF is providing support through several TA missions on cash flow
forecasting and management, and on budget and accounting classification.



Debt management. There has been significant progress on strengthening debt management
practices under the ECF, but more needs to be done. Division of labor: The IMF and IDA will
continue working jointly in this area, including on the DSA, with the IMF coordinating views on
main macroeconomic assumptions and outlook and supporting structural reforms on debt
management through ECF conditionality, and IDA providing technical support on debt
management capacity through the SPEMP as well as a Debt Management Performance
Assessment (DeMPA).



Monetary and exchange rate policies. The IMF will take the lead in this area. IDA will play a
complementary role through operations to strengthen payments systems at Bangladesh Bank
(BB).



Financial sector reform. A sound and viable financial sector will remain critical for creating an
improved environment for private sector investment. Ensuring steady sector growth and
institutional development and sound prudential oversight and risk management will require
considerable technical cooperation in the coming years. Strengthening the central bank’s
regulatory and supervisory framework and internal accounting and controls underpins this work.
Division of labor: IDA/IFC and IMF are both engaged in this area, with the former taking the lead
on financial market development and governance and institutional strengthening of BB, and the
latter on bank supervision and oversight, supported by a resident advisor in BB.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



Energy sector reform. Under the Fund-supported program, the government has initiated a
subsidy reform, raising retail and bulk tariffs to reduce overall subsidies and create fiscal space
for more pressing spending needs. Further such adjustments are needed. Reducing financial and
operational inefficiencies in state-owned enterprises in the energy sector is also critical. Severe
power shortages constrain growth in Bangladesh. Selection of sponsors through transparent and
competitive processes will send the right signal to the market, and help in financial closure of
power projects. Finally, shortage of primary fuel supply for power generation remains a key
constraint. Proper incentives are needed for stepped-up private investment in the sector.
Division of labor: IDA will lead on policy dialogue and investment in this area, with the IMF
focused on policies to address fiscal implications.



Social protection. Bangladesh has a large number of mostly inadequately targeted social safety
net (SSN) programs. Consolidation and improvement in the targeting and implementation of
SSNs is necessary to enhance their efficiency and poverty-reduction impact, and provide support
as universal subsidy schemes are phased out. Division of labor: IDA is taking the lead in this area
through support to the development of the Bangladesh Poverty Database and improved
management and administration of SSNs, with the Fund-supported program tracking socialrelated expenditure to ensure that fiscal targets under the program protect social spending.



Trade and investment climate reform. To boost productivity and investment, it is vital to
create a level playing field for all sectors and reduce the cost of doing business. Division of labor:
IDA has the leadership of a Diagnostic Trade Integration Study that is close to being finalized
and IFC is targeting incremental reforms with the aim of improving legal and administrative
procedures. The IMF is providing support on the review of foreign exchange regulations.



Statistical policy. Improvements in statistics are critical to formulating sound policies and
monitoring their outcomes. Both IDA and the IMF have sustained engagement in this area and
will ramp it up further in the future. Division of labor: IDA on poverty, social, and development
statistics and the IMF on macroeconomic and financial statistics.



Other structural policies. The World Bank keeps the IMF informed about its work on
governance and anti-corruption, local government and decentralization, and private sector
development. Upstream sharing allows the IMF to comment on such work before it is finalized.

4.
The teams agree to continue to keep each other informed of their respective activities,
coordinate financial and technical support, and share key documents.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK1
(October 2013)
Lending and Technical Assistance Operations
Bangladesh had cumulative public sector borrowing from the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) of
US$14.1 billion (234 loans) as of December 31, 2012, and technical assistance (TA) grants of
US$221.7 million (389 projects). The country is one of the largest borrowers of concessional Asian
Development Fund (ADF) resources. The loans and TA have supported all key sectors, including
energy and transport, social infrastructure, and agriculture and natural resources. The AsDB has also
supported twelve private sector projects worth US$297.2 million, including the Meghnaghat Power
Project—the first build-own-operate power project in the country—and GrameenPhone, which
substantially expanded rural access to mobile phone services.
In 2012, the AsDB approved a total amount of US$1.07 billion in loans. This included loans for
(i) Power System Expansion and Efficiency Improvement Investment Program Multitranche Financing
Facility (Tranche 1) (US$185 million OCR); (ii) Coastal Climate-Resilient Infrastructure Project
(US$20 million ADF); (iii) Second Teaching Quality Improvement in Secondary Education Project
(US$70 million ADF); (iv) Urban Primary Healthcare Services Delivery Project (US$50 million ADF);
(v) Second Capital Market Development Program (US$300 million, of which US$205 million is from
ADF); (vi) Financing Brick Kiln Efficiency Improvement Project (US$50 million, of which US$20 million
is from ADF); (vii) SASEC Road Connectivity Project (US$198 million ADF); (viii) Dhaka-Chittagong
Expressway Public-Private Partnership Design TA Loan (US$10 million ADF); (ix) Greater Dhaka
Sustainable Urban Transport Project (US$160 million, of which US$60 million is from ADF);
(x) Coastal Towns Infrastructure Improvement Project (project design advance) (US$3.5 million), and
(xi) South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Trade Facilitation Program (US$21 million ADF).
In 2013 (calendar year), planned AsDB disbursements are about US$603 million (see table below).

Country Partnership Strategy
The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2006–10 lapsed in December 2010. The CPS 2011–2015,
approved on October 27, 2011, focuses on six sectors: energy, transport, urban development,
education, agriculture and natural resources, and finance. The CPS is closely aligned with the
government’s Sixth Five-Year Plan priorities and aims to contribute to more inclusive and greener
growth. Under the CPS, the total indicative resources for public sector lending during 2011–2015
included US$2.4 billion in ADF and US$2.1 billion in OCR. AsDB’s OCR financing would be used for
major revenue-generating infrastructure projects. An average of US$9.6 million per annum in TA
resources was included, of which 35 percent would be allocated for project design.
The CPS prioritizes the thematic drivers of environmental sustainability and climate resilience,
regional cooperation, knowledge solutions, partnerships, good governance and capacity
development, gender equity, and private sector development. Country Operations Business Plan
(2014–2016), under the current CPS, was approved in July 2013.
Over a five-year cumulative period from 2007–2011, Bangladesh leveraged the highest amount of
cofinancing among AsDB’s developing member countries at US$3 billion. By the end of 2012,
cumulative direct value-added official cofinancing for Bangladesh amounted to US$4.37 billion for
42 investment projects and US$72.3 million for 90 technical assistance projects. In 2012, four
projects received loan cofinancing: (i) from Agence Française de Développement for Greater Dhaka
Sustainable Urban Transportation Project (US$45 million); (ii) from the International Fund for
Agricultural Development (US$59 million) and Strategic Climate Fund––Pilot Program for Climate
Resilience (US$20 million) for Coastal Climate––Resilient Infrastructure Project; (iii) from the Abu
Dhabi Fund for Development (US$30 million) and OPEC Fund for International Development
(US$30 million) for South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Road Connectivity Project; and
(iv) from European Investment Bank (US$91 million) and IsDB (US$85 million) for Power System
Expansion and Efficiency Improvement Investment Program (Tranche 1).
Economic and Sector Work Program
Each year, the AsDB publishes its Asian Development Outlook and Asian Development Outlook
Update, in which it assesses macroeconomic performance. The AsDB’s Bangladesh resident mission
(BRM) also publishes the Bangladesh Quarterly Economic Update. A bimonthly Economic Indicators
Update is also prepared. BRM also commissions studies on economic and thematic areas.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(October 2013)
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General. Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The most
affected areas are national accounts, fiscal, and external sector statistics.
National accounts. The paucity of source data remains the main impediment to improving national
accounts statistics. It adversely affects the ability of the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) to
absorb technical assistance (TA) aimed at improving compilation techniques. The BBS does not
conduct an annual national accounts survey of business enterprises. Source data are primarily from
benchmark surveys and a biennial census of manufacturing establishments and household
expenditure survey. Many of the benchmark surveys were conducted over five years ago and are
based on outdated sample frames. The shortcomings in the data also affect compilation practices.
In addition, a system of price indices for estimating national accounts at constant prices needs to be
developed. Technical assistance missions, conducted between 2009 and 2012, developed and
agreed a detailed work program with the BBS for undertaking the exercise of updating the base
year from 1995/96 to 2005/06 and creating a comprehensive benchmark estimate and new series
with the new base year. In September 2013, BBS announced the introduction of a new GDP series
with base year 2005/06, details for which are awaited at this time. Revisions to national accounts
data are done annually, reported data often have large statistical discrepancies, and currently there
are no quarterly national accounts statistics available. A Fund resident advisor on real sector
statistics is expected to be in place at the BBS by November 2013.
Price statistics. In July 2012, BBS introduced a new CPI series (base year 2005/06) with updated
weights and coverage and, from August 2013, it discontinued publication of the old CPI series (base
year 1995/96). With support from Fund TA, BBS is currently working on further improving and
updating the CPI weights, including incorporating the recent household survey and the
Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose (COICOP). The producer price index
(base year 1988/89) continues to suffer from outdated weights.
Government finance statistics. A 2008 STA multisector mission recommended additional actions to
strengthen the analytical usefulness of fiscal data, including to: (i) improve the integration of debt
stocks and related financial flows; (ii) sensitize donors to the need to promptly provide complete
data on direct project assistance; and (iii) establish an inter-agency committee to prepare a migration
plan to the GFSM 2001. STA-assisted missions in 2012 and 2013 found some progress in migration
toward the GFSM 2001 system, including the launch of a new accounting and budget classification
system. Remaining priorities here for the authorities include to disseminate stock data on financial
assets and liabilities, and to broaden the coverage to general government.
Monetary and financial statistics. Bangladesh Bank compiles monetary data using the standardized
report forms (SRFs) framework. The SRFs are reported electronically to the IMF on a regular basis. As
a result, a consistent time series based on SRF data is available from December 2001.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BANGLADESH

External sector statistics. Pressing issues need to be addressed in balance of payments and
international investment position statistics, mainly in trade in goods, trade credits, and related
financing. In the area of goods transactions, data are collected from different data sources: exports
are based on information from customs declarations, while imports used to be reported on the basis
of settlement of payments. Efforts are underway by the authorities to unify the source data based on
customs declarations only, in line with STA’s recommendations, and import data from FY11 onward
are now being reported on this basis. This should help resolve inconsistencies with the national
accounts, where customs trade data are used in compiling net exports of goods and services.
Bangladesh Bank, the institution in change of external sector statistics, also needs to employ
additional data sources, apart from the settlement data, for the financial account, including for trade
credits and external borrowing by private and public entities, and should discontinue some
adjustments to the financial account that are deemed to be unsound. International investment
position data remain weak.
Data Standards and Quality
Bangladesh has participated in the GDDS since March 2001. The Data Module of the ROSC was
published in December 2005.

Statement by the Staff Representative on Bangladesh
November 27, 2013
The information below has become available following the issuance of the staff report. It
does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
All quantitative targets for end-September for which preliminary data are available
appear to have been met. The publication of the tender for the selection of the value-added
tax automation software vendor (a December 2013 benchmark) has been completed.
2.
The Election Commission has yet to announce a date for the national elections,
although they are widely expected to take place in early January 2014. On November 18,
Prime Minister Hasina formed an interim cabinet for the pre-election period. The
appointment follows resignations from all cabinet ministers, at the request of the Prime
Minister. The ruling Awami League has a majority in this interim cabinet, along with some
appointments from other political parties. Some ministers were retained in key portfolios,
including the Finance Minister. The main opposition party has so far refused to participate in
the interim government and has asked Prime Minister Hasina to resign and hand power to a
nonpartisan caretaker government formed by prominent citizens. The situation, however,
remains fluid, with several stakeholders trying to broker an agreement between the two main
parties. In the meantime, strikes and disruptions are likely to continue with detrimental
effects on the economy.
3.

4.

Recent data releases have evolved broadly in line with staff’s expectations.


Exports were volatile but overall strong in the first three months of fiscal year
2014 (FY14, July 2013 to June 2014), but fell by 4 percent (y/y) in October,
hampered by frequent shutdowns and political uncertainty.



Remittances contracted 15 percent (y/y) in October, reflecting continued weak
outflows of migrant workers.



Private sector credit growth has continued to trend down from an average of
almost 16 percent (y/y) in FY13 to 11 percent in September.



Headline inflation eased further to 7 percent (y/y) in October with slower
nonfood inflation offsetting higher food inflation (which is being affected by
supply disruptions).

There have been several developments in the garment industry.


After a period of consultations, the Minimum Wage Board recommended on
November 21 raising the minimum wages for the garment industry. For entrylevel workers, the recommended minimum wage will be Tk 5,300 (US$68)

2
per month, a 77 percent rise from the current Tk 3,000 per month. This wage
rate was last revised in 2010 (by 81 percent), and before that in 2006 (by
78 percent). The recommendation needs to be approved by the Ministry of
Labor and Employment, and is expected to go into effect in December 2013.

1



The Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety (a group of U.S. garment
retailers) and the Accord on Fire and Building Safety (a European group),
which were set up in response to the Rana Plaza building tragedy, announced
on November 20 a comprehensive set of common fire and safety standards for
Bangladesh garment factories, based on which thorough inspections are
planned to take place in the coming months.



Higher wages, in conjunction with strengthened safety standards, are likely to
lead to a period of adjustment and consolidation in the garment industry (as
explained in the staff report), and will necessitate offsetting improvements in
productivity to avoid some erosion in the sector’s competitiveness. However,
the proposed entry level minimum wage would still be lower than in other
major garment-exporting countries.1 Moreover, the impact on wages in other
industries is expected to be contained as over four fifths of total employment
in Bangladesh is informal, with limited bargaining power. Staff analysis based
on past episodes of minimum wage increases suggests that the pass through to
consumer prices is likely to be moderate.

According to a recent ILO report, the lowest applicable wage in the garment industry is US$71 in India and
US$73 in Sri Lanka, rising to $78 in Vietnam, US$79 in Pakistan, and $80 in Cambodia. Based on limited
available information on productivity differentials, the proposed minimum wage in Bangladesh would likely
lead to roughly comparable unit labor costs vis-à-vis some of these comparator countries.

Press Release No.13/493
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 5, 2013

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with Bangladesh
On November 27, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Bangladesh. On the same day the Executive
Board also completed the third review under the Extended Credit Facility Arrangement
(ECF) with Bangladesh, and approved US$140.4 million disbursement (Press Release
No. 13/479).
Over the past two years, the Bangladesh economy has shown significant economic
stabilization and progress in structural reforms, underpinned by the Fund-supported
program. In that period, real GDP growth has averaged above 6 percent, while sustained
garment exports, increasing public investment, and strong workers’ remittance inflows have
supported demand and activity. Meanwhile, Bangladesh’s two-decade trend of poverty
reduction has continued, with steady progress toward the country’s Millennium
Development Goals.
Since early 2013, however, political events and uncertainty in the run up to national
elections have affected economic activity and curbed investment appetite, thereby slowing
private credit growth and imports. Looking ahead, a slowdown in growth associated with
unrest and political uncertainty, as well as an expected transition in the garment sector to
higher costs and upgraded labor and safety standards, pose important challenges.
Real GDP growth moderated in fiscal year 2013 (FY13, July 2012-June 2013) to 6 percent
and is projected to further slow down to 5½ percent in FY14 before strengthening to
7 percent in FY15, with drivers of growth shifting from net exports to domestic consumption.
The current account reached a record surplus of 2 percent of GDP in FY13 and is forecasted
to narrow, but remain in surplus in FY14. The balance of payments has been further
supported by aid flows and sustained public sector external borrowing for infrastructure. As a

report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

result of the strong external position, international reserves have more than doubled since late
2011, and the nominal and real exchange rates have also appreciated over this period.
Underlying (nonfood) inflation eased to under 8 percent in FY13 and is expected to continue
to fall in the near term as a result of tighter policies, a slowing economy, and currency
appreciation, but with upside risks from higher wages and supply disruptions.
The central government deficit was 4½ percent of GDP in FY13, in line with the ECF
program targets. Revenue shortfalls resulting from the slowing economy were offset by
better controlled nonessential expenditures and lower subsidy costs, allowing for a higher
execution of investment spending under the Annual Development Program. The monetary
policy stance, guided by Bangladesh Bank’s Monetary Policy Statement in July 2013, has
been restrained while allowing sufficient space for private credit activity. However, credit
growth has slowed in line with weaker investment demand, contributing to ample liquidity
in the banking system.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the significant progress made in
macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms, underpinned by the Fund-supported
program. International reserves have increased, underlying inflation pressures have receded,
and public debt has declined. The trend of poverty reduction has also continued.
Nevertheless, the economy faces challenges arising mainly from the uncertain political
environment, social unrest, and the transition in the garment industry. To safeguard
stabilization gains and to further boost inclusive growth, Directors called for vigilance and
continued implementation of sound policies.
Directors underscored that fiscal policy should remain prudent, while providing space to
raise public investment and social spending. They encouraged further reforms to modernize
the tax system and generate additional resources over the medium term. Decisive revenue
administration reforms are needed to improve tax collections, while advancing
implementation of the new value-added tax without further delays. Improving treasury cash
management and cash flow forecasting is also a priority, as is strengthening financial
reporting and management at state-owned enterprises. Directors encouraged the authorities
to continue to strengthen debt management practices and to ensure that all nonconcessional
borrowing is focused on high-impact projects.
Directors noted that restrained monetary policy has curbed inflationary pressures and
supported reserve accumulation. With reserves approaching adequate levels, the central

bank’s foreign exchange intervention could be scaled back, while keeping up sterilization
efforts to achieve program targets.
Directors encouraged Bangladesh Bank to fully utilize its enhanced regulatory and
supervisory powers, following the amendments to the banking law, in order to address
vulnerabilities in the banking system. The financial position of the state-owned commercial
banks requires attention. Directors welcomed the latest revisions to the central bank’s
memoranda of understanding with these banks, which provide a clear program of action and
strengthened sanctions for noncompliance. Strong implementation of these reforms,
complemented by recapitalization, will be needed to improve governance and restore these
banks’ financial health. Directors supported the continuation of annual central bank audits
by a global audit firm, as well as reforms to strengthen Bangladesh Bank board’s audit
committee and internal audit capacity.
Directors emphasized that removing critical infrastructure bottlenecks is necessary for
sustained high growth. Further streamlining the trade regime and regulations, including on
foreign exchange, is also needed to improve the business climate. They welcomed the
revision in the garment sector’s minimum wages, as well as initiatives to strengthen labor
and factory safety conditions, and looked forward to continued progress in these areas in
consultation with development partners and the private sector. Priority should also be given
to better targeting social safety net programs. These reforms, together with prudent
macroeconomic policies, will help lay the foundations for sustained strong growth and
poverty reduction.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 1, 2013

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Completes Third Review under the Extended Credit Facility Arrangement with
Bangladesh, and Approves US$140.4 Million Disbursement
On November 27, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
completed the third review of Bangladesh’s economic program under a three-year
arrangement supported by the Extended Credit Facility (ECF). The Executive Board’s
decision enables the immediate disbursement of an amount equivalent to
SDR 91.423 million (about US$140.4 million) to Bangladesh. This would bring total
disbursements under the arrangement to SDR 365.692 million (about US$561.4 million).
The three-year ECF arrangement for Bangladesh was approved by the Executive Board on
April 11, 2012 (see Press Release No. 12/129) for a total amount equivalent to
SDR 639.96 million (about US$982.5 million), or 120 percent of quota.
After the Board discussion, Mr. Naoyuki Shinohara, Deputy Managing Director and Acting
Chair, said:
“Progress on macro-stabilization and structural reforms has been strong under Bangladesh’s
policy program, supported by the Extended Credit Facility. International reserves have risen
and underlying inflation is moderating. Progress has also been made in lowering subsidies,
raising development spending, improving public financial and debt management, and
strengthening financial supervision. However, strikes and uncertainty associated with the
upcoming elections, an attendant slowdown in growth, and an expected transition in the
garment sector to higher costs and upgraded labor and safety standards, pose challenges
ahead. To manage them, it is important to persevere with a strong policy framework in the
run-up to national elections and beyond.
“Fiscal policy should remain prudent, while providing space to raise public investment and
social-related spending. Further reforms to modernize the tax system and generate additional
resources for development spending over the medium term are critical, with implementation
of the new value added tax a priority. Public financial management needs strengthening,
focused on treasury cash management, state-owned enterprise financial reporting, and debt
management practices.

2
“Restrained monetary policy has curbed inflationary pressures and supported reserve
accumulation. The stronger external position could allow scaling back foreign exchange
intervention while continuing sterilization efforts.
“Bangladesh Bank should fully utilize its enhanced supervisory powers to bolster financial
stability. The program for reforms at the state-owned commercial banks should be firmly
advanced, backed by recapitalization.
“Reforms to achieve sustained and inclusive growth should aim at further removing critical
infrastructure bottlenecks, while streamlining the trade regime and foreign exchange
regulations to improve the business climate. Advancing initiatives to strengthen labor and
garment factory safety conditions is also critical, while the targeting of social safety net
programs needs to be further improved.”

Statement by Mr. Rakesh Mohan, Executive Director for Bangladesh
and Mr. Koodathumuriyil Verghese Eapen, Senior Advisor
November 27, 2013
1.
The Bangladesh authorities wish to thank the IMF Mission for their constructive
engagement in the course of the Third Review mission during September/October 2013 for the
Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement. They appreciate the staff’s recognition of the
achievements made in the context of the macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms
supported by the ECF program. The authorities have outlined recent economic developments and
programs as well as their targets under the ECF in the Letter of Intent (LOI) dated November 5th
2013, the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) and the Technical
Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) attached to the staff report. They requested the
completion of the third review under the ECF arrangement and access to the fourth disbursement
in the amount of SDR 91.423 million under the program.
Progress under the ECF program
2.
Bangladesh has made substantial progress in strengthening macroeconomic conditions
and structural policies during the ECF arrangement, which has now successfully reached its
midpoint. The ECF supported program is firmly on track. All the quantitative performance
criteria (PC) and all but one of the indicative targets for end-June 2013 have been met.
Preliminary data indicates that the progress is in step for most end-September 2013 indicative
targets as well. Bangladesh has also completed all ten structural benchmarks due between endJune 2013 and end-September 2013 as well as all the prior actions under the third review of the
ECF arrangement.
3.
The authorities are moving forward with the implementation of the new value-added
tax (VAT) law. The VAT implementation project has now been included in the Annual
Development Program (ADP) and the procurement process for automation software and related
consultancies has begun. In addition, rules and regulations for the new VAT law have been
drafted and are now in public consultation. With Bangladesh Bank’s financial, regulatory and
supervisory powers broadened under the newly approved amendments to the Bank Companies
Act, the authorities are now focusing on strengthening the governance, internal audit and
controls and risk management practices of state-owned commercial banks.
4.
To protect international reserve buffers amid global and domestic uncertainties, the
authorities are requesting an increase in the end-December 2013 PC on net international reserves
of Bangladesh Bank (BB) and a corresponding reduction of the PC on BB’s net domestic assets.
They believe that the commitments as outlined in the MEFP are adequate to achieve program
objectives but may consider further measures, as appropriate, for this purpose.
Macroeconomic Outlook
5.
The Bangladesh economy continues to exhibit robust real GDP growth (6.18 percent
in FY13). The pace has recently been slightly less than anticipated due to depressed global
growth and domestic political uncertainties, but has been supported by resilient domestic
consumption and export performance so far. Given these factors, the authorities view staff

2
projections for FY14 as conservative. Further, they feel that the steps to remove supply side
constraints by means of targeted investment in social and physical infrastructure and power and
energy sector have bolstered growth prospects.
6.
While the authorities do share staff’s views on the prospects for weaker remittances in
FY14, they are more optimistic on the export front. Export performance till September 2013 has
been strong. The authorities also anticipate stronger recovery in imports following the elections,
leading to slower reserve accumulation from 2014. The ongoing structural adjustment of the
ready-made garment (RMG) industry might also have an impact on future growth; the authorities
are committed to providing policy support, particularly to small and medium enterprises. The
authorities are well aware that it is important to sustain competitiveness in this sector through
productivity and education reforms.
7.
Prudent fiscal policy coupled with moderate monetary tightening has helped keep
inflation below the 8 percent mark. In particular, point to point non-food inflation has
decelerated to 5 per cent in October 2013 from the double digit level in March 2012
(11.8 percent). The BB has been pursuing a moderately restrained monetary policy strategy to
safeguard macroeconomic stability and keep inflation in check, while allowing adequate credit
flows to the productive parts of the private sector.
8.
The authorities are well aware of the importance to move ahead with requisite labor
and safety action plans in the RMG sector; at the same time, there is need for an appreciation of
the scale and complexity of the reforms that are required within a short timeframe. It is
important to note that the success of the RMG - sector is often credited as the reason for
improvement in the overall position of women in the country. It should also be noted that
population growth and the fertility rate in Bangladesh are lower than South Asian averages.
Fiscal and Monetary Policies
9.
Bangladesh has met the FY13 fiscal target with the overall budget deficit (excluding
grants) at an estimated 4.5 percent of GDP. The authorities are committed to a budget deficit
(excluding grants) target of 4.3 percent of GDP in FY14, anchored by restricting the net credit to
the central government (NCCG) by the banking system to Tk. 242 billion over FY14. To
underpin revenue collection despite slowing economic activity, they will strengthen the tax
enforcement capacity by recruiting new staff and continue with progress in customs automation
and modernization and on-going reforms to boost taxpayer registration. In addition, they will
keep expenditures contained so as to achieve the overall deficit target. They will also continue to
strengthen ADP implementation—including by utilizing the pipeline of committed donor
funding—and increase social-related expenditure.
10.
Over the medium term, fiscal policy will be centered on the objective of putting
public debt on a smooth downward path. The authorities point out that the Debt Sustainability
Analysis (DSA) update for the 2013 consultation indicates that Bangladesh remains at a low risk
of debt distress. The authorities will also continue to strengthen public debt management by
(i) focusing external borrowing, including the contracting and guaranteeing of non-concessional
external debt, on projects with a high development impact for which concessional financing is
not available and (ii) by further streamlining debt management processes.

3
11.
The authorities will continue to contain fuel and electricity subsidies. In particular,
they are committed to keeping domestic average fuel prices within Tk. 10 per liter of
international prices and will adjust prices as needed to keep to that target. They will also
continue making regular budgetary transfers to Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) in
order to cover subsidy costs as well as reducing its short term external borrowing needs. They
will focus efforts on strengthening BPC, the largest non-financial corporation in the country. A
global audit firm, in association with a local firm, will be appointed to conduct a financial audit
of the BPC for FY13, to be completed by September 2014.
12.
The Bangladesh Bank will continue to maintain a restrained monetary policy stance
as set out in the July 2013 Monetary Policy Statement, anchored on a reserve money target, to
safeguard macroeconomic stability and keep inflation in check, while allowing adequate space
for private credit growth. Going forward, the BB will adjust foreign exchange intervention to
market conditions, while keeping up sterilization operations to adhere to program targets. A full
external audit of the BB by a global audit firm will be completed before the December 2013
benchmark. Following up on the findings from this audit, the BB Board will appoint a certified
chartered accountant as an advisor to the Audit Committee of the BB Board by March 2014 until
the Audit Committee is reconstituted to include such an expert. The BB will also continue to
engage a global firm to audit its financial statements on an annual basis.
13.
Bangladesh has also continued to build up net international reserves, meeting the
end-June 2013 target by a comfortable margin. The current account balance continues to be in a
surplus reflecting continued sizeable inflows of remittances and high aid disbursements coupled
with sustained export expansion and subdued imports. This has also resulted in the recent gross
international reserve build-up to US$17.2 billion by end October 2013.
Financial Sector Reforms
14.
Amendments to the Bank Companies Act (BCA) were approved by Parliament in
July 2013. Following this, the BB has issued an order in September 2013 limiting banks’ capital
market exposure to 25 percent of their capital as set out in the newly amended BCA. To
strengthen the central bank’s contingency planning framework, the BB Board has also adopted a
bank intervention and resolution plan as well as a lender of last resort policy. The Bangladesh
Securities and Exchange Commission has also approved demutualization models and plans for
both Dhaka and Chittagong stock exchanges in September 2013 to strengthen market
governance.
15.
A key focus of financial sector policies going ahead will be the strengthening of the
governance, credit risk management and balance sheets of the state-owned commercial banks
(SOCBs). The BB has completed special diagnostic examinations of the SOCBs in June 2013,
which identified significant weaknesses in asset quality, liquidity management and internal audit
and control.
16.
To this end, several measures are being undertaken including: (a) Revised MOUs.
The authorities have revised the memoranda of understanding (MOUs) between BB and the
SOCBs to address various deficiencies. The revised MOUs provide for the bank boards to adopt
a stronger credit policy and credit risk management policy (in line with BB’s credit risk

4
management guidelines) by November 2013 and independent internal audit programs. Further,
the authorities are committed to imposing the strengthened range of sanctions provided for in the
revised MOUs in case of noncompliance. (ii) Recapitalization. The authorities intend to
gradually restore the capital position of SOCBs in line with regulatory capital adequacy
standards, conditional on progress on actions agreed under the revised MOUs and clearly laid
out new business plans approved by the SOCB boards. (iii) Automation. The authorities will
initiate an automation plan for SOCB branches to reduce operational and financial reporting
risks. A detailed action plan for automation will be completed by the Ministry of Finance in
consultation with BB by March 2014.
Structural Policies
17.
After the Rana Plaza building collapse in April 2013 in Savar on the outskirts of
Dhaka the authorities have taken various steps to allay international and domestic concerns
relating to labor and safety conditions in the RMG industry. A wage board has been formed to
revise the minimum wage for the garment industry, which was last raised in 2010. The board
has recommended an increased minimum wage. They also formed a high-level inter-Ministerial
Committee, with worker participation, to examine working conditions and safety issues in the
RMG industry. In line with commitments set out in a joint statement including employers’ and
workers’ organizations signed in May 2013, they have amended the Labor Act (in July 2013) to
improve safety standards and workers’ collective bargaining rights. They are also strengthening
the labor inspection system with support from the International Labor Organization (ILO),
development partners, and international retailers. This is also being done through the recruitment
of 200 additional inspectors by end-2013 and through safety assessments of all active RMG
factories.
18.
The authorities will continue to increase budget allocations for well-targeted social
safety net programs and strengthen the efficiency and transparency of all social safety net
programs with support from the World Bank and other development partners. The authorities
have also prepared a strategy paper laying out the roadmap towards gradual liberalization of
exchange regulations on the current and capital account with a view to facilitating business
operations and attracting foreign investment. The BB will review and adopt necessary
amendments to all foreign exchange regulations and reporting routines for current account
transactions. The authorities recognize the importance to add momentum to the liberalization of
the trade regime to strengthen the trade and investment climate. Their future trade liberalization
program will focus on reducing the dispersion and average level of protection, streamlining
customs and border procedures and introducing a more efficient duty drawback system.
Conclusion
19.
The authorities will maintain close policy dialogue with the Fund to ensure
continued strong performance under the ECF arrangement. They will also consider the
recommendations arising from the 2013 Article IV Consultation. They will pursue technical
assistance as necessary from the Fund and other development partners in support of the reform
agenda.
