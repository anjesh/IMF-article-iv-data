-3EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Sudan’s economic performance in recent years has been good despite internal conflicts and
the difficulties of concluding and implementing the peace agreement with the South. Growth
has been robust, inflation has been kept at a single-digit level, and important reforms have
been undertaken. There has been progress with financial sector reforms and trade
liberalization, and the managed floating exchange rate regime has been working well.
Notwithstanding these achievements, several challenges remain to make the Government of
National Unity fully operational, achieve peace throughout the country, and implement
additional reforms to sustain growth and stability and deal with widespread poverty.
The economic program for 2006 addresses some of those challenges. Despite an increase in
oil revenues, the fiscal space of the central government will be constrained because of the
transfers required by the peace agreement and decentralization. These transfers, coupled with
higher capital expenditures, will contribute to a substantial increase in pro-poor development
spending. In this context, and to safeguard macroeconomic stability, an additional
reorientation of expenditures is required, including through a reduction in fuel subsidies.
Sudan’s economic prospects are favorable, assuming a continuation of the reform effort.
Critical actions going forward are as follows:
¾ Adhere to fiscal spending and reserve money targets in an environment of exchange
rate flexibility to keep inflation in check.
¾ Introduce a new national currency to foster financial development in the South and
economic integration.
¾ Ensure close coordination between the government of Southern Sudan, the other
states, and the central government to harmonize spending and preserve
macroeconomic stability.
¾ Initiate fiscal reporting according to Government Finance Statistics Methodology and
publish detailed oil-sector data to improve expenditure management and
transparency.
¾ Build capacity, transparency, and accountability at all levels of government and make
the Fiscal and Financial Allocation and Monitoring Commission operational to
support fiscal decentralization.
¾ Proceed with reforms to remove structural rigidities and lower transactions costs in
order to improve competitiveness.
Sudan’s external debt problems continue to limit the country’s access to external
development financing. Despite these and other emerging constraints, the staff has urged the
authorities to maintain their record of cooperation on economic policies and payments to the
Fund including minimizing nonconcessional borrowing in order to facilitate the prompt
resolution of Sudan’s debt and arrears problems at the appropriate time.

-4I. INTRODUCTION
1.
During the last seven years, the authorities have maintained close cooperation with
the Fund as evidenced by good performance on successive Staff-Monitored Programs
(SMPs) and by making payments in excess of obligations falling due. During January 27–
February 9, 2006, a staff team visited Khartoum to conduct discussions on
the 2006 Article IV consultation, the performance under the 2005 SMP, and an SMP
for 2006.1 The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP,
Attachment I) describes the authorities’ program and their policy commitments through
December 2006.
2.
In concluding the last Article IV consultation on April 29, 2005, Directors stressed
the importance of keeping inflation low, strengthening the tax base, improving oil sector
transparency, and containing nonconcessional borrowing. During the midyear review of the
SMP on December 2, 2005, Directors urged the authorities to press ahead with the
implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) and redouble efforts to
resolve the crisis in Darfur. Directors also encouraged the authorities to formulate a prudent
budget for 2006, scale back fuel subsidies, adopt the Government Finance Statistics (GFS)
methodology, and increase the level of payments to the Fund.2
3.
The authorities have been carrying out staff recommendations, although there have
been some slippages and delays. Inflation pressures have been contained, and measures to
broaden the tax base and improve administration have been undertaken. However, the
adoption of GFS (GFSM 2001) methodology has progressed slowly, and the target on
nonconcessional borrowing has been missed. The program for 2006 contains important
commitments to increase fiscal and oil sector transparency as well as higher payments to the
Fund.
4.
The framework for assistance to Sudan by donors and multilateral institutions is
based on the reports prepared by the Joint Assessment Mission (IMF, UN, World Bank, and
the authorities) in early 2005 and the commitments made by donors and the government at
the Oslo Conference in April of that year.3 Since then, the first semiannual consultative
group meeting (the “Sudan Consortium”) to follow up on these commitments, redefine
priorities, and foster mutual accountability was held in Paris during March 9–10, 2006
(Appendix II). Fund staff provided input and participated at these events.
1

The staff team comprised Mr. Gelbard (head), Mr. Ilahi, Mr. Al-Ghelaiqah, Ms. Maseeh (all MCD),
Mr. Hussain (PDR) and Mr. Chua (FAD). Mr. Pérez (MCD) joined the mission for a few days.
Mr. de Schaetzen (Resident Representative) assisted the mission and participated in the discussions. The
mission met with senior government officials including the First Vice-President, Mr. Salva Kiir Mayardit;
representatives of the business and the banking community; and members of the donor community.

2

Most Directors supported the view that the policy commitments under the SMP continued to be in line with
what would be required for a Rights Accumulation Program (RAP) and that performance under successive
SMPs since 2000 should be taken into account in determining the length of a RAP. A number of Directors
suggested that, at the appropriate time, the requirement of a RAP could be waived altogether.

3

The Joint Assessment Mission report to the Oslo Donor Conference in April 2005 provided a comprehensive
view of development challenges in Sudan and outlined the areas in need of donor assistance. At that time,
donors pledged US$2 billion in development assistance to Sudan during 2005–07.

-5II. STOCKTAKING OF PERFORMANCE AND MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK
5.
Sudan’s economic performance in recent years has been good despite adverse
security conditions and the difficulties of concluding and implementing the CPA. Growth has
been robust, inflation has been at single-digit levels, and important reforms were undertaken.
The authorities attained macroeconomic stability, lifted price controls, set up liberal foreign
investment and foreign exchange regimes, pursued an ambitious privatization and
enterprise-restructuring program, and began a second phase of reforms to liberalize the trade
regime. The authorities have also finalized a strategy to try to attain the Millennium
Development Goals, increased pro-poor and investment spending in 2005, and plan to
finalize an interim Poverty Eradication Strategy in 2006.
6.
Notwithstanding these achievements, progress was not smooth and major challenges
remain. In the period ahead, Sudan’s main tests are to make the Government of National
Unity fully operational, achieve peace throughout the country, sustain growth and economic
stability, and reduce poverty. The difficulties in ensuring the effectiveness of the new
government (and the newly created North-South commissions) cannot be underestimated.
Similarly, resolving the crisis in Darfur and dealing with potential unrest in the Eastern
provinces is a major challenge. Sustaining growth and stability and fostering poverty
reduction will require further structural reforms and addressing the country’s social and
reconstruction needs. Lastly, the ongoing process of fiscal decentralization requires
improvements in implementation capacity, transparency, and coordination at different levels
of government.
7.
Sudan’s economic prospects are promising, but there are also risks. The
medium-term outlook, based on the continuation of reform policies, envisages growth of
8–10 percent per year, low inflation, and rising international reserves (Table 1). The
economic growth assumptions reflect the effects of the ongoing investment boom, the
improved prospects for the

While the outlook is favorable,
there are risks arising from the influence of anti-reform groups that may oppose necessary
reforms, unresolved domestic political tensions, and weak institutions (especially at the
subnational level).

-6III. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAM
8.
The CPA is being implemented, albeit with some delays. An interim national
constitution was put into force and the Government of National Unity and the government of
Southern Sudan were set up in mid-2005.4 The central government has begun transferring oil
revenues to the South as stipulated in the CPA, although the exact amounts due are still
under discussion.5 Furthermore, important commissions dealing with North-South borders,
the oil sector, and financial aspects of fiscal federalism are not yet functioning effectively.
9.
Progress has been made at the Darfur peace talks in Abuja, but the situation on
the ground remains precarious. There has been progress on a revenue sharing agreement as
well as on power-sharing and security arrangements. However, the security situation in
Darfur has deteriorated during the last year, and the international community has stepped up
pressure for strengthening peacekeeping operations in the region. Relations between Sudan
and Chad have also deteriorated because of allegations that each country is supporting rebel
forces in the other country.
10.
The economy has been growing at a fast pace and macroeconomic conditions
have been stable. Real GDP grew at an estimated rate of 8 percent in 2005, owing mainly to
a recovery in agriculture and robust activity in construction and services. After rapid growth
in 2003 and 2004, oil sector output remained virtually unchanged in 2005 at 287 thousand
barrels per day (Table 2). Average inflation in 2005 was contained at 8.5 percent. At endFebruary 2006, the 12-month rate of inflation was 5.8 percent.

11.
The external current account worsened in 2005, but the balance of payments
was supported by strong capital inflows. Oil export revenues rose because of higher oil
prices, but imports rose drastically and non-oil exports slowed. The latter suffered from
transportation bottlenecks, high domestic demand, and, possibly, real exchange rate
4

Under the new constitution, the national unity government has authority over national sovereignty, central
banking, and selected central government functions. The Government of Southern Sudan has a large degree of
autonomy (especially on fiscal matters) and responsibility for 10 states in the South.

5

The South’s share of revenues is based on oil production from fields in the South. However, the precise
demarcation of where all fields lie needs to await the work of a technical commission envisaged under the CPA.

strong trend in capital inflows continued
(mainly in the form of foreign direct foreign
investment in industrial, telecommunications,
transport, and banking activities) allowing for
a buildup of net international reserves from
1.9 months of imports at end-2004 to 2.6
months at end-2005 (Table 3).

Box 1: Exchange Rate Trends and Competitiveness
Since late 2004, improved market fundamentals coupled with a move towards a market-driven exchange
rate have led to an appreciation of the dinar. In 2005, the economy grew at fast pace and higher oil prices
led to a 35 percent increase in oil exports. In addition, foreign direct investment rose sharply from
US$1.8 billion in 2003 to US$3.8 billion in 2005.

Beyond the effects of growth and foreign exchange
inflows, higher levels of government spending have
also put pressure on nontraded goods’ prices and
contributed to the real appreciation. Prices of
nontraded goods (housing, water, and electricity)
grew at an average rate of 11 percent in 2004–05,
while prices of tradable goods (food, clothing, and
other consumer goods) grew by an average of
6 percent.

Nominal Effective Exchange Rate

Trade performance also suggests that competitiveness may be deteriorating, although other factors have
also played a role. In 2005, the volume of non-oil exports (mainly agricultural products and livestock)
fell. Export volumes were also affected by supply
constraints (inadequate capacity at the port,

(Indices 1995=100)
deterioration in the road infrastructure), conflict in
livestock-rich areas, and higher domestic demand.
140
130

Looking ahead, the oil sector boom coupled with
strong fundamentals will likely exert further upward
pressure on the equilibrium real exchange rate. This
highlights the importance of removing structural
bottlenecks and improving the business environment
to preserve competitiveness in non-oil export and
import-competing sectors.

After three years of surpluses, the fiscal balance turned into a deficit in 2005.
Oil revenue continued to rise, but it could not keep pace with the increase in government
spending (Table 4). Transfers to the South

In 2005, money demand remained high and the dinar appreciated. Money

respectively (Tables 5 and 6). Credit to the
10
Broad money
5
private sector also grew rapidly (by
0
65 percent) during the year.7 Money
demand pressures, backed by strong foreign
exchange inflows, translated into dinar
appreciation.

14.
Faced with a trade-off between higher inflation and exchange rate
appreciation, the authorities have appropriately allowed the exchange rate to
appreciate. In the context of Sudan’s managed floating exchange rate regime, the authorities
have been monitoring inflation developments closely and allowed the exchange rate to
appreciate in response to incipient inflationary pressures. While also aimed at containing
excessive exchange rate volatility, foreign exchange market intervention has been geared to
the attainment of the program’s foreign exchange accumulation reserves objectives rather
than targeting an implicit path for the exchange rate.
6

Fuel prices are set administratively and the estimated fuel subsidies are implicit; that is, they reflect domestic
sales at below export prices with no explicit compensation in the budget. The staff has urged the authorities to
record these subsidies as an explicit expenditure item and set an automatic adjustment mechanism to adjust them
in line with world prices.

7

About 60 percent of the new credit was channeled to the services and trade sectors. Regarding the
concentration of the new credit, almost 40 percent originated in a single bank. The central bank has stepped up
supervision of this bank to monitor its lending portfolio.

-915.
The authorities took steps to improve the import tariff structure and increase
flexibility in the foreign exchange market. As part of a three-year import-tariff reform
program, the authorities lowered the top tariff rate from 45 percent to 40 percent. The
average tariff fell to 20 percent, and there are plans to reduce it further to 15 percent or less
by 2008 (MEFP, ¶23). Regarding the foreign exchange market, the authorities have recently
allowed for further flexibility (through auctions) in the pricing of foreign exchange. Sudan
maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers
for current international transactions (Appendix I).
16.
Banking system soundness indicators improved in 2005. The ratio of
nonperforming loans to total loans fell from 8.9 percent in 2004 to 6.9 percent at end-2005.
During the same period, capital adequacy ratio for the banking system increased from
10.8 percent to 12 percent (Table 5).8
17.
The authorities made progress with the envisaged fiscal and financial sector
reforms. They set up a medium taxpayer unit to boost non-oil revenue collection, adopted
the Automated System for Customs Data at customs ports, and strengthened cash
management through cash plans and better coordination between the ministry of finance and
the central bank. Regarding monetary and financial sector reforms, the central bank
introduced competitive auctions of government securities, implemented a new financing
window for banks using collateral-based certificates, and privatized a large bank (Khartoum
Bank). The authorities have also been setting up the new federal structure in the banking
system (required by the CPA) by enacting laws to restructure the central bank and banking
activities and by establishing a branch of the central bank in the South. Furthermore, the
central bank has formulated a strategy for screening mergers and acquisitions and opened the
banking sector to foreign banks.9
18.
Performance under the 2005 SMP was broadly satisfactory. Three of the five
quantitative targets and all but one structural benchmark for end-December 2005 were met
(Tables 7 and 8). The target on the domestic financing of the fiscal deficit was missed by a
small margin, while the ceiling on nonconcessional borrowing was not observed as
US$935 million in loans were contracted during the year. The authorities explained that, in
the absence of concessional financing, these loans financed key water and electricity
projects.10 The structural benchmark on converting the 2006 budget in GFSM 2001 format
was delayed because of technical difficulties in the preparation of the budget; the authorities
expect to implement this measure in May 2006.

8

It should be noted that measures of regulatory capital in Sudan are artificially high because fixed assets are
improperly counted as capital. The authorities are reviewing accounting norms for commercial banks to correct
the problem.

9

In 2005, the authorities granted four licenses for new banks.

10

Project-related nonconcessional loan contracts with China amounted to US$814 million, while contracts with
the Islamic Development Bank and the Arab Monetary Fund amounted to US$102 million. Iran provided a loan
for U$S19 million with a grant element of 25 percent.

- 10 IV. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
19.
The discussions focused on economic policies for 2006 and macro-relevant
structural measures to sustain growth and foster poverty reduction, and the 2006 SMP. The
main Article IV issues relate to the need to consolidate macroeconomic stability and pursue
pending reforms. In this context, particular attention was given to the need to streamline tax
exemptions, create the conditions for successful fiscal decentralization, improve efficiency
and transparency in public sector operations, and support continued private sector
development in light of the recent appreciation of the dinar. The program for 2006 contains
measures to maintain inflation in single-digits, keep the fiscal deficit under control, reorient
public spending to increase pro-poor outlays and reduce fuel subsidies, and implement key
measures to improve fiscal and oil-sector transparency and reform the financial sector.
A. Macroeconomic Policies
20.
The economic outlook for 2006, underpinned by higher oil output, is favorable.
The macroeconomic framework envisages GDP growth of 13 percent and average inflation
of 7.5 percent. The non-oil sector is expected to grow by 7 percent, but oil production will
increase by nearly 70 percent (to 492,000 barrels per day) as two new oil fields come on
stream. The new oil (Dar blend) is of lower quality compared to Sudan’s traditional oil (Nile
blend). The forecast for 2006 envisages prices of US$55 and US$40 per barrel of Nile blend
and Dar blend, respectively.

The fiscal framework is based on revised oil revenue and expenditure projections compared to the original
2006 budget. The authorities intend to inform Parliament about the changes to the original budget as mentioned
in the MEFP.
12

Given the potential for crowding out associated with high domestic borrowing, the authorities’ program
envisages a decline in borrowing from the nonbank sector from 1.3 percent of GDP in 2005 to 0.7 percent of
GDP in 2006.

- 11 oil output, while non-oil revenues are expected to increase because of improvements in
administration (including tax collection in the South) and a rationalization of tax exemptions
(see Section B below). The oil savings account is expected to accumulate the equivalent of
1.4 percentage points of GDP in 2006.
23.
Given the need to preserve macroeconomic stability, the authorities’ fiscal
framework for 2006 envisages a reorientation of expenditures away from lower priority
areas. The fiscal framework envisages a moderate growth in outlays on wages and on goods
and services and a smaller fuel subsidy.13 The authorities recognize that the fuel subsidy does
not benefit the poor and, despite opposition from vested interest groups, intend to begin
dealing with the problem in 2006. They consider that a large increase in fuel prices could be
counterproductive, but will be informing the public about the costs of the subsidy and
developing a strategy for the automatic pass-through of changes in world prices in the
future.14
24.
The authorities’ plan to devolve resources to the states and foster national unity
through infrastructure investments entails a sizable increase in public spending. Central
government transfers to the South and to northern states are expected to grow significantly
in 2006. The bulk of the latter (meant for state-level spending on health, education, and
water) and some national capital expenditures are deemed pro-poor.15 The authorities
recognize that capacity constraints will condition the effectiveness of such spending, but see
their strategy as the only option to reduce poverty in disadvantaged areas and prevent the
disintegration of the country.
25.
Successful decentralization will require good budget preparation procedures,
sound budgetary and financial management, transparency, and effective monitoring.
Careful coordination of expenditure and borrowing plans between the Government of
Southern Sudan, the northern states, and the central government will be critical in
safeguarding macroeconomic stability. The newly created Fiscal and Financial Allocation
and Monitoring Commission (FFAMC) established under the CPA will need to lead and
coordinate work in these areas.
26.
The authorities plan to focus on attaining reserve money targets in an
environment of exchange rate flexibility. Reserve and broad money growth are targeted at
25 percent and 28 percent, respectively, consistent with the GDP growth and inflation
objectives and with an increase in money demand driven by financial deepening and the
reintegration of the South. The conduct of monetary policy will require the flexible use of
13

While some fuels are priced close to international levels, selected fuels such as gas oil carry a large subsidy
element. Sudan’s level of (implicit) fuel subsidies in 2005 (3.5 percent of GDP) was in the middle range
compared to other oil exporters. The staff estimates that a price increase of 60 percent will be needed to
eliminate the subsidy on gas oil.

14

The decline in the fuel subsidy in 2006 reflects, in part, a decline in fuel imports that enjoy a higher subsidy
per unit compensated by a significant increase in the domestic production of such products. The subsidy is also
lower because of the recent appreciation of the dinar and lower oil prices in 2006.

15

The aggregate level of pro-poor spending in 2006 is close to the more than doubling of such spending (in
percent of GDP) promised by the government at the Oslo Donors’ Conference in 2005.

- 12 instruments (e.g. domestic open market operations and foreign exchange market operations)
to deal with a number of uncertainties such as the fiscal behavior of subnational
governments, money demand in the South, and foreign exchange inflows. While the
authorities expressed concern about exchange rate appreciation pressures and external
competitiveness, they agreed with the staff that maintaining flexibility in the exchange rate
combined with improvements in the business environment through structural reforms is the
most appropriate policy response. In this regard, they intend to carry out a World Banksponsored investment climate assessment later this year.
B. Structural Reforms
27.
The authorities agreed on the need to reinvigorate the reform momentum by
proceeding with the implementation of pending reforms. The discussions covered selected
reforms in the following areas: tax policy and administration, expenditure management, oil
sector transparency, and financial system restructuring.
28.
Tax policy and administration. Following efforts over the last few years to
streamline exemptions and improve administration, the authorities recognize the need to
reinvigorate reforms in these areas (Box 2). As part of the program, they intend to stop the
renewal of expired business-profits tax and customs-duty exemptions, introduce
self-assessment for large and medium-sized taxpayers, and set up three federal tax offices in
major cities in the South. The authorities also intend to prepare a program to revamp the
system of investment incentives in line with best international practices.
Box 2: Tax Reforms—Progress and Future Agenda
Sudan has carried out important tax policy and administration reforms in recent years. The main policy
reforms were the introduction of a value-added tax, the phasing out of privileges for major oil
distribution companies, and the removal of income tax exemptions. Key administration reforms involved
setting up large and medium taxpayer units, enforcing departmental fee collection, and implementing the
Automated System for Customs Data. Because of these reforms, non-oil tax revenues as a share of
non-oil GDP rose from 7 percent in 2002 to 9.9 percent in 2005.
Notwithstanding these achievements, further reforms are needed:
•

The Investment Encouragement Act should be modified by removing tax holidays and customs
duty exemptions while grandfathering existing beneficiaries. To improve the costeffectiveness of investment promotion, a system of accelerated depreciation should be
implemented.

•

A low (20 percent or less) uniform business profit tax (currently, there are different rates
depending on the type of economic activity) needs to be adopted.

•

VAT exemptions, especially on capital goods and selected consumer goods need to be scaled
back.

•

Improve audit and collection enforcement by the large taxpayers unit and implement
self-assessments by taxpayers and risk-based methods in tax and customs administration.

- 13 29.
Expenditure management. The authorities recognize that the success of the rapid
move to a decentralized system of public finances depends on appropriate regulations,
implementation capacity, transparent reporting, and effective monitoring mechanisms. At
present, however, capacity in the South and other states is weaker than at the central
government, highlighting the need for urgent investments in administration and training. A
key initial step is to ensure the efficient operations of the new Fiscal and Financial Allocation
and Monitoring Commission (FFAMC). At the same time, close cooperation between the
federal government, the Government of Southern Sudan, and other state governments will be
essential to coordinate development planning and implementation and attain good
macroeconomic outcomes (Box 3). Regarding fiscal reporting, the authorities intend to
pursue an ambitious timetable for compiling budget execution reports according to the
GFSM 2001 format (covering operations of the central government and the government of
Southern Sudan). Lastly, the government is conducting its first public expenditure review in
consultation with the World Bank (Fund staff will assist on revenue management).
Box 3: Macroeconomic Challenges of Implementing the CPA
The CPA contains numerous peace-related provisions (including the modalities of power and wealth
sharing with the South) and strengthens the federal system of government in Sudan. On the monetary
front, the CPA envisages a new national currency and a single monetary policy conducted from
Khartoum. On fiscal matters, the CPA confers autonomy to the South by transferring a share of national
oil revenues and allowing the South to levy state taxes and retain one-half of the federal taxes collected
in the region. The Government of Southern Sudan and other states can also borrow at home or abroad.
The challenges of implementation and the implications for macroeconomic outcomes are manifold:
•

Monetary policy. The central bank plans to introduce conventional instruments of monetary
policy in the South because of the dual nature of the new banking system stipulated in the CPA
(Islamic banking in the north and conventional banking in the South). The central bank will also
need to strengthen its regulatory and supervisory capacity to cover banks in the South.

•

Single currency. Introducing a new currency is essential to provide for a single means of
payments in the South, develop its economy, and integrate the South with the rest of the
country.

•

Tax collection. The Government of Southern Sudan lacks capacity and infrastructure to collect
taxes in its territory. Customs posts and tax offices will gradually begin to operate this year.

•

Coordination of spending. Coordinating the composition of expenditures will be essential to
ensure the harmonization between national projects and those in the South and allow the central
government to formulate a countrywide public expenditure program. Coordinating the timing of
expenditures is also crucial to ensure a smooth conduct of monetary policy.

•

Transparency and monitoring. The FFAMC will be critical to ensure transparency and monitor
the allocation of nationally collected funds to the Government of Southern Sudan and northern
states.

•

Coordination on budget preparation and execution. Coordination on budget preparation and
execution (including coordination of borrowing plans) will be necessary to safeguard fiscal
sustainability and macroeconomic stability.

- 14 30.
Oil sector transparency. The authorities’ near-term reforms in this area include the
monthly publication of detailed oil sector data, the completion and publishing of the audit of
Sudapet (a state-owned oil company with equity stakes in a number of fields), and the
regularization of the hitherto ad hoc transfers of profits from the state-owned oil companies
to the treasury (MEFP, ¶21). The authorities are also expected to clarify the operational role
of the National Petroleum Commission, a high-level body created under the CPA to manage
oil sector policy.
31.
Financial system restructuring. Cognizant of the importance of implementing
CPA-related financial sector reforms, the authorities intend to proceed with the restructuring
of the central bank and the introduction of the new currency. MFD has been providing
intensive technical assistance in these areas. The most critical reform is the introduction of
the new currency, and the authorities are aware of the risks involved, i.e., inappropriate
planning for distribution and lack of safeguards to prevent fraud at the time of implementing
the currency exchange. Following on the Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA)
prepared in March 2005, the authorities are also proceeding with a strategy to restructure
commercial banks based on increasing minimum capital requirements and capital adequacy
ratios and ensuring banks’ compliance with prudential norms.
C. External Debt and Relations with Creditors
32.
Sudan’s debt overhang continues to condition development prospects. At end2005, the stock of public and publicly guaranteed external debt was US$27.7 billion, of
which US$24.4 billion was in arrears.16 In present value terms, the estimated stock of debt is
US$26 billion, or about 690 percent of the three-year average of exports of goods and
services. The authorities are worried that, after seven years of successful implementation of
consecutive SMPs, Sudan’s pressing needs to finance programs for achieving the Millennium
Development Goals cannot be met because of lack of access to concessional resources
related to Sudan’s debt problems.
33.
To strengthen Sudan’s record of cooperation with the Fund, the authorities
committed to increase the level of payments to the Fund to US$45 million in 2006. In
recent years, Sudan’s payments to the Fund have exceeded obligations falling due, leading to
a small decline in arrears. In 2005, Sudan paid US$30 million to the Fund as envisaged under
the SMP. The staff emphasized the importance of increasing payments to the Fund in light of
the deterioration of a number of indicators showing payments as a share of debt service
capacity (Table 9). The authorities have taken this decision notwithstanding the need to
deliver a peace dividend and a reduction in the fiscal space because of the requirements of
the CPA.17

16

About 70 percent of the debt is owed to official bilateral creditors (almost equally divided between Paris Club
and non-Paris Club creditors). The remaining debt is owed to multilateral institutions (17 percent) and
commercial creditors (13 percent).

17

As shown in Table 9, the increase in payments has begun to reverse the erosion of Sudan’s payments to the
Fund in relation to various indicators of debt service capacity, including official reserves.

- 15 34.
Sudan has been making debt service payments to almost all multilateral
creditors and selected bilateral creditors that have provided new financing in recent
years. In 2005, multilateral creditors excluding the IMF, World Bank, and the African
Development Bank made a net resource transfer of US$74 million, while Arab bilateral
creditors made a net transfer of US$68 million. In the same year, Sudan paid other bilateral
creditors (China, India, and Malaysia) a net amount of US$84 million. These creditors have
financed a number of water and electricity projects in recent years (IMF Country Report
No.05/180).
35.
The staff urged the authorities to minimize nonconcessional borrowing, noting
the potential complications with a potential debt relief operation and the higher cost of debt
relief for existing creditors. The authorities emphasized that their strategy to foster national
unity called for undertaking substantial investment projects and that, in light of the limited
fiscal space after the peace agreement and lack of access to concessional financing, they had
to finance these projects from other sources. They also noted that these loans should be
viewed as exceptional and that they are project-specific facilities to be disbursed over a
number of years, not direct budget support. Lastly, the authorities expressed concern that it
may take a long time until sanctions are removed and Sudan can regularize its debt situation.
The authorities’ initial borrowing plans for 2006 amounted to US$1.1 billion. The staff
pressed the authorities to prioritize their projects and minimize this type of borrowing. The
authorities later indicated that they could limit this type of borrowing to about
US$700 million. Almost two-thirds of the borrowing would be for projects related to the
reconstruction of a North-South railway and the construction of roads to the South and to
Darfur.18 The authorities acknowledged the concern of Sudan’s creditors about this
borrowing, and committed to limit contracting these facilities as much as possible, especially
if concessional financing becomes available.
D. Data Issues and Technical Assistance
36.
Sudan’s economic data is sufficient for surveillance and program monitoring,
but inadequacies remain. The quality of Sudan’s economic data has improved in recent
years, especially through the participation in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System.
Monetary and financial sector statistics are comprehensive and timely, and detailed data on
oil sector shipments, revenues, and payments are available regularly. However, fiscal
expenditure data are not compatible with GFS methodology, national accounts are virtually
nonexistent, details on oil production from new blocks are not available, and statistics on
capital goods imports and foreign direct investment are weak.
37.
In the near term, Sudan’s technical assistance priorities comprise the adoption of
GFSM 2001 methodology (budget classification, accounting, auditing, and reporting); tax
administration; fiscal decentralization and public financial management; issuance of the new
currency; banking supervision and liquidity management; and fiscal and real sector statistics.
The Fund is coordinating a technical assistance program on financial sector reforms and is
18

The remaining amount is intended for water and irrigation projects. The authorities noted that these intentions
are plans and not final operations. They indicated that they would seek to obtain the highest possible degree of
concessionality and will not use oil as collateral. These potential loans are not yet factored in the fiscal or the
balance of payments projections.

- 16 expected to continue providing assistance on some of the fiscal areas mentioned above. In
addition, with occasional support from Fund staff, the World Bank will continue providing
technical assistance to the Government of Southern Sudan on several areas including public
financial management.
E. The 2006 Staff-Monitored Program
38.
The program for 2006 aims at maintaining macroeconomic stability, ensuring
the implementation of macro-relevant commitments under the CPA, and increasing
fiscal and oil sector transparency. The macroeconomic objectives and the policy
commitments are described in the MEFP and were mentioned in sections A-C above. The
program contains measures to keep inflation at no more than 7.5 percent, increase budget
allocations on social and infrastructure projects, and lower the fuel subsidy. Other
commitments include establishing rules and procedures for the FFAMC, beginning fiscal
reporting according to GFS, publishing detailed oil sector data and oil-related transfers to the
South, and introducing the new national currency.
V. RISKS TO THE OUTLOOK
39.
Sudan’s economic prospects are good, but significant risks exist. The main risk is a
weakening of political resolve to maintain macroeconomic stability, advance critical reforms,
and foster Sudan’s integration with the world economy. This could set off a negative cycle of
bad policies and worsening prospects for a united and peaceful Sudan. At the same time, the
authorities’ hope that Sudan’s good performance under successive SMPs over the past seven
years would pave the way for a resolution of Sudan’s debt problems has not yet materialized.
While the authorities want to foster Sudan’s integration with the world economy and are
aware of the negative impact of developments in Darfur on the views of key creditor
countries, they are also concerned that the persistence of the external arrears problems and
the lack of concessional financing may make it more difficult to continue implementing the
reform agenda.
40.
The lack of resolve could manifest itself in delayed action to lower fuel subsidies
and implement fiscal and oil-sector transparency reforms as well as an inability to adhere to
the fiscal spending ceilings. There are also potential pitfalls in trying to mount a modern
administration in the South and in other states, prevent wasteful spending of transfers to
subnational governments, and carry out a successful monetary policy amidst unpredictable
spending patterns of subnational governments.

- 17 VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
Despite a difficult year marked by the beginning of the implementation of the CPA
and a deterioration of the security situation in Darfur, the authorities managed to strike a
balance between the pressures for a peace dividend and policies that maintained
macroeconomic stability. Economic growth in the non-oil sector was robust, foreign direct
investment reached new heights, and inflation was contained within single-digit levels.
While there were some slippages on budget execution (mainly because of the fuel subsidy)
and a higher-than-projected level of nonconcessional borrowing, most of the quantitative and
structural targets under the program were met. As a result, performance under the 2005 SMP
was broadly satisfactory. Since some policy actions were delayed last year, the authorities
will need to press ahead with those policies and other critical reforms to achieve their
objectives.
42.
The program for 2006 aims at sustaining Sudan’s recent record of high growth,
preserving macroeconomic stability, and meeting the country’s development and poverty
reduction needs. The program contains a prudent fiscal framework with realistic revenue and
expenditure assumptions, as well as a reorientation of public spending toward social and
infrastructure investments. The staff is particularly encouraged by the authorities’
commitment to improve fiscal and oil sector transparency. However, the continued reliance
on nonconcessional borrowing is a serious concern.
43.
Despite an increase in oil revenues in 2005–06, the fiscal space of the central
government has been constrained because of the sizable increase in transfers required by the
peace agreement and decentralization. The increase in transfers, coupled with higher capital
expenditures, will lead to a substantial increase in pro-poor development spending. At the
same time, the authorities will need to focus on improving expenditure management and
monitor closely the effectiveness of the additional spending. In this context, the intended
reorientation of public spending is welcome, including the much-needed steps to reduce fuel
subsidies. Regarding the latter, the staff urges the authorities to bring domestic fuel prices in
line with export prices and develop an automatic mechanism for future price adjustments.
44.
The staff urges the authorities to press ahead with the fiscal reform priorities. These
include rationalizing investment incentives to protect the non-oil tax revenues; building
capacity, transparency, and accountability at all levels of government to support
decentralization; and improving fiscal transparency through the adoption of GFS
methodology. The authorities also need to redouble their efforts to ensure close coordination
between the Government of Southern Sudan, the northern states, and the central government.
45.
Monetary policy should continue to focus on attaining the authorities’ inflation
objectives in an environment of exchange rate flexibility. Fiscal prudence and a proactive
monetary policy with close management of reserve money will help to ensure that inflation
remains subdued. The authorities will also need to ensure flexibility in the pricing of foreign
exchange to prevent the excessive monetization of external inflows and thus accommodate a
prospective real exchange rate appreciation without rekindling inflationary pressures. In this
regard, the current managed floating exchange rate regime remains appropriate. At the same
time, structural reforms to remove structural rigidities and lower transactions costs will be

- 18 the best way to safeguard external competitiveness and improve profitability in non-oil
exports and import-competing sectors.
46.
The authorities should be commended for the implementation of a number of
financial system provisions of the CPA. In 2006, the central bank will need to proceed with
its internal restructuring, provide the basis for the effective functioning of a dual banking
system, and introduce the new currency. The staff urges the authorities to embark on a
well-planned, expeditious, and transparent process to introduce the new currency given the
importance of the latter in fostering development in the South and the country’s economic
integration.
47.
Sudan’s external debt problems continue to constrain access to external
development financing. Sudan’s record of cooperation on economic policies and payments to
the Fund in recent years augur well for the clearance of Sudan’s arrears at the appropriate
time. In the meantime, the authorities’ should strive to minimize contracting nonconcessional
debt as such borrowing threatens debt sustainability and could delay the process of securing
creditors’ participation in a potential debt-relief operation. In this regard, the staff
underscores that it will be critical for creditors and Sudan to treat all such new borrowing
under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries’ Initiative. This will ensure that any eventual relief
provided under the Initiative is sufficient to restore debt sustainability.
48.
Looking ahead, the authorities should focus on the implementation of the CPA,
sustained efforts to achieve peace throughout the country, capacity building, and the effective
use of Sudan’s oil wealth. In the near term, the main risk is a weakening of the reform effort.
In this regard, the authorities should also strive to preserve macroeconomic stability and
proceed with the reforms envisaged in the 2006 program. These include conducting a prudent
monetary policy in a flexible exchange rate environment, adhering to the fiscal spending
targets, monitoring the effectiveness of public spending, lowering fuel subsidies, and
proceeding with the envisaged fiscal and oil-sector reforms.
49.
While the proposed level of nonconcessional borrowing implies that in this area the
program is no longer equivalent to an upper-credit tranche arrangement, the SMP is a
valuable tool to support the reform momentum at a critical juncture in the country’s history
when the CPA needs to be implemented amidst a complex political environment.
The program contains important actions to preserve economic stability and increase fiscal
and oil-sector transparency as well as higher payments to the Fund. It also provides a
framework within which donors can support the peace process and afflicted areas. Except for
the high level of nonconcessional borrowing, the staff considers that the 2006 SMP continues
to be equivalent in strength to a Rights Accumulation Program.
50.
Sudan’s economic data remains generally adequate for surveillance and program
monitoring. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Sudan be held according
to the standard 12-month cycle.

Sources: Sudanese authorities; and Fund Staff estimates and projections.
1/ From 2005 onwards, oil revenues are reported on an accrual basis and are valued at international prices.
2/ For 2006, the authorities have reclassified about SDD 30 billion (0.4 percent of GDP) of expenditures on wages and salaries
to the states from Chapter 3 to Chapter 1.
3/ The gross shortfall in oil revenues from the low consumer prices is accounted for as a subsidy within
Chapter Two expenditures. The figure does not include the proceeds from excise taxes on some oil products.
4/ Oil-related transfers as per the peace agreement with the south.
5/ In 2006 the authorities plan to privatize a total of 13 entities including Sudan Telecommunications Company, Sudan Airways,
Seaports corporation and the National Building and Construction Company.
6/ Excluding grants. In percent of non-oil GDP. The reduction in the ratio in 2005 reflects a drop in excise rates.
7/ Includes estimated capital spending by subnational governments. Before 2006 a part of the transfers were expenditures carried out by

Sources: Sudanese authorities; and Fund staff estimates.
1/ Outstanding stock at end-2004.
2/ As specified by the technical memorandum of understanding (IMF Country Report No. 05/180, attachment I), the program targets for domestic financing of the budget
deficit and for changes in the NDA of the central bank have been reduced, and the international reserves target have been raised by the difference between programmed
and actual revenues accumulated in the oil savings account.
3/ Defined as total net borrowing by the government, including net borrowing from the central bank (including Government Musharaka Certificates (GMCs)
and changes in deposits of the central government with the central bank but excluding oil savings account), net sales of GMCs outside the central bank,
revenues from privatization, and repayments of domestic arrears.
4/ This target applies not only to debt as defined in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt
(Decision No. 12274 - (00/85), August 24, 2000), but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received.
Debt will be deemed to be concessional when the currency-specific discount rate (determined by the market-related “commercial interest reference rates
(CIRR)” as published by the OECD) applied to the contractual schedule of charges and principal payments indicates a grant element of at least 35 percent.
The target excludes the financing of the Merowe hydropower project. The end-December target in the revised program has been increased
to reflect a higher-than-programmed oil price.
5/ Including foreign banknotes in the vaults of the central bank.

Exchange Rate Arrangements

The legal tender is the Sudanese dinar, which replaced the Sudanese pound in proportion
SDD 1=LSd 10 in 1999. Since October 1998, the exchange rate system has been unified—market
participants trade freely within a unified regulatory framework. In 2001, the foreign exchange
market came under pressure and the Central Bank of Sudan (CBOS) introduced a formal band of
+1.5 percent (later broadened to 2 percent) around the official rate and began auctioning its
foreign exchange within the band. In May 2003, the CBOS adopted a managed-floating exchange
rate regime. The formal exchange rate band was abandoned and the auction system was replaced
with direct transactions in the interbank market. The CBOS established an internal limit of
+2 percent in intraday trading in the average daily market rate. In 2004, the CBOS changed the
permissible intraday exchange rate fluctuation from +2 percentage points to +3 percentage points.
Sudan maintains one inoperative bilateral payment agreement with Egypt and an inoperative
payment clearing account with the former Soviet Union. Sudan maintains an exchange system that
is free of restrictions on the making payments and transfers for current international transactions.20

Sudan is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation discussion was

In November 2005, the authorities removed two remaining exchange restrictions under Article VIII, Sections
2, 3 and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. At that time, they lifted the prohibition that applies to importers
in arrears with valid import licenses from executing payments and transfers for import transactions and
eliminated the multiple currency practice arising from the use of a historic buying rate for the resale of export
proceeds.

APPENDIX II

SUDAN: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK21
(As of March 17, 2006)
The World Bank has no active lending portfolio in Sudan because of Sudan’s default on its
financial obligations to the Bank, which led to the suspension of disbursements in
April 1993. After discussions between the Bank and the Sudanese authorities on the need for
Sudan to take steps toward normalizing its relations and establishing a track record with the
Bank, the authorities started making “good faith” payments of US$1 million per month to the
Bank since July 1999 and US$500,000 per month since October 2002. The amount of
payments has not been sufficient to prevent a continued accumulation of arrears, which stood
at about US$372 million as of March 16, 2006 (from US$145 million at the end of 1999).
Sudan’s outstanding Bank debt, including arrears, is approximately US$1.3 billion.
The Bank was mostly absent from Sudan between 1992 and 2002. In the 1970s and 1980s,
the Bank was a major player in the reconstruction of Sudan, following the Addis Ababa
peace agreement of 1972. As the prospects for peace with the South rose in 2003, the Bank
formulated a strategy for reengaging with Sudan in the event of peace. This strategy,
described in the Sudan Country Reengagement Note (CRN), was discussed by the Executive
Board of Directors on July 10, 2003. Main areas of emphasis in the CRN are knowledge
generation and sharing, capacity building to support policy reform, demonstration projects to
improve delivery of social services, and resolution of the debt overhang. In addition to
capacity building, the Bank, together with the Fund, provided technical resource persons for
the discussions around wealth sharing in the peace talks. The Bank is also providing
technical support to the Darfur peace talks in Abuja, Nigeria.
Between January 2004 and March 2005, the Bank co-led (with the UN) a Joint Assessment
Mission (JAM), covering eight thematic sectors. 22 IMF staff participated in a number of
workshops and contributed to the economic policy cluster. The JAM synthesis report:
“Framework for Transition, Reconstruction and Poverty Eradication,” was completed in
March 2005. The Report outlines the reconstruction and development needs for Sudan over
the six year Interim Period as well as a Monitoring Framework that reflects policy reforms
and commitments made by the government which are needed to implement the
Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA). The Report, presented at an April 2005 Donors’
Conference in Oslo, raised US$2.0 billion in pledges for 2005–2007.
To report on progress on policy commitments and to renew financial pledges, it was agreed
that a twice-yearly Sudan Consortium meeting would be held. The first meeting of the
Consortium took place in Paris on March 9 and 10, 2006. During the Consortium, the

35

government reported on progress and an assessment made by the Bank, IMF and UN laid out
the joint views of staff with respect to the credibility and implementation of the policies and
programs, key constraints, and proposed next steps. Particular attention was paid to the need
for improved public expenditure and revenue management at all levels of government as well
as good governance. The broad conclusion was that progress is being made in
implementation of the CPA, although there have been delays (i.e. need for effective
functioning of the National Petroleum Commission and other institutions). The centrality of
poverty eradication and the MDGs was reaffirmed; however, the government must follow
through with the implementation of commitments on pro-poor development. Donors also
reconfirmed the levels of financial pledges made at the 2005 Oslo Donors’ Meeting.
The Comprehensive Peace Agreement agreed between the government of Sudan and the
Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM) specified that two Multi-Donor Trust Funds
(MDTFs) be established to facilitate the coordination of external donor financing of Sudan’s
reconstruction and development needs as laid out in the JAM. One fund would be for the new
National Government (NG) for war-affected areas in the north and the transition zones, and
one for the government of Southern Sudan (GoSS). The MDTFs would remain operational
through the six years of the Interim Period. MDTF-financed activities would be within the
context of a unified budget and a coherent public expenditure process. Approximately
US$500 million was pledged in Oslo toward to two Trust Funds, nearly all of which has been
formally committed over 2005-2007. The World Bank is the Administrator for both MDTFs.
The MDTFs are now effective and the first projects have been approved.
As part of the JAM, a workshop with the government and the SPLM initiated work on a joint
strategy for poverty eradication (PRSP). IMF staff also participated. During this workshop,
the parties reached an agreement on a shared vision for poverty eradication, with an
articulation of strategic objectives and associated operational implications. A joint concept
note was developed that provides the foundation for a national Poverty Eradication Strategy.
Based on this work, the interim PRSP is expected to be finalized in 2006.
To support capacity building and policy reform, a US$4.5 million Low-Income Countries
under Stress (LICUS) trust-fund grant for Sudan was approved in December 2004. The grant
focuses on capacity building and institutional development of fiduciary and aid-management
systems both in the North and in the South. The trust fund complements two ongoing Post
Conflict Fund grants from the World Bank totaling US$3.0 million.
The World Bank is also preparing a Public Expenditure Review (PER), with selected broad
activities, which are distinct for the NG and the GoSS. The proposed approach is pragmatic
in that a series of distinct activities are being designed to build joint understanding and
ownership and to begin to address capacity-building needs through end-2007. IMF staff will
participate in this work in the areas of their competence. Lastly, World Bank staff is working
at a technical level with the IMF and other multilateral creditors to explore options for
clearance of arrears and debt relief.

APPENDIX III

SUDAN: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Available economic data are generally adequate for surveillance and program monitoring.
However, there are many areas where further improvements are needed, particularly in
compiling national accounts, state budgetary data, and external trade and financial statistics.
This appendix discusses outstanding statistical issues by sector.
As a participant in the Department for International Development (DFID) project for
Anglophone African countries, Sudan has been receiving technical assistance in various
statistical issues. DFID financed three Statistics Department (STA) missions in June–
July 2003 (monetary and financial statistics, balance of payments statistics, and the General
Data Dissemination System (GDDS) metadata completion), contributing to Sudan’s
participation in the GDDS starting in August 2003.
In early 2004, Sudan also received assistance for the initial stages of preparation of a
strategic plan for the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). In May 2005, an STA/METAC
mission assessed the technical assistance needs in macroeconomic statistics and identified
emerging statistical priorities in the statistics-producing agencies. In December 2005, a
follow-up mission on monetary and financial statistics visited Khartoum to assist the
authorities in further implementing the action plan developed by the mission in 2003.
I.

REAL SECTOR

In recent years, practices in the production of the monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) have
been commendable. Monthly CPI data for the Khartoum area are provided shortly after the
end of each month, while the CPI for other states is provided with a three-month lag.
The compilation of the national accounts is subject to delay. The national accounts statistics
suffer from a lack of basic information for many sectors, including oil, livestock,
horticulture, and most services. On the expenditure side, data are lacking on final
consumption by households, investment, and changes in stocks. There are no national
accounts or industrial production data at sub annual frequencies. Furthermore, the annual
data are being reported with a lag of over three years. There is an urgent need to increase
funding to the CBS and rebuild its capacity. Priorities include introducing the 1993 System of
National Accounts, conducting a census of agricultural production, carrying out a household
survey, producing poverty statistics, and improving coordination between the CBS, the
Ministry of Finance and National Economy (MOFNE), the Ministry of Energy and Mining,
and the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock. A peripatetic real sector expert provided
technical assistance on national accounts through end-2003.

- 37 -

II.

FISCAL SECTOR

Government Finance Statistics are broadly adequate for program monitoring, with the main
revenue, expenditure, and financing items reported on a monthly basis with a lag of about
one month. Financing items are consistent with the monetary accounts. The reported
statistics are for the central government only, and do not include the states and publicly
owned corporations. Data are submitted using an outdated economic classification and, while
the allocation of resources by MOFNE to the various ministries is reported, their actual
expenditures are not. There is an urgent need to improve accounting and reporting
procedures, introduce GFS classifications according to guidelines provided in the
Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2001, and implement technical assistance
recommendations on GFS. Monthly and quarterly fiscal data are not reported for the
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook or for the International Financial Statistics (IFS).
The October 2005 mission assisted the authorities in developing a budget classification and
budget execution reports in line with the GFSM 2001 methodology.
III.

MONETARY SECTOR

Sudan has received significant technical assistance to improve the collection, compilation,
and dissemination of monetary and financial statistics. The most recent STA mission took
place in December 2005, and assisted in implementing the ongoing action plan. Progress has
been made in several areas including finalizing the new report form and its accompanying
guidelines, which were scheduled for pilot testing during the first quarter of 2006. The
weekly flash report on the activities of the Central Bank of Sudan (CBOS) is consistent with
relevant components in the depository corporations’ survey as recommended in the Monetary
and Financial Statistics Manual.
In general, the monetary statistics compiled by the CBOS are acceptable for monitoring
purposes. However, the central bank should complete the harmonization of its accounting
codes and network connections as this would improve data collection and compilation. In
addition, the central bank should work with the Ministry of Finance to review and reconcile
government accounts held with the banking system to ensure their appropriate classification
in the monetary survey. There is also a need to develop a framework for future collection and
incorporation of South Sudan’s banking activities into the monetary statistics. Another
follow-up mission on monetary and financial statistics to Sudan will be considered after the
authorities have completed the priority actions recommended by the December 2005 mission.
IV.

EXTERNAL SECTOR

Daily exchange rate data are reported to the Fund with minimal lags, but there are several
areas for improvement in the external accounts, particularly with regard to foreign direct
investment, trade, and oil statistics. The authorities need to provide clarification on items that
qualify as international reserves in general, and those earmarked reserves in particular, and

- 38 -

should begin compiling the data template on international reserves and foreign currency
liquidity.
Regarding import statistics, there are significant discrepancies between the reports from
customs and from the central bank. The July 2003 STA mission identified some possible
causes and, in collaboration with the authorities, attempted to reconcile the data. The mission
reported some progress on implementing previous STA recommendations. However, the lack
of survey data continues to affect the compilation of important balance of payments items
such as foreign direct investment.
Medium-term oil production projections and data on amortization of private sector debt need
substantial improvement. The authorities have made some progress in improving oil
projections, but need to provide more detailed information on the phasing-in and expected
production levels of new blocks and on amortization of debt in the oil sector.

ATTACHMENT I

March 9, 2006
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Mr. de Rato,
Slightly more than a year ago a historical peace agreement was signed that ended more than twenty
years of civil war between the north and the South of Sudan. Implementation of the Comprehensive
Peace Agreement is now underway and we have formed a new government of national unity. This
government has now turned its efforts to peacefully resolving the Darfur crisis. To this effect, we have
been an active and good faith party in the peace talks currently held in Abuja.
Meanwhile we have sought to implement economic policies that aim at maintaining economic stability,
fostering growth, and reducing poverty. We believe these will be important factors in promoting peace
and reconciliation throughout the country. We appreciate in that respect the close and long-standing
policy dialog with the Fund. Discussions with Fund staff on the 2006 Article IV consultation, and on a
new Staff Monitored Program for 2006 were conducted in Khartoum in February 2006.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) sets forth our policy intentions
under the 2006 SMP. We are committed to maintain macroeconomic stability and advance the reform
agenda. The government believes that these policies are adequate to achieve the objectives of the
program and will consult with the Fund on any revision of the policies contained in the MEFP.
Notwithstanding the enormous financing needs for national reconstruction and peace that we face,
and to strengthen our cooperation, we propose to increase our payments to the Fund from $30 million
in 2005 to $45 million in 2006.
We are committed to a process of economic integration both within Sudan and with the international
community, but our success depend also on the support we get from multilateral institutions and
development partners. In this regard, we look forward to the Fund’s Executive Board's discussion of
the SMP and to the resolution of Sudan’s debt and arrears problems in the near future. In the
meantime, we will intensify our efforts to obtain financing assurances from creditors for arrears
clearance and debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries and the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiatives.
Sincerely yours,

GOVERNMENT OF SUDAN
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
March 9, 2006
1.
This memorandum sets out the economic policies and objectives of the government
of National Unity for 2006. These policies will be pursued in the context of an IMF staffmonitored program (SMP) for 2006.
I. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
2.
Despite the tremendous challenges we faced in the first year of implementation of
the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), we have tried to maintain the thrust of our
economic policies, achieved high economic growth, and contained inflationary pressures.
In 2005, GDP growth is estimated at 8 percent while average inflation was contained at
8.5 percent. High oil prices supported the balance of payments and allowed for a further
accumulation of international reserves. Economic stability, robust growth, and a stronger
balance of payments led to an 8 percent appreciation of the Sudanese dinar against the
U.S. dollar.
3.
Fiscal performance was weaker than programmed, owing primarily to the expanding
fuel subsidy.1 Although higher than in 2004, oil revenues were also lower than programmed
because of a delay in commencing oil production in Blocks 3 and 7. In addition, non-oil
revenues were below projection because of an increase in the volume of imports exempted
from VAT (capital goods and NGO-related imports). The lower-than-programmed revenues
and higher expenditures led to a withdrawal of deposits from the oil savings account and
higher-than-programmed non-bank financing (mostly government securities). Following the
stipulations of the CPA, we initiated transfers to the government of South Sudan.
4.
Broad money during the year grew by 45 percent, while reserve money growth
increased by 35 percent. Both variables exceeded the programmed amounts because of high
foreign exchange inflows and an expansionary fiscal stance. Private sector credit also
increased rapidly during the year (62 percent).
5.
We undertook a number of structural reforms in the fiscal arena. To enhance non-oil
revenues, a medium taxpayer unit was set up early in the year. A three-year tariff reform
program was prepared and the first phase of the reform was initiated in the 2006 budget. In
customs administration, we adopted the ASYCUDA++ and plan to implement risk based
verification system later this year. We continued our efforts to strengthen cash management
1

The prices of most domestically consumed fuels were set when the 2005 budget was formulated and remained
unchanged since then despite rising international prices. These prices are traditionally set by decree and are not
automatically adjusted in response to changing market conditions. The SPC discounts the difference between
domestic and world prices when it transfers oil revenue to the treasury. This way of handling the oil subsidy will
be addressed in future fiscal execution reports and budgets by presenting the subsidy as an expenditure item.

- 44 -

by the preparation of a cash plan on a regular basis and improving coordination between the
ministry of finance and the central bank through regular high-level meetings.
Notwithstanding our efforts, we acknowledge that further improvements in cash
management are warranted.
6.
Banking system soundness indicators improved in 2005. While credit expanded
rapidly during the year, the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans decreased from
8.9 percent in December 2004 to 6.9 percent at end-2005. The asset quality of banks also
improved. As of December 2005, a total of 18 banks (out of 24 banks) complied with
capital adequacy requirements. As for the concentration of credit, almost 40 percent of the
increase in credit to the private sector was granted by a single bank. We have put this bank
under close supervision to monitor its lending activities.
7.
Regarding monetary operations, we began auctioning Government Musharaka
Certificates (GMCs) and Government Investment Certificates (GIC) through competitive
tenders without predetermined prices, phased out the existed financing window for banks,
and implemented the new financing window by using collateral-based certificates. We also
launched the Central Bank Ijara Certificates (CIC) in the fourth quarter of 2005 to help
manage short-term liquidity. During 2005, we privatized the Khartoum Bank and granted
four new licenses for commercial banks: Al-Salam Bank, the Egyptian Sudanese Bank,
Capital Bank, and the Emirate Sudanese Bank. The restructuring of the central bank to
function within a new federal banking system has already begun with the Central Bank of
Sudan (CBOS) changing its legal structure and the approval of new laws for the central
bank and for commercial banks. Lastly, the CBOS has established its branch in Juba as
envisaged in the CPA.
8.
Despite a number of difficulties related to the first year of implementation of the
peace agreement with the South, we made every effort to meet the targets under the StaffMonitored Program and met three of the five quantitative targets for end-December and all
but one of the structural benchmarks. The quantitative target on the financing of the fiscal
deficit was missed by a small margin, while the target on nonconcessional borrowing was
missed as new loans for US$122 million were contacted in the second half of the year.
These loans were needed to finance critical water and social projects and were contracted as
we had limited access to concessional financing and grants. Regarding the conversion of
the 2006 budget into GFSM 2001 format (end-December structural benchmark), we have
not been able to proceed as fast as planned because of complexities in the preparation of
the 2006 budget, which in turn are related to the implementation of the new revenue sharing
arrangements under the CPA. However, given the importance of this reform, we will
implement this measure by May 2006.
II. MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK AND CHALLENGES
9.
The CPA provides a good framework for building a prosperous and peaceful Sudan.
Despite initial unavoidable delays, we are fully committed to implement the agreement,
tackling regional inequalities, and reducing poverty. In this regard, we launched a strategy

- 45 -

to meet the Millennium Development Goals and intend to finalize our interim Poverty
Eradication Strategy by the end of this year. We will also continue to reorient public
spending toward disadvantaged regions and social and infrastructure projects as well as on
capacity building and the revamping of public financial management systems at all levels of
government. We are committed to clear arrears and achieve debt sustainability, but we will
need comprehensive and deep debt relief beyond traditional mechanisms.
10.
Meeting Sudan’s medium term challenges will require economic stability, sustained
growth, the spread of peace throughout the country, and regularization of relations with
donors and creditors. We are committed to prudent macroeconomic policies and a new
wave of structural reforms to strengthen the business environment, foster agricultural
development, and improve transparency in the oil sector as well as in the use of public
resources. This will require improvements in policy coordination between (and within)
national and subnational governments as well as capacity building. Notwithstanding higher
oil revenues, fiscal policy will mobilize non-oil revenues to lower the dependence on oil
revenues and preserve a prudent fiscal policy. The medium-term outlook envisages
economic growth of 8–10 percent per year, a continued decline in inflation to 5 percent or
less by 2008, and reductions in poverty levels.
III. OUTLOOK AND POLICIES FOR 2006
11.
The 2006 program of the national government assumes economic growth of
13 percent, bolstered by a large increase in oil production and continued high growth in the
non-oil sector. The average inflation objective is 7.5 percent, compared to 8.5 percent
in 2005.
12.
Fiscal policy. The fiscal deficit (including grants) will be contained at no more than
0.9 percent of GDP as both revenue and expenditure increase rapidly. On the revenue side,
oil revenues will increase because of high international oil prices and higher output. For
budget purposes, the benchmark price of oil has been set at US$45 per barrel for the Nile
blend crude and US$40 for the new DAR blend crude. Non-oil revenues will benefit from
improvements in administration, including improvement in collections in the South and
other states, and from a rationalization of tax exemptions (see below). On the expenditure
side, the recently approved budget figures have been revised because they were based on
unfeasible assumptions about the size of the oil subsidy. Compared to the budget figures,
we will contain the intended large increase in civil servants’ salaries, expenditures on goods
and services, transfers to the northern states, and domestically financed capital
expenditures, to ensure that the fiscal framework is compatible with our goal of economic
stability. This will be done in a manner that protects proposed spending on programs that
directly benefit the poor—namely pro-poor development spending. Further, any shortfall in
non-oil revenues will be covered by restrain in lower priority expenditures from Chapter I
and Chapter II. We hope that increased development assistance from the international
community in 2006 will also help co-finance pro-poor programs. We will inform parliament
of these changes vis-à-vis the budget as no supplementary budget will be required.

- 46 -

13.
Fuel subsidies. We intend to review the policy on domestic fuel prices this year to
reduce the sizeable subsidy. We realize that these subsidies do not benefit the poor, distort
the allocation of economic resources, contribute to environmental problems, and
compromise other valuable expenditures. Still, we will ensure the public is well informed
about this policy action. Later this year, we will also finalize a strategy to eliminate these
subsidies and adopt an automatic mechanism that passes through changes in world prices of
crude to product prices.
14.
Monetary policy. The program will target a broad money growth rate of 28 percent
in 2006, consistent with GDP growth and inflation objectives, and an increase in money
demand reflecting the reintegration of the South. The monetary target and the projected
build-up in foreign reserves will allow for an appropriate growth rate of credit to the
nongovernmental sector. The conduct of monetary policy will be challenging given a
number of uncertainties, including the fiscal behavior of national and sub-national
governments, introduction of the new currency, the size of the private capital movements,
and large oil export receipts. Accordingly, we expect to reassess the monetary targets midyear to ensure that it remains in line with the program’s inflation objective.
15.
Monetary operations. We will rely heavily on open market operations for
supporting banks’ liquidity needs and government and central bank securities will continue
to be issued in competitive auctions. Direct lending to banks will be limited and
collateralized by short-term securities, while lending to public enterprises (including for
agriculture) will remain at its end-2005 level.
16.
Exchange rate flexibility. As exchange rate appreciation pressures are likely to
continue, we will ensure exchange rate flexibility to safeguard our inflation objective. The
envisaged fiscal expansion for 2006 will exert pressure on monetary aggregates and on
inflation, which will need to be appropriately sterilized through open market operations
and/or foreign exchange operations.
17.
Competitiveness. High external inflows and an expansionary fiscal stance have
recently led to an appreciation of the real exchange rate, which in turn appears to have been
partly responsible for a decline in non-oil exports in 2005. As these trends are expected to
persist, we will intensify our efforts to improve the business environment for the private
sector through the removal of structural bottlenecks (especially on transportation) and other
institutional reforms as well as efforts to foster rural development. In this regard, we will be
conducting an investment climate assessment with the assistance of the World Bank. The
assessment will identify key areas of improvement as well as indicators to be tracked over
time.
18.
Tax policy and administration. To protect our tax base, the Ministry of Investment
will not refer to the Council of Ministers any proposal to renew expired business profit tax
exemptions granted under the Investment Encouragement Act. By October 2006, we will
finalize a program to revamp the system of investment incentives in consultation with Fund
staff and in line with best international practice. The program will also address the need to

- 47 -

adopt a uniform system of profit tax rates to ensure a level playing field for investors across
sectors. Lastly, we will examine the scope for expanding the VAT base by bringing
exempted items into the tax net. In the area of tax administration, key measures include the
introduction of self-assessment for large and medium-sized taxpayers and setting up three
federal tax offices in major cities in the South.
19.
Fiscal decentralization. Pro-poor spending (i.e. transfers to states, state-level
capital expenditures and some pro-poor national development expenditures) increased
in 2005 and is expected to increase further in 2006. In order for such spending to realize the
intended benefits, a strengthening of public financial management at all levels of
government (including better transparency and accountability) is our key priority. We also
plan to make significant progress on the public expenditure review, which will focus on
pro-poor spending, decentralization and public financial management, and implement the
necessary provisions to ensure coordination in budget preparation, execution, and
monitoring between the national government, the GOSS, and other states. To underpin the
decentralization reforms envisaged under the CPA and to maximize the benefit from
cooperation among the different levels of government, rules and procedures for the Fiscal
and Financial Allocation and Monitoring Commission will be established and made
operational by end-June 2006.
20.
Fiscal reporting and accounting. We are committed to the implementation of GFS
methodology at all levels of government. We will begin reporting under the GFS format
the 2006 fiscal framework of the national government to parliament (by May) and monthly
budget execution (by June). The GOSS is also committed to fiscal transparency and regular
reporting and will follow the same schedule as the National Government. Other aspects of
GFS implementation will require a larger project to support public financial management at
the national, state and local levels, for which we will seek assistance from development
partners. We also intend to upgrade our system of recording the outturn of development
spending from the current cash basis to an accrual basis. The current system, among other
difficulties, has led to inaccuracies in the measurement of development spending and in a
pattern of accumulation of arrears that are paid down in the subsequent year. Later this year,
we will modify the chart of accounts to ensure that the 2007 budget is prepared in
accordance with GFSM 2001.
21.
Oil revenue management and transparency. As the oil sector becomes more
important in Sudan’s economy, we will ensure that oil proceeds are wisely used for the
welfare of the whole population. Our response to the specter of the “oil curse” in the form
of wasteful use of oil revenues that have affected a number of countries with dire
consequences for development will be transparency in oil sector operations and sound
expenditure policies. In the near term, we will publish monthly detailed oil sector data and
clarify the role and status of the National Petroleum Commission consistent with the CPA.
We will also publish the 2004 and 2005 audited accounts of Sudapet, and ensure regular
transfers to the treasury of the net operating income from the Sudan Petroleum Corporation
and from Sudapet including that resulting from exports of fuel products. In addition, the

- 48 -

prevailing marketing mechanism (open international tenders) for export of Nile blend crude
will be extended to the new Dar blend crude after an initial test period of six months. Lastly,
we intend to discuss will be discussing with Fund staff the medium-term agenda for
subsequent oil sector reforms, including the process for joining the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative.
22.
Financial sector. In 2006, we will implement restructuring plans for the central
bank and for commercial banks as well as the financial reform program discussed during the
recent FSAP. We are also planning to introduce the new national currency (as envisaged in
the CPA) in the second half of this year. We have also initiated a reform program to develop
and restructure commercial banks (2006-2008). By end-2006, we will increase minimum
capital requirements for commercial banks from SDD3 billion to SDD6 billion
(US$25 million) and increase the capital adequacy ratio from 8 to 12 percent. We will also
require banks to implement action plans to meet provisioning and capitalization
requirements. Lastly, the CBOS will encourage mergers of commercial banks according to
specific guidelines. In order to permit screening of any merger/acquisition, we will carry out
an evaluation of banks to identify their net worth and share value.
23.
Trade and Payments. In the 2006 budget, we initiated the first phase of the threeyear tariff reform program by reducing the top tariff rate from 45 percent to 40 percent,
which will reduce the average tariff rate to 20 percent. By 2008, we plan to further reduce
tariff dispersion and lower the average tariff rate below 15 percent, especially through
reductions in the top tariff rate.
24.
Technical assistance. For the coming year, we would like to request further
technical assistance from the Fund and other development partners in the following key
areas:
•

Implementation of Government Finance Statistics Methodology (GFSM 2001)
(budget classification, accounting, execution, and auditing)

•

Budget reporting, including accounting of development expenditures

•

Fiscal decentralization and public financial management

•

Issuance of the new currency

•

Banking supervision

•

Liquidity management

•

Microfinance

•

Balance of payments, monetary, and real sector statistics.

IV. RELATIONS WITH THE FUND AND OTHER CREDITORS
25.
External debt problems. In 2006, Sudan’s debt service payments capacity will be
constrained by the considerable burden of implementing the peace agreement and dealing
with widespread poverty and regional inequalities. Any shortfall (or even a delay) in donor
assistance or a significant negative shock in oil prices would further limit our capacity to
service our obligations. We are making partial debt service payments to almost all
multilateral creditors and selected bilateral creditors that have provided new financing in
recent years. At the end-2005, stock of public and publicly guaranteed external debt was
about US$27.7 billion in nominal terms, of which US$24.4 billion was in arrears. We are
still hopeful for an early resolution of Sudan’s debt problems—including debt relief under
the HIPC initiative and under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative—through concrete
action by our key creditors and multilateral institutions. Needless to say, Sudan’s income
level calls for substantial debt relief to finance programs for achieving the Millennium
Development Goals.
26.
External financing. Sudan has continued to suffer from limited access to
concessional loans because of the difficulties in resolving our debt and arrears situation.
Development needs, however, are vast, and we have had to rely on nonconcessional
facilities to finance critical development and social projects. We are fully aware of the
concern of other creditors about this borrowing, and we will limit the contracting of such
facilities as much as possible. At the same time, we see these levels of borrowing as
exceptional and temporary, as they are an integral part of our strategy to unite the country
after the signing of the peace agreement with the South. For this year, we will need to begin
critical infrastructure and transportation projects that will require new financing equivalent
to as much as US$700 million. Two critical large projects involve the reconstruction of a
railway linking the North and the South and the construction of roads to the South and to
Darfur. We will make every effort to avoid incurring nonconcessional loans and we hope
that we can obtain concessional resources from donors and other creditors. At the same
time, these projects cannot wait, and this may force us to contract nonconcessional loans for
up to that amount. In line with our commitment to increase the transparency of public sector
operations, we will continue to share openly with Fund staff our plans and information on
loans and we will publish detailed information on all government or government guaranteed
facilities (see Table 2 below).
27.
Payments to the Fund. In addition to strong cooperation with the Fund on
economic policy matters, Sudan made regular payments to the Fund as committed under
the 2005 SMP. The Fund’s preferred creditor status will be maintained by ensuring that our
payments continue to exceed obligations falling due. To demonstrate our continued
cooperation, we will increase payments to the Fund from US$30 million in 2005 to
US$45 million in 2006. However, because oil and non-oil revenues will be much lower in
the first half of the year (the new oil fields will only be at full production in the second half
of the year and non-oil revenues are cyclical), payments to the Fund up until June will be

- 50 -

US$15 million. We hope that our record of cooperation will be fully recognized at the
appropriate time through a rapid resolution of Sudan’s debt and arrears problems.
V. PROGRAM TARGETS AND MONITORING
28.
Program monitoring. The program covers the period January-December 2006 and
takes into account the financial position of the South. It contains semi-annual quantitative
targets (end-June and end-December test dates) and structural benchmarks. Given the
impact of the South’s finances for the financial program, the targets on net domestic assets
and international reserves of the central bank will have an adjustor for any lower-thanprogrammed withdrawals of deposits by the government of South Sudan as noted in the
attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU). There is also an adjustor on the
value of oil export proceeds. The program targets and key structural benchmarks are
specified in Tables 1 and 2 below.
29.
Compilation and provision of information. To insure the effective monitoring of
the program, the relevant ministries, the CBOS, and the Central Bureau of Statistics will
compile and share with Fund staff all core economic data on a timely basis as specified in
the attached TMU.

SUDAN
TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
1.
This memorandum specifies the understanding reached with the Fund staff regarding
quantitative targets, structural benchmarks, and reporting for the 2006 staff-monitored
program (SMP).
2.
The SMP relies on five quantitative indicative targets for up to end-March and endSeptember and an equal number of quantitative targets for end-June and end-December. The
targets are (i) ceilings on the change in net domestic assets of the Central Bank of Sudan
(CBOS); (ii) ceilings on the domestic financing of the fiscal deficit; (iii) floors for the
buildup of net international reserves of the central bank; (iv) ceilings on new
nonconcessional external loans contracted or guaranteed by the government or the central
bank; and (v) floors for payments to the Fund. Broad money, reserve money, total
government revenues from crude oil exports and oil savings account will be monitored as
memorandum items. Some of these targets are subject to adjustors depending on the
financial position of the government of South Sudan and total government oil export revenue
performance. The definitions of these variables and the adjustors are set out below. All the
quantitative targets and structural benchmarks are displayed in Tables 1 and 2 of this
attachment.
3.
Net domestic assets (NDA) of the CBOS are defined as the sum of the Net Domestic
Credit of the CBOS, the net issue of money market instruments and other items net. Net
Domestic Credit is defined as net credit to the central government (i.e. Government
Musharaka Certificates (GMCs), Government Investment Certificates (GICs), and any other
form of central bank credit to the central government minus total central government
deposits) plus net central bank claims on state and local governments, central bank claims on
public enterprises, and claims on banks, and minus Central Bank Ijara Certificates (CICs).
The definition of the central government comprises all accounts of line ministries and
agencies controlled by the government (corresponding to Group no. 11, Group no. 12, and
some accounts of the Group no. 19 in the CBOS general ledger), the Zakat funds (recorded
under Group no. 13), and margin deposits placed with the CBOS by the central government
against letters of credit issued by the CBOS. The definition includes all oil-related accounts
controlled by the government. To evaluate program targets, the dinar equivalent values of
foreign exchange denominated items in the balance sheet of the central bank will be
calculated at the program exchange rate.
4.
Domestic financing of the fiscal deficit is defined as total net domestic borrowing
by the central government, including net borrowing from the banking system (including
GMCs and GICs), net sales of GMCs and GICs outside the banking system, and revenues
from privatization. The definition of central government for the purpose of this criterion is
the same as the one applied for the NDA of the central bank.

- 53 -

5.
Net international reserves (NIR) are total gross non-earmarked official foreign
reserve assets on active accounts plus reserve assets of the government of Southern Sudan in
the central bank minus official short-term liabilities (i.e. no more than one-year maturity).
The assets are maintained on accounts with overseas correspondent banks and foreign
exchange banknotes in the vaults of the central bank. Short-term liabilities include shortterm liabilities, IMF deposit accounts, nonresident deposits, and (overdrawn) foreign
correspondents accounts.
6.
Limits on contracting or guaranteeing of nonconcessional external debt apply to
all forms of debt of more than one-year maturity contracted or guaranteed by the government
or the CBOS. It applies not only to debt as defined in point no. 9 of the Guidelines on
Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (Decision no. 12274-(00/85),
August 24, 2000), but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not
been received. The degree of concessionality of debt will be calculated as specified in the
Guidelines.2
7.
Broad money is defined as the sum of local currency circulating outside of the
banks, banks’ demand, and time and savings deposits. It also includes transferable deposits
and margin deposits against letters of credit placed by state and local governments,
nonfinancial public enterprises, and the nonbank private sector with the CBOS. Reserve
money is defined as the sum of local currency circulating outside of the banks, total reserves
(required and excess) for banks, and deposits at the CBOS included in broad money.
8.
Adjustor on the financial position of the government of South Sudan (capped).
The program target for changes in the NDA of the central bank will be reduced (increased)
and the international reserve target will be increased (reduced) by the amount of any decline
(increase) in net central bank claims on the government of South Sudan. The adjustor will
not apply if the stock of net claims on the government of South Sudan turns positive.
9.
Oil revenue adjustor (symmetric). The programmed government oil revenue from
crude oil exports is based on the program’s assumptions about oil prices (f.o.b. Port Sudan)
and quantities expected to be exported (see Table below). Accrued revenue is the cumulative
government oil revenue inflows based on actual shipments at current international prices
(f.o.b. Port Sudan). The portion of oil revenue for use in the 2006 budget is estimated at a
price of oil of US$45 per barrel for Nile blend and US$40 for Dar blend (benchmark prices).
The accrued government oil revenue in excess of the planned budgeted amounts is deposited

For program purposes, a loan is considered concessional if the grant element is at least 35 percent calculated
using a discount factor based on the Commercial Interest Reference Rates (CIRRs) published by the OECD
plus margins depending on the loan maturity. The margins are 0.75 percent for repayment periods of less than
15 years, 1 percent for 15–19 years, 1.15 percent for 20–29 years, and 1.25 percent for 30 years or more. The
average of the CIRRs over the last ten years will be used for loans with a maturity of at least 15 years and the
average of the CIRRs for the preceding six months will be used for shorter maturities.

in an oil saving account (OSA), a locked sub-account within net credit to the government at
the CBOS. The programmed OSA accumulation for the year is US$509 million.
The oil revenue adjustor will work as follows:
•

If the accrued government revenue from crude oil exports exceeds the programmed
amount (either because the price and/or volume exceed the programmed levels), these
proceeds will also be deposited in the OSA. The program targets for domestic
financing of the budget deficit and NDA will be reduced, and the international
reserves target will be increased, by the difference between the accrued and the
programmed amounts.

•

If the accrued government revenue from crude oil exports falls short of the
programmed amount, the program targets for domestic financing of the budget deficit
and NDA will be increased and the international reserves target will be reduced by
the difference between the programmed and the accrued amounts.

•

If within a given quarter the accrued oil revenue that goes to the budget falls below
the planned amount, appropriate amounts will be withdrawn from the OSA to ensure
that cumulative oil revenues for use in the budget match the cumulative amounts
planned in the fiscal program.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
May 3, 2006
1.
The following information has become available since the issuance of the staff report
on November 7. It does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
The staff and the authorities discussed the issue of nonconcessional borrowing within
the 2006 Staff-Monitored Program (SMP) during the Spring Meetings. The authorities are
aware of Paris Club creditors’ concerns about this type of borrowing and indicated that they
would approach their other creditors to seek concessional terms with a view to minimizing
nonconcessional borrowing in 2006. Furthermore, if the higher-than-projected oil price
environment continues, the authorities will also look into the possibility of using additional
oil revenues to substitute for the intended borrowing. The authorities also noted that the
peace negotiations in Abuja are at an advanced stage, and they hope that Sudan’s creditors
will be ready to begin exploring financing options to resolve Sudan’s debt and arrears
problems after a peace agreement on Darfur is signed.
3.
The staff urged the authorities to find some combination of additional oil revenue and
concessional financing in order to minimize nonconcessional borrowing and thus address the
concern about this borrowing raised in the staff appraisal (paragraph 49). In this regard, a
final assessment of the program’s strength will need to take into account actual
developments, including in nonconcessional borrowing.
4.
The authorities have given their consent to the publication of the staff report
including the letter of intent, the Memorandum of Economic Policies, and the technical
Memorandum of Understanding.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with Sudan
On May 3, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Sudan.1
Background
Despite some delays, the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement with the South
began in 2005. An interim national constitution was put into force, the Government of National
Unity and the government of Southern Sudan were set up, and the central government began
transferring oil revenues to the South as stipulated in the peace agreement. Further work is
required, especially to make operational the commissions envisaged in the agreement.
Sudan’s economy has been growing at a fast pace and macroeconomic conditions have been
stable. Real GDP grew at an estimated rate of 8 percent in 2005, owing mainly to a recovery in
agriculture and robust activity in construction and services. After rapid growth in 2003 and 2004,
oil sector output remained virtually unchanged in 2005, while average inflation was 8.5 percent.
The external current account worsened in 2005 but the balance of payments was supported by
strong capital inflows. Oil export revenues rose because of higher oil prices, but imports rose
drastically and non-oil exports slowed (owing to transportation bottlenecks, high domestic
demand, and to some extent, real exchange rate appreciation). A continuation in the strong trend
in capital inflows—primarily foreign direct investment in non-oil sectors—allowed for a buildup of
international reserves from 1.9 months of imports at end-2004 to 2.6 months at end-2005.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities.

-2-

The central government fiscal balance turned to a deficit after three years of surpluses.
Oil revenue continued to rise in 2005, but it could not keep pace with the increase in government
spending, driven by higher transfers to subnational governments (including transfers to the South)
and a large subsidy on domestic fuels. The subsidy is a significant drain on public resources
without any direct benefit to the poor in Sudan.
In 2005, monetary growth remained high and the dinar appreciated. Money demand was bolstered
by strong economic growth and further monetization, while the fiscal expansion, higher oil exports,
and strong capital inflows contributed to an appreciation of the dinar.
The authorities took steps to improve the tariff structure and increase flexibility in the foreign
exchange market. As part of a three-year import-tariff reform program, the top tariff rate was
lowered from 45 percent to 40 percent, the average tariff rate fell to 20 percent, and is likely to
decline further to 15 percent or less in the next two years. The authorities removed the remaining
exchange restrictions under Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement and allowed for further
flexibility (through auctions) in the pricing of foreign exchange. Sudan maintains a managed
floating exchange rate regime.
There was progress on structural reforms in the fiscal and financial sectors, but more remains to
be done. A medium taxpayer unit was set up to boost non-oil revenue. The adoption of Automated
System of Customs Data system should improve efficiency at customs ports. Regarding financial
reforms, the central bank introduced competitive auctions of government securities, privatized a
large bank, and began to implement the financial reforms envisaged in the peace agreement with
the South. Notwithstanding the progress made, more remains to be done to modernize the tax and
the financial system, strengthen expenditure management at all levels of government, and
improve fiscal and oil sector transparency.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Sudanese authorities for pursuing prudent macroeconomic
policies in recent years and carrying out structural reforms in a very difficult environment.
These policies have resulted in a favorable economic performance marked by higher levels of
foreign investment, robust economic growth, a strengthening of the external position, and
single-digit inflation. Directors urged the authorities to continue implementing sound economic
policies and to persevere with the structural reform agenda.
Directors noted the challenges that the authorities face in mobilizing and transferring resources to
meet the requirements arising from the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement,
reconstruction, and national unification, as well as in dealing with profound regional tensions and
disparities. In this regard, Directors stressed the need to ensure the effective operations of the
North-South commissions and resolve the crisis in Darfur in order for Sudan to realize its full
economic potential. This will also set the stage for moving towards the Millennium Development
Goals, which will also require the full support of the international community.

-3-

Directors considered that performance under the 2005 Staff-Monitored Program (SMP) was
broadly satisfactory. In particular, they welcomed the policy actions to contain inflation and the
implementation of most structural benchmarks under the program. Directors regretted, however,
the higher-than-programmed level of nonconcessional borrowing and the delay in setting up the
framework for fiscal reporting according to Government Finance Statistics methodology.
Directors broadly endorsed the policy package embedded in the 2006 SMP but urged the
authorities to minimize nonconcessional borrowing. They commended the authorities for their
commitment to carry out prudent monetary and fiscal policies and proceed with fiscal reform
priorities. Directors particularly welcomed the measures to increase transparency in oil sector
operations, including the monthly publication of detailed oil sector data, and encouraged the
authorities to join the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. Directors also welcomed the
authorities’ decision to increase the level of payments to the Fund, despite severe financial
constraints. However, some Directors called for a further increase in line with Sudan’s increased
repayment capacity.
Directors acknowledged the recent improvements in monetary management and the central
bank’s intention to focus on its reserve money targets and to broaden the range of monetary
instruments for a dual (Islamic and conventional) banking system. They saw substantial merit in
maintaining exchange rate flexibility within the current managed float regime, while remaining
vigilant to achieve the program’s inflation objectives and undertaking reforms to enhance the
business environment. In addition, Directors noted that close policy coordination between the
central bank and central and subnational governments would be required to maintain price
stability.
Directors considered the recent implementation of financial system provisions contained in the
peace agreement with the South to be commendable. They encouraged the central bank to
proceed with the reform agenda, especially the implementation of FSAP recommendations
including the increase in minimum capital requirements. Directors also urged the authorities to
embark on a well-planned and transparent process to introduce the new currency, a key step to
foster development in the South and to integrate Sudan’s economy.
Directors underscored the importance of pressing ahead with fiscal reform priorities. Investment
incentives and other tax exemptions need to be rationalized in line with best international practice.
These policies will ensure a level playing field, improve governance, and protect non-oil tax
revenues. Another priority is to reduce fuel subsidies in order to alleviate economic distortions and
preserve fiscal sustainability. In this regard, Directors were encouraged by the authorities’
intention to carry out a public information campaign about the subsidies and develop an automatic
mechanism for future price adjustments in line with changes in world oil prices. Directors
encouraged the authorities to further reduce and ultimately eliminate the fuel subsidies, while,
in this context, a few Directors also noted that the authorities will have to take into account the
realities of such a process as they move forward.
Directors commended the authorities for the pro-poor focus of the 2006 budget framework,

-4including the higher transfers to the South and Northern states and higher capital expenditures.
To address capacity constraints and improve transparency, especially in subnational
governments, they stressed the need to move expeditiously to improve expenditure management
systems, including through appropriate regulations, effective monitoring, and transparent
reporting. Furthermore, Directors urged the authorities to begin compiling budget execution
reports according to Government Finance Statistics methodology for both the Government of
National Unity and the Government of Southern Sudan.
Directors urged the authorities to minimize the level of nonconcessional borrowing in 2006 in view
of Sudan’s already unsustainable external debt burden and in order to avoid complications in a
potential debt relief operation. While acknowledging the country’s reconstruction and unification
needs, the larger transfers to the South and other states, and the need for higher social spending
in order to make progress toward the Millennium Development Goals. Directors urged the
authorities to use any windfall oil revenues to finance intended infrastructure projects or to seek
concessional terms for any loan facility, and they supported their efforts in this regard.
Many Directors underscored that all creditors have a responsibility in helping to ensure that
Sudan’s unsustainable debt is not aggravated further. They also pointed out that all creditors
should participate fully and on equal terms in any debt restructuring and the HIPC Initiative for
Sudan, and that the authorities should treat all creditors equally. Directors underscored the
importance of tracking nonconcessional borrowing—both actual and planned—and called for
close cooperation and exchange of information among all creditors.
A number of Directors called for a zero ceiling on nonconcessional borrowing in 2006, and could
not support the inclusion of a ceiling of $700 million in such borrowing in the SMP. In light of this
level of nonconcessional borrowing, these Directors did not consider the 2006 SMP equivalent in
strength to a Right Accumulations Program (RAP) that could contribute to Sudan’s efforts to build
a track record. Many other Directors, however, felt that a zero ceiling on nonconcessional
borrowing would not be realistic given Sudan’s exceptional circumstances. Some of these
Directors viewed the 2006 SMP as equivalent to a RAP in all respects except for the level of
nonconcessional borrowing, while others considered that all the policy commitments under
the 2006 SMP continue to be in line with what would be required for a RAP. A number of Directors
felt that Sudan’s performance under the successive SMPs should be reflected in the timetable for
arrears clearance, and emphasized the importance of presenting a timely and clear road map in
this respect. Stressing the need for a continued constructive engagement with Sudan, most
Directors felt that a final evaluation of performance under the SMP should take into account actual
developments, including in the evolution of nonconcessional borrowing. They urged the authorities
to continue to work, in close cooperation with staff, towards ambitious measures that would
substantially reduce the level of nonconcessional borrowing.

Statement by Peter Ngumbullu, Executive Director for Sudan
and John Steytler, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
May 3, 2006

Key Points
•

Despite some initial delays due to various factors, including the untimely death of the
First Vice President, John Garang, implementation of the CPA is on track and the
payments of oil revenue to the Government Of Southern Sudan (GOSS) had been
effected in line with the wealth sharing provision of the CPA. Implementation of
other key elements of the CPA are also on track. However, lack of donor inflows is
posing a challenge to the overall implementation of the peace agreement.

•

The Authorities are working hard towards reaching agreement with all concerned
parties along the lines of the CPA, regarding the situation in Darfur. They request
the Fund to play a visible role and act as a full partner in the planned Joint
Assessment Mission (JAM), comprising the World Bank, Africa Development Bank,
and UN agencies which will assess and determine the post-conflict requirements of
Darfur.

•

In principle, the policy of the Sudanese authorities is not to contract nonconcessional loans. The authorities request for special consideration since they do
not have access to any form of concessional or development funding, and given the
enormous needs of providing key social and physical infrastructure to make the
peace attractive and to enhance the growth potential of the economy.

•

The authorities are aware of the concern of Paris Club creditors about nonconcessional borrowing. They will approach their other creditors to seek
concessional terms with a view to minimizing non-concessional borrowing in 2006.
Furthermore, if the environment of higher than projected oil prices persists, they will
be exploring the possibility of using the additional oil revenues to substitute for the
intended borrowing.

•

After seven years of successful implementation of strong SMPs, the last four with
policies equivalent in strength of Upper Credit Tranche conditionality, the
authorities request that creditors and donors come up with a clear road map for
Sudan on the way forward with respect to arrears clearance and debt relief under
HIPC and MDRI.

1.
The Sudanese authorities appreciate the candid exchange of views during the 2006
Article IV Consultation and the Staff-Monitored Program discussions. They view the staff
assessment as fair and balanced, and agree that there is a broad measure of agreement with
staff on economic policies. The authorities would like to thank Management and the

-2-

Executive Board for their continued engagement and constructive policy advice and technical
assistance provided to Sudan. They consent to publication of the staff report.
Progress on Implementation of the CPA and Darfur Negotiations
2.
Despite a slow start and some initial delays due to various factors, including the
untimely death of First Vice President, John Garang, implementation of the Comprehensive
Peace Agreement (CPA) is on track. All commissions envisaged under the CPA had been
established and transfer of oil revenues to the Government of South Sudan (GOSS), in line
with the wealth sharing provision of the CPA, have started to take place. The Government of
National Unity is trying its best to operationalize all the institutions of the CPA. Oil receipts
have been verified by all parties concerned and there are no disputes on this matter.
Implementation of other key elements of the CPA are also on track, such as the establishment
of a central bank branch in Juba, issuing of rules and regulations on conventional banking for
South Sudan and issuing of a new national currency with Fund TA. There are still some
problems in the South with respect to budget preparation and execution due to capacity
constraints and the authorities are requesting Fund TA to strengthen public expenditure
management systems of the GOSS and states, in order to overcome this problem.
3.
Following the last Board discussion on Sudan, the authorities have intensified their
efforts to finding an amicable solution to the situation in Darfur. They expect to reach
agreement soon along the lines of the CPA. A Joint Assessment Mission (JAM), comprising
the World Bank, African Development Bank, Donor Community and UN agencies is
planned, to conduct an assessment on the post-conflict requirements for Darfur, followed by
a donor conference. It is expected that the JAM will focus on three key elements, namely,
debt relief, development, and humanitarian needs. In this respect, the authorities request the
Fund to play visible and pro-active role, in determining the post-conflict requirements of
Darfur.
Recent Economic Developments and Prospects
4.
Notwithstanding internal conflicts and the difficulties of concluding and
implementing the CPA, Sudan’s economic performance in recent years has been outstanding.
Growth has been robust, inflation kept under control and a number of important reforms
implemented. Furthermore, higher oil prices supported the balance of payments and allowed
for further accumulation of reserves and appreciation of the Sudanese dinar against the U.S.
dollar. So far, the appreciation of the currency has not led to loss of competitiveness, but the
authorities are closely monitoring the situation. Going forward, economic growth is expected
to be in the range of 8-10 percent in 2006, supported by a large increase in oil production and
continued high growth in the non-oil sector; inflation is expected to remain at a low single
digit level and reduction in poverty levels will be enhanced.
5.
As staff note, a number of challenges and risks remain. The authorities remain
vigilant and agree with staff on the need for prudent economic policies, to which they are
fully committed. The authorities are aware of the enormous developmental challenges facing
the country going forward, including full implementation of the CPA, tackling regional

-3-

inequalities and reducing poverty as well as avoidance of the “Dutch disease”. In this regard,
they have launched a strategy to meet the Millennium Development Goals and will finalize
their interim Poverty Eradication Strategy by the end of this year. The authorities will
continue to reorient public spending towards less developed regions and social and
infrastructure projects, as well as on capacity building and revamping of public financial
management systems at all levels of government. They will need comprehensive and deep
debt relief beyond the traditional mechanisms to clear arrears and achieve debt sustainability.
Fiscal Policy
6.
The Authorities remain committed to implementation of prudent fiscal policies aimed
at achieving fiscal and debt sustainability and restoring borrowing relations with the
international community, including international financial institutions. In 2005, oil revenue
was lower than programmed because of delay in commencing oil production in some oil
blocks. In line with stipulations of the CPA, the authorities initiated transfers to the
government of South Sudan.
7.
In 2006, the fiscal deficit will be contained at below 1 percent of GDP. Oil revenue
will increase because of higher international oil prices and estimated higher production,
while non-oil revenue will benefit from improvements in administration, including
collections in the South and other states, and from rationalization of tax exemptions. With
respect to the latter, the Ministry of Investment will not refer to the Council of Ministers any
proposal to renew expired business profit tax exemptions granted under the Investment
Encouragement Act. By October 2006, the authorities will, in consultation with Fund staff,
finalize a program to rationalize the system of investment incentives in line with international
best practice. The authorities will also examine the scope for expanding the VAT base by
bringing exempted items into the tax net.
8.
On the expenditure side, the authorities will contain the intended increase in civil
servant’s salaries, expenditure on goods and services, transfers to the northern states, and
domestically financed capital expenditures to ensure that the fiscal framework is compatible
with their goal of maintaining economic stability. Expenditure prioritization will be done in a
manner to ensure spending on programs that directly benefit the poor is protected. The
authorities hope that increased development assistance from the international community in
2006 will also help co-finance pro-poor programs. They agree that subsidization of domestic
fuel prices is not sustainable. In this respect they prefer a phased reduction of fuel subsidies,
starting in June this year by sensitizing Parliament and the public and ultimately adopt an
automatic pricing mechanism in line with world market prices for petroleum products.
9.
With regard to structural issues, the authorities are committed to further strengthen
public expenditure management systems in 2006, implement the Government Finance
Statistics Methodology (GFSM 2001), and enhance transparency in oil revenue management.
Fiscal decentralization and improvement in fiscal reporting and accounting will also continue
to be prioritized in the 2006 SMP. All measures to strengthen public expenditure
management and enhance transparency are articulated in the authorities Memorandum of
Economic and Financial Policies. These measures would, however, require a great deal of

-4-

Fund and World Bank Technical Assistance which the authorities hope they can continue to
count on.
Monetary, Exchange Rate and Financial Sector Issues
10.
The Sudanese Authorities remain committed to price stability through reserves
management within the context of a flexible exchange rate system. High external inflows
have recently led to an appreciation of the real exchange rate, but thus far there are no visible
signs of tangible loss of competitiveness and overall the non-oil economy remains
competitive. The authorities believe that for long-term prosperity, focus should be on
improvements of total factor productivity for enhancing external competitiveness. Therefore,
as these trends are expected to persist, the authorities will intensify efforts to improve the
business climate for private sector participation, through removal of structural bottlenecks
and other institutional reforms, as well as efforts to foster rural development.
11.
With respect to financial sector reform, the authorities will implement restructuring
plans for the central bank and commercial banks, as well as the financial reform program
discussed during the recent FSAP. As envisaged in the CPA, a main central bank branch was
established in South Sudan, rules and regulations were issued on conventional banking and a
new national currency will be introduced in the whole country by June this year. The Bank of
Sudan has also initiated a reform program to develop and restructure commercial banks
during the period 2006-2009, with the first steps being an increase in the minimum capital
requirement from SDD 3 billion to SDD 6 billion and an increase in the capital adequacy
ratio from 8 to 12 percent by end-2006. Additional reforms include, the requirement of
commercial banks to implement action plans to meet provisions and capitalization
requirement and the encouragement of mergers of commercial banks according to specific
guidelines.
Non-Concessional Borrowings
12.
As a matter of policy, the Sudanese Authorities do not consider it prudent to borrow
on non-concessional terms. They would refrain from such borrowing if they had access to
concessional resources. They request that the special circumstances of Sudan be considered
with respect to the conditionality on non-concessional loans. Currently, Sudan does not have
access to any form of concessional or development funding from multilateral financial
institutions, including the World Bank and the IMF and the African Development Bank.
There is also a big shortfall from major bilateral donors. At the same time, there are
enormous pressures to implement the CPA and provide key social services and physical
infrastructure to sustain the peace and keep the country together and to enhance the long-term
growth potential of the non-oil economy. In this respect, all non-concessional loans are
directed to key projects, such as the North South Railway, the Darfur highway and provision
of basic services such as hospitals, water and rural electrification. The authorities have been
very transparent on the use of all non-concessional loans.
13.
Nevertheless, to demonstrate their commitment to a strong program, the authorities
together with staff, are exploring innovative ways to reduce the level of non-concessional

-5-

loans, including usage of any excess revenue from higher than projected oil prices and
negotiation of concessional terms with key creditors. With these remedial actions, the
authorities hope that Sudan will maintain RAP quality equivalence on all their policies so
that they can move quickly to a formal successor program, arrears clearance and debt relief.
In the meantime, they request the international community to provide concessional resources
to enable them implement key social and physical infrastructure projects, that will make the
peace dividend more tangible.
Technical Assistance
14.
The Authorities are grateful for technical assistance being provided by various Fund
departments. However, the challenges that Sudan face are enormous and have been further
amplified by implementation of the CPA and the forthcoming agreement on Darfur, hence
requiring additional TA. Under the CPA a number of new institutions had to be established at
federal and state levels. The key challenge going forward would be to get these institutions
operationalized, and this would require additional technical and financial assistance.
Specifically the authorities request Fund TA in the following areas: implementation of
Government Finance Statistics Methodology (GFSM 2001); budget reporting, fiscal
decentralization and public financial management; issuance of the new national currency;
banking supervision; liquidity management; microfinance and balance of payments,
monetary and real sector statistics.
Roadmap/Way Forward
15.
Sudan’s end-2004 debt stock remains unsustainable and significantly above the HIPC
threshold. In addition, Sudan needs substantial resources to finance post-conflict needs,
including the development and reconstruction of Darfur. Indeed, to effectively reduce
Sudan’s debt burden, the country needs debt relief beyond traditional mechanisms and under
the Enhanced HIPC Initiative and MDRI.
16.
After seven years of successful implementation of high quality SMPs, with the last
four being implemented to the level of Upper Credit Tranche conditionality, the authorities
request that creditors and donors come up with a clear and timely road map for Sudan in
terms of the way forward with respect to arrears clearance and debt relief under HIPC and
MDRI. As discussed by the Board in December 2005, contributions from donors may need to
constitute the bulk of resources needed to solve Sudan’s debt and arrears problems. We, thus,
request the creditors and donors to begin considering how to mobilize the necessary
resources to address this issue.
17.
We are still of the opinion that Sudan’s strong track record of policy implementation
under successive SMPs since 1999 should be adequate to justify a waiver of the RAP for
arrears clearance, qualification for a successor program and speedy reach of the decision and
completion points under the HIPC Initiative. Given the expiration of the sunset clause by the
end of this year, we urge creditors and donors to move quickly in mobilizing the necessary
resources to ensure that the protracted arrears cases will benefit from HIPC and MDRI debt

-6-

relief as soon as possible so that these countries make progress towards the achievement of
the MDGs.
Conclusion
18.
In conclusion, the authorities would like to reaffirm their strong commitment to
prudent and market oriented policies aimed at growth, employment creation and poverty
reduction. The authorities are aware that without peace, no development is possible, and
therefore implementation of the CPA and peace in Darfur will remain centre stage in the
authorities development strategy. Their task is, however, complicated by the high debt
burden and lack of access to concessional and development finance resources. They trust that
the Fund will continue to be fully responsive in providing technical assistance in the areas
requested to build their capacity, strengthen the macroeconomic management and implement
the reform agenda going forward. The authorities are looking forward to normalizing their
financial relationship with the international community in the context of a formal
arrangement with the Fund, instead of continuing with SMPs for an undetermined period of
time. As proof to their commitment to normalize relations with creditors, the authorities have
increased their payments to the Fund by 50 percent under the current SMP. We urge the
international community to recognize and fully support the authorities’ efforts by releasing
concessional resources, including grant financing and removing sanctions to assist
implementation of the CPA and the forthcoming Darfur peace agreement.
