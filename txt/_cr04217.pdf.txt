Article IV consultation discussions were held in Warsaw during March 25–April
7, 2004. The mission met the Prime Minister designate, the Deputy Prime Minister,
the Minister of Finance, President of the National Bank of Poland (NBP), Minister of
Treasury, members of the Monetary Policy Council (MPC) and the Sejm, and other
senior officials.

•

The staff team comprised Ms. Schadler (Head), Ms. Choueri, Ms. Murgasova,
Mr. Székely (all EUR), and Ms. Mitchell-Casselle (MFD), and was assisted by
Messrs. Sassanpour and Sierhej (Resident Representative’s office). Mr. Szczuka, thenAlternate Executive Director for Poland, and Mr. Tomasz Skurzewski then-Advisor to
the Executive Director participated in the discussions.

•

In the last consultation in June 2003, Directors commended the authorities for
achieving price stability and welcomed the government’s fiscal reform proposal, but
urged the authorities to use the improving cyclical position to embark on a substantial
fiscal adjustment and accelerate structural reforms.

•

Poland’s statistical base is adequate for surveillance.

•

Poland has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 and maintains
no restrictions on current transactions.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Poland is in a challenging economic situation. Although a strong recovery is
underway, private investment is still flat and financial markets are jittery. This paradox is the
legacy of several years of weak policies which produced an unsustainable fiscal position and,
together with slow growth, worsened a rising unemployment problem. Exacerbated by
uncertainty about the strength of the recovery in Western Europe, Poland’s principal export
market, these setbacks continue to strain political stability and market confidence even as the
recovery takes off. While the government has proposed a comprehensive program to tackle
the fiscal and structural problems, political support needed to implement it has wavered.
Thus, Poland, a star performer in the 1990s, entered the EU with substantive economic and
social problems and a weak government.
2.
Throughout the past year, a recovery strengthened, but it is not yet fully
entrenched. With strong exports, robust consumption, and a leveling off of the drop in
investment, GDP growth picked up gradually, reaching 4.7 percent (year-on-year) in the last
quarter of 2003 (Table 1, Figure 1). Continued high export growth and accelerating retail
sales suggest that the recovery strengthened substantially in early 2004, but still without any
indication of investment growth (Figure 2). Although the fiscal stance in 2003 was slightly
restrictive, a considerable easing of monetary conditions since 2001 supported the recovery:

-4-

policy rates were massively reduced between early 2001 and mid-2003, while falling interest
differentials and unsettled politics contributed to a 20 percent real effective depreciation of
the zloty in the past two years (Figure 3). With strong gains in the service sector,
employment has grown modestly in the past year, for the first time since 1997. This,
combined with accelerating wages and rising social transfers, kept consumption growth
robust.

Slack in the economy is diminishing but without signs yet of excessive demand
pressure. The output gap narrowed slightly in 2003, but at over 2 percent of potential GDP,
was still sizable. The unemployment

of domestic cost push and with an unusually small pass-through of the zloty depreciation by
profit-rich firms, net inflation (excluding food and fuel) was steady at 1–1½ percent. A rise in
headline inflation to 2.2 percent in April (still below NBP’s 2½ percent target) was mostly
due to food and oil price increases.
4.
Financial markets have been unsettled. Despite low inflation, long-term interest
rates have risen since mid-2003, in response initially to the announcement of an expansionary
2004 budget and more recently to unsettled politics (Figure 5). Unlike in most other new EU
countries, the domestic spread over the 10-year euro yield has more than doubled since
mid-2003. Pointing to weak political and fiscal fundamentals, S&P and Fitch downgraded
Poland’s domestic debt and the outlook on its foreign debt in the past year.
5.
The weak responses of investment and employment raise concerns about
fundamental impediments to the recovery. Uncertainties about the recovery in Western
Europe are likely playing a role. But investment and employment growth remain
substantially weaker than in other central European countries facing the same markets
(Figure 6). And while excess capacity may still be a factor in some sectors, it seems likely
that policy weaknesses during the past several years are influencing investor confidence and
employment trends.

A weak fiscal situation inherited from the 1990s has been allowed to drift. With
a widening output gap, the headline deficit doubled during 1999–2002 and narrowed
only slightly last year. As a result, public debt increased from below 40 percent of
GDP at end-2000 to 51½ percent by end-2003 (Figure 7). Repeated fiscal reform
efforts have failed in the face of vested interests and fractious politics (Box 1).

•

As fiscal reform attempts failed, social expenditure remained excessive and
poorly targeted. According to the World Bank, half of the 6.3 percent of GDP social
spending (excluding old-age pension) in 2002 was paid to non-poor families or in
excess of what

Box 1. Fiscal Reform Attempts in Poland, 1999–2004
The authorities realized as early as 1999 that public finances needed to be strengthened to
enhance Poland’s growth potential and fully benefit from EU accession. Excessive current,
mainly social, expenditure was diagnosed as the root of the fiscal problem. Since then a series of
fiscal reform attempts have failed, reflecting vested interests and inadequate political cohesion around
reforms. Each year since 2000, the finance minister resigned when his effort to incorporate reforms in
the budget met political resistance and the government temporarily gave into the pressure. The Fund
has supported these efforts and provided technical assistance to help design them.
The Balcerowicz strategy
The 1999 fiscal strategy—building on previous fiscal reforms and an ambitious reform agenda—
aimed to reduce the general government deficit below 1 percent and public debt below 30 percent of
GDP by 2003 (IMF Country Report No. 01/56). The strategy addressed the crux of the fiscal problem
by aiming to restrain high current expenditure. As growth slowed in mid-2000, fiscal slippages
emerged, political support for reforms faded, and the ruling center-right coalition lost its majority in
2000.
The Bauc period
Election politics got the upper hand in 2001, the structural deficit rose relative to GDP by
¾ percentage point and fiscal reforms were halted.
The Belka rule
After the 2001 election, Finance Minister Belka attempted to introduce a fiscal rule limiting central
government expenditure growth to the CPI inflation rate +1 percent. To make this rule sustainable,
the MoF started preparations for fiscal reforms to reduce social expenditure. Staff supported the plan
and called for extending the rule to the general government (IMF Country Report No. 02/127).

The Kolodko package
The consolidation plan in 2003 focused on eliminating widespread formulaic expenditure
adjustments. Welcoming the plan, staff called for structural fiscal reforms and warned that more
needed to be done to restore fiscal sustainability (IMF Country Report No. 03/187).
The Hausner plan
The plan, proposed in 2003, aims to reduce social expenditure, streamline government, and accelerate
the restructuring of ailing public companies. Deputy Prime Minister Hausner has accompanied wellspecified proposals with a major outreach effort to gain public support, PM-designate Belka has
endorsed the plan, but its fate remains uncertain.
The large fiscal problem Poland is facing now could have been avoided if past plans had been
implemented. For example, had the augmented Belka rule been followed from 2003 onward the
deficit would now be well-positioned to drop below 3 percent of GDP by 2006, and public debt
would have been stabilized below 50 percent of GDP.

-7-

•

An increase in unemployment owing to the cycle and enterprise restructuring
was aggravated by policy-induced disincentives in the labor market.1 A large tax
wedge and high minimum relative to average wage for low-skilled workers hindered
wage adjustment where it was needed most. In addition skill mismatches persisted,
and the social transfer system created benefit traps. By 2002, the share of long-term
unemployed had risen to over half of the total.

•

With considerable rigidities in the labor market and poorly targeted social
transfers, the economic slowdown worsened poverty. Rising (particularly longterm) unemployment was the prime source of the increase in poverty. Poorly targeted
fiscal transfers meant that even high social spending was less effective in addressing
this problem than it should have been.

•

Lax fiscal policy left the burden of responding to a large current account deficit
and rising inflation in the late-1990s to monetary policy. Excessive tightening and
a simultaneous large real appreciation (more than 25 percent during mid-1999–
mid-2001) produced a sharp, though short-lived, diminution in price competitiveness
(Figure 3). This contributed to a deep decline in investment in 2001–02 and, as it was
most severe in labor-intensive industries, to massive lay-offs (Box 2).

Box 2. The Changing Structure of Exports and Labor Demand
Substantial changes in the product structure of Polish exports have had a strong impact
on labor markets. As the accompanying selected issues paper shows, the share of low-tech
and labor intensive exports declined rapidly following the Russia crisis, while medium-tohigh-tech exports rose rapidly. As a result, employment in export industries fell by 25 percent
between 1998–2003, accounting for most of the decline in employment in the corporate
sector. Low-skilled jobs were likely lost to competition from other emerging markets.

High unemployment, controversy over a fiscal reform plan, and scandals linked
to the ruling coalition destabilized the political situation. Prime Minister Miller resigned
in May, and the President asked former Finance Minister Belka to form a new government.
The first-round confidence vote failed to deliver the needed majority and ongoing
negotiations will determine whether a government can be formed or early elections (ahead of
the 2005 schedule) must be held. Prospects for implementing the previous government’s
fiscal reform plan are uncertain.

-9-

II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
7.
The discussions focused on policies needed to foster a pick-up in investment and
employment growth so as to secure the recovery. On the fiscal side, the Hausner plan and
debt dynamics were the main issues. For monetary policy, keeping inflation within the target
range in the face of rising oil prices and several temporary shocks was viewed as a major
challenge. The discussions about longer term goals centered on the adoption of the euro.
8.
The authorities were confident that growth in 2004–05 would be strong and
provide a robust foundation for containing the fiscal deficit. They saw the Hausner plan
as well-targeted at Poland’s central fiscal problems and were determined to see it through to
full implementation. While they expected that it would be sufficient to stabilize debt below
the constitutional limit of 60 percent of GDP, they acknowledged that additional measures
could be needed should growth disappoint. Staff shared the authorities’ positive assessment
of short-run economic trends, but cautioned on vulnerability to policy slippages.
9.
Despite previous ambitious plans, early euro adoption is unlikely. The depth of
the conviction about the benefits of early adoption varies within policy-making circles, but
most accept that gains for trade and growth could be substantial. The authorities thought that
achieving the necessary fiscal adjustment would be the most difficult hurdle to overcome.2
Staff emphasized that a strong fiscal position—a structural deficit of 1–2 percent of GDP—
before entering ERM2 would provide scope for automatic stabilizers to operate and minimize
the risk of speculative attacks in ERM2. Inflation, on the other hand, was low and meeting
the Maastricht criterion should be feasible. The monetary authorities were concerned about
market stresses on the exchange rate in ERM2, depending on how limiting it would be, but
agreed with staff that a stay limited to two years would be manageable.
10.
The authorities thought that staff’s past policy recommendations had served
Poland well, although political constraints had hindered their implementation. They
acknowledged that inadequate political support had prevented fiscal reforms (Box 1), and
frequent changes in privatization strategies reflecting political resistance had delayed
restructuring. Regarding monetary policy, the authorities thought that the policy of
non-intervention—on which there had been an agreement with staff since the move to the
float in 2000—had been a critical aspect of risk management.

2

The Maastricht deficit limit is for the general government net borrowing (ESA95), which
differs from the general government cash deficit (GFS86) shown in this report. Depending on
how the Eurostat decision on pension funds is applied to Poland, the ESA95 deficit was 0.3
(with pension funds outside the general government) or 1.9 (with pension funds in the
general government) percent of GDP lower than the GFS86 cash deficit in 2003 (Table 4).

- 10 -

A. Economic Outlook
11.
Short-run prospects are favorable. A modest recovery in Europe and improved
competitiveness will help maintain high export growth, but political and fiscal uncertainties
could keep a recovery of fixed investment gradual. Fiscal stimulus, mostly through
accelerating public investment, will boost domestic demand. Reflecting job creation and
some acceleration in real wages, private consumption growth should increase. Thus staff
project growth rising to 5 percent in 2004, with an external current account deficit of 2.3
percent of GDP. Indications of strong growth in early-2004 suggest risks for full-year growth
are on the upside, although some doubt remains about whether the robust first half reflected a
bunching of consumer demand before EU accession. The authorities broadly agreed with
staff’s assessment, though NBP staff were less optimistic on growth and expected that higher
domestic demand would lead to a faster deterioration in the external current account balance.
12.
Though core inflation should be low, headline inflation is likely to increase this
year due to one-off factors. Staff expect CPI inflation in 2004 to rise, perhaps briefly above
the 2½–3½ percent target range, due to a closing output gap and temporary shocks—rising
oil prices, possible effects of EU accession, and the pass-through from depreciation. Yet even
rising inflation expectations and, in turn, wage growth are consistent with the center of the
target range. Assuming expectations increase no further, staff expect headline inflation to
revert to the central target in 2005 as the one-off factors dissipate. While trends so far are no
cause for concern, the authorities viewed a further increase in inflation expectations—which,
if translated into further wage acceleration, could turn a temporary increase in inflation into a
more lasting one—as a major risk.

13.
The authorities were optimistic about the medium-term. They expected growth to
increase, to 5½ percent in 2006–07, driven by a sharp upturn in investment and gradually
rising consumption growth owing to confidence effects from the Hasuner plan. They
projected a small deterioration in the current account deficit.

- 11 -

14.
Staff pointed to substantial risks to the recovery without structural and fiscal
reforms. Assuming a partial implementation of the Hausner plan in their central scenario,
staff projected GDP growth to return to around 4¼ percent in 2005 and slightly below
4 percent in the longer run (Tables 6 and 7). Staff stressed that with only tepid fiscal
adjustment—which would keep financial markets unsettled and interest rates increasing—the
recovery of private investment would be slow—stabilizing the external current account
deficit below 4 percent of GDP, but limiting job creation and private consumption growth.
Staff emphasized that a higher growth path would require ambitious fiscal reforms (Table 8).
External debt remains manageable under most stress tests (Table 9), but public debt
continues to grow under the staff’s central scenario (Table 10). In this scenario, a sudden
depreciation of the zloty, especially if combined with a substantial increase in international
capital market yields, would increase public debt sharply and would threaten required
rollovers.
B. Fiscal Policy
15.
The authorities acknowledged that the 2004 budget was expansionary and added
to the ultimate adjustment burden. Prepared in the wake of the resignation of the previous
finance minister, the budget had prioritized investment promotion and fully utilizing
available EU funds. They stressed that the deterioration in the fiscal deficit was mostly due to
the CIT rate cut from 27 to 19 percent, implemented in one step in 2004, and increased
EU-related spending. The authorities were confident that the required financing could be
secured and that a strong recovery would allow them to reduce the deficit later. Staff argued
that, with a strong recovery in train, a fiscal expansion was unwarranted in 2004 and that
with a reprioritization, an increase in spending relative to GDP could have been avoided.
While recognizing the pressure from CIT-rate cuts in neighboring countries, staff emphasized
that, without expenditure reform, the budget could not afford a large revenue loss. Moreover,
as private investment was not hindered by inadequate internal funds or low profit margins,
the rate cut would have limited immediate effects on corporate investment. Pointing to the
increase in gross financing requirements, staff argued that the 2004 budget had substantially
increased the vulnerability of public finances.
16.
To address the growing debt, Deputy Prime Minister Hausner had put forward
a medium-term fiscal consolidation plan. The plan aims to reduce the general government
deficit relative to GDP (from an official baseline) by about 2 percentage points by 2007 (text
table), thereby stabilizing public debt below the constitutional limit on the debt ratio—
60 percent of GDP. Savings are from three areas: social benefit reforms, broadening the tax
base, and administrative measures including public enterprise restructuring. Social measures,
accounting for almost half of the planned total savings, include a change in the pension
indexation rule, a streamlining of the pension scheme for farmers (KRUS), a tightening of
pre-retirement benefits, and a reassessment of disability pensions. These are among the
measures recommended in recent years by the IMF and the World Bank. Tax measures aim
to broaden the tax base by eliminating preferential income tax and social contribution
treatment for farmers, the disabled, and the self employed. Administrative measures

concentrate on reducing defense spending, strengthening tax administration, streamlining
extra-budgetary funds, and restructuring public companies.

The authorities emphasized that the Hausner plan addressed the crux of the
fiscal problem and were confident that parliamentary support could be secured. They
explained that the plan aimed to redefine the role of government, increase the efficiency of
public spending, and promote growth and employment. Planned reforms would reduce
excessive social spending while making it more pro-poor and eliminating disincentives to
work. The authorities also emphasized that the successful restructuring of the targeted public
companies—recipients of substantial budget support—would improve efficiency and reduce
the burden on the budget in the longer run. The first package of legislative amendments was
submitted to Parliament in March 2004. Two others would follow shortly and all key
measures were to be in place before the 2005 budget.

rules and KRUS reform—over
half the savings from social measures—risked being substantially watered down during
Parliamentary approval. Applauding the long-term benefits of restructuring public sector
companies, staff pointed out that it was unlikely to produce significant savings soon. Taking

into account this, the absence of identified measures to increase revenue, and the likelihood
that pension indexation, pre-retirement benefit, and KRUS reforms would be watered down,
staff estimated the total annual saving from the Hasuner plan at 0.7 percent of GDP by 2007,
around one third of the official estimates (text table, Table 7). About half of the
1.1 percentage points difference between the authorities’ and staff’s estimates reflects staff’s
more conservative assessment of the yields of tax and administrative measures, particularly
where measures are not clearly identified. The rest reflects staff’s expectation that social
measures would be implemented only partially. Moreover, staff scenarios with more
conservative growth projections than in the official projections suggested that even full
implementation of the Hausner plan would not stabilize debt below 60 percent of GDP.
19.
Staff argued that a decisive fiscal adjustment based on full implementation of the
Hausner plan and follow-on structural measures was needed to restore fiscal
sustainability and enhance growth. Staff advocated further trimming and better targeting
social benefits and streamlining public administration. Staff pointed out that an adjustment of
about 1¾ percent of GDP in the structural deficit by 2007 compared to its central scenario—
about 1 percent of GDP more than full implementation of identified measures in the Hausner
plan would produce—was needed to stabilize public debt below the constitutional limit.
Additional measures should aim to achieve savings in 2004 and keep the deficit on a
declining path in 2005 (Table 8). The authorities agreed, but doubted whether the necessary
political support could be secured.
20.
Staff emphasized that steady debt management would be key to securing budget
financing and the stability of domestic financial markets. High gross public financing
requirements combined with uncertainties about fiscal reforms and political developments
created potential for episodic financing difficulties. Reflecting on the market turbulence last
fall (Box 3), the authorities agreed on the importance of steady debt-management, including
the maintenance of adequate government reserves. They also realized the role foreign
investors had played in stabilizing the T-bond market in the past few months and described
plans to improve market access by including non-resident financial institutions among
primary dealers. Staff commended the authorities for stabilizing the T-bond market and
urged that the foreign investor base be strengthened by issuing new liquid benchmark
T-bonds.
C. Monetary Policy
21.
The MPC, which was fully reconstituted early this year, considered monetary policy
had been appropriately supportive during the past year. Some MPC members thought that
deeper cuts in the policy rate in 2003 would have provided more scope for an early increase
in rates as the recovery gained steam, but they did not consider interest rates had hindered
recovery. Staff pointed out that the success of the previous MPC in achieving low inflation

Box 3. Turbulence on the Domestic T-Bond Market and the Role of Foreign Investors
Responding to deteriorating fiscal trends, long-term yields started to increase in mid-2003. In
an attempt to stem the consequent increase in interest costs, the Ministry of Finance (MoF)
reduced T-bond issue: in September two auctions were cancelled or declared unsuccessful
because yields demanded by investors were deemed too high. This triggered a period of market
turbulence, when long-term rates continued to increase and the average maturity of newly
issued debt dropped. MoF subsequently improved communication with the market and returned
to the practice of accepting market pricing. By March 2004, it managed to stabilize the market
and increase the maturity of newly issued debt back to its mid-2003 profile.

An accompanying selected issues paper shows that foreign investors played an important role in
stabilizing the T-Bond market during this period. From September, when the turbulence began,
through December they substantially increased their holding of domestic T-bonds. This
suggests that, in their absence, the fluctuation in long-term yields would have been larger with
potentially severe consequences for other financial markets.

was a helpful legacy although the new MPC would need to establish its credibility. Staff
complimented the new MPC for quickly establishing a clear anti-inflationary stance and for
successfully managing the take-over.
22.
The MPC saw an increasing number of factors weighing on the side of tightening
their policy bias. They attributed the recent pickup in headline inflation to supply side
shocks from agriculture and oil; also, a possible short-run price hike caused by EU accession
was a risk specific to this year. They would keep a careful eye on these effects on inflation
expectations which they saw closely influencing wages. Thus far the effects had been benign,
and no policy reaction had been required; but any change would call for a tightening of their
bias. They viewed the weak fiscal position and increased uncertainty surrounding the
Hausner plan, however, as more fundamental threats to price stability. Staff agreed with this
assessment. Reflecting the analysis in the selected issue paper, it emphasized that the passthrough from the depreciation of the zloty during the past year had been less than experience
of the past few years would suggest. While wide profit margins and strategic pricing by

- 15 -

importers might explain this, the strong recovery could produce a catch-up of the
pass-through.
23.
The authorities felt that inflation targeting with no intervention in the
foreign-exchange market would continue to serve Poland well until ERM2 entry. They
thought that exchange rate flexibility had for the most part helped the economy adjust to
external and internal shocks in the past four years. Staff emphasized that in a low inflation
environment and with limited downward wage flexibility, preserving this adjustment
mechanism would help ensure that exchange rate is well-aligned upon ERM2 entry. More
importantly, staff noted that the float had promoted prudent risk management which
strengthened Poland’s capacity to withstand volatile capital flows. Regarding the inflation
targeting framework, MPC members thought that the medium-term inflation target of
2.5±1 percent set by the previous MPC remained suitable. Given the importance of
continuity, staff agreed, though pointed out that a slightly higher target could better
accommodate the Balassa-Samuelson effect, estimated at 1–2 percent per year.
24.
The tension over the use of the NBP revaluation reserve had dissipated. The
fiscal authorities confirmed that they would leave the decision on this matter to the central
bank and emphasized that any part of the reserve released should be used to redeem
expensive foreign debt. Welcoming the positive developments, staff stressed the importance
of carefully considering the appropriate capitalization of the NBP and the level of foreign
exchange holding when discussing the options.
25.
The authorities attributed the weakness of the zloty to political uncertainties.
They thought that an appreciation a more stable environment would bring about would not
significantly harm competitiveness, but it would keep public debt in check. They argued that,
while the depreciation of the zloty helped exporters, corporate restructuring was the main
factor explaining strong corporate profits and rapid export growth in the past year. Staff
broadly agreed, but stressed that, given high unemployment and the abundance of low-skilled
labor, export competitiveness not just overall but also in labor-intensive products was
important. Structural and labor market reforms as well as training were essential for
addressing these problems, although an appropriate macroeconomic policy mix would help
maintain a supportive exchange rate.

- 16 -

D. Financial Sector Risk and Vulnerability
26.
The authorities were confident that the banking system was well-capitalized and
fully provisioned for irregular loans. Based on the old loan-classification system, the share
of irregular loans started to decline in mid-2003 reflecting the improved liquidity and
profitability of the corporate sector. The rapid growth of foreign exchange-denominated
housing loans had slowed significantly in the last quarter of 2003 as zloty interest rates
declined and households became more careful about unhedged borrowing. Nonetheless,
about half of the outstanding stock of housing loans was still foreign exchange-denominated
or indexed. Based on their empirical analysis, the authorities thought that risks to the banking
system originating from these loans were small.

27.
The authorities felt the new loan classification system would enhance banks’
competitiveness without substantially increasing risks. Staff agreed that many elements of
the new system had brought Poland in line with international best practice (Box 4). Staff,
however, recommended keeping provisions freed up as a result of the changes in a special
account until the full impact of the changes could be assessed. On more specific aspects of
the change, staff called attention to a provision in the new regulation that automatically
assumed or solely relied on the strength of a foreign guarantor when classifying loans. In
staff’s view this alone was insufficient for judging the quality of a loan; the capacity of the
local borrower to repay should also be taken into account. Staff was concerned about the new
rules for classifying consumer loans because they had the potential to delay the timely

- 17 -

identification of problems. Regarding mortgage products, staff recommended uniform
standards for all types of banks. Staff also emphasized the importance of maintaining a
database on foreign exchange-denominated or linked loans that would allow supervisors to
assess risks—including built-in options for conversion—of this type of product.
Box 4. Changes to the Loan Classification and Provisioning Regulation (LCP)
The new regulation, introduced in 2004, was motivated by the authorities’ perception that
Poland’s classification regulation was more exacting that that in most other countries. The
change extends the period of non-servicing that triggers automatic classification, limits
the value of the real estate collateral that can be considered for reducing the provisions for
non-performing loans and sets specific timeframes for writing down the value of
underlying collateral to zero. It also allows some high quality collateral (mainly
guarantees) to be used to determine the severity of loan classification. At this stage, there
is no available estimate of the impact of these changes on the stocks of classified loans
and provisions.

E. Structural Policies
28.
The government planned to speed up privatization, but implementation is
uncertain. After a sizable underperformance last year, a relatively ambitious target—0.8
percent of GDP—was set for privatization receipts in 2004. Treasury officials, however,
pointed to several factors hindering privatization, including political resistance to foreign
ownership in financial services and other strategic sectors. Staff emphasized the importance
of privatization in promoting corporate restructuring and FDI and urged the authorities to
speed up implementation. Staff also argued against extensive restructuring prior to
privatization, stressing that it had been costly and led to major delays without achieving
significant improvements. The authorities planned to sell a 30-percent stake in PKO BP
through an IPO. Staff emphasized the urgency of moving ahead with this long–delayed
project.
29.
The government is planning comprehensive reforms in health financing, delivery
and organization. The authorities explained that the reforms, formulated with World Bank
technical support, aimed to control costs, channel scarce resources to cost effective and
clinically efficient procedures, enhance service quality, foster competition among service
providers, and improve efficiency in the production and delivery of health care. Services to
be covered by the public health insurance system are being established in a basic benefits
package. These reforms are an integral part of the new legislation on health insurance, and
the authorities were aiming for parliamentary approval of this bill by September 2004. Staff
agreed that controlling health care costs is critical to avoid a rapid increase in public health
care expenditure in the coming years.
30.
The authorities expected a marked decline in unemployment with the cyclical
upturn and new initiatives to promote job creation. They projected that the

- 18 -

unemployment rate could drop to 16–17 percent by end-2006. They expected the new law on
employment promotion in the Hausner plan to enhance job creation during the upturn by
promoting active labor market programs for high-risk groups (e.g., long-term unemployed
and low-skilled people). They also emphasized that the law would create incentives for
old-age people to re-enter the labor force. They thought that the changes to the Labor Code
had helped create employment. Staff commended the authorities for their renewed efforts to
reduce high structural unemployment and agreed with the overall strategy of focusing on
low-skilled and long-term unemployed, and creating work incentives for old-age workers.
The reform of the Labor Code had been an important step forward, but the re-introduction of
restrictions on temporary contracts was likely to reverse some gains. Staff stressed that
reforms needed to reduce the large tax wedge particularly for low-skill workers and eliminate
the disincentives of poorly-targeted social assistance. The authorities thought that EU
accession would not be conducive to making Polish labor market more flexible and they did
not expect significant labor migration to other EU countries.
31.
The authorities expected EU entry to increase competitive pressure in several
sectors, even though the overall level of trade protection would decline only slightly.
Significantly lower tariffs on light industrial and consumer electronics products and cars
would have the strongest impact, while changes in antidumping and safeguard rules would
have a negative impact on metallurgy production. In agriculture, the authorities expected
increased competition from the other new EU members following elimination of high tariffs
among these countries.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
Poland is in the midst of a strong recovery with an uncertain future. The
immediate outlook is for an unusually favorable combination of strong growth, low inflation
and a small current account deficit. Much of the recent and prospective success is due to a
cyclical rebound accompanied by modest wage growth and strong corporate profits.
Sustaining the recovery, however, will require more. Most importantly, confidence that
steady and sustainable policies will be pursued is essential to reignite investment and
employment demand. To this end, the damaging drift in fiscal and structural polices during
the past few years must give way to purposeful reform.
33.
The 2004 budget illustrates the problems Poland will face in this process.
Formulated in the aftermath of the fourth resignation of a finance minister in four years, the
budget was another in a series that failed to address the formula-driven structure of spending
inherited from the era of central planning and first years of transition—characterized by
poorly-targeted and excessive social transfers and subsidies. While commendable initiatives
were taken—the corporate income tax rate was cut and co-financing for a sizable increase in
EU funds was provided—the reprioritization of budget spending needed to make such
policies sustainable was not. Moreover, coming as the recovery gained steam, the budget
injected a pro-cyclical stimulus that is likely to hasten the need for a restraining monetary
policy response. Any windfall revenues from higher-than-predicted growth in 2004 should
therefore be saved. The adverse market reaction to the announcement of the 2004 budget is

- 19 -

an example of the difficulties Poland will face if the unsustainable fiscal trends are not
addressed.
34.
The Hausner plan, if fully implemented, would be a central step in this process.
Its thrust—streamlining social transfers, restructuring state-owned enterprises, and
broadening the tax base—targets the most acute fiscal excesses. It would not only improve
the fiscal balance, but also address several unfinished aspects of transition—particularly a
poorly-targeted social welfare system with disincentives to work and cumbersome
state-enterprises. The political obstacles to implementation are onerous; passing a
watered-down version of the reform legislation offers a politically appealing escape that
would probably satisfy markets for the short-term. Further postponing a decisive fiscal
consolidation, however, would make public finances vulnerable to shifts in market sentiment,
and, in turn, limit the recovery in private investment. Longer-term prosperity demands that
this option be resisted. Indeed, barring exceptionally favorable external and domestic
conditions over the next decade, steps beyond the Hausner plan will be needed to stabilize
debt below the constitutional limit (and Maastricht criterion) of 60 percent of GDP. Such
efforts should focus on further streamlining social benefits and public administration and
improving revenue administration.
35.
A second priority for the new government will be to reinvigorate economic
restructuring. The urgency of this issue is reflected in the share of Poland’s GDP produced
in the public sector, which remains the largest among the new EU members, while the
political commitment to privatization has all but disappeared. Longstanding discussions on
privatizing several large financial institutions, in particular the country’s largest bank, and
major companies in the energy, chemical and petrochemical industries need to move onto
implementation; progress in downsizing and restructuring in the coal industry needs to be
replicated in other sectors; and the government should divest minority shareholdings in
privatized enterprises. The drain of inefficient state enterprises should not be allowed to drag
down Poland’s competitiveness as it enters the EU.
36.
Labor market reform is a third task for the new government. The recovery
should lead to a cyclical decline in unemployment, but efforts are needed on several fronts to
lower structural unemployment. Labor market reforms should focus on increasing
employability, in particular of low-skilled workers. Changes to social benefits—some already
included in the Hausner plan and others expanding the effort, for example, to in-work
benefits for the recently unemployed—should increase incentives to work. Also on the fiscal
side, savings need to make room for reducing the tax wedge.
37.
Fiscal and structural reform will be critical for future monetary policy. Poland’s
exceptionally low inflation will rise over the next year, in the first instance owing to one-off
supply side influences: as the recovery strengthens, these one-off effects could be
incorporated in expectations and self-perpetuate. The new MPC has therefore appropriately
signaled its concern—and thereby taken the first step toward establishing its anti-inflation
credentials—by shifting to a tightening bias, while holding off on any increase in interest
rates until the risk of one-off factors influencing expectations is clearer. A continuation of the

- 20 -

strong recovery, especially without full and early implementation of the Hausner plan, would
likely call for the Council to act on its bias.
38.
A flexible exchange rate continues to serve Poland well. The large depreciation
since mid-2001 has restored profitability contributing forcefully to the strength of exports
and activity. The new MPC has appropriately signaled its support for continuing a policy of
non-intervention, which, by placing the costs of capital account volatility on market
participants and eliminating the scope for the official sector getting stuck on one side of the
market, offers Poland substantial protection from the risks of zloty volatility. Indeed, the fact
that balance sheets have absorbed the large depreciation without excessive strains is
testimony to the strengths of this regime. In this setting, questions about the need for NBP
reserve holding equivalent to over 180 percent of short term debt might be asked, but the
case against such holdings must take into account prospects for participation in ERM2.
39.
Having weathered the slowdown in activity and the deprecation of the zloty, the
financial sector must now prepare for the challenge of rapid growth of bank credit to
the private sector. After sharp deteriorations until mid-2003, the share of non-performing
loans has stabilized, and bank profitability has strengthened. Bank credit to the corporate
sector remains stagnant but credit to households is increasing strongly. Such expansion is
expected when bank credit accounts for only one third of GDP, but the health of banks must
be watched closely in these circumstances, even though most banks are subsidiaries of
foreign banks. A preliminary assessment of the new loan classification system suggests that it
probably moves Poland’s system closer to that in neighboring countries and does not unduly
ease oversight or free provisions excessively. Nevertheless, experience over the next year
will be critical in solidifying this assessment, and the authorities must be ready to act if
experience suggests undue easing of provisioning.
40.
Poland’s potential for a rapid catch-up to EU incomes levels is substantial, but a
decisive shift to pro-growth policies is essential to realize it. Such policies would also
pave the way to early euro adoption—another channel for speeding up the catch-up and
locking in a commitment to policy discipline. To this end, not only must fiscal policy be
reined in quickly, but also labor and product markets must demonstrate the flexibility to
ensure efficient adjustment in the absence of an independent monetary policy, and financial
sector supervision must be exemplary. The government has not committed to a timetable for
euro adoption—understandably, in light of the current political turmoil. But once a new
government with a multiyear mandate is in place, it would be well-advised to summon the
political support to prepare the economy expeditiously for euro adoption
41.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.

denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).

VII. Exchange Rate Arrangement
Poland accepted the obligation of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on June 1, 1995. The
exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions.
Since April 12, 2000, the zloty has floated freely.
Prior to that, the zloty had been pegged to a currency composite made up of the U.S. dollar,
deutsche mark, pound sterling, French franc, and the Swiss franc. As of January 1, 1999, the
currency composite was changed to a basket comprised of 55 percent euro and 45 percent U.S.

dollar. From January 1, 1995, the zloty was redenominated, with new Zl1 equaling old
Zl10,000. The central parity of the zloty was adjusted under a crawling peg policy at a
preannounced monthly rate. On May 16, 1995, a band of ±7 percent was introduced around the
central rate. Following the implementation of the new system, the zloty initially appreciated by
about 5 percent above the central rate. In September 1995, the exchange rate was allowed to
appreciate a further 1 percent within the band. In December 1995, the central parity was raised
by 6 percent, and at the same time the authorities allowed the actual exchange rate to
appreciate by 22 percentage points. On January 8, 1996 the monthly rate of crawl was reduced
to one percent. On February 26, 1998, with the zloty pushing towards its upper limit, the
newly-formed Monetary Policy Council (RPP) widened the fluctuation band from ±7 percent
to ±10 percent. At the same time, the rate of crawl was reduced from one percent to 0.8 percent
per month. On July 17, 1998, the crawling peg’s monthly rate of depreciation was cut from
0.8 percent to 0.65 percent. On September 9, 1998, the monthly rate of depreciation was
reduced further to 0.50 percent. On October 29, 1998, the zlotys trading band was widened to
12.5 percent. On March 1, 1999, the zloty’s trading band was widened to ±15 percent, and the
rate of crawl was lowered to 0.3 percent per month. On December 31, 1999, the official rate
was Zl4.08 per US$1. On April 12, 2000, the crawling band regime was abolished and the
zloty has since floated freely.
VIII.

Article IV Consultation

The last Article IV consultation was concluded on June 9, 2003 (EBM/03/54). In concluding
the consultation, Directors commended the authorities for achieving price stability and
welcomed the government’s fiscal reform proposal, but urged the authorities to use the
improving cyclical position to embark on a substantial fiscal adjustment and speed up
structural reforms.

POLAND—WORLD BANK ACTIVITY
1.
Poland rejoined the World Bank in 1986 and World Bank lending to Poland started in
1990. Since then the Bank has committed loans totaling US$5.4 billion equivalent. Total
loans outstanding and disbursed amount to US$2.5 billion as of April 2003. At present eleven
projects are under implementation, with an undisbursed balance of US$360 million. In
addition, the World Bank is administering three Global Environmental Facility operations
totaling US$33 million in commitments, with US$8.5 million undisbursed.
2.
Since 1990, the Bank has financed projects in a variety of areas including in
agriculture, coal sector restructuring, enterprise and financial restructuring, environment,
energy, forestry development, health, housing, railway sector restructuring, ports, roads, and
rural development. These include the Krakow Energy Efficiency project (US$15 million,
also co-financed by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF)), which aims at improving
energy efficiency of the city's district heating systems and end-users; a Railway
Restructuring loan (US$110 million), which is financing restructuring of the Polish State
Railways' (PKP) to increase efficiency, improve finances, and privatize selected activities
within a sound regulatory framework; a Rural Development Project (US$120 million), which
has the objective of rural restructuring and employment creations through promotion of
non-farm rural activities, strengthening of local governments and other institutions, financing
infrastructure investments, and improving rural education; and the Szczecin-Swinoujscie
Seaway and Port Modernization Project (US$38.5 million), which aims to promote Poland's
trade by developing an efficient administrative/managerial structure and improving physical
facilities. Other ongoing projects being financed by the World Bank are for rural
environmental protection, flood management, roads, Gdynia and Gdansk ports, power
transmission, water supply and development of geothermal resources. More recent loans
include the Hard Coal Social Mitigation Loan (US$200 million), which aims at supporting
the government’s Coal Reform Program (2003–06), specifically by mitigating the negative
effects associated with the further reduction of employment levels (a companion Coal Mine
Closure Loan is scheduled for Board approval at the end of June 2004 and should provide
between US$80–100 million for supporting closure of uneconomic production capacity in a
safe and environmentally sound manner); and a EUR 100 million loan for Rehabilitation and
Maintenance of Roads. Smaller institutional development grants are currently financing
activities to strengthen the processes of land administration and registration and to strengthen
budget management.
3.
The World Bank in consultation with the Polish government prepared in 2002 a
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) with three focuses; promoting a rebalancing of
macroeconomic policies through fiscal reform, assisting the Government to strengthen the
effectiveness of public expenditures and programs, and enhancing private sector-led growth
and employment creation. The Bank’s Executive Directors discussed the Country Assistance
Strategy in December 2002. As indicated in the CAS, total lending in 2003–05 could total as
much as US$1.4 billion. Areas for potential lending during this time include support for road
infrastructure, coal sector restructuring, rural development, health sector reform, and
education sector reform.

- 45 -

APPENDIX II

4.
In addition to its lending program, over the years of its involvement in Poland the
Bank has prepared a series of economic and sector work reports and policy notes that provide
advice on various poverty-related, institutional and structural reform issues. A Public
Expenditure and Institutional Review has been prepared with the Government in January
2003. Most recently, World Bank staff prepared with Government and non-Government
counterpart teams a Living Standards Assessment to help measure the status of poverty
reduction in Poland and advise on policy programs to achieve this objective, an
Anticorruption Update, an Investment Climate Assessment, and a Knowledge Economy
Assessment. Other work which has been completed in the past couple of years includes a
development policy assessment (2001), health and social sector reviews and policy notes
(1999–2001), a labor market review (2001); rural land, labor and capital markets (2001), and
a study on trade and foreign direct investment (2000). In 2000, a Financial Sector
Assessment on the Poland financial system was carried out under the joint IMF/World Bank
Financial Sector Assessment Program.

APPENDIX III

POLAND—STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Poland has a comprehensive macroeconomic database that has been improving in
recent years. The authorities publish a full range of economic and financial statistics, and
cooperate fully in providing information to the Fund. Data on the core indicators are
available on a timely basis (see the attached table on core statistical indicators). Consistent
with its commitment to providing a comprehensive set of high quality data, in an open
manner, Poland subscribes to the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), and
its metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board.
Real sector statistics
2.
The Central Statistical Office (GUS) compiles a wide range of real sector statistics,
most of which are published promptly in the monthly Statistical Bulletin. The main problems
for users include (i) the short span of comparable Polish data series, reflecting the upheavals
associated with transition to a market economy, (ii) inconsistencies between annual and
higher frequency data, reflecting differences in weights and differences in coverage, and
(iii) lack of easy electronic retrieval of these data.
3.
The national accounts follow the concepts and definitions of the European System of
Accounts 1995 (ESA 95), which is based on the System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA
1993). The GUS compiles annual and quarterly GDP estimates by production and
expenditure approach in current and constant prices, a full sequence of accounts by
institutional sectors, supply and use tables, input/output tables, annual financial accounts and
regional accounts. The statistical techniques are basically sound. The constant price estimates
are compiled in average prices of the previous year, using deflation techniques that generally
follow international standards. However, national accounts data still have some problems—
the subannual data are collected on a cumulative rather than on a discrete basis, and plans to
introduce proper benchmarking and chain-linking techniques have been delayed.
4.
The concepts and definitions of the CPI follows the ESA 95 standards and Eurostat’s
requirements for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index. Polish CPI does not cover the
shelter prices faced by household owner-occupants. The weights for the index are obtained
from the average annual expenditures primarily taken from the national Household Budget
Survey (HBS) of the previous calendar year, and are updated annually. From 1999 onwards,
the national classification is based on the Classification of Individual Consumption by
Purpose (COICOP). The scope of the index covers all resident households, except those in
some rural areas. Historical series are constructed using a chain method. Time series data are
available for the index with reference periods of 1990 and 1998.
5.
The producer price index (PPI) is based on the 1993 SNA concepts and definitions for
recording and valuation of product prices and weights. Its scope includes mining and
quarrying, manufacturing and electricity, gas and water supply. Output price indices are also
calculated for agriculture, construction, and business services such as transport, storage, and
communication. Since 2000, the index is classified by the Polish Classification of Activities

- 47 -

APPENDIX III

based on the General Industrial Classification of Economic Activities within the European
Communities, first revision (NACE, Rev.1), the Classification of Products by Activity, and
the List of Products of the European Communities. The PPI does not include any estimation
for missing prices and quality and seasonal adjustments.
Government finance statistics
6.
The authorities provide detailed state budget data to the Fund every month. In
addition, government finance statistics are reported to the Fund on a regular basis. The
classification of transactions in the official data still needs improvement. In the meantime,
the staff makes adjustments to the official data.
7.
The annual consolidated general, central and local government data are available in
the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. Monthly data on consolidated core operations
of the central government are reported in IFS.
Monetary statistics
8.
The National Bank of Poland (NBP) reports analytically useful data on a regular and
timely basis to the Fund with minimal delay. High-frequency data (every ten days) on the
central bank balance sheet and the monetary survey are also available with minimal delay. As
a member of the European Union, Poland is in the process of adopting the recommendations
of the European Central Bank (ECB) in the compilation of its monetary statistics. The
monetary statistics from March 2002 are generally consistent with the ECB framework. The
authorities have also revised the historical data to December 1996.
9.
The data module of the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC)
mission that visited Warsaw in January 2003 found that the concepts and definitions used by
the NBP to compile monetary statistics were in broad conformity with the guidelines outlined
in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. Nevertheless, the following concepts and
principles underlying valuation and classification of financial instruments deviate from the
MFSM: (1) financial derivatives are indistinguishably recorded under other assets/other
liabilities; (2) accrued interest on loans and deposits are included as part of other assets/other
liabilities, but not with the respective underlying instruments; similarly accrued interest on
securities other than shares issued by the depository corporations are included as part of other
liabilities; (3) loan-loss provisions are classified as special reserves under capital accounts
and reserves; and (4) valuation of shares and other equity on the asset side of the balance
sheets of the NBP and other depository corporations are not in market prices.
Notwithstanding the first three practices noted above differ from the MFSM guidelines, they
are in conformity with the ECB framework.
10.
The data presented on the balance sheets of the NBP and other depository
corporations provide insufficient breakdown of the claims on, and liabilities to, the
government and other resident sectors. It is impossible to derive net claims on general
government or central government on a consistent basis from the published data. Similarly,

- 48 -

APPENDIX III

interbank positions between the NBP and other depository corporations cannot be identified.
There are material differences between government finance statistics financing data and the
corresponding monetary data. The data module ROSC mission recommended that the NBP,
in cooperation with the Ministry of Finance, reconcile monetary and government finance
statistics and carry out the reconciliation exercise on a regular basis.
External sector statistics
11.
Some improvements have been made in the balance of payments data. Payments from
the kantor market are reported separately, but are allocated into current account components.
The NBP compiles the balance of payments on transaction basis with monthly and quarterly
frequency, including trade in goods. The trade data are fully consistent with the national
accounts data prepared by GUS. Despite these improvements, some additional issues need to
be addressed. The NBP now reports net foreign assets (NFA) rather than the net international
reserves (NIR) previously shown in the monetary survey. In contrast to NIR, NFA includes
less liquid foreign assets and liabilities. Finally, the coverage and reporting of the stock of
external debt, especially at maturities up to one year, could be improved.
12.
The 2003 data module ROSC mission recommended that Poland move to a
transaction-based monthly balance of payments, include interest on an accrued basis, make
explicit the legal requirement that the NBP disseminate balance of payments statistics,
separate insurance from transportation when making the c.i.f./f.o.b. adjustment, publish on a
regular basis a reconciliation table between international merchandise trade statistics and
“goods” in the balance of payments, and undertake periodic revision studies. Since 2004, the
transaction-based balance of payments is compiled and published monthly (though the
interest payments remain on a cash basis), and the reconciliation between the international
merchandise trade statistics and goods in the balance of payments is published quarterly.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
REPUBLIC OF POLAND
Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2004 Consultation
with the Republic of Poland
Approved by Michael Deppler and Liam P. Ebrill
July 8, 2004
1.
This supplement reviews developments in Poland since the preparation of the staff
report for the 2004 Article IV consultations and provides a staff comment.
I. RECENT ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS
2.
The recovery continues to be strong, while inflation has risen faster than
expected. Real GDP growth reached 6.9 percent year-on-year (2.8 percent quarter-on-quarter
seasonally adjusted) in the first quarter of 2004, substantially faster than the 4.7 percent
year-on-year (1.2 percent quarter-on-quarter) growth in Q4 2003. Most of the pick-up in
growth was attributable to a rapid inventory accumulation, though fixed investment growth
also rose. The current account deficit rose in the first quarter of 2004, but, owing to a strong
pick-up in service exports, was less than staff expected. CPI inflation increased in May to
3.4 percent (year-on-year) mainly due to food and oil price increases. Nevertheless, inflation
expectations are steady at about 2½ percent (year-on-year) and nominal wage growth fell to
4.4 percent (year-on-year) in May. Retail sales, export, import and industrial sales remained
robust through May. Employment growth, however, is still weak.
3.
Prime Minister Belka’s government was approved by Parliament in a second
round confidence vote in June. The economic team, including Deputy Prime Minister
Hausner, of the previous government remains in place. To secure the support of the new
social democratic party (SDPL), the ruling coalition had to agree to a no-confidence vote in
October which could lead to early elections in late 2004 or early 2005. Mainstream
opposition parties strengthened their positions and the support for populist parties diminished
in the European elections.
II. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
4.
Recent data releases support the projections in the staff report of a reasonably
strong recovery with a modest current account deficit; inflation in the near term,
however, is likely to be higher than projected.

-2-

•

Staff have revised GDP growth projections for 2004 slightly upward, from 5 to
5.3 percent, reflecting expectations of somewhat stronger investment growth and a
smaller negative contribution from net exports than in the staff report.

•

The relatively small upward revision, despite a far stronger than expected outcome in
the first quarter, reflects the staff’s assumption that some pick-up in final domestic
demand over the balance of the year will be largely met by drawing down the large
inventory accumulation in the first quarter.

•

In spite of the stronger-than-expected current account outcome in the first quarter, the
staff’s projection for the year remains unchanged because higher oil and commodity
price projections suggest a smaller terms of trade gain than previously expected.

•

Reflecting a stronger-than-expected pick-up in food prices, staff has increased its
projection for the average inflation rate in 2004 from 2.9 to 3.5 percent.
III. FISCAL POLICY

5.
The fiscal outlook for 2004 has improved somewhat. With stronger growth and
higher tax revenue so far this year than previously expected, staff projects the general
government deficit at 7 percent of GDP, down from 7.2 percent indicated in the staff report.
Assuming the appreciation of the zloty since mid-May holds, public debt should remain
below 55 percent of GDP by year-end.
6.
The new government has committed itself to the implementation of the key
elements of the Hausner plan. Although a number of social benefit reform measures in the
Hausner plan have been abandoned, staff estimates of annual savings in 2005–07 fall by only
0.1 percent of GDP.
IV. MONETARY POLICY
7.
The MPC increased the policy rate by 50 basis points on June 30 and maintained
a restrictive bias. As analysts expected a 25 basis point-increase, the MPC’s decision
surprised the market. In its statement, the MPC pointed to strengthening domestic demand
and the increase in inflation expectations that had taken place already before the high CPI
inflation for May was released as the main inflation risk factors.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
8.
The resolution, at least for now, of recent political uncertainties and the new
government’s commitment to renew the effort to implement the Hausner plan are
welcome. The government should seize this opportunity to press the fiscal reform agenda
vigorously. Early statements provide some hope that the government will attempt to do so.
While part of the Hausner plan appears to have been abandoned, what remains is still a
critical mass that should be implemented in time for the 2005 budget. This will be a critical

-3-

test of the government’s will to arrest the damaging fiscal deterioration of the past few years
and reposition the government’s role in the economy.
9.
The increase in the policy rate in June signaled concerns about the impact of
rising prices on inflation expectations and future wage demands. The recent jump in
inflation—due to one-off factors, which now seem to be stronger than previously expected by
staff and market participants—combined with an expansionary budget and a strong rebound
in economic activity made a case for a policy response. Going forward, it will be important to
ensure that the policy response to supply side influences remains measured. In its future
decisions, therefore, the MPC should take into account that—as long as inflation expectations
continue to be contained and nominal wage demands do not accelerate—inflation should
revert toward the middle of the target range when temporary shocks dissipate in 2005. While
the output gap seems to be closing faster than staff previously expected, the modest nominal
wage increase so far suggests that high unemployment continues to impose wage discipline.
Nonetheless, nominal wage developments and changes in inflationary expectations will have
to be closely monitored in the coming period. Setting, early on, a nominal wage growth target
in the budget that is in line with longer-term inflation trends would help with anchoring
expectations at this stage.

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with
the Republic of Poland
On July 12, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Poland.1
Background
Since mid-2002 a recovery has taken shape, but it is not yet fully entrenched.
With strong exports and robust consumption, GDP growth picked up gradually, reaching
6.9 percent (year-on-year) in the first quarter of 2004. Nevertheless, investment growth
remains moderate. Although the fiscal stance in 2003 was slightly restrictive, a
considerable easing of monetary conditions since 2001 supported the recovery: policy
rates were massively reduced between early 2001 and mid-2003, while falling interest
differentials and unsettled politics contributed to a 20 percent real effective depreciation
of the zloty in the past two years. With strong gains in the service sector, employment
has grown modestly in the past year, for the first time since 1997. This, combined with
accelerating wages and rising social transfers, kept consumption growth robust.
Slack in the economy is diminishing but without signs yet of excessive demand
pressure. The output gap narrowed slightly in 2003, but at over 2 percent of potential
GDP, was still sizable. The unemployment rate of 20 percent is well above the estimated
structural rate of 15 percent. Falling unit labor costs and, in turn, strong increases in
profit margins have been key to containing current account and inflation pressures

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

during the upswing. The strong increase in corporate savings, while investment fell,
pushed the current account deficit down to 2 percent of GDP in 2003; and in the
absence of domestic cost push and with an unusually small pass-through of the zloty
depreciation by profit-rich firms, net inflation (excluding food and fuel) was steady at
1-1½ percent. A rise in headline inflation to 3.4 percent in May (still within National Bank
of Poland’s 2½ percent ±1 percent target) was mostly due to food and oil price
increases.
Financial markets have been unsettled. Despite low inflation, long-term interest rates
have risen since mid-2003, initially in response to the announcement of an expansionary
2004 budget and more recently to unsettled politics. Unlike in most other new EU
countries, the domestic spread over the 10-year euro yield has more than doubled since
mid-2003. Pointing to weak political and fiscal fundamentals, S&P and Fitch
downgraded Poland’s domestic debt and the outlook on its foreign debt in the past year.
The weak responses of investment and employment raise concerns about fundamental
impediments to the recovery. Uncertainties about the recovery in western Europe likely
play a role. But investment and employment growth remain substantially weaker than in
other central European countries facing the same markets. And while excess capacity
may still be a factor in some sectors, it seems likely that policy weaknesses during the
past several years are influencing investor confidence and employment trends.
A weak fiscal situation inherited from the 1990s has been allowed to drift. Repeated
fiscal reform efforts have failed in the face of vested interests and fractious politics, and
social expenditure remained excessive and poorly targeted. An increase in
unemployment owing to the cycle and enterprise restructuring was aggravated by
policy-induced disincentives in the labor market. With considerable rigidities in labor
market and poorly targeted social transfers, the economic slowdown worsened poverty.
Lax fiscal policy left the burden of responding to a large current account deficit and
rising inflation in the late-1990s to monetary policy. Excessive tightening and a
simultaneous large real appreciation (more than 25 percent during mid-1999–mid-2001)
produced a sharp, though short-lived, diminution in price competitiveness.
This contributed to a deep decline in investment in 2001–02 and, as it was most severe
in labor-intensive industries, to massive lay-offs.
Privatization slowed sharply in the past years. Several major companies slated for
privatization in 2001 have still not been sold. Slowing privatization, and stronger
competition from neighboring countries led to a decline in foreign direct investment
(FDI). The recently adopted Economic Freedom Act was an important first step to
improve the investment climate.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Poland’s accession to the European Union on
May 1, 2004, which sets the stage for faster economic growth and income convergence
based on stronger policy coordination with Europe. They noted that the Polish economic
conjuncture is favorable, with a strong cyclical recovery alongside a small current

-3-

account deficit and low underlying inflation. Improved overall competitiveness
underpinned by modest wage growth and a large depreciation of the zloty have
supported the recovery. The near-term economic outlook is also positive, with the
prospect of strong growth in exports and output being supported by an improved
external environment, strong profitability of enterprises, and domestic fiscal stimulus.
At the same time, Directors noted that the response of employment and investment to
the pickup in activity has thus far been modest and that unemployment and public debt
remain high. Furthermore, Poland remains vulnerable to policy slippages stemming from
political uncertainty and a lack of consensus for adjustment and reform, factors that
have deterred private investment by weakening market confidence and increasing the
cost of financing.
Against this background, Directors urged the Polish authorities to seize the opportunity
provided by the current favorable conditions to implement ambitious fiscal and structural
reforms. A durable recovery will require a sustained increase in investment and fiscal
consolidation consistent with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact. In addition,
tackling deep-rooted structural weaknesses will require building a political consensus for
reform. Decisive actions in these areas will help secure a balanced and lasting recovery
into the medium term, and demonstrate that the authorities are embarked on a clear
agenda of policies to reap the full benefits of EU membership and to move ahead with
the adoption of the euro.
Directors expressed concern about the steady worsening of the fiscal position during the
past several years and the attendant threat to keeping the debt-to-GDP ratio within the
constitutional limit. Although pension reform has mitigated an important part of potential
difficulties related to population aging, costs will still be significant, particularly in the
health care sector; this strengthens the case for timely fiscal consolidation. Directors
were therefore disappointed that the 2004 budget introduced an undesirable fiscal
stimulus and is likely to further increase the debt ratio. While welcoming the initiatives
that have been taken to reduce the corporate income tax rate and co-finance the sizable
increase in EU funds, Directors regretted that the opportunity to reprioritize budget
spending to make such policies sustainable was missed. They therefore urged that, at a
minimum, any windfall revenues from higher-than-predicted growth in 2004 be saved
and used to lower the government debt.
Directors welcomed the Hausner plan for fiscal reform and felt that its full
implementation would be a major step in the process of medium-term fiscal
consolidation. They agreed that its key reforms—aimed at streamlining social transfers,
restructuring state-owned enterprises, and broadening the tax base—would target
Poland’s most acute fiscal excesses. Directors urged that the 2005 budget reflect full
implementation of the plan. They also encouraged the authorities to begin consideration
of measures beyond the Hausner plan, which will be necessary to stabilize the debt
ratio, minimize the vulnerability of public finances to shifts in market sentiment, and
support the recovery in private investment. Such measures should focus on further
streamlining social benefits and public administration and reducing mandated public
spending, while also improving revenue administration.

Directors agreed with the view that the authorities’ inflation targeting framework has
served the country well. In the immediate future, headline inflation will remain at
elevated levels owing to one-off influences. Directors stressed that the new Monetary
Policy Council (MPC) should continue to ensure that these influences do not feed into
expectations and become entrenched in an inflationary process, and they welcomed, in
this context, its cautious approach—whereby the MPC first shifted to a tightening bias
and subsequently raised interest rates as the risk of one-off factors influencing
expectations increased. Looking ahead, Directors considered that the still sizeable
amount of slack in the economy will help inflation revert toward the middle of the target
range as temporary shocks dissipate in 2005.
Directors underscored the importance of fiscal and structural reform for monetary policy.
They felt that decisive measures to ensure a strong supply-side response to rising
demand will be the best insurance against pressure on interest rates through the
recovery. Directors also agreed that an improved policy mix—with tighter fiscal policy
avoiding the need for monetary tightening as the recovery proceeds—should provide
maximum protection for Poland’s currently strong external competitiveness.
Directors agreed that a flexible exchange rate continues to serve Poland well, both as a
shock-absorber and as assurance that the zloty is well-aligned upon Poland’s entry into
ERM2. They commended the MPC for signaling its support for continuing a policy of
non-intervention in the foreign exchange market. Directors noted Poland’s comfortable
reserve cushion, which they considered a strength for attracting and maintaining the
confidence of international capital markets. They cautioned that any decisions about the
optimal level of central bank reserves should take into account both the role played by
this cushion and needs associated with prospective participation in ERM2.
Directors noted that the banking system had adjusted well to the slowdown in activity in
2001–02 and the depreciation of the zloty. They welcomed the slowdown since late
2003 of the previously rapid growth in foreign exchange-denominated credit. Going
forward, Directors urged the authorities to continue to monitor the health of the banking
system closely, as credit growth to the private sector, and households in particular, is
likely to remain strong. Directors noted that the new loan classification system adopted
in January 2004 moves practices in Poland closer to those in other countries in the
region. Although Directors were reassured that the changes to the system would not
ease oversight unduly or free provisions excessively, the authorities should be ready to
act if developments during the next few months created any room for doubt.
Directors urged the new government to give high priority to reinvigorating economic
restructuring and reducing the size of the public sector. They cautioned that inefficient
state enterprises could impede Poland’s competitiveness, and called on the authorities
to speed up privatization and divestment of the government’s minority shareholdings in
privatized enterprises. They welcomed the recent adoption by Parliament of the
Economic Freedom Act aimed at reducing red tape and simplifying procedures for
setting up new enterprises. Directors noted that Poland’s structural unemployment
problem is attributable in part to the shifts in the industrial structure in response to
changes in competitiveness. In this context, they emphasized the importance of

-5-

pursuing labor market reforms, measures to reduce skill mismatches, and changes to
social benefits in order to increase incentives to work and lower structural
unemployment.
Poland’s statistical database is adequate for surveillance. Directors noted the progress
in improving fiscal transparency, and encouraged the authorities to further reduce
budget fragmentation and emphasized the importance of transparent recapitalization of
loss making state-owned enterprises.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV
Consultation with Poland is also available.
