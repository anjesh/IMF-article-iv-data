Staff Report for the 2003 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2003 Consultation with
St. Vincent and the Grenadines
Approved by José Fajgenbaum and Matthew Fisher
April 1, 2004
Discussions. A staff team, comprising A. Salehizadeh (Head), J. Chai, P. Kufa, and Y. Wu (all
WHD), held discussions in Kingstown during October 27–November 7, 2003, with D. Robinson
(WHD) joining the mission on November 3. The team was assisted by staff of the Eastern
Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB). I. Bennett and
R. Campbell (OED) participated in the final meetings. The team met with the prime minister
(who is also the Minister of Finance), the Director General of Finance, other senior government
officials, the leader of parliamentary opposition, and representatives of labor, business, and the
financial sector.
Exchange system. St. Vincent and the Grenadines, with a population of about 110,000 and per
capita GDP of US$3,300, is one of eight Eastern Caribbean countries and territories comprising
the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU), of which six are Fund members. ECCU
countries and territories share a common central bank (the ECCB) and the common currency
(E.C. dollar) is pegged to the U.S. dollar. St. Vincent and the Grenadines has accepted the
obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of
restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. Fund relations are
summarized in Appendix I.
Political situation. St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a parliamentary democracy. The Unity
Labour Party assumed power following the March 2001 elections, in which it defeated the
National Democratic Party (in power since 1984) by winning 12 out of 15 elected seats in
parliament. Elections are due no later than March 2006.
Previous Article IV consultation. At the conclusion of the consultation on January 27, 2003,
Directors expressed concern about the fiscal deterioration and rising public sector debt. They
urged wage restraint, a curb in other recurrent expenditures, prioritization of public sector
investments with a focus on growth promotion and poverty reduction, a broadening of the tax
base, and removal of tax exemptions. Directors cautioned against expensive foreign borrowing
and encouraged the authorities to improve the management of public enterprises. Directors urged
bolstering the health of the financial system by restructuring the state-owned commercial bank
and improving the prudential framework of the nonbank sector.
Statistics. The statistical base has improved in recent years, but weaknesses remain in certain
areas (for example the labor market, national accounts, and balance of payments statistics) that
hinder effective surveillance (Appendix IV).

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Recent developments
•

St. Vincent and the Grenadines enjoyed relatively high economic growth
through most of the 1990s, but growth has slowed in recent years. Following
stagnation in 2001, a moderate recovery started in 2002 and the economy is
estimated to have grown by about 1½ percent a year in 2002–03. Growth has been
supported by a rebound in agricultural production and expansionary fiscal
policies, including large public sector investments, while private sector activity
has been weak.

•

The overall fiscal stance in 2002–03 was relaxed, with fiscal stimulus coming
through a strong increase in investment partly offset by a higher current
surplus of the central government. The overall deficit of the nonfinancial public
sector doubled to 3½ percent of GDP a year over this period largely due to higher
capital spending. As a result, public sector debt increased to more than 71 percent
at end-2003. At the same time, central government current revenue rose sharply
(due to significant improvements in broadening the tax base, removing tax
concessions, and strengthening tax administration, as well as one-off factors),
while government wages were frozen and nonwage current expenditure was kept
under tight control.

Policy discussions
•

The authorities should revert to their prudent fiscal policies and continue to
contain current spending. The public sector investment program should focus
on projects that are aimed at enhancing the economy’s growth potential and are
largely financed on concessional terms to ensure debt sustainability.

•

Given the unusual stress in the ECCU region, the authorities should
formulate a contingency plan in the event that a crisis occurs. The plan should
include fiscal measures to reduce (or at least rephase) financing needs.

•

The authorities should address the weaknesses in the banking system’s
regulatory and supervisory framework which were identified by the ECCU
FSAP exercise. In particular, they should develop expeditiously a clear strategy
for the state-owned National Commercial Bank, which has a high nonperforming
loans ratio.

•

Reforms in several areas are needed to enhance the growth potential. Key
hindrances to growth include weak institutional capacity, labor market rigidities,
small size of the economy, and high cost of doing business. Efforts to strengthen
public institutions, improve the supply of skilled labor, enhance access to global
markets and deepen regional integration, and improve the efficiency of public
enterprises including utilities should be intensified.

Tertiary sector
Real GDP at factor costs
has slowed since the late 1990s. Real GDP
growth averaged 3½ percent a year for the
decade; excluding bananas (the key
traditional export crop), growth averaged
4¼ percent a year (Figure 1). The economy
underwent a major structural transformation
in the 1990s as the share of agriculture in
GDP declined by about 10 percentage points
(reflecting the retrenchment of the banana
industry),1 while that of services increased by the same rate, with tourism becoming the
largest foreign exchange earner. As the economy is vulnerable to external factors (such as
growth in the United States and the United Kingdom―the origin of most tourists―and
weather-related shocks such as hurricanes and droughts), real GDP growth during
the 1990s showed significant yearly variations (between -2.9 percent to 8.3 percent).
Unemployment has remained high (estimated at about 21 percent).2

2.
To reduce growth volatility, since the mid-1990s the government has
attempted to implement an economic diversification program supported by major
public investments.3 Reflecting the concern with the social implications of rising rural
unemployment, the cornerstone of the economic diversification program has been
structural reforms in the agricultural sector, aimed not only at promoting non-banana
crops, but also at increasing the productivity of the banana sector. Although progress has
been made on irrigation projects and on identifying more productive banana farmers, the
implementation of other aspects of the diversification program has been slow.

1

Banana production declined from a peak of around 80,000 tons in 1990 to about
37,000 tons in 2002.
2

This estimate, based on the results from the 2001 census, represents an increase of
about 1 percentage point from the preceding official estimate based on the 1991 census.

3

During the 1990s, public sector capital spending averaged 11½ percent of GDP a year,
70 percent of which was undertaken by the central government, and the remainder by the
public enterprises.

debt to 66 percent of GDP (from 49 percent
in 1998).5 During the decade, external public
debt service averaged about 5 percent of exports of goods and services and less than
10 percent of central government’s current revenue.

4.
Despite the high frequency of natural disasters, the fiscal deficits in the 1990s
were modest. During the decade, the current account surplus (savings) of the
nonfinancial public sector (NFPS)6 averaged 7½ percent of GDP a year, while the overall
deficit of the sector was 1 percent of GDP.7 One half of the NFPS savings was accounted
for by the central government, while the other half was shared equally between the
National Insurance Scheme (NIS) and the public enterprises (mainly the electricity and
water companies).

5

In the early 1990s, the government participated in a joint venture with the private sector
for the construction of a marina (Ottley Hall project). However, the project failed, the
private sector partners defaulted on the loan, and the government assumed the loan which
equaled 17½ percent of 1999 GDP.

6

The nonfinancial public sector includes the central government, the Kingstown Board,
the National Insurance Scheme (NIS), and 10 public enterprises.

7

The central government overall deficit averaged 1.9 percent of GDP, while the NIS had
an overall surplus averaging 1.6 percent of GDP and the public enterprises had an
average deficit of ¾ percent of GDP.

5.
Since 1990, the St. Vincent and
Grenadines’ economy has generally
performed better than the ECCU average.
Real GDP growth, central government
balances, and public sector debt have been at
levels better than the ECCU averages. A
notable exception is the government wage bill
(as a percent of GDP), which has been higher
than the average for the ECCU.

With GDP per capita at the lower
end of the ECCU average, the government
has placed poverty alleviation at the forefront of its economic program. An Interim
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) has been prepared, which is intended to serve
as a blueprint for achieving the Millennium Development Goal of halving the level of
poverty by 2015 (Box 1).

Recent developments
7.
Following stagnation in 2001, a
moderate recovery started in 2002. The
economy is estimated to have grown about
1½ percent a year in 2002–03 (Table 1).
Growth has been supported by a rebound in
agricultural production and countercyclical
fiscal policies, including large public sector
investments. Private sector wage increases have
averaged 4 percent during 1999–2003, and after
a long period of no change, minimum wages
were increased in 2003 (Box 2). Inflation has
remained in the low single digits, reflecting the
monetary discipline of the currency union. The
12-month inflation rate is projected at
1½ percent in December 2003.

public sector debt increased to more than 71 percent at end-2003 (Table 4).

In 2002–03, central government
current revenue rose sharply while current
expenditure was held under close control.
Significant improvements in broadening the tax
base, removing tax concessions, and
strengthening tax administration, as well as oneoff factors have contributed to the increase in
revenue.8 At the same time, current expenditure
remained largely unchanged, as government
wages were frozen and nonwage current
expenditure was kept under tight control.9

cell phones, following the liberalization of
the telecommunication sector; (ii) imports of
machinery, equipment, and building materials largely related to public sector investment;
and (iii) the impact of higher international petroleum prices. Tourism receipts have risen
since the September 11, 2001 attacks, but are estimated to have increased only marginally
in 2003, as uncertainties before the Iraq war affected international travel during the first
quarter of the year (the main tourist season). About three-quarters of the current account
deficit during 2000–03 was financed by direct investment, while the remainder was
financed by public sector borrowing.

8

Current revenue was 3 percent of GDP higher in 2003 than in 2000. The one-off factors
contributing to the revenue increase included around 1 percent of GDP in duty collections
on imports of cell phones in 2003 (see paragraph 10).
9

Current expenditure in 2003 was about ½ percent of GDP higher than in 2000. The
wage bill increased by ½ percent of GDP in 2002, reflecting new hiring as well as a
4 percent bonus that was granted to civil service employees in December 2002 in lieu of a
general salary increase.

after rising by 8⅓ percent in 2002, broad
money is estimated to have increased by about 3 percent in 2003. As a consequence of
the resulting excess liquidity, commercial banks continued to build up their net foreign
asset positions and lowered slightly their deposit rates in 2003 (except for the rate on
saving deposits), while keeping lending rates basically unchanged.10

Prudential indicators provide mixed signals about the strengths of the
banking system, but point to significant weakness of the state-owned bank which
holds about a third of banking system assets.11 Banks’ loan portfolios remain
concentrated on personal lending and their profitability is low relative to the ECCU
average. The ratio of nonperforming loans (NPL) to total loans was around 13 percent at
end-June 2003 (Table 7), slightly below the ECCU average (14 percent). While the
branches of foreign banks had an average NPL ratio of 4½ percent, this ratio for the
locally incorporated banks, which account for about 60 percent of banking system assets,
stood at 19 percent, with their provision for loan losses as a share of total nonperforming
loans amounting to 25 percent. The ratios for locally incorporated banks largely reflect
those of the state-owned National Commercial Bank (NCB).
13.
Regulation and supervision of the offshore sector has been strengthened, but
much still remains to be done.12 As a result of enhanced regulation and supervision,
St. Vincent and the Grenadines was removed from the OECD’s list of tax havens in 2002
and from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) list of noncooperative countries and

10

The rate on saving deposits was not lowered because it is subject to the ECCB interest
rate floor of 3 percent.

11

The commercial banking system comprises four banks (the NCB, one subsidiary of a
regional—non-ECCU—bank, and two branches of foreign banks). The subsidiary of the
regional bank is locally incorporated and is classified in the ECCB statistics as a local
bank.

12

As of end-September 2003, the offshore financial sector comprised 6,695 international
business companies (IBCs), 394 trusts, 11 banks, 5 insurance companies, 9 mutual
funds/asset managing companies, and 40 registered agents.

territories (NCCTs) in June 2003.13 The short-term consequence of the strengthened
regulation and supervision has been a sharp reduction in the number of offshore banks
(which stood at 11 as of end-September 2003, compared with 44 at endDecember 2001).14 Despite improvements, the prudential supervision of the offshore
sector remains less robust than that of the domestic financial sector.
14.
Progress has been made on structural reforms. Steps have been taken to
diversify the economy and enhance its external competitiveness, attract foreign
investment, improve the budgetary process, and strengthen the regulation of the financial
sector.
•

Diversification: The restructuring of the banana sector has continued, and efforts
to diversify into other crops and agro-processing have advanced. These efforts
include conducting research and training of farmers for the development of nonbanana crops, acquiring relevant technology, and improving marketing.

•

Growth and competitiveness: Efforts have been made to promote foreign
investment by, inter alia, establishing a one-stop investment shop and
implementing training programs to improve labor skills.

•

Fiscal management: The budgetary process has improved through the
introduction of a three-year rolling budget and the concentration of the planning
functions of line ministries in the ministry of finance and planning. There has also
been progress in restructuring public enterprises as a result of establishing
quarterly financial reviews and implementing strategic corporate plans.

•

Financial sector supervision: An umbrella supervisory agency has been
established recently, with a coordinating role for the expanding domestic financial
system.
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS

15.
Over the past several years, the Fund policy advice to St. Vincent and the
Grenadines has centered on the need to strengthen public finances. Other Fund
recommendations have included the need to address data deficiencies and to draw a
schedule for possible privatization of selected public enterprises. Implementation of

Following the removal of the country from the FATF list of NCCTs, 154 new entities
were registered during the third quarter of 2003, compared with 144 for the
corresponding period in 2002.

14

This reduction led to a drop in government revenue from this sector, despite an upward
revision of fees. The government revenue from the sector during January–
September 2003 was EC$1.9 million, compared with EC$2.8 million in 2002.

- 11 -

previous Fund advice has been mixed. Significant progress has been made in
implementing measures to strengthen expenditure control and improve tax
administration. However, overall macroeconomic policy has deviated from Fund
recommendations, in part due to the impact of exogenous shocks and the need the
authorities felt for pursuing more active countercyclical fiscal policy. In the structural
area, while the authorities concur with Fund recommendations, progress has been limited
in large part due to capacity constraints.
16.
Discussions focused on the challenges facing the authorities in reinvigorating
private sector growth while preserving macroeconomic stability. In this context,
discussions covered near-term prospects and risks as well as the medium-term outlook.
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff that the current strategy of government-led
growth through large public sector investment can only provide a temporary boost to the
economy as sooner or later a debt constraint will be encountered. They also agreed that
policies should be geared toward preserving macroeconomic stability and ensuring fiscal
sustainability over the medium term.
17.
The authorities believe that the currency board arrangement (CBA) has
provided a long period of price stability, and reiterated their commitment to its
maintenance. The staff noted that pressures on the continued stability of the CBA are
mounting, as several ECCB member countries face challenges similar to those faced by
St. Vincent and the Grenadines but start from deeper fiscal imbalances and are
accumulating substantial debts with stagnant growth. The authorities agreed that
achieving the fiscal targets adopted by the ECCB’s Monetary Council would provide
reassurance of the consistency of fiscal positions within the CBA (Table 9). The mission
noted that the adoption of these targets—enforced either on a regional basis via the
ECCB (or any other relevant regional entity) or through national legislation, for example
in the form of a fiscal responsibility law—would provide an important signal that
national fiscal policies will seek to achieve these targets.
A. Near-Term Prospects and Vulnerabilities
18.
A modest recovery is projected for
the near-term, subject to substantial risks.
The outlook for 2004 is for real GDP to grow
by 2–2½ percent but private sector activity is
expected to remain weak. In addition to the
usual risks related to volatility in the global
economy, uncertainties in the tourism sector,
and other potential exogenous shocks, the
region as a whole is undergoing a period of
unusual stress. As the countries in the region
seek to resolve their situations, there is a
possibility that events in one country could
spill over into the other countries in the
region. While the comparatively strong

starting point of St. Vincent and the Grenadines provides additional room for maneuver
in such an event, the staff strongly recommended the formulation of a contingency plan
that should include fiscal measures to reduce financing needs. However, as the size of the
gross financing needs of the government in the near-term is not large, the authorities did
not see much risk and felt that they had sufficient flexibility on timing expenditures to
withstand temporary funding disruptions. In this connection, they pointed to the
continued decline in interest rates on recent government placements in the Regional
Government Securities Market (RGSM).
B. Financial Sector Policy
19.
The authorities have begun addressing the weaknesses in the banking
system’s regulatory and supervisory framework which were identified by the ECCU
FSAP exercise (Box 3).15 To this end, the government has drafted amendments to the
Banking Act and the ECCB Agreement Act, which are expected to be approved soon.16
The authorities have also given high priority to developing a clear strategy for the NCB,
and have begun to take steps to restructure the bank, including by reorganizing its Board
of Directors and changing its senior management, as well as selling its properties on a
sale and lease back arrangement. The staff recommended that in the meantime, it will be
important for the authorities and the ECCB to closely monitor the performance of the
bank.
20.
The authorities are also taking steps to enhance the regulation and
supervision of the nonbank financial institutions (NBFI) and the offshore financial
sector. The government has established an umbrella agency (Supervisory and Regulatory
Unit) in the Ministry of Finance and Planning to regulate the activities of the NBFI
sector, which has grown rapidly in recent years and accounts for 28 percent of total assets
of the financial system.17 The authorities have requested technical assistance from the
CARTAC to draft amendments to the International Financial Services laws, taking into
15

The FSAP for the ECCU, which was conducted in September–October 2003, identified
several weaknesses in the banking system that need to be addressed, including
unacceptably high levels of nonperforming loans in indigenous banks, the uncertain
quality of capital of these banks, and weaknesses in supervision of domestic and offshore
financial sectors.

16

These amendments were proposed by the ECCB to bring the banking laws more in line
with international standards and to give the ECCB more authority to deal with problem
banks.
17

The financial system includes four commercial banks, one small state-owned
development bank, and the NBFI sector. The latter comprises 49 institutions and includes
2 nonbank credit institutions, 25 insurance companies, and 22 other institutions (building
and loan societies, credit unions, cooperatives, and money transfer agencies).

offshore banking sector with the Basel Core Principles, as well as the CFATF review of
AML/CFT.18
C. Fiscal Policy
21.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to pursue a prudent fiscal
policy. They emphasized their intention to contain current expenditure so as to achieve a
current surplus of at least 3 percent of GDP in 2004. The mission’s preliminary
projections indicated that absent the one-off factors contributing to revenue growth in
2003, the current surplus could reach close to 3¾ percent of GDP and the overall deficit
of the central government could increase slightly to 2 percent of GDP in 2004. However,
the staff’s preliminary estimates suggested that an increase in current surplus of 1
percentage point of GDP to around 4¾ percent (and a corresponding decline in the
overall deficit) would be consistent with the achievement of the ECCB’s guideline for the
debt-to-GDP ratio by 2008.
22.
The authorities have decided to grant wage increases to civil service
employees totaling 7 percent over 2004–05.19 While an increase in public sector wages
and salaries was expected following two years of wage freeze, the mission expressed
concern about the potential signaling effect of the government decision (announced
during the mission’s stay), as it could lead to high wage increases in the private sector
and dampen growth prospects. The authorities indicated that, in general, public sector
wage awards follow (and are less than) those in the private sector and not the other way
around. Furthermore, they stated that the adjustment was needed in order to preserve the
morale of the civil service and retain qualified employees.
23.
Given the continued weakness in private sector activity, the authorities
viewed the public sector investment program (PSIP) as key to stimulating economic
growth in the near term and providing the basis for private sector-led growth in the
medium term. They agreed with the mission that it is important that the PSIP focus only
on projects that are aimed at enhancing the economy’s growth potential and are largely
financed on concessional terms to ensure debt sustainability. The authorities noted that
debt levels remain amongst the lowest in the ECCU and that, given the concessional
nature of much of the debt stock, the economy could sustain a somewhat higher debt-toGDP ratio.

18

The ECCU Financial System Stability Assessment (the staff report on which is being
prepared and will be issued shortly) found that the offshore banking sector was
noncompliant with nine of the 30 Basel Core Principles.

19

The wage increases are phased, 4 percent in 2004 and 3 percent in 2005. Public sector
wage negotiations in the past have normally resulted in three-year contracts.

- 14 -

24.
The authorities agreed that a key element in ensuring medium-term fiscal
sustainability is the continuous control over current spending, in particular the
wage bill. In this context, the mission stressed that given the large size of the wage bill, a
prudent wage and employment policy as well as civil service reform to increase its
efficiency need to play a central role in rationalizing expenditure. The authorities noted
that the government was committed to civil service reform and, in this vein, has
established a Public Sector Reform Unit, which will focus on four areas: (i) establishment
of a performance management and development system; (ii) reclassification of the public
service; (iii) revision of the regulatory instruments; and (iv) improvement of customer
service. Work is proceeding on most of these areas, including the reclassification exercise
which is on target for a phased implementation starting in about two years. The
authorities are also looking forward to the upcoming public expenditure review with the
World Bank which could help in streamlining and improving the efficiency of spending.
25.
The authorities have embarked on a tax reform aimed at simplifying the tax
system and broadening the tax base. Major steps include the introduction of a valueadded tax (VAT), a review of the property tax, and the elimination of ad hoc tax
exemptions—consistent with the preliminary report of the OECS Tax Reform and
Administration Commission. In 2004, the authorities plan to establish a VAT
implementation unit within the ministry of finance, with a view to introducing the VAT
in 2006. To this end, they have requested technical assistance from the Fund/CARTAC.
The government also intends to modernize the property tax over the medium term by
replacing the current system based on ascribed rental value with one based on marketvalue assessments.
26.
The authorities are committed to building efficient and accountable public
institutions, including the public enterprises. In this connection, the mission noted that
notwithstanding some progress toward restructuring public enterprises, additional steps
are needed to strengthen their financial position and enhance efficiency. In particular, the
staff recommended: (i) establishing explicit financial goals and performance indicators
for the public enterprises, particularly for the electricity and water companies, with full
management accountability; and (ii) advancing preparations for commercial public
enterprises (such as the Marketing Corporation and the electricity company―VINLEC)
to be listed on the Eastern Caribbean Stock Exchange, as a key step towards divestiture.
The authorities agreed to strengthen the quarterly financial performance reviews and
expedite the implementation of strategic corporate plans that have been established for
public enterprises.

- 15 -

D. Competitiveness and Growth
27.
The authorities agreed that in the
context of the fixed exchange rate regime,
competitiveness depends crucially on
continued fiscal discipline, wage
moderation and labor market flexibility,
and increased factor productivity. The
mission noted that even though the Eastern
Caribbean dollar had depreciated by about
13 percent in real effective terms over the
last two years (October 2001–October
2003), in line with the depreciation of the
U.S. dollar vis-à-vis other major currencies,
a number of indicators (e.g., slow growth,
weak exports, and high unemployment)
suggest that competitiveness is weak, at
least in some sectors. Recent increases in
private sector wages, including the
minimum wages, have likely weakened
competitiveness further. Nevertheless, the
performance of the St. Vincent and the
Grenadines’ tourism sector has been better
than the ECCU average in recent years.

prospects. Given that the medium-term
prospects for the banana sector remain
uncertain, the authorities have appropriately stepped up their agricultural diversification
and agro-processing programs. The government has facilitated growth in the
telecommunication sector as it liberalized the market by granting licenses for fixed lines,
private networks, and internet broadband. As for the labor market, the authorities have
made welcome efforts to improve the supply of skilled labor (for example, through
expanded vocational training programs). The mission, however, noted that the recent
increase in guaranteed severance payments (with a corresponding increase in minimum
service time requirement) is counterproductive as it serves to limit labor market
flexibility.

29.
Notwithstanding their efforts, the authorities agreed that reforms in several
areas are needed to enhance the economy’s growth potential. Key hindrances to
growth include weak institutional capacity, labor market rigidities, small size of the
economy, import licenses and price controls, and high cost of doing business. The

- 16 -

authorities consider the lack of institutional capacity as the main impediment to growth
and are taking steps to strengthen public institutions. The staff noted that the constraints
imposed by the small size of the economy can be eased by accelerating efforts to enhance
access to global markets and deepen regional integration through both CARICOM and
the FTAA. In this connection, the mission encouraged the authorities to proceed with
further trade liberalization, including by abolishing import licenses and converting
existing quota restrictions into tariffs. The authorities indicated that they are committed to
regional economic integration and are actively pursuing the early and full implementation
of the Caribbean Single Market and Economy (CSME). They also noted that most import
licenses as well as price controls are not enforced, but a lack of institutional capacity has
prevented the repealing of related regulations. The mission welcomed the government’s
efforts to promote foreign investment and noted that the cost of doing business could be
reduced by improving efficiency in public enterprises including the utilities.
E. Other Issues
30.
The government has made substantial efforts to generate a broad consensus
for its economic program through its dialogue with civil society. The staff noted that
such efforts, including a regular program of town hall meetings, would help strengthen
the public’s understanding of the economic challenges currently being faced and the
government’s strategy for their resolution.
31.
The statistical base has improved in recent years, but remaining weaknesses
hamper the quality of economic analysis. Specific areas of weakness include labor
market data, national accounts, and balance of payments statistics. The mission
encouraged the authorities to strengthen the central statistical office, including by taking
advantage of technical assistance from CARTAC.

an alternative scenario which assumes

growth would level off at less than 2 percent a year during 2005–08, and, in this context,
the public sector primary surplus (projected at about ¼ percent of GDP in 2004) would
turn into a deficit of ¾ percent of GDP and public debt would rise to 77 percent of GDP
by 2008 (Table 10). In the alternative scenario, annual real GDP growth would rise to 2–

underscores the vulnerabilities stemming from
high debt in St. Vincent and Grenadines’ shock-prone environment. Stress tests point to
the potentially negative impact of various shocks of an average magnitude. They indicate
that exogenous shocks could potentially raise the debt level above 80 percent and that
additional fiscal effort beyond the alternative scenario would be needed.

III. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
St. Vincent and the Grenadines faces difficult policy challenges. The modest
growth of the last two years has been supported by expansionary fiscal policies, while
private sector activity has been weak. Recent increases in private sector wages, including
the minimum wage, at a time when the economy is adjusting to permanent negative
shocks, have likely weakened competitiveness. Unemployment remains high, raising
concerns about deepening poverty.
35.
The authorities have been successful in maintaining macroeconomic stability
in a very difficult regional and global environment. While pursuing a countercyclical
fiscal stance, the fiscal stimulus has come through higher investment offset in part by an
increase in current revenue. The latter reflected one-off factors as well as welcome
improvements in broadening the tax base, removing tax concessions, and strengthening
tax administration. Similarly, the authorities’ efforts at containing current expenditure,
partly reflecting the 2002–03 wage freeze as well as tight control over other goods and
services, are commendable.
36.
While public sector debt remains amongst the lowest in the ECCU and is
mostly on concessional terms, the authorities need to pursue cautious fiscal policies
to reduce vulnerabilities. Fiscal policy needs to aim at containing current
expenditure―in particular the wage bill―and strengthening government revenue by
implementing the envisaged tax reform measures. It would be important that public
sector investment focus on key priority projects aimed at enhancing the economy’s
growth potential and largely financed on concessional terms. At the same time, the
authorities need to take additional steps to strengthen the financial position of the public
enterprises and improve their efficiency.
37.
The key challenge in the medium term is to reinvigorate private sector
growth, while preserving macroeconomic stability and reducing public debt. The
current strategy of promoting growth through expansionary fiscal policies can provide a
temporary boost to the economy, but given the already large public debt outstanding, the

60

50

- 18 -

risks to debt sustainability should not be underestimated. The development of a dynamic
private sector could be facilitated by addressing constraints to growth and competition in
the economy―such as weak institutional capacity and labor market inflexibility―while
preserving macroeconomic stability and the currency board arrangement.
38.
Developing and implementing a clear strategy for restructuring the stateowned National Commercial Bank are urgently needed to remove this key
vulnerability of the financial system. The steps being taken by the authorities in this
area are in the right direction, and should be reinforced by the adoption of the measures
proposed by the FSAP. Strengthening the regulation and effectiveness of supervision of
nonbank financial institutions would also reduce risks, given the rapid increase in their
level of activity in recent years. As for the offshore sector, the implementation of the
action plan recommended by the FSAP is essential to ensure the full compliance of this
sector with Basel Core Principles.
39.
The stress faced by some ECCU countries suggests that the authorities need
to develop a plan to deal with potential contagion without delay. While the stronger
starting point of St. Vincent and the Grenadines provides some room for maneuver in the
event that problems emerge, complacency should be avoided. The identification of fiscal
contingency measures to reduce financing needs should be an important element of such
a plan.
40.
The envisaged recovery in economic activity should facilitate the
maintenance of the current high levels of social services, human capital, and a
reduction in poverty. Thus, the full implementation of the government’s poverty
reduction strategy and stemming the spread of HIV/AIDS needs to be given the highest
priority.
41.
The government’s efforts to generate a broad consensus for its economic
program through its dialogue with civil society are commendable and should
continue. Such steps can only strengthen the public’s understanding of the economic
challenges currently being faced and the government’s strategy to address them.
42.
Weaknesses in the statistical base need to be addressed. The staff encourages
the authorities to strengthen the central statistical office, including by taking advantage of
the available technical assistance.
43.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with the St. Vincent and the
Grenadines take place on the standard 12-month cycle.

Box 1. Poverty Reduction Strategy
The most recent source of statistical data on the incidence of poverty in St. Vincent and
the Grenadines is “the Poverty Assessment Report” prepared by a group of consultants
in 1996. The report states that 37½ percent of the population (30.6 percent of
households) are poor, of which 25.7 percent of the population (20.4 percent of
households) are indigent. A study prepared in 2001 on “the Socio-Economic Impact of
Restructuring the Banana Industry” indicates a worsening of the poverty situation as a
result of severe shocks to the economy since 1995.
The process to develop a poverty reduction strategy began in September 2001. The
government assigned the responsibility for the development of a Poverty Reduction
Framework to the National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC),
which comprises representatives from the government ministries, ECCB and other
financial institutions, private sector, and civil society groups. A Poverty Reduction
Task Force was established by the NESDC to develop the Poverty Reduction Strategy.
The final revision of the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (IPRSP) was
completed in June 2003. The IPRSP serves as a blueprint for achieving the
Millennium Development Goals: (i) eradicating extreme poverty and hunger by
halving the level of poverty (the proportion of people living on less than a dollar a day
and those who suffer from hunger) by 2015; (ii) achieving universal primary education;
(iii) promoting gender equality and empowering women; (iv) reducing child mortality;
(v) improving maternal health; (vi) combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases;
(vii) ensuring environmental sustainability; and (viii) developing a global partnership
for development.
The strategy for poverty reduction adopted by the government follows a multi-faceted
approach, which includes: (i) a job creation program (including the Youth
Empowerment Service to address youth unemployment); (ii) a low income housing
project; (iii) an enhanced safety net for the poor through public assistance; and
(iv) the promotion of a micro-enterprise sector.

Wage developments: Wage increases in the central government have been generally in line with those in the public
enterprises, except for 2002 and 2003, when the freeze of the central government wages resulted in a cumulative base-wage
difference of about 7 percent. Limited private sector wage data indicate a small wage premium over the public sector as well
as additional performance-based merit increases of up to 3 percent a year in some private firms and public enterprises.

wages above the new minimum levels prior to May 2003, while for a number of other businesses (including banana farmers)
the new minimum wages have created difficulties, including a reduction in the number of employees or work hours.

Box 3. Financial Sector Vulnerabilities
Banking system: The risks in the banking system are concentrated in the state-owned National Commercial Bank (NCB),
which has a high nonperforming loans (NPL) ratio and is heavily exposed to the public sector. Aggregate NPL ratio is around
13 percent, and despite the macroeconomic difficulties, has not deteriorated significantly in recent years. Foreign currency
deposits as a share of total deposits are very small and have steadily declined since early 2001. Foreign currency and interest
rate risks are limited. Cross border exposures to the other ECCU countries are low, suggesting that contagion risks may come
through overall confidence effects rather than direct financial linkages.
Exposure to the public sector: The banking system’s aggregate exposure to the public sector is about 10 percent of the total
banking system assets. Net claims on the public sector are much smaller, reflecting the large National Insurance System
(NIS) and government deposits, of which about 40 percent may not be freely available. Banks’ investments in home country
treasury bills account for a small portion of their gross exposure to government, although individual banks’ exposures to the
three-month treasury bills can vary considerably, depending on the outcome of the treasury bill auctions in the Regional
Government Securities Market (RGSM). Banks’ net exposures to public enterprises are very small, and banks’ indirect
exposures to the government through the use of government securities (treasury bills and bonds) as collateral are limited.

1/ Include the NCB and the locally incorporated branch of the Royal Bank of Trinidad and Tobago.

Prudential indicators: Prudential indicators provide mixed signals about the strengths of the banking system, but point to
significant weakness of the NCB which holds about a third of the banking system assets. However, indicators of asset quality
need to be treated with caution for two reasons. The indicators are based on bank-reported numbers, and the quality of
reported capital is uncertain, given the possible under-provisioning of NPLs and the zero risk-weights applied to public sector
debt in arrears. The robustness among foreign banks may also vary, depending on the quality of the supervision in the parent
company country.
Other risks: Adverse shocks to the real economy may have negative effects on banks’ balance sheets as they may affect their
loan portfolios. The hurricanes that affected the region in the past have reportedly led to increases in the NPLs of the
agricultural and tourism sectors. Loans to the household sector account for about one-half of the total bank loans; most of
these loans are mortgages and for consumer durables. Although historically default rates on mortgages have been the lowest
among private sector loans, banks’ exposures to the household sector could be potentially destabilizing, as the semi-annual
adjustment of interest rates on mortgages could reduce the borrowers’ ability to service the loans should interest rates
increase. This default risk, combined with the possible misvaluation of underlying property, could lead to substantial losses
for the banks.
Nonbank financial institutions (NBFI): Some NBFIs are experiencing financial difficulties, but the sector is not likely to
pose serious risk to the stability of the financial system because the problematic NBFIs are small in size and their liquidity
linkages to the banks are limited. However, the reputation risk associated with the failure in one credit union might spread to
others on the same island, affecting foremost the rural areas where members are least capable of absorbing losses.

1/ Gross public sector net of intra public sector debt (mainly central government debt to the NIS). In 2004, EC$49.6 million of Ottley Hall debt would be written off.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and
e=nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and primary balance) remain at the level in percent of GDP/growth rate of the last projection year.

appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator)
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
4/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
5/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain

APPENDIX II

St. Vincent and the Grenadines: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of January 31, 2004)
The World Bank’s Management presented to its Board the Eastern Caribbean Sub-Region
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), on June 28, 2001. The CAS, which covers FY 2002–06,
proposes new commitments of US$107 million for five borrowing member states of the
Organization of the Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), including St. Vincent and the
Grenadines. The main goals of the strategy are to reduce income insecurity and vulnerability
at the national and household levels, and build human and institutional capacity to meet the
challenging economic and social environment facing these small states. Most new projects
are being provided under a sub-regional umbrella mechanism using horizontal Adaptable
Program Loans (APLs), and in close collaboration with sub-regional organizations and
external partners.
I. PROJECTS
There are three active World Bank projects in St. Vincent and the Grenadines for a net
commitment of approximately US$9.1 million.
The St. Vincent and the Grenadines Disaster Management Project, approved in May 2002,
is part of a regional program for the five OECS borrowing countries to fortify, reconstruct,
and/or rehabilitate key economic and social infrastructure and facilities, in order to minimize
damage or disruption caused by future natural and man-made disasters, and to speed
emergency recovery following such disasters. Additionally, the project is expected to
strengthen the countries’ institutional capacity to prepare for and respond to disaster
emergencies efficiently and effectively. The total program size is US$46 million, and the St.
Vincent and the Grenadines component is US$5.9 million.
The World Bank on March 8, 2002, approved $20.9 million in loans and credits to support
Emergency Recovery Projects in Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St.
Vincent and the Grenadines. The projects support efforts aimed at fostering recovery from
the fallout of the events of September 11, 2001. The projects support: (i) efforts to safeguard
the productive capacity of the tourism sector by securing energy imports; (ii) investments to
enhance security at airports and ports; and (iii) the development of institutional capacity to
develop security programs as mandated by international civil aviation and maritime transport
agencies. The Bank’s support to St. Vincent and the Grenadines under this project is for
US$3.2 million.
The OECS Telecommunications Reform Program, approved in June 1998 for
US$6 million, aims to introduce pro-competition reforms in the telecommunications sector
and increase the supply of informatics-related skills in the five OECS borrowing countries—
Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The
project has assisted the OECS countries negotiate with the subregional telecom monopoly for
less one-sided contracts and lower long distance and regional telephone rates. The
St. Vincent and the Grenadines is US$1.2 million.

II. ECONOMIC AND SECTOR WORK
The Bank is and has recently been engaged in three categories of analytical work of direct
relevance to St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The first builds on the Bank-wide program on
small states. Earlier pieces focused, among others, on the issues of vulnerability in the
Caribbean (including macroeconomic volatility and income security), research on
catastrophic insurance, reviews of natural hazard risk mitigation strategies, and institutional
arrangements for environmental management in the OECS. Several of these were discussed
by the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic Development in June 2002.
The second body of work addresses long-term development in the OECS and includes the
completed Institutional and Organizational Capacity Review of the OECS, a Procurement
Assessment Review, and a Financial Accountability Assessment. A fiscal issues report,
which includes a review of public expenditures in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, is
ongoing, as is work on an Energy Sector Management Assistance Program for the OECS as a
whole. The Bank is also about to embark on a study of growth and competitiveness in the
OECS, scheduled for completion in 2004.
Third, the Bank will continue to work together with the IMF and ECCB to fully review the
financial sector through an ongoing Financial Sector Assessment Program.

APPENDIX IV

St. Vincent and the Grenadines: Statistical Issues
St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ statistical database remains weak in terms of coverage,
consistency, periodicity, and timeliness. Efforts to address the weaknesses in the statistical
base have been hampered by low response rates to surveys (less than 50 percent), and high
turnover of staff.
Prices: Data on the consumer price index are reported regularly with a two-month lag.
CARTAC assisted in linking the CPI based on 1981 series to the CPI based on 2001 series.
This was part of the Fund assisted program on Constructing Weights for the Harmonized
Consumer Price Index in the ECCU. St. Vincent and the Grenadines conducted the
Household Budget and Expenditure Survey (HBES) in 1995/96, whilst all the other five
ECCU member countries conducted HBES surveys for 1998/99. Compilers thus will have to
use a method for updating the St. Vincent expenditure weights to 1998/99 to properly align
its CPI with those of the other ECCU member countries before all eight are combined into an
ECCU-harmonized CPI.
Labor: The Statistical Office has not published official data on unit labor costs and
employment.
National Accounts: National accounts data by sector are provided with one year lag, and the
coverage of economic activity in the informal sector is inadequate. There is a need to fully
upgrade compilation of statistics from the 1968 System of National Accounts to the 1993
System of National Accounts.
Public finance: STA publishes annual data for the consolidated central government in the
GFS Yearbook. This publication includes detailed information on revenues and expenditures
but not on financing. Due to delays in reporting capital expenditures by some ministries,
quarterly revenue and expenditure data for the central government are provided to the Fund
after some lag. Discrepancies exist between the fiscal and monetary accounts, between above
and below the line for budget data, between financing data and debt accumulation. There is a
need to reconcile these discrepancies. Although domestic debt figures are now available
following implementation of the CS-DRMS system, the domestic debt amortization figures
are incomplete. The public enterprises financial reports are not timely, with about a two year
lag.
Monetary statistics: Monetary data are compiled by the ECCB on a monthly basis. The data
are reported regularly to the Fund, although the timeliness of data could be improved. The
monetary and financial data do not include other deposit taking institutions such as the credit
unions. The ECCB is aware of the need to improve the coverage of the financial statistics and
has taken steps to collect data on credit unions (the savings and loans of credit unions
account for 20–30 percent of market share).
Balance of payments: The ECCB compiles annual balance of payment statistics for
St. Vincent and the Grenadines, which are submitted to STA. The latest published data in the
IFS (February 2004) are for 2001. There is a need to improve the compilation of capital and
financial account transactions in the balance of payments. In addition, the recording of the
stock of private and public debt should be improved.

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES: CORE STATISTICAL INDICATORS

- 43 APPENDIX IV

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
Staff Report for the 2003 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the Western Hemisphere and Policy Development and Review Departments
Approved by José Fajgenbaum and Matthew Fisher
May 3, 2004

I. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Real GDP grew more rapidly than anticipated in 2003, while inflation was also
higher. Preliminary national accounts estimates indicate real GDP growth of 3.6 percent in
2003, 2 percentage points higher than previously estimated. The strong growth outcome
stems from increased activity in the electricity, construction, and trade and transport sectors.
The 12-month CPI inflation increased to 2.7 percent (projected inflation was 1.5 percent),
largely on account of a sharp increase in food prices in the last three months of the year.
2.
Preliminary data show that the fiscal outturn for 2003 was substantially weaker
than expected. The overall balance of the central government was 3¼ percent of GDP
weaker than projected. While this deviation reflects in part weaker-than-expected tax
collections, lower grant disbursements, and somewhat higher capital expenditures (due to the
government purchase of equity in the regional airline following an agreement on its
restructuring), almost half of the deviation represents a discrepancy between identified
revenues and expenditures and identified financing items, which has yet to be clarified.
3.
Despite an increase in the public sector debt stock, interest rates on government
debt instruments continue to decline. Total gross public sector debt is estimated at
73 percent of GDP at end-2003, slightly higher than projected earlier, as the larger deficit
was financed through higher external disbursements and use of the overdraft facility with the
state-owned National Commercial Bank (NCB). Nonetheless, interest rates on government
debt instruments placed on the Regional Government Securities Market have continued to
decline—at end-September 2003, three-month treasury bills were placed at a yield of
5.7 percent, which had declined to 4.75 percent by end-April 2004.
4.
The approved budget for 2004 envisages an improvement in the overall balance
of the central government of 2½ percent of GDP, if grants and capital expenditures
remain at historical levels. While the budget envisages a significant increase in capital
spending, the implementation rate of the public sector investment program has typically been
less than envisaged in the budget. The authorities expect both current expenditures and

-2-

current revenues to increase by about 2½ percent of GDP—revenue increases are anticipated
to stem largely from administrative improvements and a pick-up in economic activity.
II. STAFF APPRAISAL
5.
Recent developments serve to reinforce the thrust of the staff appraisal
contained in the staff report (4/1/04), but highlight further the need to ensure fiscal
discipline. While the debt stock remains among the lowest in the region and debt service
remains manageable, given the large concessional element, the deterioration in the fiscal
stance at end-2003 and the consequent increase in debt raise concerns. The approved 2004
budget, appropriately, is likely to entail a narrowing of the fiscal imbalances, and the staff
strongly encourages the authorities to achieve an overall deficit of 2¼ percent of GDP, in
line with the average outturn in 1999–2001.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 19, 2005

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2003 Article IV Consultation with
St. Vincent and the Grenadines
On May 5, 2004 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with St. Vincent and the Grenadines.1
Background
Following stagnation in 2001, a moderate recovery started in 2002. The economy is estimated
to have grown 3½ percent in 2003. Growth has been supported by a rebound in agricultural
production and expansionary fiscal policies, including large public sector investments, while
private sector activity has been weak. Inflation has remained in the low single digits, reflecting
the monetary discipline of the currency union. The 12-month inflation rate was 2.7 percent in
November 2003. Unemployment has remained high (estimated at about 21 percent).
The overall fiscal stance in 2002–03 was relaxed, with the fiscal stimulus coming through a
strong increase in investment partly offset by a higher current surplus of the central
government due to a rise in revenue. The overall deficit of the Non-Financial Public Sector
(NFPS) doubled to 4 percent of GDP a year over this period as capital spending—by public
enterprises on power and water projects as well as by the central government—increased by
an average of nearly 2 percentage points of GDP. As a consequence, public sector debt
increased from about 69 percent of GDP in 2001 to more than 73 percent at end-2003.
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

-2In 2002–03, central government current revenue rose sharply while current expenditure was
held under close control. One-off factors have contributed to the increase in revenue—notably
around 1 percent of GDP from duty collections on the large imports of cell phones during 2003
following the liberalization of the telecommunications sector—but there have also been
significant improvements in broadening the tax base, removing tax concessions, and
strengthening tax administration. At the same time, government wages were kept frozen and
non-wage expenditure was kept under tight control to maintain current expenditure largely
unchanged.
The external current account deficit widened sharply in 2003 (to 16 percent of GDP from about
9½ percent in 2002) driven by a temporary spike in investment-related imports as well as the
impact of higher international petroleum prices. About three quarters of the current account
deficit during 2000-03 was financed by direct investment, while the remainder was financed by
public sector borrowing. Merchandise exports and tourism receipts increased only marginally
in 2003.
Regulation and supervision of the offshore sector continued to be strengthened. As a result,
St. Vincent and the Grenadines was removed from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) list
of non-cooperative countries and territories (NCCTs) in June 2003 (it had been removed from
the OECD’s list of tax havens in 2002). The short-term consequence of strengthened
regulation and supervision has been a sharp reduction in the number of offshore banks
(which stood at 11 as of end-September 2003, compared with 44 at end-December 2001),
although the reduction in government revenue from the sector has been modest because of an
upward revision of fees.
The government has made some progress on structural reforms. Steps have been taken to
diversify the economy and enhance its external competitiveness, attract foreign investment,
improve the budgetary process, and strengthen the regulation of the financial sector.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the authorities for the successful maintenance of macroeconomic
stability despite a difficult economic environment. Directors noted that real growth in 2002-03
was above the average for the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) as a whole,
supported by a rebound in agricultural production and expansionary fiscal policy. However,
unemployment continued to be high and private sector activity remained weak.
Directors welcomed the substantial improvement in current revenue collections, which
reflected not only one-off factors but also continued improvements in broadening the tax base,
reducing tax concessions, and strengthening tax administration. The authorities were also
commended for their efforts at containing current expenditure, particularly through the wage
freeze in 2002-03 and tight control over outlays on other goods and services. Directors noted
with some concern, however, the pursuit of a counter-cyclical fiscal policy, with a strong
increase in investment expenditure, which had resulted in a weaker-than-expected fiscal
outturn for 2003.

-3Directors stressed the need to ensure fiscal discipline going forward. They encouraged the
authorities to implement vigorously the envisaged tax reform measures, in particular the
planned introduction of a value-added tax. Continued control over current expenditure,
including through a prudent wage policy and civil service reform, will also be essential.
Directors underlined that public sector investment should focus on key priority projects aimed
at enhancing the economy’s growth potential and should be financed largely on concessional
terms. Continued efforts will also be necessary to strengthen the financial position of the public
enterprises and improve their efficiency. Given uncertainties in the tourism sector and other
potential exogenous shocks, Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to pursue a
cautious debt management strategy.
Directors noted that the key challenge over the medium term is to reinvigorate private sectorled growth and diversification of the economy, while preserving macroeconomic stability and
ensuring fiscal sustainability. The development of a vibrant private sector should be promoted
by addressing structural constraints to growth and competition in the economy. To this end,
Directors underscored the importance of increased labor market flexibility and strengthened
institutional capacity.
Directors commended the authorities for their ongoing efforts to strengthen the regulatory and
supervisory framework of the financial system, including the offshore sector, as recommended
by the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) for the ECCU. Nevertheless, they
considered that more should be done to reduce risks. In particular, they saw an urgent need to
develop and implement a clear strategy for restructuring the state-owned National Commercial
Bank.
Directors noted that weaknesses in the statistical base hamper the quality of economic
analysis and surveillance. They encouraged the authorities to address the data problems,
including those related to the national accounts, balance of payments, and labor market.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Key Points





Following a fairly subdued economic performance recently, real GDP
rebounded in 2003.
While the central government current surplus increased in 2003, the overall
deficit widened consistent with higher spending on public investment.
The authorities believe that the current exchange rate arrangements remain
appropriate even though competitiveness in some sectors may have been
affected.
The authorities believe that the state has a critical role to play in fostering
economic development, particularly when private sector activity is subdued.
While cautious, the authorities are, nevertheless, optimistic that with a prudent
approach, the adoption of timely reforms and a benign international
environment, the medium term outlook is positive.

1. My authorities wish to convey their appreciation to the staff for the constructive input
and support offered during the consultations. They broadly agree with the staff’s
assessment of the challenges and are optimistic about the medium term prospects
following modest growth over the last two years.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
2. Following a subdued economic performance recently, economic growth rebounded in
2003. Real GDP for 2003, which had been expected to grow by 1.6 percent at the
time of the Article IV consultation, is now estimated to have grown by 3.6 percent.
My authorities are optimistic about this nascent recovery, which was supported by
increased domestic demand. Increases in output of the non-traded sectors,
particularly, construction, electricity and water and wholesale and retail trade
reflected the higher domestic demand. In tourism, although total visitor arrivals was
down marginally, modest growth was recorded in the important stay-over visitor
category, while tourism receipts grew by 2½ percent. Despite a contraction in banana
production, increased output from non-traditional crops was recorded, reflecting some
early success of the agricultural diversification program.
3. While the central government current surplus increased to 4.1 percent of GDP in 2003
compared to 3.1 percent in 2002, higher capital spending to improve social and
economic infrastructure and add productive capacity, resulted in a widening of the
central government overall deficit.

-24. On the external account, the current account deficit widened, related to higher imports
and a decline in banana export earnings. The higher imports were associated with new
public investment and growth in the telecommunications sector, while the decline in
banana export earnings reflected a combination of lower export volume and reduced
prices.
5. My authorities are aware that much still needs to be done to ensure that the recovery
is sustainable. They believe, however, that their economic reform efforts appear to be
meeting with some success, and together with positive developments in the
international economy, these should help improve the medium term economic
outlook.
Fiscal Policy
6. While committed to fiscal prudence, my authorities’ judgment on the pursuance of a
counter-cyclical fiscal policy has been, by all reasonable assessments, largely
successful. In particular, it has, to a large extent, managed to avert a full scale
recession in 2001, and stemmed a rise in unemployment. Further, with the recovery
over the last two years, the approach appears to have been an appropriate policy
response given the economic circumstances.
7. My authorities agree with the staff that efforts to maintain control over current
expenditure, including the government wage bill, are key to ensuring fiscal
sustainability. The staff note that while these efforts have been largely successful, the
government wage bill (as a percentage of GDP) has been higher than the average for
the ECCU. While this is true, it must be noted that the higher wage bill reflects, in
part, the fact that as a multi-island state, the government has to provide duplicate
services to remote islands. At the same time, my authorities believe that the wage
increases granted to public servants over the 2004-05 period was justified in order to
preserve morale in the public service and retain qualified staff.
8. Efforts to broaden the tax base and enhance tax administration continue to bear fruit,
contributing to higher revenue collections in 2003. The increase in revenue
collections in 2003 also represented one-off factors, however, my authorities are
committed to tax reform in order to bolster revenue and increase current savings. In
this regard, preparatory work on the adoption of a VAT has commenced while the
intention to revise the current property tax system to one that is market-based has
been announced.
9. Total public sector debt at 72.9 percent of GDP in 2003 is amongst the lowest in the
ECCU and is mostly concessional. My authorities are, however, aware of the need to
contain debt service costs, and understand the potential impact that exogenous shocks
could have. In this regard, they continue to pursue a prudent debt management
strategy – for example, by substituting higher cost local loans with lower cost external
financing and making use of cheaper financing on the Regional Government
Securities Market (RGSM). At the same time, it is anticipated that with the write-off

-3of part of a major loan and some rescheduling, public sector debt will fall to 67.1
percent of GDP in 2004, while debt service payments decline.
Financial Sector Issues
10. Development of a sound financial system with well-functioning supervisory
arrangements is a key goal of my authorities. They acknowledge that there are gaps in
the financial system as identified in the recent FSAP and are working steadfastly to
address these issues. In conjunction with the ECCB, my authorities are updating the
prudential regulations and supervisory system, restructuring weak financial
institutions, and initiating reform of the financial laws and regulations. Amendments
to the Banking Act and the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank Agreement Act, which
gives the ECCB more authority to deal with problem banks, have been drafted,
however, their introduction has been put on hold pending consideration of a more
comprehensive amendment of the Banking Act expected to be completed during the
first half of 2004.
11. In addition, new legislation has been introduced to modernize the system for the
regulation of insurances, a supervisory and regulatory unit in the Ministry of Finance
has been established to cover insurance companies, and the National Commercial
Bank has been reorganized with a new Board of Directors and management has been
strengthened.
12. The recent FSAP identified regulatory and supervisory weaknesses when measured
against the Basel Core Principles and recommended the adoption of further antimoney laundering measures, particularly in the area of supervision and compliance.
While my authorities intend to implement the general recommendations of the FSAP,
there is disagreement with some of the findings in the Preliminary Draft BCP. In
particular, my authorities believe there are factual inaccuracies and differences in the
interpretation of the level of compliance in seven areas and would hope that these can
be resolved speedily so that publication can be facilitated. In this regard, they are
working with the assessors to incorporate suggested changes which will improve the
accuracy of the reporting in the identified areas.
Growth and Competitiveness
13. The authorities believe that the current exchange rate arrangements remain
appropriate even though competitiveness in some sectors may have been affected.
The staff suggest that recent increases in the minimum wage may have affected
competitiveness, however, it must be noted that the minimum wage in St.Vincent and
the Grenadines is still amongst the lowest in the ECCU.
14. While acknowledging the role of the private sector in creating wealth, the authorities
are convinced that the state has an important role to play in fostering economic
development, particularly when the private sector activity remains subdued. In this
regard, the policies of my authorities aim to support a more diversified economy

-4which facilitates tourism, international financial and other services, and agriculture
and fisheries as the main sectors.
15. My authorities disagree with the staff assessment that existing import licenses and
price controls remain key hindrances to growth in the economy. Import licenses have
been all but eliminated – except for a few items related to intra-regional trade and
these are expected to be phased out next year, while price controls remain only on a
couple of basic food items primarily for poverty reasons. Under these circumstances,
my authorities believe these have little adverse impact on growth.
16. Improvements in labor market flexibility are also important to enhance growth
prospects. Recognizing this, and consistent with efforts to establish the CARICOM
Single Market and Economy (CSME), the authorities have already given the
undertaking to remove the legal and administrative restrictions on labor mobility.
This is expected to be completed in 2004.
Conclusion
17. Despite a difficult economic environment, prudent macroeconomic management has
resulted in modest growth over the last two years. While cautious, the authorities are,
nevertheless, optimistic that with a prudent approach, the adoption of timely reforms
and a benign international environment, the medium term outlook is positive. The
approach of the authorities over the medium term will, therefore, focus on sound
macro-economic fundamentals, the pursuit of balanced growth and the recognition of
social equity in its economic policy.
