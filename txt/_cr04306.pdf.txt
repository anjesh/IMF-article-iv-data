ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN
Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2004 Consultation with
The Islamic Republic of Iran
Approved by Saleh M. Nsouli and Donal Donovan
August 20, 2004

• The 2004 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Tehran from June 5 to 19. The team
comprised Messrs. Jbili (Head), Kramarenko, Bailen, and Ms. Farahbaksh (all MCD); Mr. Nielsen
(PDR); and Ms. Djahanyekta, assistant (MCD).
• The mission met with Minister of Economy and Finance Husseini, Head of Management and
Planning Organization Shoraka, Central Bank Governor Sheibani, Vice Minister of Commerce
Vahaji and senior officials of the Social Security Organization, the Statistical Center of Iran, the
Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE), and representatives of commercial banks, charitable foundations, and
the private sector.
• In concluding the last Article IV consultation on August 26, 2003, Executive Directors noted that the
economy had performed well owing in large part to structural reforms implemented over the last three
years. Nevertheless, Directors expressed concern about the procyclical stance of monetary and fiscal
policies and the slow pace of implementation of some structural reforms. In this regard, Directors
welcomed the authorities’ intention to introduce corrective fiscal and monetary policy measures in
FY 2003/04 and called for accelerating structural reforms.
• Iran maintains exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices (MCPs) that are subject to
approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3, but plans to eliminate or request Fund approval for
the remaining restrictions in the near future in the context of accepting the obligations under
Article VIII.
• The authorities consented to the publication of the 2003 Article IV consultation papers, and it is
expected that they will do so for the 2004 Article IV Staff Report, Selected Issues, and Statistical
Appendix. The authorities are following up on STA Technical Assistance (TA) recommendations to
prepare for subscription to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).
• The principal authors of this report are Abdelali Jbili and Vitali Kramarenko.

Executive Summary
Background
Real GDP grew by 6.7 percent in 2003/041 on account of an increase in hydrocarbon output
and continued strong growth momentum in the non-hydrocarbon sector. The improved growth
performance of the last three years reflects in part important reforms implemented during
2000–02, but also an expansionary policy mix and high oil prices. While unemployment
declined to 11.2 percent in 2003/04 from 14.1 percent in 2000/01, inflation remained in
double digits at about 15 percent for the second year in a row. Some progress was achieved in
establishing risk-based banking supervision, streamlining tariff and nontariff barriers to trade,
and preparing medium-term reforms in the context of the forthcoming five-year development
plan. Progress in other areas of reform, however, was slow.
Policy issues
Real GDP growth is projected to remain at 6½ percent on account of strong private sector
investment and consumption, as well as continued expansionary fiscal and monetary policy
mix. The authorities intend to scale back government spending from a high level budgeted for
2004/05 and introduce a series of policy measures to rein in liquidity growth and contain
inflation. It is likely, however, that M2 growth will remain high with no deceleration in
inflation.
The staff expressed the view that expansionary fiscal and monetary policies at this stage of the
oil price cycle were neither needed, given the private sector’s strong response to economic
reforms, nor desirable in the face of persistent double-digit inflation. The authorities shared
the mission’s assessment, but pointed out that demographic dynamics and pressing social
needs called for a pro-active growth and employment policy stance. They highlighted that
unemployment was their major concern, while reducing inflation would be achieved gradually
over the medium term.
The medium-term outlook is sensitive to oil price assumptions and the authorities’ resolve to
implement fiscal adjustment and structural reforms expeditiously. The staff underscored that
high growth and steady gains in employment creation crucially depended on steadfast
implementation of key structural reforms as foreseen under the forthcoming five-year
development plan. These include financial sector reform, the phasing-out of explicit and
implicit subsidies, the strengthening of the non-oil revenue base, labor market reform, and
privatization, as well as streamlining of administrative procedures.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
During the period 2000/01–2003/04, growth accelerated, external debt ratios
improved, gross official reserves increased substantially, and unemployment declined
(Text Table I and Figure 1). The proportion of the population living below the poverty line
declined to 21 percent in 2002 from 26 percent in 1990. These positive achievements are in
part attributable to important structural reforms implemented at the beginning of the Third
Five-Year Development Plan (2000/01–2004/05, TFYDP), including exchange rate
unification, progress in trade and exchange liberalization, passage of a new foreign direct
investment (FDI) law, tax reform, and the granting of licenses to private banks and insurance
companies. High oil prices and expansionary fiscal and monetary policies also helped sustain
domestic demand (Figure 2) and growth, but contributed to high liquidity growth and
inflation.

2.
Major challenges remain in the period ahead. In the short run, the authorities’
policy of stimulating growth and employment creation through expansionary fiscal and
monetary policies is contributing to persistently high inflation and increased vulnerability to a
possible downturn in oil prices. Withdrawal of the policy stimulus to reduce inflation is
necessary, but the magnitude and timing of the needed adjustment are key to containing the
related output cost. In the long term, structural reforms are needed to consolidate the gains
achieved so far and complete the transition to a market economy in which the private sector is
the primary engine of growth.

3.
In light of these policy challenges, Fund staff advice has focused on the need for
restrained fiscal and monetary policies to help reduce inflation and critical structural
reforms to sustain private sector investment and growth. The authorities broadly share the
staff’s views, but have been reluctant to tighten monetary policy and adjust fiscal policy
sufficiently out of concern for employment (Text Table II). While implementation of critical
structural reforms in 2003/04 was slow after a promising start at the beginning of the TFYDP,
major strides in this area are foreseen under the Fourth Five-Year Development Plan (FFYDP,
2005/06–2009/10).
4.
The 2004 Article IV consultation mission took place against the background of
significant political changes. Following the February 2004 elections, in which the
conservatives won a majority of seats in the parliament, President Khatami reshuffled his
cabinet.2 Many important policy decisions, including the draft FFYDP, are awaiting approval
by the newly elected legislature. The political calendar in the period ahead is also marked by
the approaching presidential elections, scheduled for May 2005, in which Mr. Khatami will
not run, given the constitutional term limit. External political developments were dominated
by regional instability (mainly in Iraq and Afghanistan), as well as by the on-going discussions
with European countries concerning Iran’s cooperation with the International Atomic Energy
Agency regarding its nuclear energy program.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
5.
Growth remained strong in 2003/04, albeit lower than in the previous year, and
unemployment declined. Growth was driven by higher oil production following increases in
Iran’s OPEC oil production quota, as well as by rising private sector investment, including
foreign direct investment. The non-hydrocarbon GDP growth remained strong, even though it
decelerated to 6.5 percent from 7.8 percent in 2002/03. Agricultural output growth reverted to
its trend after an exceptionally good rainfall during the previous years and there was some
slowdown in construction and services. Other sectors, however, such as manufacturing and
mining grew at double-digit rates (Text Table III). Employment increased by 3.7 percent, with
most of the increase taking place in the private sector. This led to a decline in the
unemployment rate to 11.2 percent in 2003/04 from 12.2 percent in 2002/03.3 Domestic
demand continued to grow rapidly under the impetus of an expansionary policy mix, as
evidenced by the strong growth in credit and liquidity (Figures 2 and 3). As a result, average
CPI inflation remained at 15½ percent in 2003/04.

2

The main changes were in the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the Ministry of Labor, and the Management
and Planning Organization.
3

Official unemployment data are those reported by the Statistical Center of Iran (SCI), which are based on the
definition recommended by the International Labor Organization (ILO) (Appendix III).

Buoyant domestic demand also led to a decline in the external current account
surplus to about 1½ percent of GDP in 2003/04 from 3.1 percent in 2002/03. Despite a
significant increase in both oil and non-oil exports, imports continued to rise significantly.
The capital and financial account recorded a large surplus, reflecting increasing FDI inflows—
mainly in the energy sector––and short-term financing through letters of credit. Gross official
reserves increased by $3.0 billion to $24.4 billion, equivalent to 6½ months of next year’s
imports of goods and services. External debt remained low at $11.9 billion,4 equivalent to
8.7 percent of GDP. External vulnerability indicators have remained at satisfactory levels
(Tables 2 and 3).
7.
The managed float exchange regime has continued to operate smoothly. The
central bank has not committed to, or publicly announced a specific exchange rate target, but
has aimed to smooth out fluctuations in the exchange rate vis-à-vis a basket of currencies. In
2003/04, the average nominal and real effective exchange rate (NEER and REER) indexes
depreciated by 16.4 percent and 8.8 percent, respectively, in part due to expansionary
monetary policy and the appreciation of the euro vis-à-vis the dollar (Figure 4). If oil trade is
excluded in compiling weights, the average REER remained broadly unchanged in 2003/04
compared to 2002/03.5
4

This does not include short-term contingent liabilities under letters of credit opened by domestic banks for trade
financing, which increased to $9.2 billion (7 percent of GDP) by end-March 2004 from $4.3 billion (3.2 percent
of GDP) at end-March 2003.

5

Excluding oil trade from REER calculations reduces the relative weight of the euro and yen in the basket and
provides a better indicator of competitiveness.

While fiscal policy was tightened in 2003/04, the fiscal stimulus introduced
during 2000/01–2002/03 was not fully withdrawn.6 The non-oil fiscal deficit was brought
down to 16½ percent, or close to 2 percent of GDP lower than in the previous year, mainly
through expenditure restraint, while non-oil revenue remained unchanged relative to GDP.
The overall fiscal deficit also declined from 2.4 percent of GDP to 0.2 percent and was mainly
financed by privatization proceeds and Government Participation Papers7 (Table 4).
Notwithstanding these efforts, however, government spending remained high (27 percent of
GDP) at a time when private sector demand was expanding rapidly.
9.
Despite the persistence of double-digit inflation, monetary policy remained
expansionary. Average bank lending rates have remained broadly unchanged in both nominal
and real terms (Figure 5). Unsterilized purchases of foreign exchange from the government by
the central bank and increased central bank lending to commercial banks led to a rapid growth
of base money.8 This, together with a higher money multiplier, fueled private sector credit and
M2 growth to the tune of 39 percent and 30 percent,9 respectively (Table 5).
10.
The stock market price index rose by 125 percent, contributing to a significant
increase in the TSE capitalization to about 27 percent of GDP by end-2003/04 (Figure 5). This
performance reflected improved fundamentals, such as higher earnings and strong business
confidence, but other factors were at play, including the low starting base of equity valuation
and the effect of high money and credit growth.
11.
The authorities are undertaking the necessary steps toward accepting the
obligations under Article VIII, sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement.
The regulatory changes recommended by a LEG/MFD technical assistance (TA) mission to
eliminate all exchange restrictions have been largely made and are being reviewed by Fund
staff (Appendix I). Moreover, steps are being taken to liberalize capital account transactions,
including foreign direct investment and access to foreign exchange through off-shore zones.

6

The underlying fiscal stance is measured in terms of the non-oil deficit ratio to GDP. It increased to 18.7
percent of GDP in 2002/03 from 10.8 percent of GDP in 1999/2000.

The authorities’ structural reform agenda is ambitious, but implementation has
slowed somewhat since the beginning of 2003/04. Efforts have mainly focused on
completing the preparation of major reforms, such as the energy price reform, the capital
market law, and the preparation of the value-added tax (VAT). Also, the unweighted average
import tax was reduced to 23 percent in 2004/05 from 27 percent in 2003/04 and the import
ban on automobiles was replaced with high tariffs.10 In the financial sector, banking
supervision reform continued (Box 1), and new private insurance and leasing companies were
licensed.

10

Currently there are 13 import tariff bands with tariff rates ranging from 4 to 174 percent. There is a small
negative list of prohibited import goods for non-economic reasons.

Box 1. Banking Supervision Reforms
Major measures which have been undertaken:
•

Regulations on licensing, net open positions, and AML procedures for banks were approved in 2002/03.

•

Regulations on capital adequacy, large exposures, and connected lending were approved in 2003/04.

•

On- and off-site inspections have begun, using risk-based criteria; and reporting forms and supervision
manuals are being developed.

The remaining reform agenda includes the following:
•

Approving the essential regulations pertaining to liquidity risk, asset classification, provisioning, and
investments.

•

Amending the banking legislation (Banking Act) to incorporate the concept of bank soundness in the
objectives of bank supervision; enlarge the range of sanctions of banks, which do not comply with the
regulations; define services that banks and other financial entities are allowed to provide; and define the role
of external auditors in banks.

•

Bringing all deposit-taking institutions under central bank supervision.

•

Incorporating staff training and the development of information technology into the central bank’s priorities
are essential elements for successful implementation of this reform.

13.
Progress in other areas, however, remains slow. The restructuring of public banks
has not moved beyond a modest increase in their capital base through re-investment of
post-unification foreign exchange gains, which has left the average capital adequacy ratio
below the 8 percent recommended by the Basel I Accord; little progress was made in
improving the supervision of the insurance sector and issuance and trading of securities,11
the pace of divestiture of public companies has been slow and none of these operations has
resulted in a transfer of majority stake to the private sector; and there have been no significant
efforts to reform the labor market or streamline administrative procedures. While anti-money
laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regulations for banks have been
approved, comprehensive legislation covering the entire financial system is still awaiting
parliamentary approval.

14.
Some progress has been achieved in enhancing fiscal transparency. Large
charitable foundations (Bonyads)12 have been subjected to greater oversight and reporting
requirements, including the publication of their audited annual reports. Moreover, the
companies under their ownership will start paying profit taxes in 2004/05. In the fiscal area,
progress is being made toward compiling experimental consolidated accounts in general
government operations.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
15.
Against the background of a favorable outlook for 2004/05, the discussions focused on
the short-term policies to reduce inflation, as well as on structural reforms to sustain high rates
of growth and employment creation over the medium term.
A. Short-Term Outlook and Policies
Outlook for 2004/05
16.
The outlook for 2004/05 is favorable. Against the background of high oil prices, a
comfortable level of international reserves, and low external debt, business confidence is
expected to remain strong and FDI inflows are likely to remain high. This, together with a
continuation of the expansionary fiscal and monetary policy mix of the past year, will help
keep real GDP growth at about 6½ percent, with healthy contribution from most sectors
(Table 1). The authorities intend to scale back government spending from a high level
budgeted for 2004/05 and introduce a series of policy measures to rein in liquidity growth and
bring inflation under control. Staff estimates, however, indicate that M2 would grow at about
30 percent with average CPI inflation remaining at 15–17 percent.
17.
Under the current policy stance, despite higher oil prices,13 the external current
account position is projected to deteriorate on account of strong domestic demand.
Exports are projected to increase by 10 percent in U.S. dollar terms, but continued strong
growth in imports of goods and services is likely to fully eliminate the current account
surplus. The capital account is expected to remain in surplus, mainly on account of FDI
inflows in the hydrocarbon sector, and gross official reserves would increase by $3 billion to
$27.5 billion at end-2004/05, or the equivalent of about 6½ months of next year’s imports
(Table 2).

12

Bonyads are charitable foundations that also control large segments of economic activity and their relations
with the public sector are not fully transparent. They are funded by the net incomes of their asset holdings,
government transfers, and charitable contributions.

13

During the 2004 Article IV consultation mission, the average price for Iranian crude oil was conservatively
projected to increase to $30 per barrel in 2004/05 from $28 per barrel in 2003/04. The impact of the latest
August 2004 WEO assumption on oil prices is discussed in the sensitivity analysis.

- 16 -

Macroeconomic policies
18.
Fiscal and monetary tightening is needed in 2004/05. The staff expressed the view
that expansionary fiscal and monetary policies at this stage of the oil price cycle were not
needed, given the private sector’s strong response to economic reforms, nor were they
desirable in the face of mounting pressure on the price level. In particular, the staff argued that
higher government spending was making it difficult for the central bank to sterilize large oil
inflows, while contributing to fuel domestic demand and private sector credit growth.
Moreover, it highlighted that the current expansionary policy mix may provide only a
temporary cyclical respite for the unemployment problem, as non-hydrocarbon GDP is above
estimated potential (Figure 6).

The authorities shared the mission’s assessment, but pointed out that
demographic dynamics and pressing social needs called for a pro-active growth and
employment policy stance. In particular, they underscored the need to complete major
infrastructure projects that had been delayed, provide housing and basic social services to the
population in remote rural areas, and improve education and training to help foster
employment and productivity. While recognizing that fiscal and monetary policy adjustment
in 2004/05 was needed, the authorities intended to follow a cautious approach that would not
jeopardize their growth and employment objectives. The staff argued that withdrawal of fiscal
stimulus should be made from a position of strength in the economic cycle, rather than under

- 17 -

duress when oil prices decline and private sentiment turns bearish. The latter would entail
higher output costs over the medium term and undermine external viability in the face of a
possible medium-term decline in oil prices.
Fiscal policy
20.
The mission pointed out that the approved budget for 2004/05 continues past
years’ expansionary policy stance. All of the projected increase in oil revenue due to higher
oil prices (see footnote 13) will be used for the budget, contrary to the authorities’ objective of
accumulating savings in the Oil Stabilization Fund (OSF) when oil prices are high. While
non-oil revenues are budgeted to rise significantly compared to the previous year’s outcome,
shortfalls are likely given the absence of new major revenue measures.14 As budgeted, total
expenditure and net lending are expected to increase from 27 percent of GDP in 2003/04 to 30
percent in 2004/05 (Table 4). This reflects a sharp increase in capital expenditure, including
delayed projects from the previous years. The growth rate of current expenditure, however, is
relatively modest, since some food subsidies are being phased out and the budgeted increase
in the wage bill is limited.
21.
The authorities were in broad agreement with the staff’s projection of possible
revenue and privatization shortfalls of about 2 percent of GDP under the approved
2004/05 budget. They intend to offset these shortfalls by reducing capital spending and
improving tax administration, which the staff estimates could help bring the overall fiscal
deficit to about 1½ percent of GDP. Such a deficit would be financed mainly by a net
withdrawal from the OSF of about 0.7 percent of GDP, issuance of government participation
papers, and privatization proceeds. The non-oil fiscal deficit is projected to increase by
½ percent of GDP to about 17 percent of GDP (Table 4).
22.
The staff proposed further fiscal adjustment to bring the overall deficit closer to
balance, which would facilitate the achievement of the authorities’ monetary target and
reduce vulnerability to a decline in oil prices over the medium-term. While welcoming
the efforts to contain the growth of current expenditure, including the wage bill, the staff
called for further savings on explicit subsidies and steadfast progress in phasing out implicit
energy subsidies.15 It noted that the recent adjustment in gasoline prices by 23 percent on
average, which brought the domestic price to about one-third of the border price level, was a
step in the right direction,16 and underscored the need to make headways in overhauling the
14

Shortfalls will likely occur, notwithstanding the lifting of the ban on automobile imports, which may bring an
additional 0.4 percent of GDP in revenue.

15

Explicit subsidies (about 5 percent of GDP) are mainly for basic necessities, fertilizers, and foreign exchange
losses stemming from the 1993 and 2002 exchange rate unifications. Implicit energy subsidies (10½ percent of
GDP) arise from the differential between domestic and border prices.
16

There are indications of across the border smuggling of petroleum products to neighboring countries, but they
represent a small share of the overall domestic consumption.

- 18 -

subsidy system. Additional fiscal measures for 2004/05 suggested by the staff also include a
reduction in net lending from the OSF and larger cuts in capital spending, together with
further improvements in tax administration. The staff argued that a tighter fiscal position
in 2004/05 would help contain the growth of domestic demand and the liquidity impact of
central bank’s purchases of foreign exchange from the government, thereby reducing the need
for large sterilization operations. An upfront fiscal adjustment would also help build
precautionary fiscal savings in the OSF and smooth the adjustment to a possible decline in oil
prices.
Monetary policy and financial sector issues
23.
The authorities agree that reducing money supply (M2) growth is key to
disinflation. The authorities’ monetary program aims at containing M2 growth within a range
of 20–24 percent in 2004/05, from 30 percent in 2003/04, through a series of policy measures,
including the issuance of additional Central Bank Participation Papers (CBPP) of up to
Rls 5,000 billion and an increase in the share of credit facilities not subject to sectoral
allocation limits. The authorities also plan to make use of the standing deposit facility at the
central bank to mop up excess liquidity.
24.
The staff argued that based on its estimated fiscal and balance-of-payments
outcomes for 2004/05, M2 would grow by about 30 percent in 2004/05. As such,
additional monetary policy measures, supported by fiscal adjustment, would be needed to
bring down the growth of liquidity within the targeted range. To curb the expected rapid pace
of growth in private sector credit, the staff recommended increasing the administered rates of
return, which would also be interpreted as minimum expected rates, and allowing the
state-owned banks to charge higher rates as warranted by credit conditions.17 In this context,
the staff pointed out that the authorities’ decision in early 2004/05 to lower the rates of return
on loans extended to manufacturing companies was inconsistent with the need to curb credit
growth and reduce inflation. The staff also suggested that access to the central bank’s
overdraft facilities would need to be tightened and greater efforts should be made to secure
commercial banks’ cooperation in restraining credit growth. At the same time, however, it
advised against raising the ratio of obligatory reserves, which would shift the cost of monetary
policy implementation to the banks and further weaken their financial position. The
authorities indicated that increasing bank lending rates was not feasible in the current political
circumstances, but agreed to keep the staff’s suggestions under review.
25.
The staff stressed the importance of a strong track record of credibility in
meeting monetary policy targets. It underscored the need to put forward more realistic
monetary targets, consistent with the desired medium-term disinflation path, which would
anchor inflation expectations. The authorities explained that with greater central bank
17

Under Islamic banking principles, ex-ante interest rates are not allowed, but financial rates of return are used
based on expected profitability.

- 19 -

independence envisaged under the forthcoming FFYDP and better coordination between fiscal
and monetary policies, monetary policy implementation would gain in credibility. The
authorities also plan to open an interbank market for rial funds and develop indirect
instruments of monetary policy.
26.
Despite recent reforms, the financial system is still weak and supervision is
inadequate. The staff called for steadfast progress in banking supervision reform (Box 1),
which is needed for a proper monitoring of risks and urged the authorities to finalize a
timeline for its completion. In particular, the main risk to the stability of the banking system
emanates from a possible deterioration in loan portfolios following the rapid credit growth.
Moreover, the rapid build-up of banks’ exposure to short-term foreign currency-denominated
debt under letters of credit for trade financing could be a potential source of risk. The
authorities indicated that although the current system of loan classification and provisioning
was not consistent with international standards, the evolution of their indicators of nonperforming loans do not suggest any problems for now. They assured fund staff that they
would monitor closely the financial position of banks and their credit risks. The Iranian
authorities are also determined to enforce compliance with newly approved regulations on
capital adequacy within two years and continue their reform of banking supervision. With
regard to the mounting exposure of banks under letters of credit, the authorities were
monitoring developments in this area, which in their view, reflected normal trade finance
flows.
27.
The staff welcomed the steps toward developing the infrastructure of the TSE
and deepening the capital market, but expressed concern over the rapid increase in
equity valuation. The authorities maintained that the current level of the average
price/earning ratio, estimated at nine, did not indicate the presence of a price bubble, even
though they conceded that the supply of equities was still limited. They also noted that the
direct exposure of banks and other financial institutions to the stock market was small. The
staff called for early adoption of the capital market law, which would help foster the
development of the TSE and strengthen the supervision of issuance and trading of securities,
particularly through the establishment of an independent Securities and Exchange
Commission, as well as better monitoring of margin lending.
Exchange rate policy
28.
The staff underscored the need for exchange rate policy to give a considerably
greater weight to monetary policy objectives. Tensions have emerged between monetary
and exchange rate objectives. Under the current fiscal policy stance, achieving the authorities’
M2 target might not be consistent with the desire to continue with a gradual nominal exchange
rate depreciation aiming at preserving competitiveness. Given the size of projected purchases
of foreign exchange from the government, sterilization might be too costly and would only
provide a temporary remedy against inflation-induced real appreciation. In the short run, real
appreciation could be contained through fiscal adjustment. If the latter is not possible, the
authority should give priority to achieving the M2 target. While this might result in some
nominal appreciation, it would also contribute to faster disinflation.

- 20 -

29.
The current level of the exchange rate does not raise concerns with regard to
competitiveness as evidenced by the rapid growth of the tradable sector, including
non-oil exports. Further gains in competitiveness could be achieved in the medium term
primarily through structural reforms. While some real appreciation in the short run may be
inevitable, as highlighted above, this should not be sustained over the medium term since it
would undermine the objective of economic diversification away from oil. The authorities
indicated that the central bank is determined to smooth out short-term fluctuations in the
exchange rate vis-à-vis a basket of currencies, while avoiding a nominal effective appreciation
that might hinder competitiveness.
30.
The staff supported the authorities’ gradual approach to capital account
liberalization. The authorities have put increased emphasis on attracting FDI under the
recently adopted FDI law. They are also considering authorizing limited portfolio investment
of non-residents with time limitations on the repatriation of principal capital. The staff
underscored that further financial sector reforms and steady progress in disinflation are key
preconditions for further capital account liberalization.
B. Medium-Term Issues
31.
The current draft of the FFYDP puts forward ambitious macroeconomic
objectives and a comprehensive structural reform agenda. The plan targets a real GDP
growth of 8 percent compared to 5.7 percent on average during the TFYDP. This is expected
to be achieved through higher private sector investment and improved efficiency (higher total
factor productivity, TFP) that would result from stepped up implementation of structural
reforms. Inflation is projected to decelerate to 9.9 percent on average during the plan period,
from an estimated 15–17 percent in 2004/05.
32.
The staff encouraged the authorities to finalize their reform programs and assess
the macroeconomic implications of the plans’ targets and structural reform agenda. The
staff welcomed the planned ambitious privatization program, which will open most sectors to
private sector participation, including banks and insurance companies, and called for early
implementation of labor market reform, further trade liberalization, and various measures to
improve the business climate.
33.
The staff endorsed the authorities’ plans to set the budget within a medium-term
framework, given the central role of fiscal policy in Iran. The fiscal policy objectives set
forth in the draft FFYDP aim at reducing the dependency on oil revenue and limiting growth
in current expenditure. The reform agenda also includes the introduction of the Value Added
Tax (VAT) in 2006, a reduction in tax exemptions, a gradual phasing out of implicit energy
subsidies (10½ percent of GDP in 2004/05), a reduction in explicit subsidies, and an overhaul
of benefits and contributions under the current social security system. There are also plans to
improve expenditure management and streamline Treasury operations with TA from the
World Bank.

- 21 -

34.
The staff called for early implementation of financial sector reform under the
FFYDP. These include restructuring of public banks and improving their management in
connection with recapitalization; the privatization of most public banks and insurance
companies; a significant reduction in controls on credit allocation and rates of return; and a
complete transition toward a risk-based supervision system.
35.
These reforms will support an increase in TFP and GDP growth. While past
experience shows that the Iranian economy can sustain relatively high growth rates over an
extended period of time, the plan’s objectives are particularly challenging given the lags in
reform-driven increases in TFPs (Box 2), the likelihood of forced fiscal adjustment in
response to a possible decline in oil prices over the medium term, and the need to overcome
entrenched rigidities and improve the business climate.
36.
The staff developed an illustrative baseline medium-term scenario, assuming a
gradual implementation of the reforms under the FFYDP and a back-loaded adjustment
in fiscal and monetary policies. This scenario is also based on a conservative assumption of
a steady decline in oil prices to about $24 per barrel at the end of the plan period, as well as a
gradual implementation of the energy price reform. Under this scenario, real GDP growth is
projected to decline to below 5 percent in 2009/10 and the unemployment rate is likely to
increase (Figure 7, Table 6, and Box 3). The fiscal adjustment will be gradual and will be
achieved mainly through additional revenue measures, including energy subsidy reform,18 of
the VAT implementation in 2006/07, as well as lower growth in capital spending and net
lending. Such a fiscal stance, together with modest monetary policy tightening at the
beginning of the period, as well as the planned phasing out of subsidies, may well result in
inflation being entrenched at about its current level. Under this scenario, a deficit in the
external current account would emerge in 2005/06 and widen thereafter, as sluggish oil export
earnings are likely to be more than offset by continued import growth (Figure 7 and Table 7).
While external and public debt ratios would remain at an appropriate level, the OSF resources
would be depleted by the end of the plan period and external liquidity indicators would
deteriorate significantly. However, a sensitivity analysis shows that if average oil prices were
to be about $5 per barrel higher relative to the baseline projection,19 Iran’s external position
would be stronger than currently projected (Figure 8). Conversely, a decline in oil prices by

18

Based on broad indications regarding the planned energy price reform, it is assumed that energy prices will be
increased by 25 percent per year with two-thirds of the additional revenue spent on social protection and public
investment.

19

In this scenario, oil prices are consistent with the August WEO benchmark price and a discount of about $3
per barrel for Iranian crude.

Box 2. Sources of Growth in Iran
In the period 1960–2002, the Iranian economy grew at an average rate of 4½ percent, which compares
favorably with the rest of the countries in the MENA region (with average growth rates of 4.2 percent). This
growth performance, however, shows a high degree of variability: rapid growth in the 1960s and early 1970s
was followed by a period of negative growth during the 1979 revolution and the war with Iraq which lasted
well into the 1980s. Growth rebounded following the post-war reconstruction and subsequent economic
reforms.
Text Table IV shows the decomposition of the sources of growth in Iran during the period, drawing on a
Selected Issues Paper “Economic Growth in the Islamic Republic of Iran.” The negative contribution of TFP to
economic growth and the relatively high rates of investment in physical capital (30 percent of GDP on average
during 1960–2002) suggest that growth in Iran resulted from high savings and investment rather than from an
efficient use of resources. Text Table V shows that while the investment to GDP ratio has been relatively high
compared with high-growth countries, average GDP growth has been 50 percent lower.

These results suggest that if the government targets an increase in real GDP growth to 8 percent on average––
as proposed under the draft FFYDP––TFP would need to contribute about 2.2 percent to the average growth
rate in the future (versus -1.8 percent during 1989–2002), if investment ratios were to remain at about 30
percent of GDP. The authorities’ growth target for the next five years seems overly ambitious. However, crosscountry evidence suggests that while structural reforms are necessary to increase TFP, these effects tend to be
delayed by about two to four years.

Box 3. Employment under Alternative Medium-Term Scenarios
This Box describes the projected evolution of total employment and unemployment under two alternative
medium-term scenarios presented in the text. Both exercises assume the same rate of growth of labor supply of
3.3 percent per year over the medium term and no change in labor participation rates, consistent with the
experience in the past decade (in which the labor participation rate for females increased but decreased for
males).
Under the baseline medium term-framework, the absence of labor market reform would imply that the elasticity
of employment to non-oil GDP growth is likely to remain at its historical level of 0.5. The reform and adjustment
(alternative) medium-term scenario assumes upfront labor market reform that would introduce greater flexibility
in the labor market and progressively cause the elasticity of employment to grow from 0.5 to 0.7 over the
medium term. The needed labor market reform includes reducing dismissal costs, eliminating regulations of
wages in many industries dominated by state-owned companies, and improving the information system for job
seekers.

about $3 per barrel relative to the baseline scenario would result in a significant deterioration
of the current account balance and in reserve coverage of imports by the end of the projection
period (Figure 8).
37.
An alternative scenario developed by the staff assumes an upfront fiscal
adjustment supported by monetary policy restraint (Table 8 and Figure 7).This, together
with expeditious implementation of structural reforms, would result in a much better outcome
for inflation, a stronger liquidity position of the government, as reflected in a steady build-up
of savings in the OSF, a better resilience to external shocks due to a much higher coverage of
imports by gross official reserves, and possibly faster growth and employment creation
(Figure 7 and Box 3). The recommended policy scenario would also help achieve fiscal
sustainability in the long run by moving consumption of hydrocarbon wealth closer to the
optimal path.20

A Selected Issues Paper––“Issues in Medium-term Management of Oil Wealth”––provides estimates of
optimal consumption out of oil wealth based on various assumptions for oil prices and inter-generation equity
considerations.

C. Other Issues
38.
The authorities attach great importance to transparency and improvements to
data dissemination. They are committed to moving toward compliance with the requirements
of the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). In this regard, the staff stressed
the need for rapid implementation of the recommendations of recent STA TA missions
(Appendix III).
39.
The track record of implementing Fund TA recommendations has been mixed.
During 2003/04, the authorities made substantial progress in implementing the
recommendations of a LEG/MFD mission on eliminating exchange restrictions for current
account transactions. However, progress in implementing Fund TA in tax administration and
VAT has been slow so far. The authorities continue to value Fund’s assistance and expressed
interest in receiving TA in the areas of banking system restructuring and capital account
liberalization.
40.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to provide debt relief to Nicaragua and
Tanzania under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
Iran has enjoyed two consecutive years of real GDP growth at above 6 percent,
supported by economic reforms and a favorable external environment, but key
challenges remain. This growth performance has been accompanied by lower unemployment,
rising international reserves, low external debt, and enhanced business confidence. While
initial structural reforms implemented at the beginning of the TFYDP have played a key role
in improving economic efficiency, attracting foreign direct investment, and improving the
business environment, less enduring factors such as high oil prices and expansionary policies,
have also been at play. The authorities are now facing challenges on both fronts: the
temporary factors may soon run their course and require policy adjustment, while the initial
structural reforms need to be consolidated and deepened to sustain high growth and
employment creation.
42.
Fiscal and monetary policy stimulus at the height of the oil price cycle has
increased inflationary pressure and intensified the economy’s vulnerability to a
retrenchment in oil prices. Channeling larger oil revenue to finance higher government
spending, together with accommodating monetary policy, has led to the persistence of rapid
credit and liquidity growth and double-digit inflation. This, together with inadequate
instruments of monetary policy and a relatively weak banking system, poses a serious
challenge for macroeconomic management. While the authorities take comfort in the positive
employment outcome of their policy and seem willing to tolerate inflation at its current level,
a continuation of the current expansionary policy mix could make inflation entrenched and
increase the output cost of lowering it in the medium term.

- 27 -

43.
The projected outcome for 2004/05 calls for a shift in the policy mix. Despite the
expenditure cuts that are envisaged to deal with shortfalls in revenue and privatization
receipts, the level of government spending remains high and the non-oil fiscal deficit is
estimated by the staff to increase. This, together with the authorities’ reluctance to raise bank
lending rates, may lead to another year of high money and credit growth, double-digit
inflation, and the elimination of the current account surplus at a time of high oil prices.
44.
A withdrawal of the policy stimulus is needed through tightening in fiscal policy
that would be sufficient to support the central bank disinflation objective and contain upward
pressure on the exchange rate. The output cost of an upfront adjustment is likely to be offset
by the benefits of more sustainable growth and employment creation in the medium term. The
authorities in all likelihood will need to consider further fiscal adjustment in 2004/05 beyond
offsetting possible revenue shortfalls. While there is limited room for revenue measures,
efforts could focus on reducing subsidies and containing the steep increase in capital spending
and net lending. These efforts would help move the overall fiscal position close to balance.
Assuming that average oil prices will be higher than assumed in the baseline scenario, the
authorities should strongly resist pressures to increase expenditure and, instead, use the
windfall gains to build savings in the OSF. This would help achieve the authorities’
disinflation objectives, contain the pressure on the exchange rate to appreciate, and build a
financial cushion to ride out a possible downturn in oil prices.
45.
Monetary policy should give priority to reducing the rate of inflation. The
authorities’ package of monetary policy measures, including issuing additional CBPP and
providing commercial banks with greater freedom in credit allocation, are steps in the right
direction. The staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to take additional measures to
contain credit growth and mop up excess liquidity, along with their determination to
strengthen fiscal and monetary policy coordination to achieve their inflation objective. In this
respect, sufficient flexibility to use a variety of policy instruments would go a long way to
help the central bank achieve its objectives. The staff welcomes the authorities’ plans to grant
the central bank greater instrument independence, enhance the monetary policy formulation
framework, and develop adequate instruments of liquidity management. The authorities
should also consider announcing a feasible medium-term disinflation path consistent with
their other priorities, including employment.
46.
The exchange rate level is not misaligned, but greater flexibility in exchange rate
management is needed. Given the likelihood of continued large inflows of oil revenue and
FDI, and in the absence of sufficient fiscal tightening, tensions will continue to arise between
the central bank’s attempt to avoid a real appreciation of the exchange rate through nominal
depreciation and its disinflation objective. In this regard, priority should be given to achieving
the intermediate monetary policy targets, which calls for greater exchange rate flexibility,
including allowing for some nominal appreciation in the short run, if warranted. While
fostering competitiveness is key to facilitating the diversification of the Iranian economy,
major obstacles in this area are of a structural nature and would need to be removed through
stepped up reforms to improve the business environment. The staff commends the authorities
for the decisive progress in eliminating exchange restrictions on current account transactions

- 28 -

and supports their strategy of a gradual capital account liberalization to be underpinned by
further progress in financial sector reform and disinflation.
47.
Structural reforms must be carried further to sustain high rates of growth and
employment creation. The current period of high oil prices and strong business confidence
provides an opportunity to implement major reforms that would put the economy on a
long-term path of high growth and employment creation. With abundant natural resources, an
educated work force, and long traditions of entrepreneurship, Iran is in a position to realize its
economic potential if wide-ranging reforms are implemented. The staff welcomes the
ambitious reform agenda under the forthcoming five-year development plan and encourages
the authorities to ensure steadfast implementation. In addition to medium-term fiscal and
financial sector reforms, the authorities would need to follow through with their plans of
privatization, further trade liberalization, labor market reform, and improvements to the
business climate.
48.
The staff supports the authorities’ intention to set fiscal policy in a medium-term
framework and to accelerate fiscal reforms. The authorities’ objective of reducing
dependence on oil revenue is commendable, and would need to be pursued through
determined implementation of the VAT, a phasing-out of implicit and explicit subsidies, and
the development of targeted social assistance. Early action on other fiscal reforms is also
needed, including public expenditure and cash management, with assistance from the
World Bank and the IMF. The staff encourages the authorities to continue with their practice
of audit and oversight of charitable foundations (bonyads).
49.
The staff and the authorities agree on the importance of early financial sector
reform. Progress in establishing sound foundations for a market-based financial system must
be commensurate with the liberalization of the Iranian economy and the attraction of large
capital inflows. As such, the staff stresses the need to move forcefully to restructure stateowned banks, reform banking supervision by establishing a full-fledged risk-based
supervisory framework, and adopt the capital market law while strengthening the supervision
of the stock exchange. Moreover, the authorities are encouraged to adopt the AML/CFT
legislation and introduce relevant implementing regulations. Looking ahead, the staff
welcomes the banking system reform agenda outlined in the draft FFYDP, which aims at
establishing a dynamic and competitive banking system with majority private ownership.
50.
While there was some progress in timeliness and quality of statistical information
provided to the Fund, further efforts are needed in a number of areas. The authorities are
encouraged to compile and publish the international reserves template, along with Iran’s
international investment position, and improve monetary and fiscal data in line with STA TA
missions recommendations.
51.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Exchange System

On March 21, 2002, a unified exchange rate regime, based on a managed floating exchange
rate system, was adopted and the former official exchange rate of Rls 1,750 per U.S. dollar
was abolished. The new exchange rate is determined in the interbank foreign exchange
market. As a result, effective March 30, 2002, the exchange rate arrangement of the
Islamic Republic of Iran has been reclassified to the category of managed floating with no
pre-announced path for the exchange rate from the conventional pegged arrangement. Under
new foreign exchange regulations (a) there is no surrender requirements of the foreign
exchange earned by non-oil exporters; (b) the need for and the amount of advance deposits
for opening letters of credit are now left to the discretion of the authorized financial

- 40 -

APPENDIX I

institutions; (c) the procedure of foreign exchange allocation for authorized imports has been
eliminated; (d) the distinction between internally and externally sourced foreign exchange
deposit accounts has been largely eliminated; and (e) the base rate for converting the
U.S. dollar value of imports for the collection of customs duties and commercial benefits
taxes were revised from Rls 1,750 per U.S. dollar to the market rate.
Prior to March 21, 2002, the foreign exchange market operated mostly under a multiple
exchange system, consisting of two officially approved rates: (a) an official exchange rate
pegged at Rls 1,750 per U.S. dollar that applied mainly to imports of essential goods and
services as well as servicing public and publicly guaranteed debt; and (b) an effective
Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) rate, applicable for imports from a positive list issued by the
ministry of commerce. There was also an unofficial exchange market and the CBI allowed
commercial banks limited access to this market to cover certain current transactions.
Iran continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV but maintains
no exchange restrictions under these arrangements. Based on the information available to
date, the staff concludes that Iran maintains a number of exchange restrictions and multiple
currency practices subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3. The
restrictions identified are as follows:
Exchange restrictions arise from:
1.
Quantitative limits on the availability of foreign exchange for certain current
payments and transfers (for example, travel, education, medical expenses, or family
remittances);
2.
Limitations on the availability of foreign exchange for current payments and transfers
not expressly authorized in the Foreign Exchange Regulations;
3.
Limitations on the transferability from nonresident rial accounts of proceeds from
current transactions;
4.

Limitations on the availability of foreign exchange for advance payments; and

5.
Limitations on the availability of foreign exchange for the transfer of certain rial
profits from investment under Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Act.
Multiple currency practices arise from:
1.
Payments in respect of contingent liabilities pertaining to certain letters of credit
opened prior to the exchange rate unification in March 2002; and
2.
CBI purchases of unused allocations of foreign exchange at pre-unification “allocated
rates.”

APPENDIX II

Islamic Republic of Iran: Relations with the World Bank Group
1.
As of June 30, 2004, Iran received 51 World Bank loans totaling $2,599 million net of
cancellations and terminations, of which $1,867 million has been disbursed. Forty-five of
these loans have been fully disbursed. The ongoing portfolio consists of six loans for a total
of $791 million, of which $59 million has been disbursed.
2.
World Bank lending to Iran resumed in 2000 after a hiatus of seven years. This
coincided with the revival of the government’s large reconstruction effort. Four projects:
Tehran Sewerage Project, Second Primary Health Care and Nutrition Project, Environmental
Management and the Earthquake Emergency Project, were approved during the years
2000-02. An Environmental Management and an Earthquake Emergency Projects were
approved by the Board, in April and June of 2003, respectively. In May 2004, two new
projects were approved, Ahwaz and Shiraz Water and Sanitation, and the Urban Upgrading
and Housing Reform. Health, urban development, environment and sewerage sectors are
currently the major recipients of the Bank’s loans. In addition, a loan for reconstruction of
the quake-hit city of Bam is under preparation for Board approval in late-summer 2004.
3.
On May 2001, a two-year Interim Assistance Strategy (IAS) was approved by the Board
of Executive Directors. This strategy followed a two-pronged approach: (a) policy dialogue
on the reform program through nonlending services; and (b) targeted lending in key social
and environment areas consistent with the TFYDP objectives. During the IAS period, the
World Bank undertook a series of economic studies in support of the government’s reform
efforts, which formed the basis for policy dialogue and analysis. These included a study on
the reform of the Energy Pricing System, a Trade and Foreign Exchange System Reform
Study, a Public Expenditure Review, and a Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), as
well as other sectoral studies. In addition, Policy Review Notes have been prepared for
urban water, housing, agriculture, and air pollution control. Work is under way on the
pension system.
4.
A new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY 2005–08 is under preparation. The
overarching aim of the new CAS is to assist the government in implementing the structural
reform agenda, supporting the transformation of the economy, promoting high and
sustainable growth, and creating employment opportunities. The CAS emphasis is on
poverty alleviation and capacity building for a knowledge-based economy. The CAS
envisages a lending program in water and sanitation, urban transport, agriculture, education,
and community-based development. The analytical and advisory program proposes to
include public finance, economic management, improvement in the investment climate, and
human capital development, in addition to ongoing work on public expenditures and pension
strategies. The CAS also seeks to align with the government’s priorities and objectives of the
FFYDP. To support Iran’s reform efforts, the Bank is also intensifying its assistance for
capacity building in the formulation of economic and sectoral policies, their sequencing, and
implementation.

5.
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) support of the Bank’s program for Iran
will focus on technical assistance and advisory services. IFC's activities support private
sector firms while focusing on how to boost a private-sector supply response that Iran needs
to achieve higher and sustained growth, while accelerating job-creation opportunities. IFC
supports the establishment of a modern, open, and competitive financial sector, a
cornerstone for private sector development.
6.
Iran became a full member of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)
on December 2003. MIGA’s entry into Iran will play an important role in attracting foreign
direct investment to the country and promote outbound investment from Iran.

- 45 APPENDIX III

Islamic Republic of Iran: Statistical Issues
The data transmitted to the Fund, through direct contacts with the authorities and/or through
the Executive Director’s office, provided a basis for adequate sound assessment of economic
developments and to form a realistic perspective on Iran’s medium-term prospects. The
CBI’s new Economic Accounts Department has implemented significant improvements in
the statistical database, including the dissemination of data to the public. The quarterly
publication on economic and financial data, Economic Trends, is disseminated via the
Internet at <http://www.cbi.ir/e/>, ahead of the release of the hard copy publication.
However, the timeliness of key monthly data could be improved by the implementation of
data dissemination practices that incorporate revision policies and by the utilization of
electronic modes of data release that would also enhance data accessibility.
A multisector mission of the Statistics Department (STA) of the Fund visited Iran during
from June 18 to July 1, 2002 to assess current data dissemination practices against the
requirements of the SDDS. The mission also provided assistance on ways to further improve
the compilation of the macroeconomic statistics. In December 2003 and June 2004, STA
reviewed data dissemination practices and advised the authorities on the steps needed to
subscribe to the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS).
Real sector statistics
•

National accounts statistics are reasonably sound. The CBI has updated the quarterly
GDP statistics for the period 1988–2003. Most of the recommendations made by the
1999 STA mission have been fully implemented, most notably concerning the change
of the base year to 1997/98 for the constant price calculations, implementation of the
1993 SNA, and the development of quarterly national accounts. Improvements have
also been made in the coverage of the informal economy. However, additional work
remains, especially in the coverage of small-scale industries and services. Also, the
recommended joint project between the CBI and the Statistical Center of Iran (SCI)
to compare and analyze the two sets of estimates of GDP they compile has not been
implemented. The base year for national accounts has been recently updated to
1997/98.

•

Price statistics have generally been reported to the Fund in a timely manner. The
official labor market statistics are released by the Statistical Center of Iran (SCI), and
are based on the definition recommended by the International Labor Organization
(ILO). The data are based on an urban and rural population sample of about 100,000
households, and the threshold for considering a person employed is two days a week.
Labor market statistics, however, still need improvement, particularly with regard to
employment and wage data.

- 46 -

APPENDIX III

Government finance statistics
•

One significant improvement has been the adoption of the Government Finance
Statistics (GFS) classification for the core central government operations which will
enhance transparency and help improve fiscal management.

•

Coverage of the 2003/04 budget was broadened and implicit energy subsidies were
included in the budget for the first time.

•

Data on the central government operations cover the general budget, the special
purpose funds, and transactions with the Social Security Organization. There is a need
to expand the coverage of central government to include the complete transactions of
the Social Security Organization, four pension funds, five procurement and
distribution centers, and the OSF.

•

Only experimental data for the consolidated central and general government,
comprising the central government and the municipalities, are compiled. The
preliminary data are compiled with a sample of municipalities (all large and a
selection of the small municipalities). Some time later (one or two years), more
complete municipalities data will be used to compile the final estimates. These data
are not disseminated, although they are used for compiling the SNA.

•

The existing cash-based government accounting system should be upgraded to enable
recording of expenditures at the pre-payment stage.

•

Financing data in the GFS are not broken down by residency of debt holders or by
type of debt instruments. Data used by the Economic Research and Policy Department
(ERPD) for preparing financing data could be further analyzed to distinguish debt by
type of holder and by instrument. The discrepancy between fiscal and monetary data
on deficit financing remains relatively large. From an SDDS perspective, this
discrepancy raised questions about the accuracy of the fiscal data and the 2003 SDDS
missions held a number of discussions with the objective of improving the collection
and classification of government debt. No information is available on the status of
implementation of the recommendations that were made.

•

Information on domestic government debt with the CBI and commercial banks are
disseminated in the Table, “Monetary and Credit Aggregates Outstanding at the end
of the Period” in Economic Trends. However, domestic debt with the public at large,
or economic sectors excluding the banking sector, mainly in the form of Government
Participation Papers (GPP) are not monitored. There is a need to develop a
comprehensive database on domestic public debt.

•

The Bonyad-e-Mostazafan va Janbazan (BMJ, Foundation of the Oppressed and
Injured) could be considered a holding company and can be classified in the
nonfinancial public corporations sector.

- 47 -

APPENDIX III

Monetary statistics
•

Monthly monetary data are reported to STA on a regular basis for publication in the
Fund’s International Financial Statistics or IFS, with a lag of about two months.
Compilation of monetary statistics diverges from international standards in the
application of the residency criterion and in sectorization and classification. The
authorities are undertaking improvements in each of these areas, in line with the
recommendations of two recent STA missions.

•

The measure of broad money employed by the CBI does not include deposits of
public nonfinancial corporations, local government, and foreign-currency deposits of
residents. As a result, the broad money stock tends to be underestimated.

•

In the CBI’s analytical accounts, CBPP are included in other unclassified liabilities.
Separate data on holdings of CBPP broken down by bank holders and nonbank
holders should be collected in the CBI monthly report. These separate data will allow
the CBI and other data users to construct broader liquidity measures, which will
include CBPP held by nonbank sectors.

External sector data
•

The accounting system for foreign exchange receipts and payments of the CBI and
banks is being designed in line with the methodological guidelines of the Fund’s
Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5) and is being put in operation.

•

In line with the effort of improving the balance of payments estimates for transactions
not recorded in the BPM4 format and for which historical data are unavailable, the
coverage of services and other balance of payments entries have been significantly
improved. In particular, the services debit and credit entries for 2000/01–2002/03
have been revised. Work is proceeding to carry these revisions to past seven years.
Moreover, the balance of payments has been revised to better reflect buy-back
transactions under direct investment and other balance of payments entries.

•

Data on the international investment position are compiled but not disseminated. Only
data on public and publicly guaranteed debt are compiled and disseminated, but
classifications do not fully accord with the guidelines of the External Debt Guide. The
data template on international reserves and foreign currency liquidity is not compiled;
the June 2004 STA mission provided technical advice on the methodological and
compilation aspects of this data set.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN
Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2004 Consultation
with the Islamic Republic of Iran
Approved by Donal Donovan, François Gianviti, Stefan Ingves and Saleh M. Nsouli
September 8, 2004
1.
In the attached communication, the Governor of the Central Bank of the
Islamic Republic of Iran has formally notified the Fund that the Islamic Republic of Iran has
accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of
Agreement with effect from September 6, 2004.
2.
The exchange system of the Islamic Republic of Iran was reviewed by staff during a
mission to Tehran in February 2004. In response to staff’s findings of a number of exchange
restrictions and multiple currency practices, the authorities made changes to the foreign
exchange regulations and eliminated most of the restrictions and multiple currency practices
identified. However, one exchange restriction and two multiple currency practices subject to
Fund approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and (3) remain:
¾ An exchange restriction arises from limitations set out in the by-laws adopted to
implement the Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Act (FIPPA) on the
transferability of (periodic) rial profits from certain foreign direct investments. The
authorities have committed to making the necessary changes to the by-laws within the
next 12 months and thus have requested approval of the restriction.
¾ A multiple currency practice arises from budget subsidies for foreign exchange
purchases in connection with payments of certain letters of credit opened prior to
March 21, 2002 under the previous multiple exchange rate system. As of
February 2004, the outstanding letters of credit have a volume of about
US$5,870 million and remaining maturities of up to 14 years. These letters of credit
had been opened by ministries, other government entities, and government-owned and
private companies for medium- and long-term financing purposes.

-2-

¾ A multiple currency practice also arises from the obligation of entities that had
received allocations of foreign exchange for payments based on subsidized “allocated
rates” under the previous multiple rate system to surrender unused allocations to the
CBI at the allocation rate. While the great majority of these allocations have been
resolved, there are still some outstanding amounts of unused allocations that have not
been returned.
3.
The staff welcomes Iran’s decision to accept the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4 and supports the request for approval of the restriction limiting the
transfer of rial profits in view of the non-discriminatory nature of the measure and the
authorities’ commitment to its elimination within the next 12 months. The two remaining
multiple currency practices are not being maintained for balance of payments reasons; they
do not materially impede Iran’s balance of payments adjustment, and they do not discriminate
among members or harm the interests of other members. Therefore, staff supports the
authorities’ request for approval for their retention for an initial period of two years, after
which time the issue would be revisited.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
September 10, 2004
This statement contains updated information on recent economic developments in Iran that
have become available since the Staff Report was circulated to the Executive Board on
August 23, 2004. This information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
Since the Staff Report was issued, oil prices have continued to rise. Iran’s average oil
export price for fiscal year 2004/05 is now estimated at $36 per barrel, in line with the
August 2004 World Economic Outlook. The impact of the stronger oil market conditions is
reflected in the sensitivity analysis shown in Figure 8 of the Staff Report. The authorities
have informed staff that the windfall gains from higher-than-budgeted oil revenue (estimated
at $5 billion, or 2.5 percent of GDP) will be deposited in the Oil Stabilization Fund.
2.
CPI inflation was 14.4 percent in the 12-month period ending July 2004. Preliminary
estimates for the 12-month period ending June 2004 point to an increase in broad money
(M2) of 29 percent and in credit to the private sector of 42 percent. The monetary authorities
have already issued Central Bank Participation Papers to mop up excess liquidity in an
amount of Rls 5 trillion (3 percent of base money) on a net basis.
3.
The draft law of the Fourth Five-Year Development Plan (2005–09), which has been
approved by the outgoing parliament, was re-submitted to the newly elected parliament after
the Guardian Council had raised a number of issues, one of them relating to the conformity
of the proposed privatization of public banks with the provisions of the Iranian Constitution.
This and other issues are being considered in various committees, but the authorities do not
expect major changes in the plan’s reform agenda.

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 04/109
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 27, 2004

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes Article IV Consultation with the
Islamic Republic of Iran
On September 10, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Islamic Republic of Iran.1
Background
During the first four years of the Third Five-Year Development Plan (TFYDP)
(2000/01- 2003/04), real GDP grew by 5.6 percent on average, the external current account
was in surplus, external debt was reduced to a very low level, international reserves increased,
and the unemployment rate declined. This performance has taken place against the background
of increased openness of the economy to international trade and investment and economic
reforms, but also sustained high oil prices and expansionary fiscal and monetary policies.
Notwithstanding these achievements, the Iranian economy faces the challenge of maintaining
high growth and employment creation in a stable macroeconomic environment.
The expansionary fiscal and monetary policies of recent years have maintained inflation at
double-digit rates and led to a substantial reduction in the external current account surplus at a
time when oil prices were high. Moreover, there is a pressing need to step up implementation of
structural reforms to enhance economic efficiency and foster private sector development and
growth. These include financial sector reform, privatization, further trade liberalization, and
improvement of the business climate.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during
the September 10, 2004 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

-2-

Real GDP grew by 6.7 percent in 2003/04 (fiscal year ending on March 20), with strong
contribution from both the oil and non-oil sectors. The unemployment rate declined to
11.2 percent from 14.1 percent in 2000/01. Domestic demand continued to grow rapidly under
the impetus of an expansionary policy mix, as reflected in high rates of growth of credit and
money supply (M2). As a result, average CPI inflation remained at 15 ½ percent in 2003/04.
The external current account surplus declined to about 1½ percent of GDP in 2003/04 from
3.1 percent in 2002/03. Despite a significant increase in both oil and non-oil exports, imports
continued to rise significantly, on the strength of domestic demand. The capital and financial
account recorded a large surplus, largely on account of increasing FDI inflows—mainly in the
energy sector––and short-term financing through letters of credit. Gross official reserves
increased by $3.0 billion to $24.5 billion, equivalent to 6½ months of next year’s imports of
goods and services. External debt remained low at $11.9 billion, equivalent to 8.7 percent of
GDP.
While fiscal policy was tightened in 2003/04, the fiscal stimulus was not fully withdrawn.
The non-oil fiscal deficit was brought down to 16½ percent, or close to 2 percent of GDP lower
than in the previous year, mainly through expenditure restraint, while non-oil revenue remained
unchanged relative to GDP. The overall fiscal deficit also declined from 2.4 percent of GDP to
0.2 percent.
Monetary policy was expansionary in 2003/04. The average bank lending rates have remained
broadly unchanged in both nominal and real terms. Unsterilized purchases of foreign exchange
from the government by the central bank and increased central bank lending to commercial
banks led to rapid growth of base money. This, together with a higher money multiplier, fueled
private sector credit and M2 growth to the tune of 39 percent and 30 percent, 2 respectively.
The managed float exchange regime has continued to operate smoothly.
Progress in structural reforms slowed down in 2003/04. While the preparation of medium-term
reforms advanced and some progress was made in trade liberalization and banking supervision
reforms, little progress was made in reforming the labor market, implementing privatization, or
streamlining administrative procedures.
Real GDP is projected to grow at 6.5 percent in 2003/04 on account of high oil prices and the
continuation of the current expansionary policy stance. The authorities aim at achieving a
money growth target of 20–24 percent to reduce inflation.

Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed Iran’s strong growth performance over the last four years, which has been
supported by important structural reforms implemented at the beginning of the Third Five-Year
Development Plan (2000–04), as well as by favorable oil market conditions. Directors noted with
satisfaction that unemployment has declined, gross official reserves have continued to increase,
and the external debt has remained low. These positive developments have been associated
with strengthened confidence in the economy, and a rise in private sector activity and foreign
direct investment, including in the non-hydrocarbon sector. Directors considered that key
challenges going forward will be to further strengthen the foundations for strong and sustained
economic growth and diversification to provide the basis for continued job creation in an
environment of macroeconomic stability. Iran’s pursuit of stronger macroeconomic policies and
far reaching structural reforms will be crucial for underpinning its transition to a market economy
and away from oil dependence.
The outlook for the Iranian economy remains favorable. Directors urged the authorities to use
the opportunity of high oil prices and improved business confidence to better balance the policy
mix by undertaking an upfront tightening of the fiscal and monetary policy stance to bring about
a sustained reduction in inflation, which has persisted at double-digit levels. They considered
that fiscal policy has a crucial role to play in assisting monetary policy to reduce inflation by
containing the growth of domestic demand. In this regard, they welcomed the authorities’
intention to scale down expenditure from the high level budgeted for 2004/05, and to improve
revenue collections. They noted, however, that additional fiscal adjustment measures may be
needed to ease demand pressures and reduce the liquidity effects of spending. To continue
strengthening the fiscal position, especially for the medium term, they called for further
containment of capital spending and net lending, the phasing out of explicit subsidies, early
implementation of the Value Added Tax, and further strengthening of tax administration.
Directors also underscored the need to increase savings in the Oil Stabilization Fund while oil
prices are high, and encouraged the authorities to resist pressure to relax fiscal policy in the
likely event of higher than expected oil revenue.
Directors stressed the importance of setting a medium-term framework for fiscal policy that aims
to preserve an adequate level of wealth from non-renewable hydrocarbon resources, while
ensuring that fiscal policy supports macroeconomic stability. Directors also encouraged the
completion of the preparatory work on energy price reform, which aims at phasing out implicit
energy subsidies while putting in place a well-targeted and integrated social safety net.
Directors endorsed the authorities’ intention to tighten monetary policy, and welcomed the range
of measures that have been approved to contain domestic liquidity growth, including stepped up
sterilization operations. They urged the authorities to work toward establishing a clear monetary
policy framework that serves to promote disinflation. This should be accompanied by further
steps to strengthen indirect instruments of monetary policy, curtail the use of direct credit
controls, introduce more market-based flexibility in setting rates of return, and limit the recourse

-4by banks to the central bank’s overdraft facilities. They looked forward to the establishment of
central bank independence and to the further development of money markets.
Directors endorsed the efforts underway to strengthen Iran’s financial system and improve its
resilience to exogenous shocks. Directors welcomed the licensing of private banks and leasing
companies and supported actions to restructure public banks and strengthen their capital base.
They urged the authorities to move quickly to complete the establishment of a risk-based
supervision framework to effectively monitor potential risks that may emerge from rapid credit
growth, and to monitor developments in asset prices. Directors encouraged the authorities to
seek early approval of the capital markets law, which aims at improving the regulatory
framework for the issuance and trading of securities and strengthens the supervision of the
Tehran Stock Exchange. They welcomed steps to improve transparency and oversight of
charitable institutions, and called for early passage of a comprehensive anti-money laundering
law covering the entire financial system.
Directors agreed that the managed floating exchange rate regime, which has been in place
since the March 2002 exchange rate unification, has served Iran well, and that the current level
of the exchange rate is broadly appropriate. They welcomed the assurance that, going forward,
exchange rate policy will give considerably greater weight to monetary policy objectives.
They commended the authorities for eliminating most exchange restrictions for current
international transactions and their intention to phase out the remaining ones, and for accepting
the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ aim to develop the private sector as the major engine of
growth and to further open the economy to international trade and foreign investment. Several
Directors noted that the Fourth Five-Year Development Plan legislation containing key reforms
is undergoing further deliberation, and welcomed the assurance that its approval is expected
soon. They stressed the importance of further improving the business climate by streamlining
administrative procedures, disengaging the government from commercial activities that can be
carried out more efficiently by the private sector, and increasing labor market flexibility to raise
the employment content of growth.
Directors noted the steps taken to improve data quality and transparency, including in the
presentation of fiscal accounts and the oil sector, and encouraged the authorities to accelerate
preparatory work on moving toward compliance with the Special Data Dissemination Standard.
Iran is a bilateral creditor for two heavily indebted countries. Directors commended the Iranian
authorities’ commitment to provide Iran’s share of debt relief to these countries under the
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative.
