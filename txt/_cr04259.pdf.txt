EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

A staff team consisting of Messrs. Riechel (head), Camard, Mikhael and Ms. Sancak (all AFR);
Mr. Puig (SEC); and Ms. Kebet (Assistant, AFR) visited the Union of the Comoros during
January 26–February 9, 2004 to conduct the discussions for the 2004 Article IV consultation.

•

The power struggle between the Union and the island governments about the concrete meaning of
the new constitution has hampered the conduct of coherent economic policies and undermined
economic performance. Real per capita GDP dropped in 2003 for the sixth year in a row and no
progress was made toward poverty reduction. The consolidated primary fiscal balance displayed a
deficit of 3 percent of GDP, while a move toward sustainability would have required a surplus.
The external current account deficit increased to 4.4 percent of GDP, despite a significant
improvement in the terms of trade.

•

In December 2003, a Transition Agreement on elections, political cooperation, and economic
management was brokered by the African Union and spawned the establishment of a donor trust
fund in support of its effective implementation. Elections for island parliaments that took place in
March 2004 were won by the opposition parties. Elections for the National Assembly will follow
in mid-April 2004.

•

Discussions on the modalities for the implementation of the Transition Agreement proved to be
extremely difficult, but in the end resulted in compromises that were supported, in principle, by
all parties concerned. The effective implementation of the agreed arrangements will be a test of
the parties’ preparedness to cooperate, and an indication of the scope for negotiating a staff
monitored program (SMP).

•

Given the limited human and financial resources of the country, the decentralization foreseen
under the Constitution should aim at management structures that are operationally effective and
economically efficient. It must also be guided by the need for coherent and financially sound
macroeconomic policies. The achievement of these objectives will require a high degree of
cooperation and coordination.

•

Fiscal policy under decentralization presents a particular challenge. Mechanisms for effective
coordination and expenditure control will need to be established in order to ensure that overall
fiscal deficits are kept at levels that are compatible with debt sustainability, and that spending is
directed toward development and poverty objectives.

•

Membership of the Comoros in the franc zone has served the country well and should be retained.
Initiatives to broaden the financial sector must be accompanied by measures to safeguard its
soundness and stability.

•

Structural rigidities and the poor performance of the public utilities continue to impair the
functioning of the economy and must be addressed with urgency.

•

There is a strong need to strengthen transparency and accountability at all levels of government,
and to move ahead with a broad reform of the data collection and dissemination process to
improve statistics.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Discussions for the 2004 Article IV consultation with the Comoros were held in
Moroni during January 26-February 9, 2004. Members of the mission also participated as
observers in the meetings of the Harmonization Committee, which was created to define
implementation modalities for the December 20, 2003 agreement between the Union and
island governments on political and economic management in the Comoros during the first
half of 2004 (Transition Agreement).1 In addition, the mission discussed with the authorities
the modalities for the negotiation of a staff-monitored program (SMP) needed to establish a
track record for a Fund-supported arrangement that could allow the Comoros to benefit from
the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative.
2.
The last Article IV consultation with the Comoros was concluded by the
Executive Board on October 30, 2002.2 At that time, Directors commended the authorities
for their efforts at political reconciliation and urged them to advance speedily with the
establishment of by-laws to make power sharing under the new constitution operational,
assign responsibilities for macroeconomic policies, and define financial relations between the
Union and the three island governments. Directors emphasized the need for a stable
economic environment and expressed concern about fiscal developments and the
accumulation of additional domestic and external payments arrears. They called for a staffmonitored program to establish a track record of economic policy implementation under the
new constitutional arrangements before initiating discussions on a program that could be
supported by a PRGF arrangement. Comoros has accepted the obligations of Article VIII and
maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions.3
3.
Since the Board meeting in October 2002, the staff of the African Department
visited the Comoros on two occasions before the 2004 Article IV consultation mission. In
December 2002, a staff team assisted the authorities with the establishment of a consolidated
draft budget for 2003 and participated in a seminar on fiscal decentralization. In May–
June 2003, a mission returned to the Comoros but found that the authorities had not yet been
able to achieve a consensus on key economic policy and management issues for the
negotiation of an SMP. In early October 2003, a Comorian delegation led by Union President
Azali Assoumani met with management to explain the country’s need for debt relief under
the HIPC Initiative and to reiterate its strong interest in a PRGF arrangement at the earliest
possible date.
1

Under the Agreement (Accord sur les dispositions transitoires aux Comores), the Fund was made a member of
the Harmonization Committee. For details, see below.

2

The Comoros consist of the islands of Ngazidja—formerly Grande Comore—(about 272,000 inhabitants) with
the capital Moroni; Anjouan (245,000); and Mohéli (32,000).

Indicative limits for invisible transactions to countries other than France and Morocco exist, but bona fide
requests are normally approved. Also, repatriation requirements exist for foreign exchange earnings.

II. RECENT POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
A confrontational political environment has hampered the conduct of economic
policies. At the center of the problems is a power struggle between the Union and the island
governments about the concrete meaning of the new constitution, which gives wide-ranging
but ill-defined powers to the islands, including financial autonomy.4 A number of attempts
in 2002 and 2003 to establish by-laws for critical areas of effective power sharing and
economic management failed to produce universally accepted results, notwithstanding the
heavy involvement of the international community. However, following intense international
pressure, a Transition Agreement on elections and critical arrangements for economic
management was reached on December 20, 2003 (Box 1). The agreement is strongly
supported by the international community and has given rise to the establishment of a
multidonor trust fund for the implementation of the transitional arrangements.5
5.
Economic developments during 2003 continued to be adversely affected by the
power struggle between the Union and island governments. The adversarial relationship
between these governments prevented the design and implementation of coherent economic
policies and brought to a virtual standstill structural reforms that are urgently needed to
strengthen the functioning of the economy. In addition, the political struggle undermined
confidence at home and abroad, with negative consequences for private investment and
foreign aid. As a result, the Comoros’s real per capita income declined for the sixth year in a
row, and no progress was made toward reducing poverty (Table 1).
6.
Inflation rose and the external current account deficit widened in 2003.
Notwithstanding a sizable strengthening of the Comorian franc (which is linked to the euro),
inflation increased from 3.3 percent in 2002 to 4.5 percent in 2003 (Figure 1). The rise was
mainly due to increases in import duties on selected commodities introduced by the Union
government. At the same time, notwithstanding a marked improvement in the terms of trade,
the external current account deficit (including official transfers) widened from 2.3 percent of
GDP in 2002 to 4.4 percent in 2003, owing mainly to a fall in tourism and private transfers.
The increase in the deficit led to the first decline in net foreign assets in six years. However,
at some 11 months of imports of goods and services, the Comoros’ reserve position is still at
a comfortable level.
4

The new constitution was drafted in 2001 following the return of the island of Anjouan to the Union after an
attempted breakaway in 1997. The constitution was approved with an overwhelming majority during a
referendum in December 2001.

5

The trust fund’s main objectives are the support of (i) elections of a National Assembly during March–
April 2004; (ii) the establishment of new political and administrative institutions; (iii) the preparation of a
strategic and durable framework for human development; (iv) the preparation and implementation of the 2004
budget(s); and (v) training for the consolidation of national reconciliation. Principal donors are the World Bank,
the European Union, and France; the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) is the executing agency.
Total pledged resources amount to US$5.4 million. The funds are controlled by the donors outside the budget
process.

Box 1. Comoros: International Initiatives on Decentralization Issues
A number of international initiatives sought to assist the Comorian authorities with the establishment of by-laws and
arrangements in support of an effective decentralization and increased autonomy for the islands under the new
constitution. To this end, two meetings were organized in Paris by the International Organization of the
Francophonie (OIF) on the following issues:
•
•
•

the delineation of competencies of the two levels of government (Union and islands);
fiscal issues, including revenue sharing, customs administration, and budgets; and
justice and the Constitutional Court.

While preliminary agreements on several issues were reached by the delegations, other issues remained unresolved,
and it was not possible to move ahead with implementation of the agreements. A third meeting in Pretoria, South
Africa, under the auspices of the African Union also ended in failure because the Union government questioned a
proposed revenue-sharing formula on the grounds that competencies remained unclear. The Union government also
called on the Anjouan government to harmonize its customs tariffs with those of the Union, and insisted on greater
powers for the Union in the area of national security.
In response to these developments, international pressure for an interim agreement on decentralization and the
holding of early elections increased. On December 20, 2003, a Transition Agreement was signed in Moroni between
the Union and island governments under the auspices of an African Union delegation led by President Mbeki of
South Africa. The agreement includes the following key points:
Political and security provisions
•
Legislative elections will be held by end-April 2004.
•
The national police will be placed at the disposition of the island governments.
•
Military and civilian observers of the African Union will oversee implementation.
Fiscal provisions
•
Union President Azali will issue 2004 budgets for the Union and the islands by decree by early
January 2004.
•
An independent customs authority comprising four Comorians and three international experts will
oversee the work of customs.
•
All tax and nontax revenues will be deposited in a special central bank account to be divided among the
governments in agreed shares.
•
A onetime transfer will be made to Ngazidja for the budget shortfall registered in 2003.
•
A special donor trust fund will be established to channel aid resources to critical transition projects.
The document called on the international community (including the Fund) to provide financial and technical
assistance in support of the effective implementation of the agreement, including through its participation in
implementation and monitoring committees (Comité d’harmonisation and Comité de suivi)

7.
Fiscal policies resulted in a primary deficit for the consolidated Union and island
government of 3 percent of GDP in 2003, compared with 4 percent in 2002. (Table 2
and Figure 2) An attempt to agree between the Union and island governments on a prudent
consolidated budget failed because of continued disputes about revenue sharing and the
delineation of expenditure competencies.6 In addition, the weak fiscal outturn was influenced

6

Unless otherwise defined, references to the “Union budget” in this document generally include revenues and
expenditures, notably wages and salaries, by the Union government on behalf of Ngazidja and Mohéli. At the
same time, as will be explained below, the Ngazidja government incurred its own additional spending.

-7-

by an attempt by the Ngazidja government to establish its own administration without an
agreement with the Union on the transfer of competencies.
8.
The failure to agree on a consolidated budget delayed the establishment of a
Union budget until July 2003.7 In view of the limited external financing available, the
Union government introduced a number of custom duties and surtaxes on imports and made a
substantial effort to reduce current spending, while increasing domestically financed capital
outlays. 8 When it became clear that revenues would nevertheless fall short of projections, in
mid-November the government issued a supplementary budget to avoid serious
overspending. Nevertheless, in 2003 the overall deficit of the Union reached 4.5 percent of
GDP on a payment order basis,9 and entailed a renewed accumulation of domestic and
external payments arrears of some CF 1.8 billion each, for the equivalent of 2.6 percent
of GDP (Table 3).10
9.
Fiscal developments for Ngazidja and Anjouan differed sharply in 2003. The
government of Ngazidja took several steps to establish an administration and operations in
line with its interpretation of the new constitution. In particular, although it had virtually no
revenues, it hired a significant number of contractual employees and incurred spending on
goods and services. This resulted in a deficit of about 0.8 percent of GDP on a cash basis,
which was financed by accumulating domestic arrears. In contrast to these developments, the
public finances in Anjouan were in balance in 2003, and the government repaid a substantial
amount of domestic salary arrears (Table 4).11 This positive result was achieved mainly
because of (i) a large increase in revenue (22 percent), reflecting in good measure a
strengthening of tax administration; and (ii) the trimming of the wage bill as a result of the
elimination of “ghost employees.”
10.
Monetary policy has remained narrowly circumscribed by the Comoros’s
membership in the franc zone and the related fixed exchange rate with the euro. The
membership has also imposed a firm and coherent framework for the operations and
management of the central bank (Banque Centrale des Comores—BCC), including a strict
7

During the first half of the year, discretionary spending was kept broadly in line with that of 2002.

8

The duties and surtaxes that were introduced comprise CF 750,000 for cars and CF 1 million for
buses; 20 percent of c.i.f. value for tobacco and alcohol; and CF 50 per kilo for rice.

9

The deficit figure is likely to be revised upward because of an unidentified residual item of CF 769 million
(about 0.5 percent of GDP).

10

These arrears come on top of those accumulated during the period 1998-2002 (almost 20 percent of GDP, of
which 4¼ percent were domestic and 15½ percent external). External arrears have built up to the African
Development Bank (AfDB), the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA), and some bilateral
donors. However, the Comoros has remained current on debt service to the Fund, IDA, the OPEC Fund, and the
Islamic Development Bank. The external payments arrears exist despite a very comfortable level of official
foreign reserves, the buildup of which is, however, mainly due to private transactions.

11

Since its attempt to break away from the Comoros in 1997, Anjouan has sought to remain financially and
administratively independent.

-8-

limit on lending to government. Moreover, the scope for an active monetary management has
been limited by the large amount of excess liquidity in the financial system, which mainly
reflects large remittances by Comorians living abroad and a conservative lending policy of
the sole commercial bank, the BIC-C (Table 5 and Figure 3).12 Therefore, the BCC in 2003
concentrated mainly on broadening and strengthening financial sector regulation and
supervision. The fixed link with the euro resulted in a nominal and real effective revaluation
of the Comorian franc during 2003 (Figure 5). There are no indications that this has
measurably weakened exports, while it has significantly reduced the costs of imports and
debt service.13
III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
11.
Given the importance of the Transition Agreement for domestic political
developments and financial support under the multidonor trust fund, the authorities’ attention
focused on the negotiation, in the Harmonization Committee, of concrete arrangements for a
successful implementation of the agreement during the first half of 2004.14 Discussions on
the Article IV consultation built on these negotiations and sought to provide a consistent
perspective for macroeconomic management, financial planning, and structural reform
for 2004 and beyond.
A. Work of the Harmonization Committee
12.
Discussions in the Harmonization Committee concentrated on the establishment
of Union and island budgets for the first half of 2004, the period foreseen under the
Transition Agreement. They revealed the complexity of the issues surrounding the move
toward greater autonomy of the islands, especially with respect to revenue sharing,
expenditure competencies, and the decentralization of the civil service.
13.
The revenue-sharing formula contained in the Transition Agreement reflected
long-term factors and needed adaptation. The shares under the original formula were
based on population and development indicators, as well as proposed competencies for the
Union and island governments based on the orientation of the new constitution.15 However,
in view of the so far unresolved decentralization issues, an adaptation of the formula more in
line with actual expenditure became necessary for the transition period. This proved to be
difficult because expenditure competencies—concentrated within the Union government—
12

The Banque Industrielle et Commerciale Comores dominates the financial sector.

13

The Comoros’s main export products are vanilla, cloves, and perfume oils from the ylang-ylang tree. The
drop in export volumes of vanilla and ylang-ylang observed in 2003 reflected poor harvest conditions rather
than a decline in competitiveness, which in fact benefited from significant increases in world market prices.

14

The discussions of these issues by the Harmonization Committee were chaired by the former Prime Minister
of Senegal, Mr. Mamadou Lamine Loum, who acted as the representative of the OIF.

15

The shares included in the Transition Agreement were as follows: Union, 28 percent; Ngadzija, 32.5 percent;
Anjouan, 30.5 percent; and Mohéli, 9 percent.

-9-

were being challenged by the island governments. In the event, a compromise was agreed
upon calling for only moderate changes to spending competencies relative to the status quo.
A fuller examination and rationalization of expenditure competencies and decentralization of
the civil service was referred to the political institutions and their representatives after the
elections later in the year.16 Based on this compromise, during the transition period shared
revenues would be distributed to special accounts at the central bank, after deductions for
debt service to those creditors who have received regular payments in the past.
14.
Agreements were also reached on the joint administration of the customs office
and the implementation of expenditure frameworks for individual governments. The
islands insisted that the joint administration of the customs office foreseen under the
Transition Agreement be effectively implemented and called for measures that would reduce
fraud, the diversion of funds, and discretionary exemptions.17 To strengthen transparency and
accountability in fiscal operations at all levels, Fund and World Bank staff drafted an action
plan for establishing collection and dissemination procedures for financial statistics and other
critical information.
15.
The deliberations of the Harmonization Committee on budget policy and
management issues continued after the departure of the mission. A summary of the result
is presented in Box 2. The recommendations of the committee, including the draft budgets,
were accepted by Union President Azali at the end of February 2004. Their effective
implementation remains both a political and practical problem, as commitment appears to be
uneven and implementation mechanisms have displayed considerable weaknesses.
B. Economic Management Under Decentralized Government
16.
The move toward greater autonomy of the islands will entail significant changes
in the policymaking process and institutional structures of government. Considering the
limited human and financial resources of the country and its low level of development, the
staff felt that decisions on these changes should be guided not only by the new constitutional
arrangements, but also by the need for coherent and financially sound macroeconomic
policies. They should also aim at management structures that are operationally effective and
economically efficient.

16

The related revenue shares agreed by the Harmonization Committee are as follows: Union, 44.5 percent;
Ngazidja, 19.1 percent; Anjouan, 29.3 percent; and Mohéli, 7.1 percent. They are the result of a difficult mix of
political objectives and practical considerations. Almost all of the wages and salaries for the Ngazidja and
Mohéli governments will continue to be paid by the Union government. For a discussion of civil service
decentralization, see the selected issues paper on “Civil Service Reform Under Decentralization.”

17

The attention to customs revenues and their administration and collection derives from the fact that they
typically amount to some two-thirds of the country’s overall revenue.

Box 2. Comoros: Main Agreements of the Harmonization Committee
The Harmonization Committee was charged with operationalizing the transition agreement’s provisions for fiscal
management. Meeting in almost continuous session from January 26 until March 2, 2004 (with Fund staff
participation until February 4), the committee reached agreements in the following main areas:
•
•

•

•
•
•
•

Promulgation of a revised budget for the first half of 2004 for the Union and island governments, with
shares for the allocation of revenue based on the centralization of salary administration for the Union,
Ngazidja, and Mohéli governments during the transition.
Establishment of a system of seven bank accounts for shared revenues, and of procedures for directing
the flow of revenues to meet the agreement’s provision for an “automatic” transfer of funds. The
established accounts include a central revenue collection account, one “shared” account for each
government, and separate accounts for wages and debt service.
Establishment of procedures and guidelines for transparent budget execution across governments, to
ensure that budget execution conforms to the agreed budgets. This includes the preparation of detailed
budgets and monthly cash plans based on the framework below, as well as commitments not to incur new
arrears, employ new staff, or raise salaries. Improved monitoring mechanisms were also agreed.
Agreement on the amount of a special allocation for Ngazidja to cover arrears incurred during 2003.
Some donor funding has been pledged toward covering an agreed amount of €1.5 million (against the
€2.4 million that had been requested), and additional resources are being sought for the balance.
Supervision of the unified Customs Office, including harmonization between the Union and Anjouan of
customs procedures (now completed) and tariff rates (planned for end-April 2004).
Delegation to a technical committee of work to strengthen the collection and dissemination of statistics
among the parties to the agreement, with a view to monitoring the transition and preparing for an eventual
SMP with the Fund. Fund and Bank staff contributed to the initial stages of this work.
Launching of a study on a government employment and wage bill, and agreement on harmonized
staffing levels and salaries for the senior levels of the new island administrations. The terms of
reference for the study include (i) a description of the current employment and wage bill situation (levels,
organizational charts, etc.); (ii) plans for the rationalization of the civil service under decentralization;
(iii) a reform program for managing the civil service, including training needs; and (iv) examination of the
need for redeployment of civil service staff in order to increase efficiency. On the basis of this research, the
study will then focus on how to divide staff between the Union and island governments.

Coherent economic policies
17.
The staff argued that uncoordinated economic policies had adversely affected
the economy over the past years and underscored the need for coherent policies in the
future. The discussions suggested, however, that achievement of this objective would not be
easy. Politically, a satisfactory solution to power sharing is not yet in sight, and the necessary
degree of cooperation has not been assured. Administratively, effective economic
management procedures based on decentralized government still need to be defined with
sufficient clarity and installed in a cooperative spirit.
18.
In the area of fiscal policy, the establishment of consolidated sustainable budgets
is critical. The staff urged the authorities to put in place a budget preparation process that
provides early guidance to all governments on prospective macroeconomic developments,
their implications for domestic revenues, and the maximum growth of overall expenditure
compatible with a national deficit objective.18 Budgetary arbitrage between the Union and
island governments would have to be organized within this framework to avoid a loss of
control over the country’s public finances.
19.
The prime responsibility of the central bank for monetary and exchange rate
policies as well as its operational independence are likely to be confirmed under the new
constitutional arrangements. The staff urged the authorities to ensure that these
arrangements also include the full autonomy of the central bank in matters of prudential
regulation and supervision, in line with international standards.
20.
Coherent policies are also needed in the areas of trade policy and in the
regulation of private sector activities. The staff indicated that the current differences
among islands in their external tariffs vis-à-vis third countries were not compatible with
international practices and the country’s commitments toward the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA).19 Regarding private sector activities, the staff felt
that investment incentives and other measures in support of economic development should
apply uniformly to the country as a whole, so as to avoid distortions and wasteful
competition.
Effectiveness and efficiency
21.
The decentralization foreseen under the new constitution will inevitably entail
costs related to the establishment of new government structures. Given the severe
resource constraints of the country, the staff urged the authorities to keep these costs at a
minimum by avoiding duplication and overlap, exploiting the scope for economies of scale,
and striving for an efficient management of the civil service. In this context, the staff called

The staff encouraged the authorities to seek technical assistance from the Fund in this area.

The main differences arose when Anjouan did not follow the Union government’s introduction of surtaxes on
rice, alcohol, and tobacco in July 2003.

for the establishment of selected national institutions such as (i) an independent revenue
authority that would collect shared and local taxes on the basis of the pertinent national and
local laws and regulations; (ii) a National Statistics Bureau for the timely and reliable
collection and dissemination of a core set of economic, financial, and social statistics; and
(iii) a centralized agency for payments to the country’s civil service and the military. Finally,
the staff advocated for the administration of the nation’s external debt and debt service to
remain the responsibility of a single national institution.20
C. Economic and Financial Policies
Fiscal policy
22.
There was general agreement among the governments that the fiscal deficits
observed over the past four years were not sustainable. At the same time, the authorities
claimed that the development needs of the country made cuts in government expenditure
difficult to justify politically. The authorities therefore reiterated the need for external
financial assistance, including debt relief under the HIPC Initiative.
23.
The Union government emphasized that during 2003 it had made a serious
attempt to curtail the fiscal deficit through revenue and expenditure measures.
However, dissatisfaction with tight fiscal policies and the continued accumulation of salary
arrears had resulted in a serious threat of strikes, so that the government had been forced to
allow for two administrative step increases in civil service wages (which had been frozen
since 1994), implying an almost 9 percent increase in the wage bill of government excluding
Anjouan. The authorities stressed that they had rejected more costly demands, and that the
freeze on hiring had been maintained. At the same time, the absence of sufficient donor
funding had forced the government to finance some critical investment projects from
domestic resources. On the revenue side, the introduction of surtaxes had in part been offset
by reduced taxes and profit transfers from the state-owned enterprises.21 As a result of all
these factors, the reduction in the deficit had been smaller than projected, and a large
accumulation of domestic and external payments arrears had once again been unavoidable.
The staff noted that the underlying financial situation of the government was further strained
by the growing deficit in the pension system, which suggested an actuarial imbalance that
needed to be addressed.22
24.
In 2003, the public finances in Anjouan benefited from a number of positive
exogenous developments and policy decisions. Among these, the authorities cited the
20

The staff also recommended that consideration be given to the proposals of the technical assistance mission
from the Fund’s Fiscal Affairs Department (“Comores: Options pour la décentralisation” by Luc Leruth,
Giorgio Brosio, and Alain D’Hoore; September 2002).

21

The financial performance of these enterprises was undermined mainly by higher fuel costs.

The authorities explained that some 10 percent of benefits currently went to former political officeholders
who had not been required to make contributions.

increase in economic activity in the island, supported by a stable political situation on the
island, and by favorable prices for its main export products. In addition, the government had
achieved a substantial improvement in revenue administration and collection, especially at
the customs office.
25.
Discussions on fiscal policy for 2004 focused on establishing a consolidated
budget compatible with fiscal and external debt sustainability. Draft budgets of the
Union and island governments provided to the staff implied an aggregate primary deficit of
4 percent of GDP, against 3 percent in 2003, and a further large accumulation of payments
arrears. Against this background, the staff proposed measures to achieve a small primary
surplus, which was needed for sustainability. While the authorities agreed in general that
every effort should be made to reduce the deficit, the discussions were complicated by the
continued call, especially by the government of Ngazidja, for a swift transfer of expenditure
competencies and civil service staff to the islands. In the event, it was agreed that the starting
point for any budgetary arbitrage in the course of 2004 should be a prudent consolidated
budget, and that decisions about decentralization of fiscal operations and the civil service
should be made within this framework. To that end, the staff called on the authorities to
establish and maintain a close consultation process.
26.
On the revenue side, reforms are needed in both tax policy and administration.
In the short term, measures should focus on strengthening revenue administration and
eliminating discretionary exemptions, especially at the customs office of the Union
government. For the longer term, a fundamental tax reform will be needed to simplify and
streamline the tax system, which currently comprises 19 tax categories for shared revenues
and 14 categories for local taxes. To that end, the staff urged the authorities to seek technical
assistance from the Fund. At the same time, the staff recommended that the surtax on rice,
which is earmarked to the university project of the Union government, be eliminated in two
stages in 2004.23 Together, these measures are estimated to increase domestic revenue from
15.9 percent of GDP in 2003 to 16.4 percent in 2004.
27.
On the expenditure side, there is a need to improve administrative efficiency,
restrain current expenditure, and scale down investment projects. For the combined
Union and Ngazidja/Mohéli governments, the staff proposed to limit the change in the wage
bill to the full-year effect of the two step increases granted in 2003. This would require that
the additional employment for the establishment of new administrations be fully offset by
reductions in the wage bill of the Union government. For Anjouan, a further consolidation of
the payroll would be necessary, leading to some additional savings.24 Moreover, the
23

The revenue effects of this action are expected to be compensated by improved tax administration and the
introduction of surtaxes on tobacco and alcohol in Anjouan, in line with the practice in the other islands.

24

The Anjouan authorities agreed that, following the dramatic rise in employment of about 60 percent
during 1997-2002, there was scope for efficiency gains and cuts in staff. However, they pointed out that
employment increased mainly in the education sector, which was a high priority.

- 14 -

authorities agreed that, in the current financial situation, spending on goods and services
would need to be reduced significantly from the initial proposals. Similarly, they concurred
with the need to scale down a number of low-priority investment projects of the Union
government, and to cover the outlays on the elections and the initial establishment of new
political institutions with resources from the donor trust fund. However, they attributed a
high priority to the university project, for which the staff had recommended a gradual phasein, following a thorough evaluation of its viability and longer-term need.
28.
On the basis of the above discussions, an indicative budget for the consolidated
government was developed that resulted in a small primary surplus. Under this budget,
the public finances are in balance for the combined Union and Ngazidja/Mohéli governments
(Table 3) and display a small surplus for Anjouan (0.4 percent of GDP). The staff
recommended using this surplus for the resumption of at least partial debt-service payments
to those creditors who have not been paid in recent years.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
29.
There was general agreement that membership of the Comoros in the franc
zone had provided the country with a firm nominal anchor and had contributed to low
inflation. Regarding external competitiveness, the recent appreciation of the Comorian franc
in step with the euro was not seen as posing a significant problem, particularly taking into
account the very strong increases in world market prices for the main export products.25
Financial sector development
30.
The financial sector in the Comoros is small and so far has made only a limited
contribution to economic development.26 This remains an ongoing concern of the
authorities and has resulted in a number of initiatives to strengthen competition and broaden
the availability of financial services, including in rural communities. In particular,
microfinance institutions were introduced in 1997 and have enjoyed a rapid expansion,
accounting for a share in deposits and lending of close to 20 percent in 2003. Additional
proposals include the granting of commercial banking licenses to the Comoros Development
Bank (BDC) and the National Savings Bank (CNE).
31.
The staff welcomed the intentions of the authorities to increase competition and
broaden financial services but felt that any actions in these areas should be
accompanied by measures to safeguard stability and soundness. In particular, the staff
supported the central bank’s decision to (i) issue only a limited license to the BDC for a test
period of one year, given that it had failed in the past and concerns persist about its
25

Since 1998, export prices for vanilla have increased by more than 200 percent, those for cloves by more than
500 percent, and those for ylang-ylang by about 40 percent. These developments also make it easy to absorb the
export taxes imposed on these products.

- 15 -

management capacity; (ii) insist on a clear separation of the balance sheet and financial
operations of the CNE from the postal and telecommunications operations of the National
Post Office (SNPT) as a precondition for granting a broader commercial banking license;
(iii) require the CNE to comply with the domestic banking law and international prudential
standards; and (iv) bring the microfinance institutions under the supervisory authority of the
central bank. The central bank has made good progress in establishing a credible regulatory
framework, including on money laundering, but requires additional technical assistance and
human resources to effectively conduct supervision, including by way of on-site inspections.
External sector policies
32.
While there are virtually no quantitative trade restrictions, tariff levels in the
Comoros are relatively high by international and African standards.27 At the time of the
last evaluation in 2001, the Comoros had an average tariff rate of 38.9 percent and was rated
8 on the 10-point trade restrictiveness scale, with 10 being the most restrictive. The degree of
restrictiveness has increased further as a result of the import duties on cars and the surtaxes
on rice, tobacco, and alcohol introduced in mid-2003. The authorities explained that virtually
all tariffs had been introduced for revenue purposes and had no protectionist character, given
the virtual absence of local production of most goods concerned. The staff proposed to
eventually replace—within the general tax reform discussed above—most import tariffs by a
broad-based consumption tax combined with selected excises. This would simplify the
revenue systems and also permit the Comoros to remain in step with the objectives of
COMESA.
33.
The authorities confirmed that no new exchange measures on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions had been introduced
since the last consultation. They doubted that a liberalization of capital transactions would
lead to either more foreign investment or large capital outflows.
34.
As noted above, the external debt of the Comoros is not sustainable and has
resulted in a continued accumulation of external payments arrears. An update of a debt
sustainability analysis conducted jointly by the Fund and the World Bank in 2001 suggests
that the net present value (NPV) of the external debt increased to 503 percent of exports of
goods and nonfactor services in 2003, compared with 305 percent envisaged in the
original 2001 exercise.28 In terms of domestic revenue, the ratio improved from 545 percent

27

For a detailed analysis of these issues, see the selected issues paper on “External Sector Developments and
Policies.”

28

The principal reasons for this increase are the effects on NPV of (i) new loans (US$15.8 million); (ii) the
inclusion of previously unknown postal debt (US$7.7 million); (iii) the depreciation of the dollar, which raises
the value of nondollar denominated debt (US$14.2 million); and (iv) the decline in the discount rate
(US$15 million).

- 16 -

to 420 percent, reflecting mainly the inclusion of the revenues of Anjouan and the effects of
the recent appreciation of the Comorian franc against the U.S. dollar.
Structural policies
35.
The functioning of the economy is impaired by structural rigidities and
inefficiencies. The staff reiterated its call for the design of policies to encourage private
sector development. In particular, the legal system should be streamlined and existing laws
and regulations strictly enforced. In addition, the staff urged the authorities to review
producer prices for some key export products, which, despite high world market prices, have
not been set at levels sufficiently attractive to expand production; and to foster competition
among exporters and intermediaries.
36.
Economic development in the Comoros has often been slowed by the poor
performance of the public utilities. The staff welcomed the increased attention placed by
the authorities on this matter, including new investments to expand electricity capacity and
recent measures to reduce illegal electricity use and strengthen the collection of bills.
However, additional steps are needed to achieve greater efficiency and improve financial
performance. Moreover, financial reports and audits should be required of all public
enterprises on a regular basis to increase accountability.
37.
The poor state of statistics severely undermines the authorities’ capacity to
design and implement sound policies; it also impairs the ability of the private sector to
make informed decisions. More generally, there is a need for increased transparency and
accountability at all levels of government.
IV. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
38.
The economic outlook for 2004 is expected to be dominated by reduced
government spending and a favorable external environment. The reduction of
government spending in line with the objective of a small consolidated primary surplus will
result in a substantial withdrawal of fiscal stimulus. However, growth will remain supported
by fairly stable demand and high prices for the Comoros’s traditional agricultural export
products, and the stronger euro will continue to contain imported inflation. Real GDP growth
is projected at 1.8 percent in 2004, while inflation is expected to drop to 3.5 percent. The
external current account deficit (including official transfers) is projected to narrow to
2.2 percent of GDP, in part because of grant financing under the donor trust fund. There is a
risk that the political process will not be without disruptions, and it is unlikely that the
outstanding issues of power sharing and economic and financial management competencies
will be fully resolved. As a result, the inefficiencies associated with uncoordinated policies
will continue to hamper economic growth and development.
39.
The medium-term economic outlook hinges critically on whether confidence can
be restored within a stable political environment. In addition, it depends on the
effectiveness of economic policies, which will be conditioned by the specific arrangements
for decentralization and the degree of cooperation for their implementation. As a small island

- 17 -

economy dependent on a few export products, the Comoros will remain vulnerable to
external shocks. Against this backdrop, the staff prepared two scenarios to illustrate the
stakes confronting the authorities at this juncture (Box 3).29
40.
The low-growth scenario assumes that the power struggle between the Union
and island governments cannot be resolved, and that economic policies remain
uncoordinated. In this case, private sector investment and activities will continue to be
affected by the uncertain economic and political environment. Apart from the traditional
export products, agricultural production will remain largely concentrated in subsistence
activities and the small local markets. Public sector activities would be constrained by the
absence of budgetary assistance from the donor community and limited domestic financial
resources. As a result, medium-term growth is expected to average 1–2 percent a year, which
would imply further reductions in real per capita income. The fiscal balance is likely to be
dominated by the constraints imposed by low domestic revenues, and domestic and external
payments arrears would continue to build up. The external current account is expected to
benefit from the increases in remittances typically associated with hard times. External debt
sustainability in terms of exports of goods and nonfactor services will deteriorate again
from 2006 onward, when the cyclical effects of the strong improvement in terms of trade
wear out. In addition, a large share of fiscal revenues will have to be spent on debt service.30
41.
Under the high-growth scenario, cooperative decentralization arrangements and
coherent economic policies are assumed to stimulate private investment and donor
assistance in support of economic development and poverty reduction. In this
environment, real GDP growth can rise to levels of 4–5 percent a year, thus permitting
satisfactory increases in per capita income. At the same time, the fiscal situation will
strengthen on account of larger aid flows and a better performance of domestic revenues,
owing to reforms in the tax system and its administration. The primary fiscal balance is
projected to display surpluses, albeit moderate, which would permit moving toward debt
sustainability. In terms of domestic revenues, the debt-service burden would become
significantly lighter than under the low-growth scenario, thus allowing for larger government
spending on human and physical capital.

29

The preparation of a medium-term macroeconomic outlook and the updating of the debt sustainability
analysis of 2001 were beset by a number of difficulties, including, in particular, the lack of timely and reliable
data.

30

Even under the low-growth scenario, the ratios of external debt to GDP and external debt and debt service to
domestic revenue decline over the medium term because of the extremely limited access to external financing.

V. PROGRAM ISSUES
42.
The authorities at all levels of government expressed a strong interest in a Fundsupported program.31 The staff explained that the negotiation of a program that could be
supported by a PRGF arrangement would have to be preceded by the establishment of a solid
record of policy implementation under an SMP.32 The staff indicated that discussions on an
SMP could begin once assurances on the following had been obtained:
•

adequate cooperation between governments under the Transition Agreement;

•

progress toward the establishment of a consolidated national budget; and

•

regular transmittal of key economic information for an appropriate monitoring of an
SMP.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL

43.
The power struggle between the Union and island governments about
competencies and resources has created uncertainties that affected adversely economic
developments in the Comoros during 2003. The difficult political environment has
prevented the design and implementation of coherent economic policies for the country as a
whole; has brought to a virtual standstill structural reforms; and has undermined the
confidence of investors and donors alike. As a result, real per capita income has declined, and
little progress has been made toward reducing poverty. In addition, the country has incurred
fiscal and external balances that are not compatible with the achievement of debt
sustainability.
44.
Looking ahead, the Comoros faces the challenge of moving forward with
political and economic arrangements conducive to the restoration of confidence. A first
step toward this objective must be the full implementation of the Transition Agreement of
December 20, 2003 and the related understandings reached in the context of the
Harmonization Committee. This applies in particular to the adjustments in the revenuesharing formula, the joint administration of the customs office, and the transfer of spending
competencies and civil service staff to the island governments. The establishment of a close

31

The poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) process was launched a few years ago. An Interim-PRSP was
presented in July 2002 and received favorable comments in a joint memorandum to the authorities by the Fund,
World Bank, UNDP, European Union, and France, regarding the areas of poverty assessment, design of
economic reform, and participatory process. The document will have to be updated with respect to the new
decentralization arrangements.

32

The World Bank is not considering program assistance at present. Instead, on March 11, 2004, its Board
approved a Transitional Support Strategy, which focuses on limited financial support for local service delivery
and assistance by building knowledge and empowering the civil society. The latter is to be fostered through a
strengthening of analytical capacity, technical assistance in governance, and support for the PRSP process.

- 20 -

consultation process and a reliable exchange of information will be indispensable in this
context.
45.
The objective for 2004 must be to conduct coordinated and coherent fiscal
policies that are compatible with debt sustainability. In particular, the consolidated budget
for 2004 should aim at a small primary surplus and the avoidance of additional domestic
payments arrears, while limiting the accumulation of external arrears. On the revenue side,
this will require a significant strengthening of tax and customs administration, including
through the removal of exemptions. On the expenditure side, it will be critically important to
avoid overlapping and duplication of spending because of unresolved questions about
expenditure competencies and decentralization of the civil service. In case of divergent
views, the status quo should prevail, and no new administrative arrangements or institutions
should be installed until a permanent decision is taken by the new National Assembly.
46.
In the absence of budgetary assistance, and given the limits for domestic
financing, the room for public expenditure increases will be extremely limited in 2004.
Every effort must therefore be made to control the increase in the government wage bill by
removing nonpriority staff and maintaining the freeze on hiring and step increases. In
addition, spending on goods and services should be tightly controlled, and capital spending
should be limited to economic infrastructure, leaving the bulk of spending on democratic
institutions and processes to the donor trust fund. While the establishment of a university
may be seen as a priority, the project should be phased in gradually following a careful
analysis of its viability. Debt service should be resumed vis-à-vis the creditors who have not
been paid lately, including the African Development Bank group.
47.
Decisions about decentralization must ensure the conduct of coherent and
financially sound economic policies for the country as a whole. In the area of fiscal
policy, this will require the establishment of a budget process for all levels of government
that aims to keep the consolidated budget deficit within prudent and sustainable limits. The
prime responsibility and independence of the central bank in the areas of monetary, exchange
rate, and financial sector policies constitute a key requirement for sound decisions and should
be confirmed. In the area of trade policy, the most urgent task is to achieve a full
harmonization of external tariff rates between the Union and Anjouan.
48.
An appropriate balance will have to be struck between the decentralization
objectives of the constitution and the effectiveness and affordability of institutions.
Given the limited human and financial resources of the Comoros, the country must avoid
overlap and duplication, and should seek the full exploitation of economies of scale in
economic management. In this regard, consideration should be given to a common
independent revenue authority, a National Statistics Office, and, possibly, a joint
administration for the monitoring and payment of civil service wages and salaries.
49.
Fiscal reforms are urgently needed on both the revenue and expenditure sides.
The outdated and complex tax system should be replaced by a simple, easy-to-administer
system that improves economic incentives, increases collection efficiency, and permits a

- 21 -

smoother revenue-sharing process. In addition, consideration should be given to the
replacement of most customs tariffs by a broad-based consumption tax. Budget preparation,
implementation, and monitoring mechanisms will need to ensure an effective decentralized
government and improved expenditure control, and should achieve greater transparency and
accountability. The Fund could provide technical support in both the revenue and
expenditure areas. Finally, the actuarial balance of the pension system should be assessed to
prevent a further accumulation of contingent liabilities to the government.
50.
Membership of the Comoros in the franc zone has served the country well and
should be maintained in the future. The arrangements in place have provided the country
with a firm monetary anchor and tight limits on monetary financing of fiscal deficits, and
have contributed to low inflation. These results have been particularly helpful during the
frequent periods of political uncertainty.
51.
The intentions of the authorities to broaden the availability of financial services
and to introduce more competition are welcome. However, assurances are needed that the
new institutions or services will be supported by qualified staff and appropriate capitalization
to ensure their stability and viability. In addition, to prevent financial crises and/or the
improper conduct of business, international norms of prudential regulation and supervision
should be applied and strictly enforced. The central bank should be given supervisory
authority over microfinance institutions without delay. The measures taken by the authorities
to prevent money laundering appear to be appropriate and should be implemented decisively.
52.
Structural policies need to concentrate on the provision of appropriate incentives
for private sector development and the strengthening of the performance of the public
enterprises. A correction of incentives is especially needed in the main export sectors, where
remunerative producer prices are essential to raise production to the country’s potential and
lower production costs through a broader exploitation of economies of scale. In addition, all
public enterprises need to substantially strengthen their efficiency and financial performance.
53.
Substantial improvements in statistics and the transparency and accountability
of the various governments are urgently needed, including in public enterprises.
Measures to that end will have to underpin better economic and financial management and
permit improved decision making in the public and private sectors. They are also
indispensable for a cooperative and successful management of decentralized government.
54.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with the Comoros be held on
the standard 12-month cycle.

APPENDIX II

Comoros: IMF-World Bank Group Relations
(As of March 17, 2003)
1. The World Bank Executive Board has approved 19 IDA credits totaling
US$132.4 million to support the Comoros since the World Bank became active in the
country in 1976. The current active portfolio consists of two projects supporting social
sectors (health and social fund), with a total commitment of US$19.9 million, and
undisbursed balances of US$1.7 million. Both projects are scheduled to close by the end of
fiscal year (FY) 04. The Bank presented a Transitional Support Strategy Update (TSSU) to
the Board of Directors in March 2004. This strategy update for the next 18 to 24 months has
two key objectives: (i) maintaining basic social services; and (ii) supporting the process of
national reconciliation and facilitating the transition to a viable institutional structure. A new
lending operation was approved in conjunction with the strategy. This community-based
Social Services Project (SSP) seeks to maintain service delivery and addresses most urgent
health and water sector needs. The SSP is a four-year operation in the amount of
US$13.3 million.
2. Together with the IMF and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the
World Bank assisted the government of Comoros in the official launch of the Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) process in March 2002. Its aim is to formulate a mediumterm development strategy for the country. A first draft of the interim PRSP was completed
in July 2002 and validated by Comorian stakeholders in all three islands in May 2003.
However, the political uncertainty prevailing in the Comoros in the past months has put most
reform efforts to a halt, blocked the implementation of the poverty reduction strategy, and
undermined its relevance. With the resumption of the peace process and upcoming Initiative
for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative deadlines, the PRSP process should
gather renewed momentum. A Joint Staff Assessment (JSA) is to take place in 2004 if the
Comoros is to reach the decision point before the initiative’s sunset clause.
3.
Since the signing of a national reconciliation agreement in December 2003, the
Bank has worked in close collaboration with the Fund to support the transition in the
Comoros, in particular the creation of viable economic institutions and a consolidated budget.
If the reconciliation process proves sustainable, the Bank will continue to work closely
together with the Fund in these areas.
4. The Bank has also been supporting the privatization process through a technical
assistance project. Port services (SOCOPOTRAM) were privatized in November 2001, and
a private operator was installed in the port of Moroni in July 2002, albeit with continuing
difficulties.
5. The IFC does not have any activity in the Comoros, and the country has not yet joined
the MIGA.

APPENDIX III

Comoros: Statistical Issues
Overview
Although the situation has improved somewhat since end-1998, the statistical database in the
Comoros remains seriously deficient in most sectors, complicating the formulation and
monitoring of economic and financial policies. The situation has been compounded in recent
years by disruptions in the civil service and staffing inadequacies. In view of these
difficulties, considerable work is required to improve the statistical base. The authorities have
requested a Statistics Department (STA) multitopic technical assistance mission, which is
under consideration, that could lay the groundwork for a thorough revamping of the
statistical system.
National accounts data and prices
The main aggregates of the national accounts for 1986–89, as well as the accounts for 1990
and rough estimates for 1991–93, were prepared by the World Bank; the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) assisted with the preparation of the national accounts
for 1994 and 1995. Thereafter, the national accounts were computed using extrapolations and
contain serious methodological errors. There is little specific information on the level of
economic activity, which complicates the formulation of sectoral policies. In addition, no
comprehensive consumer price index was compiled during 1990 and 1991. The Statistics
Department of the Ministry of Planning resumed price surveys in 1992. An AFRISTAT
mission in 1998 has suggested updating the consumer basket using a 1995 household survey;
however, recent developments in the Comoros have seriously outdated this survey, and the
reference prices used in the price index are largely unrepresentative.
Fiscal data
In the public finance sector, data are now presented on both a commitment and cash basis,
but the identification and monitoring of domestic arrears remain difficult. The institutional
setup to compile regular, comprehensive overviews of budgetary developments is weak, and
such information is available only on an ad hoc basis and with considerable effort. Data on
the financial operations of public enterprises lack transparency and timeliness. The latest data
provided for publication in the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) Yearbook are for 1987.
The Comoros International Financial Statistics (IFS) page does not contain government
finance data.
Monetary data
There has been improvement in the timeliness of reporting monetary data for publication in
IFS. The authorities are now reporting data to STA with a lag of one-two months instead of
four months. However, the lag increased to three months over the recent period. In 1997, an
STA mission to the Comoros reviewed the compilation and reporting of money and banking

- 39 -

APPENDIX III

statistics, and made several recommendations to improve classification, coverage, and
reporting procedures. Due to serious differences and errors in classification, IFS and central
bank data differed significantly for major monetary aggregates prior to 1997.
External sector statistics
The latest balance of payments data available to STA pertain to 1995. Balance of payments
data are prepared by the central bank with considerable delay. Data relating to capital inflows
are sketchy, and the external debt database has not been maintained since 1994.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
April 30, 2004
This statement provides additional information that has become available since the
circulation of the staff report (April 16, 2004). It includes the results of the recent island
and national assembly elections, the implementation of the Transition Agreement of
December 20, 2003, and recent economic developments. The new information does not
alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
•

Elections for the island assemblies in March 2004 resulted in a large majority for the
opposition parties supporting the island presidents, which ran against President Azali
Assoumani’s coalition of Coordination pour le renouveau des Comores (CRC). The
opposition also won the elections for the Union Assembly on April 18 and 25, 2004.
These results make it probable that the opposition parties will enjoy a 2/3 majority in
the Union Assembly, which would permit them to pass the needed by-laws to the
constitution, as well as the national budget, with the likelihood of a stronger emphasis
on decentralization and financial autonomy of the islands. President Azali’s mandate
ends in April 2006.

•

Implementation of the agreements of the Harmonization Committee described in the
staff report appears to have met with considerable difficulty. In its meeting during
April 12-14, 2004, the “Follow-Up Committee” (Comité de Suivi) noted that the
Union government had “unilaterally circumvented the revenue and expenditure
circuits.” In response, the government of Anjouan suspended its participation in the
Harmonization Committee and stopped its transfers of revenues to the central bank’s
shared revenue account established for the distribution of these revenues.

•

Revenues transferred by the various governments to the central bank’s shared revenue
account amounted to FC 2.4 billion during the first quarter of 2004. This is
substantially less than the amount expected on the basis of projections for the first
half of the year. The reasons for this development are not yet clear.

•

Very little information has become available on economic developments during the
first months of 2004, as the process of organizing a regular flow of information has
met with considerable implementation problems. Data on the consumer price index
(CPI) indicate that the year-on-year inflation rate has increased to 7.3 percent in
March 2004.

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with the Union of the Comoros
On April 30, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Union of the Comoros.33
Background
Following a number of secessionist moves since independence in 1974, Comoros34 overwhelmingly
approved a new constitution in December 2001. The constitution provides for wide-ranging autonomy
to the islands, but relies on the establishment of by-laws for the definition of specific decentralization
arrangements, including on financial autonomy and the civil service. A number of attempts in 2002
and 2003 to establish such by-laws failed to produce universally accepted results. However, on
December 20, 2003, a Transition Agreement on elections and critical arrangements for economic
management was reached under the auspices of the African Union. The agreement is strongly
supported by the international community and has given rise to the establishment of a multidonor trust
fund for the implementation of the transitional arrangements.

33

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and
discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the
staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of
the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

34

The Comoros consist of the islands of Ngazidja—formerly Grande Comore—(about 272,000 inhabitants)
with the capital Moroni; Anjouan (245,000); and Mohéli (32,000).

-2-

Implementation of the Transition Agreement has proved to be difficult despite extensive discussions
on the modalities and the definition of actions to be taken by the Union and island governments. In
addition, the elections held for the island assemblies in March and the national assembly in April
2004 diverted attention from the task of implementing coherent budget policies, including actions on
the contentious issue of revenue sharing.
Economic developments during 2003 were adversely affected by the difficult relationship between the
Union and island governments. The related disputes about competencies and resources prevented
the design and implementation of coherent economic policies, brought to a virtual standstill structural
reforms, and undermined confidence at home and abroad, with adverse consequences for private
investment and foreign aid. As a result, the Comoros’ real per capita income declined for the sixth
year in a row. Inflation increased from 3.3 percent in 2002 to 4.5 percent in 2003, notwithstanding a
sizable strengthening of the Comorian franc. The rise in inflation was mainly related to increases in
import duties on selected commodities introduced by the Union government. The external current
account benefited from a sizable improvement in the terms of trade but declines in tourism receipts
and official and private transfers in the event led to a widening of the external current account deficit
(including official transfers) from 2.3 percent of GDP in 2002 to 4.4 percent in 2003. However, at
some 11 months of imports of goods and services, the Comoros’ foreign reserves position is still at a
comfortable level.
Fiscal policies resulted in a primary deficit for the consolidated Union and island governments of
3 percent of GDP in 2003, compared with 4 percent in 2002, while a primary surplus would have
been required for a move toward sustainability. The external debt, at more than 500 percent of
exports of goods and services in net present value terms, is not sustainable. It has been
accompanied by a continued accumulation of payments arrears. The establishment of a prudent
consolidated national budget for 2003 failed because of continued disputes between governments
about revenue sharing and the delineation of expenditure competencies. The Union government,
being confronted with the threat of strikes, granted two step increases in the salary scales for civil
servants, which had been frozen since 1994. It also undertook a number of investments in economic
infrastructure. The consolidated fiscal deficit was in part raised as a result of the attempt by the
Ngazidja government to establish its own administration without having reached an agreement with
the Union on the transfer of competencies. In contrast, fiscal policy in Anjouan produced a small
surplus (permitting the repayment of some salary arrears) mainly because of a significant
strengthening of revenue administration and collection.
Monetary policy remained narrowly circumscribed by the Comoros’ membership in the franc zone
and the related fixed exchange rate vis-à-vis the euro. These arrangements have provided a firm
monetary anchor for the country and imposed a coherent framework on the management and
operations of the central bank, including a strict limit on lending to government.
While there are virtually no quantitative trade restrictions, tariff levels on imports in the Comoros are
relatively high by international and African standards, with an average tariff rate of 38.9 percent in
2001. The rate has increased further as a result of the import duties on cars and the surtaxes on rice,
tobacco, and alcohol that were introduced in mid-2003. However, given the virtual absence of local
production of most goods concerned, virtually all tariffs serve revenue purposes and are not an
expression of protectionist policies of the government.

-3-

Executive Board Assessment
Directors noted that political tensions between the Union and island governments have disrupted the
implementation of macro-economic policies and structural reforms. As a result, the economic
performance of the Comoros has remained below its potential, and little progress has been made
toward reducing poverty. Directors underscored the urgency of pursuing a coherent strategy for the
economic development of the country, and hoped this would be facilitated soon by the resolution of
the political difficulties.
Directors urged that the Transition Agreement of December 20, 2003 be fully implemented to achieve
the decentralization objectives of the new constitution. They noted that, in the economic area, this
would require adherence to the undertakings on revenue sharing, effective joint administration of the
customs office, and gradual transfer of competencies and civil service staff to the island
governments.
Directors called on the authorities to pursue fiscal policies compatible with debt sustainability. To that
effect, they stressed the need for close cooperation between Union and island administrations on the
basis of a transparent budget process and information sharing. Directors felt that fiscal policy should
aim at achieving a balanced position for the consolidated public finances. In this context, they
emphasized the need to advance with structural reforms in tax policy, tax administration, and
expenditure management. On the revenue side, this will require a substantial strengthening of
revenue administration and widening of the tax base. Directors therefore stressed the need to move
toward a simpler and more efficient tax system and to streamline tax administration. In this
connection, they encouraged the authorities to eliminate discretionary import tariff exemptions and to
consider replacing import tariffs by a broad-based consumption tax. On the expenditure side,
Directors urged tight expenditure control to avoid duplication of spending by the different levels of
government. They saw no room for increases in wages, and advised the authorities to focus
expenditure on areas of high priority with the aim of achieving the Millennium Development Goals.
Directors urged the authorities to ensure that decentralization is consistent with sound economic
management for the country as a whole. They noted that, given the country’s limited human and
financial resources, attainment of this objective will require the development of effective and
affordable economic institutions. They therefore encouraged the authorities to establish central
economic management institutions to exploit economies of scale, particularly in revenue
administration, public administration and statistics. Directors also stressed that institutional
arrangements will have to be developed to guide the budget process and ensure the implementation
of common external sector policies. In this connection, Directors encouraged the authorities to
harmonize external tariffs between the Union and Anjouan. They also supported technical assistance
from the Fund to help build capacity in economic management—particularly to establish a well
designed and integrated budget process and to implement revenue and expenditure reforms.
Directors were of the view that membership of the Comoros in the franc zone has served the country
well and should be maintained. Above all, it has provided a firm monetary anchor, curtailed the scope
for inflationary financing, and contributed to low inflation. Directors encouraged trade liberalization in
line with the objectives of the regional grouping, COMESA.

Directors welcomed the central bank’s efforts to enforce and strengthen prudential regulation and
supervision. They supported plans to develop a competitive financial sector, but cautioned that
measures taken in this area must not compromise financial sector stability and soundness. Directors
urged the authorities to promulgate legislation giving the central bank supervisory authority over
microfinance institutions.
Directors believed that economic performance could be significantly improved by relying on private
initiative and increasing the efficiency of public enterprises. They called for a review of the process of
setting producer prices for the country’s main export products to ensure that adequate incentives are
in place for increasing production in areas where the country possesses a comparative advantage.
Regarding public enterprises, Directors welcomed recent measures to reduce the illegal use of
electricity and strengthen the collection of utility bills. Nevertheless, they considered that much more
is needed to improve the performance of public enterprises, including better internal controls and the
production of regular financial reports.
Directors expressed concern about continued weaknesses in the compilation and dissemination of
statistics. They urged the authorities to establish a national statistics office and an efficient statistical
system to ensure the production and dissemination of accurate and timely data. In addition, Directors
called for increased accountability and transparency at all levels of government.
Directors encouraged the Comorian authorities to make efforts to improve economic management,
including the establishment of a consolidated budget and strengthening of data collection and
reporting to the Fund, so as to be able to move ahead with early discussion on a staff-monitored
program.

Public Information Notices (PINs) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the
conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the
public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member
countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF's assessment of these policies; and (ii) following
policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board.
