EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: The financial sector and the currency board arrangement weathered the 2008
global turmoil well but an already severe recession will be deepened by the global crisis. The
demand decline has shrunk the external current account deficit, ended the credit boom and
cooled the property market. But the recession is presenting a stiff challenge to labor market
flexibility, fiscal management and banks’ profitability. Moreover wage growth has been
outpacing productivity,undermining profits and competitiveness.
Outlook: Weak domestic and global demand will lead to a severe contraction in 2009 and–
assuming a global recovery—a slow recovery in 2010. The severity of the contraction and the
timing of the recovery are uncertain because of the unsettled external environment and lags in
the wage response.
External stability: The real exchange rate is somewhat overvalued but external imbalances
have shrunk. External risks are being mitigated by the slower growth of foreign-funded credit
and a strengthened framework to contain liquidity risk.
Policy advice: Policy discussions focused on the fiscal stance, financial sector resilience and
labor market flexibility. On fiscal policy, large expenditure increases over the past two years
are unsustainable and leave little room for countercyclical measures which would anyway be
of only modest impact. More important is to limit the run-down of the government’s liquidity
buffers in order to maintain support for the currency board, adhere to the Maastricht deficit
ceiling and move gradually to a structural surplus that would support the overarching target
of “balance or better” through the business cycle. The mission supported plans to freeze the
government wage bill for 2009-10, nudging the economy towards wage restraint. On the
financial sector, staff agreed that a key objective should be euro adoption, to reduce
vulnerability to financial turbulence. The mission welcomed the authorities’ decision to
implement the main recommendations of the FSAP-update mission, notably to strengthen
crisis management frameworks. Staff supported government’s efforts to increase labor
market flexibility while improving social safety nets.
Authorities’ position: The authorities were confident that the economy’s flexibility would
facilitate a recovery. They reaffirmed their commitment to euro adoption and to fiscal balance
or surpluses over the medium term.
Mission: Discussions were held in May and December 2008. The team comprised
Franek Rozwadowski (Head), Nada Choueiri, Anastassios Gagales, Mark Lutz (all EUR),
Pedro Rodriguez (SPR), and Steven Seelig (MCM).

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Estonia is facing its most severe recession since the early 1990’s. The downturn
started as the reversal, in early 2007, of a credit-driven domestic boom and gained
momentum from the global financial crisis and a collapse in domestic confidence. The
recession is reducing domestic and external imbalances but its pace and depth have created
large budget deficits and are putting pressure on private sector balance sheets. The
consultation focused on the macroeconomic outlook, domestic and external financial sector
vulnerabilities, and policy options for the difficult times ahead.
Box 1. Implementation of Fund Policy Advice
Relations between Estonia and the Fund have been excellent. While policy implementation has
been characterized by a high degree of ownership, which has been key to Estonia’s economic
success, the authorities report that their decisions have benefited considerably from Fund
advice. Indeed, their policies have generally been consistent with such advice. A case in point is
the adoption of the key recommendations of the 2008 FSAP update. However, in 2007-2008,
large increases in expenditure, counter to Fund advice, resulted in structural fiscal policy
loosening.

Like the upswing, the downturn was driven by domestic demand (Figure 4).
Investment sagged in 2007 when Estonia’s two largest banks—both subsidiaries of Swedish
banking groups—curtailed lending in response to a heightened awareness of risks in their
large Baltic exposures. Subsequently the global liquidity crunch in 2007-08 led to a repricing
of risk—CDS spreads, interest rate premia and forward premia all rose and Swedish banks’
share prices declined

4.
The recession has sharply reduced the external current account deficit (Figure 7).
After swelling to 18 percent in 2007, the deficit receded to an estimated 10 percent in 2008,
the lowest in six years. The main factor was the trade balance: imports were pulled down by
domestic demand while exports increased modestly, owing to an improvement in prices and a
recovery of oil transit trade. A second factor was the decline in profits paid to foreign-owned
companies and banks. Competitiveness is being eroded—the nominal ULC-based real
exchange rate is appreciating rapidly but the real ULC-based measure shows a much more
moderate appreciation.1 Indeed, Estonia’s market share of world exports has increased only
modestly in recent years, unlike the impressive gains registered in 2002–04.
5.
Inflation, which hit an eleven-year high in early-2008, is coming down rapidly
(Figure 4). As in the other Baltic countries, inflation has exceeded the euro area average,
reflecting temporary factors and convergence dynamics (Box 2). Inflation rose in 2007
mainly because of external shocks (from food and fuel) and one-off domestic shocks (from
administered prices and indirect taxes); it subsequently declined as the external shocks were
reversed.2 At the same time, core inflation, which accelerated during the boom, is
decelerating as the economy weakens.
6.
Labor market conditions were tight until late 2008 but there are signs of rapid
easing. Real wage growth still exceeds productivity growth, compressing profits relative to
their strong 2006–07 level, but nominal wage growth has slowed from more than 20 percent a
year in 2007 to about 15 percent in mid-2008. Wage growth in construction has collapsed and
there are reports of cancelled or reduced wage bonuses in other sectors. And, after eight years
of declines, the unemployment rate jumped by more than 2 percentage points in the third
quarter of 2008 (Figure 8). Other signs of easing include declining vacancies, increased
layoffs, and enterprise surveys (Figure 9) that put labor shortages at the bottom of the list of
factors hindering business activity.

1

The real ULC is the ULC deflated by the producer price index. A constant real ULC in the face of an
appreciating nominal ULC suggests that profitability is sustained by the capacity to charge higher prices,
perhaps because of a shift to higher value-added goods.

2

The authorities frontloaded the adjustment of excises and administrative prices in order to ease the way to
meeting the Maastricht criterion when other inflationary impulses fade.

Box 2. Inflation in Estonia and the EU
Estonia’s inflation has diverged from the EU
average despite the currency peg because of
convergence, differences in cyclical positions and
energy and food prices.
As in the other Baltic countries, energy prices
accelerated following the renegotiation of long-term
contracts, the linking of gas prices to oil prices and
the increase in excises towards EU-mandated levels.
Food prices, which are still well below EU average,
have been catching up. Finally, the weights of
energy and food in HICPs are substantially higher in
Estonia than EU-wide. This alone accounts for
2 percentage points of the Estonia-EU inflation
differential.

The financial sector withstood last year’s global financial turbulence well, but
risks remain elevated. Since 95 percent of the banking sector (by assets) is owned by large
Nordic groups with centralized liquidity management, there is virtually no domestic money
market. Estonian subsidiaries and branches were kept liquid—if at high prices—by their
parents who in turn benefited from liquidity support and guarantees by the home country
authorities. The resilience of the sector was tested twice in 2008. In October, a system-wide
run on a large regional bank affected its deposits in Estonia, which declined by 15 percent.
The episode caused little systemic damage because liquidity was provided by the parent
institution and the deposits moved to the local branch of another Nordic bank. Later in the
year, the banking sector was little affected by the crisis in Latvia. As regards capitalization,
banks’ buffers have been strengthened by high retained earnings (text table) and supported by
conservative regulatory limits.3 But banks face increasing risks: the mortgage boom has
reduced liquidity and asset quality is being eroded by the recession.

3

The regulatory CAR is 10 percent, higher than the 8 percent Basel requirement. The risk weight on mortgages
was 100 percent in 2006. It was reduced to 60 percent with Basel II implementation in 2008 but remains higher
than the 35 percent minimum risk weight required by the European Capital Requirements Directive.

Estonia’s track record of fiscal conservatism has been interrupted by large
expenditure increases. During 2001-06, expenditure ratios were the lowest in the EU. This
supported fiscal surpluses that distinguished Estonia from its Baltic neighbors (Figure 2) and,
built up a net asset position. But large structural expenditure increases (both the wage bill and
pensions rose a cumulative 24 percent in real terms in 2007-08) have pushed the fiscal
balance into deficit. For 2008 the impact was compounded by the recession, which helped
drive the deficit to an estimated 2.3 percent of GDP despite a supplementary budget featuring
expenditure cuts and asset sales. The cyclically-adjusted deficit was larger, nearly 3¼ percent
of GDP.

III. DISCUSSIONS
9.
The economic contraction is reducing Estonia’s imbalances, but new risks have
emerged. The deepening global recession will weaken Estonia’s export markets at a time
when wage growth has eroded competitiveness. The global credit crunch is restricting capital
inflows. The performance of banks’ assets will be stressed further by the domestic recession.
And the budget is heading towards large deficits unless there is a substantial adjustment.
Discussions focused on: the macroeconomic outlook and risks; fiscal and financial sector
challenges, with emphasis on policies to increase resilience to adverse macroeconomic
developments; and the contingency framework for the financial sector.
A. Macroeconomic Outlook and Risks
10.
The near-term outlook is uncertain. Growth is likely to recover only after further
wage deceleration has allowed a recovery of investment and exports, and higher saving has
restored households’ financial health. Also a recovery of the regional economies would be
needed to support exports and help restore consumer confidence. However, the global
outlook is uncertain and the wage response is difficult to predict although, as noted above,
there are signs that a labor market adjustment has began. Since flexible labor market
institutions (see Box 3) allow for a swift wage response, a rapid rebound is possible once the
global environment improves.
11.
In staff’s baseline scenario,4 the recession deepens in 2009, with recovery delayed
to 2010 (Table 4).
•

The global recession, weak domestic confidence, and a lagged wage adjustment
should push growth to -4 percent in 2009 (close to the Ministry of Finance’s 3½ percent). Consumption will fall as unemployment rises and households rebuild
financial buffers; investment and exports are constrained by reduced profits and
weaker domestic and external demand. The current account deficit should improve
sharply as low demand slows imports and weak profits reduce income payments.

•

The turnaround is projected to start in mid-2010, assuming the global economy
recovers. By then, all annual wage contracts will have been renegotiated and
accumulated household saving will have created a basis for increased consumption.

•

In the medium term, growth will be lower than in recent years because, with full
employment, the main drivers are investment and total factor productivity. Indeed,
productivity increases will be imperative: with real wages still converging to EU
levels, firms relying on low-wage labor will have to restructure or go bankrupt—a
process already underway. Staff projects that investment will eventually return to the

The baseline scenario incorporates the authorities’ announced policy to contain the deficit to at most the
Maastricht limit, assumed to take place through cuts in current expenditure.

16
2002 level while higher interest rates and the prospect of slowing growth will keep
the saving rate higher than before the boom. The current account deficit should settle
at about 9½ percent of GDP (Figure 10) and the debt ratio would stabilize, albeit at a
higher level.
12.
Assuming no further shocks, prices will decelerate sharply in 2009. The direct
impact of the one-off 2008 increases in excises and administrative prices will recede through
2009—vindicating the authorities’ decision to front-load the increases—while second-round
effects should be limited by the recession and by the currency board, which should also
contribute to rapid deceleration of underlying inflation. The authorities noted that a window
of opportunity to meet the Maastricht inflation criterion for euro adoption could therefore
open in 2010.
13.
Since the wage response has just begun, staff has prepared an alternative
scenario in which wages do not decelerate significantly until 2010 (Figure 10, Table 7).
Continued strong wage growth in 2009 would support higher consumption than in the
baseline but would undermine competitiveness, hurting exports and investment. GDP growth
would remain below potential through the projection period and a wider external current
account deficit would cause faster debt accumulation than in the baseline scenario. The
authorities view this scenario as unlikely to materialize given the incipient labor market
adjustment.

Box 3. Labor Market Flexibility
Estonia’s labor market institutions facilitated downward wage flexibility during the recession that followed the
1998-99 Russian crisis, and delivered low unemployment during the upswing (Figure 8). Their strength derives from:
•
•
•
•

A liberal legislative framework (though international benchmarking suggests scope for reducing dismissal costs)
Decentralized wage setting and relatively low minimum wages
Widespread use of performance-related bonuses (65 percent of enterprises; 15 percent of the wage bill)
A low trade union density (less than 10 percent of employment, compared to the 25 percent EU27 average)

Labor market institutions are at least as flexible now as in 1998-99 and should once again ease adjustment. However,
emigration could hamper downward wage flexibility and amplify employment volatility.
Above average firing costs are a drag...

14.
Other risks to the outlook stem from the still-unsettled global environment. Chief
among them are a sharper-than-expected contraction in export markets and a financial market
shock stemming from adverse developments in Nordic parent banks or in other countries in
the region. Given the strong trade and investment ties across the Baltics, a severe recession in
Latvia or Lithuania would further depress demand in Estonia, aggravating the recession and
worsening the performance of the financial sector. Moreover, since Swedish banking groups
are dominant in all the Baltics, a financial crisis in either neighboring country or Sweden
could spill into Estonia by provoking bank runs or capital flight.These risks underscore the
urgency of strengthening the financial sector contingency framework, as discussed below. On
the upside, the authorities noted that Estonia’s flexible markets and still-low production costs
compared to neighboring countries could attract investment by Nordic firms seeking to cut
costs in an adverse global environment.
B. External Stability
15.
Estonia’s imbalances suggest that the real exchange rate is overvalued, but
overvaluation estimates are inconclusive. The large current account deficit and high wage
and price inflation indicate that the real exchange rate has appreciated too rapidly, leading to
an overvalued real exchange rate. However, staff calculations, using a variety of standard
approaches, show overvaluation falling in a wide range, from 3 to 19 percent. At the low end
of the range, the projection-based estimates are consistent with staff’s medium term current
account projection; the other estimates (with the exception of the REER deviation from
historical average) rely on calculations of the underlying current account and of the
equilibrium real exchange rate (Selected Issues, Chapter II).

16.
The authorities argued that the real appreciation remained manageable. They
noted that some of the approaches likely overstate the disequilibrium. First, elasticities-based
calculations of the underlying current account use parameters estimated for advanced
economies, which may overstate the impact of past changes of the real exchange rate in a
converging economy. Second, direct real exchange rate estimates are problematic in an
economy undergoing rapid structural change. Staff agreed with the authorities’ arguments,
which are supported by sensitivity tests (Selected Issues, Chapter II). Overall, while
remaining concerned about the recent rapid appreciation and erosion in competitiveness, staff
acknowledged that their impact on export performance had been modest to date (Figure 7)
and agreed that the overvaluation would remain manageable as long as the labor market
adjustment proceeded as expected under the baseline scenario.
17.
The net external debt ratio and the net international investment position (NIIP)
are projected to worsen before stabilizing in the medium term. The worsening of the net
asset position increases vulnerability, and the bound tests suggest that a weakening of the
current account, slow growth, or a devaluation could significantly increase the debt ratio
(Figure 11). However, the gross debt ratio will begin to fall as the economy recovers,while
the NIIP (half of which is driven by equity investments) is expected to stabilize near the end
of the projection period.

the authorities emphasized that the CBA
is robust. The central bank’s monetary liabilities are more than fully covered by reserves and
euro adoption is a clear exit strategy. Moreover, the CBA is supported by the government’s
large net creditor position and a political commitment anchored by deep-rooted public
support. In addition, commercial banks and the central bank are well equipped to deal with
liquidity problems. First, banks’ high required reserves, Eesti Pank’s excess reserve cover,
and the government’s liquid external assets are significant buffers. Second, the parent
institutions have little interest in withholding liquidity from their Estonian subsidiaries,
which they view as strategic investments, and the home authorities have signaled their
willingness to support the Baltic operations of their banking groups. These mechanisms
worked well in September–October 2008 when a major bank faced a region-wide deposit run.
And, third, Eesti Pank has developed a plan for providing ELA to the large foreign-owned
banks, with the support of a neighboring central bank, in a manner consistent with CBA
rules.

C. Financial Sector Assessment
20.
Banks performed well through the 2008 global liquidity crisis, but their
profitability and capital buffers will be eroded during the recession.5 Continued
profitability in 2008 and the still exceptionally low NPL ratios signal resilience but the full
impact of the downturn lies ahead: NPL ratios could rise significantly, eating up capital,
while the decline in liquidity ratios has increased vulnerability to sudden stops. Going
5

See SM/xx/xx for a detailed discussion of banking sector vulnerabilities.

22
forward, banks’ main challenge in the adverse global environment may be to secure enough
funding to maintain profitability through loan expansion.
21.
The authorities considered banks’ buffers adequate. Capital buffers are sizable
and credit quality sound, helped by a recent strengthening of lending standards. Both should
position banks to withstand the anticipated stresses. The authorities do expect NPLs to rise to
as much as 5 percent in 2009, but noted that this would be manageable given the currently
large capital ratios. Staff agreed, but noted that much of the cushion resulted from reducing
the risk weight on mortgages from 100 to 60 percent in the context of the move to Basel 2, a
step which seemed inappropriate given the still unsettled real estate market.
22.
The authorities have implemented some key recommendations of the February
2008 FSAP-Update mission (Box 4). After initially expressing skepticism—owing to moral
hazard considerations—about eliminating coinsurance from the deposit guarantee fund
(DGF), they took this step during the global turmoil in early October. In line with the EU,
they also raised the insurance ceiling. More recently, as mentioned above, the authorities
have developed a plan for ELA in case of need. In other areas, the government has prepared
draft legislation to accelerate access to budgetary resources in the event of a financial crisis
and the Ministry of Finance is drafting legislation for a more flexible bank resolution
framework.
Box 4. Findings and Recommendations of the FSAP-Update
The FSAP-update found that Estonia has a sound, well supervised, banking sector but is
subject to vulnerabilities from euro-denominated real estate lending and the dependence on
short term external funding (see SM/xx/xx). Given these exposures and the risky global
environment, the FSSA recommended strengthening the financial safety net. The key
recommendations, and the authorities’ responses were:
•
•
•

•
•
•

Create an emergency liquidity assistance capacity. Agreed. Work is near completion.
Strengthen the deposit guarantee scheme by doubling the target size of the DGF,
shortening the payout period and eliminating coinsurance. The authorities consider the
target size adequate, but they have eliminated coinsurance and increased coverage.
Strengthen the bank resolution framework. Agreed. Legislation under preparation.
Increase staffing at the FSA. Implemented in Fall 2008.
Conduct a joint Baltics-Swedish crisis simulation exercise involving a major regional
banking group. Agreed in principle. Collaboration already close.
Implement joint Eesti Pank-FSA macrofinancial stress tests. Agreed in principle.

D. Fiscal Policy
23.
The key fiscal challenges are to rein in the budget deficit despite the recession
and restore a sustainable fiscal stance over the medium term. Expenditure increases in
the last few years have produced a significant structural deficit, leaving little room for
countercyclical policy. Against this background, the authorities’ key near-term goals are twofold: maintaining their fiscal buffer so long as global illiquidity makes borrowing difficult;
and ensuring that the deficit does not jeopardize euro adoption by exceeding the 3 percent of

23
GDP Maastricht ceiling. In the medium term they intend to adjust by enough to meet their
traditional goal of budgets that are “in balance-or-better.”
24.
The 2009 budget incorporates difficult measures but is only a first step towards
controlling the deficit. Operational expenditure was cut by an average of 8 percent across
ministries. The wage bill was frozen at the 2008 level, with the help of large reduction in
civil service employees. And previously-approved income tax cuts were postponed while
some indirect taxes and charges were increased. The authorities expected the deficit to be
1.9 percent of GDP but they recognized that lower-than-budgeted receipts from assets sales,
worse-than-expected macroeconomic conditions, and poor expenditure control by local
governments could make it larger. Staff’s view was that, given its baseline scenario (which
projects a deeper recession and lower inflation than the Ministry of Finance’s scenario, thus
implying a deficit of 3.3 percent of GDP), these downside risks would drive the deficit well
above 3 percent of GDP. This would not present an immediate financing problem given
government’s liquid assets of 8½ percent of GDP at end 2008. But it would delay euro
adoption and the needed medium fiscal consolidation. The authorities expressed readiness to
make further cuts—defense and investments were candidates—if needed to keep the deficit
within the Maastricht limit.
25.
The authorities noted that fiscal adjustment over the medium term would
require a major effort. Consolidation was complicated by the budget’s inflexibility: more
than 70 percent of expenditure is driven by entitlements and tax earmarks. Thus it would be
necessary to reform large components of the budget (such as family support programs and
health insurance), and reduce the number of public employees subject to the civil service law.
Within this broad framework, some elements of the 2010 budget were already formulated,
such as an extension of the wage bill freeze (already agreed) and the further postponement of
planned income tax cuts (not yet agreed). Staff welcomed both proposals but noted that,
alone, they would not bring the deficit below 3 percent of GDP in 2010 (text table).

The authorities plan to address recommendations of the recent FAD mission on
fiscal transparency. The Reassessment Report on Observance of Standards and Codes
concludes that Estonia now meets nearly all of the requirements of the Code of Good
Practices on Fiscal Transparency—and approaches international best practice in some
areas—but highlights potential improvements in budgetary planning, control over subnational
borrowing, and documentation of fiscal prospects and risks. The authorities agreed, but
implementation is delayed in light of the current focus on containing the deficit.
E. Structural Policies
27.
Market flexibility is critical for the restructuring needed to support mediumterm convergence. Resources should be reallocated from nontraded to traded sectors and
from low wage-based to high value-added activities. The authorities emphasized that the
reallocation was already underway, and agreed that continued product and labor market
flexibility was necessary for it to continue.
Spending on ALMPs has been low

28.
In this context, the authorities

reconfirmed their commitment to
increase labor market flexibility. They
reported that new labor market legislation,
approved by parliament last year and
effective in mid-2009, would reduce lay-off
costs, align labor law with private contract
law, streamline procedures, and simplify
conflict resolution. At the same time the
social safety net would be strengthened by
increasing unemployment compensation

greater flexibility but advised that the fiscal
costs of social protection be clearly assessed
and accounted for, and expressed concern about possible adverse labor supply effects. The
authorities considered that there was no need to raise immigration quotas, as the current
ceilings were not binding, but acknowledged that procedures could be simplified.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
The severe recession projected for 2009 will test the flexibility and resilience of
the economy. Since Estonia is very small and very open, there is limited scope for
countercyclical policy, so a strong market response is needed to cushion the downturn and
underpin the eventual recovery. While consumption should recover after households have
strengthened their finances through higher savings, further wage adjustment is needed to
revive investment and sustain exports in a more unfavorable environment. Owing to farreaching reforms in the early 1990s, labor and product markets should have the needed
flexibility. The state should support the private sector by securing financial stability. The
policies needed are: supporting the CBA, clearing the path for euro adoption, initiating a
large medium-term fiscal adjustment, and promoting the stability of financial institutions.

25
30.
The financial sector weathered severe financial shocks in 2008 owing to large
buffers and supportive policies, which have since been strengthened further. The
authorities’ decisive response to the global crisis was well-targeted, strengthening financial
safety nets and improving the bank resolution framework. The elimination of the coinsurance
feature in the DGF removes an important incentive for bank runs while the increase in
coverage, in line with EU guidelines, levels the playing field. The development of a
framework for providing ELA to large banks is welcome and other planned measures—
streamlined access to fiscal resources in a crisis and a more flexible resolution framework—
will also be important additions to the crisis management toolkit.
31.
Regional collaboration in financial stability work, which is required given the
degree of integration, has been satisfactory and should be sustained. More important
than formal arrangements has been supervisors’ routine cooperation and exchange of
information. The Swedish authorities’ explicit statement that their support to banks should be
expected to strengthen all parts of the associated banking groups has also helped; so should
the new draft legislation in Estonia creating a framework that facilitates the use of budgetary
resources in financial crises. Regularly updated regional crisis simulation exercises would be
welcome.
32.
The CBA served Estonia well during the financial crisis but the euro would
provide a safer haven. The global turbulence has underlined the risks of maintaining a
separate currency in small open economies and the corresponding benefits of currency union.
Robust in design, and buttressed by the fiscal reserve and sound banking sector, the CBA did
not come under significant pressure. It therefore was able to anchor expectations and protect
the economy from parity swings that would have destabilized the financial system.
Nonetheless, the authorities’ intention to adopt the Euro as soon as possible remains
appropriate, to eliminate the risks associated with a separate currency.
33.
Cyclical developments and policies are bringing the Maastricht inflation
criterion within reach but the fiscal criterion is at risk. While the deceleration of prices is
partly the result of exogenous shocks and cyclical factors it also reflects the anchoring effect
of the CBA, the well-judged frontloading of administrative price increases, and the
preannounced wage bill freeze. Not much more can be done on the inflation front. The focus
now needs to be on ensuring that the fiscal deficit remains within the Maastricht limit.
34.
External vulnerabilities are high but the adjustment underway is helping
mitigate them. Given the fixed exchange rate—and eventual euro adoption—Estonia’s
external imbalances must be addressed in the near term by a contraction of demand and in the
medium term by a slowing of real wage growth. The demand shift is already well underway,
driven by a more cautious response to risk. The slowing of wage growth is more recent and
must be sustained and deepened. While past real exchange rate appreciation has eroded
Estonia’s exceptionally high competitiveness, profitability should remain adequate if future
real wage increases are aligned with productivity growth. The new labor contract law should
help insofar as it addresses residual labor market rigidities while improving the social safety
net. The incentive structures in the new framework should be monitored carefully in the
testing environment of the current recession.

26
35.
The unsustainable expenditure increases in the last few years leave little room
for countercyclical fiscal policy. Since the effect of fiscal stimulus on demand is modest
anyway, fiscal policy in 2009 should focus on slowing the draw-down of the government’s
liquidity buffers, adhering to the Maastricht deficit and taking the first steps to restore fiscal
sustainability. This will require a significant effort in the context of a supplementary budget.
36.
The fiscal position should be strengthened over the medium term. A modest
structural surplus would allow automatic stabilizers to operate without producing deficits
during most recessions and position the budget for costs associated with population aging.
The adjustment needed to reach this goal is large, and should be phased in gradually. The
government's plan to freeze the state budget wage bill for 2009–10 is a welcome first step and
should be extended to other levels of government: it creates incentives to reduce inefficiency
and sends a signal for wage moderation in the private sector. More broadly, staff welcomes
the authorities' intention to review medium term expenditure and revenue policies. Priority
should be given to savings that lead to a more efficient allocation of resources.
37.
It is recommended that the Article IV consultation with Estonia remain on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Exchange Rate Arrangements:
The currency of Estonia is the kroon. The kroon replaced the ruble on June 20, 1992. Since
that date, the Bank of Estonia has guaranteed the conversion of kroon bank notes, coins, and
reserve deposits of commercial banks at a fixed rate of exchange of EEK 15.6466 per euro
(and EEK 8 per deutsche mark until 31 December, 2001). The de facto exchange rate regime
is a “currency board arrangement,” which corresponds to the de jure classification. Estonia
has accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles
of Agreement, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions, except for those imposed for
security reasons in accordance with the European Council Regulations set forth in the letter
from the Bank of Estonia dated July 9, 2008, and notified to the Executive Board in
accordance with Decision No. 144-(52/51) (EBD/08/73, July 9, 2008).

of the 2000 Article IV Consultation. Further Reports on Observance of Standards and Codes
(ROSC) modules were discussed in the 2001 Article IV Consultations and updated during the
2002 Consultation. An FSAP update mission was fielded in February 2008. An FAD mission
to reassess the fiscal transparency ROSC was fielded in November 2007. MONEYVAL has
prepared an AML/CFT ROSC which will be circulated to the Board in the near future.

APPENDIX II. ESTONIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision to the Fund is generally adequate for surveillance purposes, although
fiscal data on general government operations are not always timely. A May 2001 data ROSC
mission found that the quality of macroeconomic statistics was generally good; international
standards and guidelines were generally followed, although coverage of fiscal and monetary
data was not complete.
2.
Estonia is a subscriber to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). Also, the
Bank of Estonia (BoE) and the Statistical Office of Estonia (SE) periodically update on their
websites a wide variety of data on the key variables for the monetary, fiscal, real, and external
sectors.
3.
As a member of the European Union and a candidate to join the European Monetary
Union, Estonia has markedly upgraded its statistics to comply with European Central Bank
(ECB) standards and regulations.
A. Monetary and Financial Statistics
4.
The BoE regularly reports monetary data with minimal delay. The data are also
published by the BoE on its website. The BoE balance-sheet data (base money and net
international reserves) are reported monthly, and are available on the eighth day of the
following month. Broad money and its components are available monthly from the BoE on
the thirteenth banking day from the beginning of the month. Interest rate updates on domestic
and foreign currency transactions are provided monthly on the seventeenth banking day of the
month.
5.
BoE has adopted the framework of the ECB for the compilation of monetary and
financial statistics, which is consistent with the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual. STA and BoE have completed the data work on mapping Estonia’s monetary data
into the Standardized Report Forms which have been published in the June issue of the IFS
Supplement.
6.
Aggregate financial data are compiled by the BoE and reported on a monthly basis.
Data for individual banks are also available on a quarterly basis, and consolidated data on
commercial bank reserves, NFAs, and net open foreign exchange positions are available on
the eleventh banking day of the month. Commercial bank off-balance sheet data, leverage and
liquidity ratios, and short term external debt are available on the eighteenth banking day of
the month. Average capital adequacy ratios are available on the thirteenth banking day of the
month. Data on non-performing loans are available on the seventeenth banking day of the
month.
7.
Estonia participated in the Fund’s Coordinated Compilation Exercise for Financial
Soundness Indicators. Data and metadata on a benchmark set of indicators for 2005 have
been posted on the IMF website.

39

B. Balance of Payments Statistics
8.
Quarterly balance of payments and IIP data are compiled by the BoE. Daily exchange
rate data are available with a one working day lag. Monthly import/export data are available
with a two month lag. Quarterly balance of payments and public and private external debt
data are available with a quarterly lag.
C. Government Finance Statistics
9.
All fiscal data are published by the Ministry of Finance (MoF). Historical data are
also available on SE’s website.
•

Monthly central government operations data are available with a lag of up to 25 days
after the end of the month. The government began reporting monthly data on a
consolidated government basis in January 1999 on its Estonian-language web site.
Quarterly data on foreign loans and guarantees by the central government are
published in Estonian with a monthly lag. The MoF is using one of its two allowed
SDDS flexibility options on the timeliness of monthly central government operations
data, and have recently started to disseminate these data on the National Summary
Data Page.

•

Comprehensive annual data on central and local government operations (cash basis)
are reported in the GFS Yearbook. These data include a statement of operations and
the government balance sheet, including data on financial assets and liabilities, both
domestic and foreign. Quarterly data for general government, based on the GFSM
2001 framework, are now regularly reported for inclusion in the International
Finance Statistics.
D. National Accounts

10.
Data on GDP (quarterly, by semester, and annually) are published by SE with a lag of
three months after the end of the quarter. Flash estimates of aggregate GDP are available two
months after the end of the reference period. The monthly CPI is available seven days after
the end of the reference period. Monthly PPI and export price indices are available four
weeks after the end of the reference period. Monthly indicators of retail trade, industrial
output, industrial sales, are reported approximately six weeks to two months after the end of
the reference period. Nominal monthly wage data and quarterly nominal and real wage data
are published with a two-month lag.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
March 2, 2009
1.
This statement reports on data releases and policy measures since the staff
report was issued. The additional information does not change the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
2.
Preliminary data suggest that GDP fell sharply in the last quarter of 2008.
Industrial production plummeted, and the decline in retail sales accelerated. A flash estimate
puts real GDP growth at -9.4 percent year-on-year for the 4th quarter (-4.2 percent quarter-onquarter, seasonally adjusted). These figures would imply that the economy contracted by
3.6 percent in 2008 instead of the 2.4 percent reported in the staff report). Carry-over effects
would bring GDP growth to -6.2 percent in 2009 instead of the -4 percent in the staff report.
This would produce a larger reduction in inflation and external current account deficit than in
the staff report’s baseline scenario, but it would also bring a greater deterioration in the
performance of bank loans.
3.
The parliament has approved a supplementary budget for 2009 which further
tightens the fiscal stance. The main measures are cuts in operational expenses (including
the wage bill) in all ministries and a slowing of the pace of pension increases. The authorities
estimate that these and other measures will reduce expenditure by about 3¼ percent of GDP
which, under a 6.2 percent economic contraction, would reduce the general government
deficit to about 1 percent of GDP. Their objective is to ensure the deficit would not exceed
the Maastricht limit even if GDP falls as much as 8 percent in 2009.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
the Republic of Estonia
On March 2, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Estonia.1
Background
Estonia’s economy was already decelerating when the global financial crisis erupted. An
outstanding economic performance since the early 1990s had ended in a strong credit
boom and overheating in 2005-07. The real estate market had surged, output growth
had risen well above potential, inflation had accelerated, and the current account deficit
had widened significantly. These widening imbalances eventually raised awareness of
increased risks, driving banks to tighten credit in early 2007. This, together with a
decline in consumer confidence, triggered an economic slowdown. The global financial
crisis brought further credit tightening and decline in confidence, leading to an
acceleration of the slowdown in late 2007 and 2008.
The economy is now experiencing its most severe recession since the early 1990’s. The
downturn is mostly driven by domestic demand, as the credit crunch is squeezing
investment and the decline in confidence is reducing consumption. The stock market
index, which had soared in 2006, dropped below its pre-boom level, and real estate
prices are now more than 20 percent below peak levels. As a result, GDP growth, which
had started to decline in late 2007, turned strongly negative last year.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities.

2
The recession is sharply reducing Estonia’s imbalances. The external current account
deficit nearly halved between 2007 and 2008, largely due to a demand-driven
compression of imports but also helped by a drop in income outflows, reflecting the fall
in profits to foreign-owned companies and banks. Exports continued to grow modestly
despite an appreciation of the real exchange rate, owing to an improvement in terms of
trade and a recovery of oil transit trade with Russia. Inflation, which reached doubledigits in mid-2008 because of demand pressures as well as external and internal
shocks, is now decelerating sharply as these pressures and the impact of the fuel and
food price shocks have reversed.
Labor market conditions have begun to ease. Real wages continued to run ahead of
productivity growth in 2008, compressing profits from their (exceptionally strong) 200607 level. But nominal wage growth has slowed from over 20 percent in 2007 to about
15 percent last year, and there are reports of cancelled or reduced bonuses. Also, the
unemployment rate jumped by more than 2 percentage points in the third quarter of
2008 to above 6 percent, and there is growing evidence of large forthcoming slack in the
labor market given the shrinking number of vacancies and widespread news of layoffs.
The financial sector has withstood the global financial turbulence well so far, but risks
remain significant. Estonia’s banks (almost entirely owned by large Nordic groups with
centralized liquidity management) have so far had access to liquidity when needed
(although at higher prices) through their parents which in turn benefited from liquidity
support and guarantees by the home country authorities. Recently Eesti Pank and the
Sveriges Riksbank have concluded an arrangement which will allow for expanded
provision of liquidity to subsidiaries of Swedish banks in the event of need. As regards
capitalization, strong profits in recent years have strengthened banks’ buffers which
have traditionally been robust given conservative regulatory limits. But the recession has
started to erode asset quality (NPLs more than tripled in 2008, though from a very low
level), undermining expected profit.
Estonia’s track record of fiscal surpluses has allowed the accumulation of fiscal reserves
that are proving crucial for the country’s financial stability in this global crisis. However,
large structural expenditure increases (particularly in the wage bill and pensions) over
2007-08 have tarnished this record. Together with the recession, they contributed to
driving the general government balance into deficit in 2008, for the first time since the
beginning of this decade. They have also set the stage for continued deficits over the
medium term in the absence of corrective measures.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the Estonian authorities for the progress made in recent years in
achieving economic convergence and deepening real and financial ties with the
European Union. Economic policies have built up considerable financial buffers,
although sizable vulnerabilities have accumulated following a domestic consumption
and housing boom that was fueled by high credit growth. With the global deleveraging,
Estonia has entered a severe recession that will test the flexibility and resilience of its
economy. The domestic demand contraction has already reduced the external current
account deficit and lowered inflation. Recovery however will require a revival of foreign

3
and domestic demand, continued financial stability, and prudent macroeconomic
management.
Directors agreed that the currency board arrangement has served Estonia well by
anchoring expectations and policies. Nonetheless, contagion risks have heightened.
Directors considered, therefore, that euro accession would provide a safer haven. They
noted staff’s assessment that the real effective exchange rate is somewhat overvalued,
but that competitiveness is projected to remain adequate as real wage increases are
aligned with productivity.
Directors commended the authorities for their planned substantial fiscal restraint in 2009
that was intended to keep the fiscal deficit within the Maastricht ceiling of 3 percent of
GDP. They considered that this fiscal stance would have had only a modest impact on
activity, given the open economy and was necessary to support the currency board.
Important steps to rein in the fiscal deficit included a freeze on the wage bill for 2009-10,
which would also send a strong signal for wage moderation in the private sector, cuts in
operational expenditures, and postponement of previously agreed tax reductions and
pension increases. Directors encouraged the authorities to achieve a modest structural
fiscal surplus over the medium term and supported their intention to review mediumterm expenditures and revenue policies.
Directors noted that the financial sector has been thus far resilient to the global crisis.
Nevertheless, loan quality will likely suffer as the recession progresses and liquidity
buffers may erode further with global deleveraging. Against this background, Directors
commended the authorities for their decisive steps to strengthen the bank resolution
framework and financial safety nets, including regional safety net cooperation
agreements. They welcomed the changes to the deposit guarantee scheme that reduce
incentives for bank runs. They endorsed the recent swap agreement between the
Estonian and Swedish central banks that underpin a new framework for extending
emergency liquidity assistance to large banks, providing an additional liquidity cushion.
They supported efforts aimed at improving regional collaboration through continued
coordination of supervisory activities and exchange of information.
Structural policies to ensure market flexibility were considered by Executive Directors to
be crucial for facilitating real adjustment including a reallocation of resources from the
non-traded to the tradable sector and from low wage to high-value added activities.
They supported the new labor contract law, which aims to reduce the, albeit limited,
labor market rigidities, while improving the social safety net.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2008 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Estonia is also
available.

Statement by Jens Henriksson, Executive Director for the Republic of Estonia
March 2, 2009
The authorities would like to express their appreciation to Mr. Rozwadowski and his team
for the thorough and candid policy consultations, and to Mr. Seelig for valuable discussions
on the financial sector. The authorities broadly agree with staff’s assessment and, as always,
consider thoroughly the recommendations put forward.
The Estonian economy has undergone a major transformation over the past decade. The
consistent macroeconomic policy framework based on market-oriented policies, openness and a
currency board arrangement since 1992, has contributed to building of a broad-based economy
and a strong government balance sheet, characterised by minimal public debt and substantial
assets.
The currency board arrangement remains the main pillar for economic policies,
complemented by the EU membership and the prospective EMU accession as cornerstones
for the fast real convergence towards average EU income levels. GDP per capita (measured in
PPP terms) has increased by approximately 250 percent since 1997. The fixed exchange rate
regime implies that the economy exhibits flexibility in product and labour markets. These
assumptions will be thoroughly tested in the current downturn, as the recent sharp deterioration in
the external environment has lead to a rapid turnaround in domestic economic activity. Like staff,
the authorities view the current situation a chance for speeding up the restructuring process of the
economy in order to ensure sustained growth in productivity and output over the medium- to
long-term.
The authorities have responded vigilantly to an ongoing economic slowdown. The
vulnerabilities, especially those related to the current account deficit, credit growth and inflation,
have decreased fast, indicating the capability of the economy to adequately react when the cycle
turns. The uncertain external environment may pose more challenges for the future, especially for
the short-term. However, the defences against a disorderly adjustment are strengthened by the
fiscal and liquidity buffers, a strong and well-supervised banking system, ERM2 membership and
the policy anchor of the EMU entry. Therefore, Estonia has entered the recession from a relative
position of strength.
The outlook for 2009-2010
The Estonian economy is undergoing a sharp, but still an orderly economic adjustment. The
authorities remain committed to prudent policies in order to ensure credibility of the economy
and to restore the confidence of international investors.
The authorities’ macro-economic projections for the Estonian economy have been revised
downwards taking into account lower-than-expected growth of the main trading partners. More
specifically, the risk scenario of the authorities’ fall of 2008 forecasts is now considered to be a
baseline, foreseeing a decline in the real GDP by 5–6 percent in 2009 and a slight growth (by
about 1 percent) in 2010.
Inflation is declining sharply and is expected to turn negative in the second half of 2009. In
January 2009, inflation dropped to 4 percent (y-o-y), down from 7 percent in December 2008,

2
mainly due to lower motor fuel prices, extensive clothes and footwear sales and a favorable base
effect. The authorities do not expect the inflation to exceed 2 percent in 2009.
Labor market flexibility will contribute strongly to a general economic adjustment. Indeed,
the evidence over the last six months provides ample evidence that the labor market has been
adjusting very rapidly, owing to the decentralized wage setting mechanisms, flexible salary
structures and regional integration.
Labor market data for January is expected to confirm preliminary evidence of substantial
wage moderation and an increase of part-time work. Tax data suggest that in December, wage
growth slowed to 4 percent (y-o-y, down from the range of 15–20 percent) mainly due to a
general cancelling of end-year performance bonuses. This is confirmed by recent data on wages
with growth in the fourth quarter of 2008 at 6.9 percent. The annual nominal wage growth is
expected to be negative in 2009. The registered level of unemployment (generally somewhat
lower than the actual unemployment rate in Estonia) reached 6 percent in January 2009. To
further streamline the reallocation of labor between economic activities, the new Employment
Contract Law was adopted in January 2009 and will enter into force in July 2009. The new law,
while raising the flexibility in the labor market, also increases unemployment benefit rates and
broadens the range of beneficiaries to enhance security.
External stability
The current account deficit has contracted significantly due to a declining domestic
demand, better than expected exports performance of services and the decrease in the
outflow of profits via income account. Therefore, the dependence on current foreign financing
is receding fast. The deficit in the combined current and capital account decreased from
16.9 percent of GDP in 2007 to 7.5 percent of GDP in the third quarter of 2008. The main
contribution came from a narrowing trade deficit, on account of contracting domestic demand.
The trade balance is likely to turn into balance or surplus in the coming years, and while the
export volumes decrease as a result of a fall in transit trade, the share of higher value added
goods in exports will grow.
The authorities note that some indicators in staff’s calculations point to real exchange rate
overvaluation of the Estonian kroon. Although the calculations are always based on certain
assumptions, the authorities accept that the real exchange rate may have been somewhat
overvalued in the recent past, but the ongoing adjustment challenges the persistence of the
problem. As explained by staff, the authorities have addressed the potential capital account
vulnerabilities by improving the financial safety net in coordination with the authorities of home
countries of its banks.
Monetary policy
A currency board arrangement remains the over-arching pillar for monetary and financial
stability by providing the credible anchor for price expectations over the medium and long
term. Having CBA, Estonia has been mimicking life under the Euro area framework already for
17 years, reflecting the flexibility of its markets to adjust. The authorities strongly believe that an
orderly entrance to the EMU is the only credible exit strategy from the current monetary
arrangement.

3

As a member of the ERM-2 mechanism since 2004, Euro adoption remains a key policy
priority of the Estonian authorities. The currency board has served the economy very well,
confirmed by staff during all previous consultations, in keeping the inflation expectations low
and serving as an anchor to economic agents’ decisions.
Fiscal policy
Fiscal policy has an important role in economic policy making, inter alia, to ensure smooth
functioning of the currency board arrangement. The Estonian authorities have followed a rule
in their State Budget Law that implies an objective of a balanced budget. During the recent years
of fast growth, and in concurrence with the Fund’s advice, the authorities have run surplus
budgets for six years to achieve the objective of a balanced or better budget over the cycle.
However, against the backdrop of the collapse in global demand towards the end of 2008
and the revised projections for 2009, the authorities prepared a negative supplementary
budget that was passed by Parliament on February 20. The budgetary consolidation amounts
to 3 percent of GDP and was achieved, among other measures, by effectively reducing the
government’s wage bill. The 2009 deficit will be financed by fiscal reserves and to a limited
extent by low-cost project-based borrowing from international financial institutions. The
authorities are aware that additional restrictive measures need to be developed for the 2010
budget, and take seriously staff’s recommendations on medium-term budgetary planning.
At the same time, the long-term fiscal sustainability is not threatened. The budgetary impact
of ageing is among the lowest in the EU. The general government of Estonia has a considerable
net asset position, built during the recent years of fiscal surpluses. Financing of the deficit in
2008 has resulted in a decline in central government assets, to around 8½ percent of GDP at the
end of 2008, but the fiscal reserves provide a necessary liquidity buffer for the government in
these turbulent times. The latest fiscal measures aim at limiting the pace of the exhaustion of
these assets.
Financial sector stability
Estonia’s banking system is fully integrated with international groups, being the main
intermediary of foreign funds to Estonia. 95 percent of Estonia’s banking system comprises of
the four large Nordic groups having established themselves either as branches or as subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the legal status of local banks, the capital and liquidity management of banks is
de facto centralized at the group level. The recent experience in the context of global turmoil is
providing evidence that intra-group financial flows have been a stable and reliable source of
liquidity for the Estonian banking market. In light of regional financial integration, the banking
sector measures taken recently by the Nordic authorities have played an additional stabilizing
role.
Naturally, this market structure should rely on sufficient liquidity and capital buffers in
host countries, on effective supervision, and, most notably, on smooth and efficient
cooperation between the home and host authorities. We believe that Estonia’s authorities have
achieved satisfactory results in this regards, as is also confirmed by the FSSA report.

The capital and liquidity buffers are adequate to sustain the projected slowdown in the
economy. In addition, the small size of the corporate debt and equity markets, limited number of
market participants combined with virtually no government debt protect Estonia from being
attractive to speculators. The high reserve requirement (currently 15 percent) and capital
adequacy requirement above the international standard may not be the optimal policies for the
long-term, but in the cyclical context and since the introduction of Basel II from January 2008,
these are considered necessary safeguards. It is clear that the recent profitability levels will not be
achieved for some time to come, but in the fourth quarter of 2008 the banks’ profits were still at
17 million EUR level (in 2008, 0.25 billion EUR). An even more important indicator is the costto-income ratio of banks, which shows the flexibility of banks in reacting to external
developments and has been maintained over the course of a turbulent 2008.
Notwithstanding the rapid deceleration of economic activity and the increase in nonperforming loans, the capital adequacy remains high at 19.6 percent level as of endJanuary 2009, mainly because of retained profits from previous periods. The share of nonperforming loans (60 days overdue) in the banks’ loan portfolio is increasing from the very low
levels, and reached 3.6 percent in end-January 2009. The authorities project it to increase to
around 5 percent in 2009. As a reaction, banks have strengthened provisions further. At the same
time, the banks consider themselves capable (without any state support) to liquidate collaterals
(especially real estate), if necessary.
Credit growth to the private sector decreased significantly in 2008. While reflecting the
impact of policy measures of the previous year, this slowdown was further supported by the rapid
deterioration of the global conditions, but also of domestic credit demand. In 2009, credit growth
might remain flat due to contracting economic activity. Although in the recent years the credit
growth related to real estate has been strong, the share of indebted households remains low
(22 percent of households according to the latest surveys). In the current environment where euro
interest rates are declining, the Estonian borrowers benefit directly from lower debt-service costs
on their variable interest rate euro-denominated loans.
The commercial banks in Estonia have sufficient funds. The banks do not see a need for
additional state guarantees for the credit to the corporate sector (e.g. to exporting firms).
Similarly, the authorities believe there is no need for extensive state intervention in the
functioning of the financial system.
