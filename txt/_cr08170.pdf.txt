Executive Summary
Impressive growth in the recent global cyclical upswing is set to be followed by an unexpectedly
sharp slowdown. The upswing was impressive in its strength and in the shift from traditional manufacturing to higher value-added production and service delivery. With continued inflows of skilled
labor, this augurs well for the future. Yet, the marked slowdown in the United States, its knock-on
effects on Europe, and the continuing shake up in the global financial system are set to take their toll
on the Swiss economy. While staff sees a lower growth outcome than the authorities, there is much
agreement on the scope and balance in the policy approaches to deal with these developments.
The key objective is to maintain financial stability. Instability in the Swiss financial system would
also generate negative spillovers for global finance. The authorities’ response has blended active
liquidity management and, increasingly, forward-looking actions to limit risks in the banking sector.
In this regard, the approach to reinforce capital buffers is especially important. However,
strengthening the supervisor—who is at a resource disadvantage vis-à-vis the major banks—remains
a challenge and may need to be supplemented by transparent performance benchmarks and a stronger
role of host country supervisors in overseeing global operations.
Monetary policy has steered a careful course in an uncertain environment. The September 2007
increase in the SNB policy rate signaled concern about rising inflation. Since then, when the 3-month
Libor has tended to rise above the mid-point of the target band, the authorities have used short-term
repo operations to steer the rate down. This has provided useful accommodation. There is some scope
for further easing of monetary policy since inflation is expected to gradually decline and economic
weakness is projected to persist.
A conservative fiscal stance, in keeping with the medium-term fiscal framework, is appropriate.
The authorities emphasized that despite a small stimulus this year, they do not see a fiscal stimulus as
helpful for reviving growth. Instead, they are focused on long-term fiscal sustainability, which
remains a challenge despite the recent decrease in the public debt-to-GDP ratio. The authorities’
intent to identify specific measures for this purpose is timely, as is the proposed inclusion of
“extraordinary” expenditures in the debt-brake rule.

I. THE CONTEXT
1.
The Swiss economy performed impressively during the recent global upswing.
Although its international preeminence has eroded in some respects, Switzerland rode the
global expansion with much success, with growth exceeding the euro area average in the past
four years. High-value added manufacturing gained in strength, Switzerland’s position as a
major global financial center was reinforced, and a broader emphasis on services delivery has
opened up new growth possibilities. Building on long-standing strengths—advanced
infrastructure, a skilled and flexible workforce, openness to the flow across its borders of
trade, capital, and people, low tax rates, and a small government—these developments augur
well for the future.
2.
But the risks to its financial service industry threaten to dent the gains achieved.
The two major international banks—UBS and Credit Suisse—are closely intertwined in and
have felt the full force of the international financial turbulence. The authorities have
responded appropriately to limit the knock-on effects of the financial tensions, injecting
liquidity and coordinating with major central banks. However, the still-unfolding
developments will have a significant bearing on Swiss growth and impose important policy
challenges, with implications not just for Switzerland but also for financial and economic
developments in the rest of the world.
3.
In light of Swiss susceptibility to externally-generated volatility, the discussions
focused on the near-term outlook and policies to mitigate the risks of instability. The
very strengths of the Swiss economy—its openness and its dynamic financial sector—also
expose it to adverse developments overseas. As such, the economy experiences sharper
swings than most advanced economies (Box 1). In turn, the risk-management strategies of
Swiss banks can amplify international shocks, while also generating negative spillovers for
the global financial system and the world economy. The policy task is to pay particular
attention to decisions made by domestic financial players. This is best achieved by focusing
directly on financial sector regulation and supervision. Monetary and fiscal policies are likely
to play supportive roles within their well-defined frameworks.

Box 1. The Influence of International Shocks on the Swiss Economy
Developments in the global economy have a significant bearing on Swiss growth. A factor structural vector
autoregression (FSVAR) method was used to decompose deviations of real GDP from trend, as in Stock and
Watson (2005).1 The methodology identifies: (i) country-specific or “own” shocks; (ii) common “international”
shocks that affect all countries within the same period; and (iii) idiosyncratic shocks that “spillover” into the
domestic economy after a one quarter lag. The following conclusions emerge:
•

In all countries, deviations from trend growth—a measure of volatility—have declined over time (left
panel below).

•

However, they remain relatively large for Switzerland (only in Japan are they larger).

•

For Switzerland, just under half of these deviations are due to international shocks; another 15 percent
arise from spillovers from other countries in this sample (right panel).

The implication is that, in periods of high international volatility, Swiss growth will be particularly subject to
large fluctuations.

II. THE NEAR-TERM GROWTH OUTLOOK
A. Background
4.
In 2007, the economy was buoyed by external demand, with some pickup in
consumption. GDP growth accelerated to 3.1 percent, capping the resurgence that began in
early 2004 (Table 1). External demand, particularly from Germany, remained strong. Private
consumption rose with improving consumer confidence and falling unemployment.
Machinery and equipment investment was underpinned by strong corporate profitability and

5
by capacity utilization—at 88 percent—well above its long-term average. Construction
investment, however, fell as transportation projects were delayed. And inventories were
drawn down.

The rebound extended an ongoing structural shift—productivity growth in
services was supported by robust increase in skilled employment. Labor productivity
growth rose smartly in the cyclical upturn. While Switzerland’s manufacturing
transformation—from chocolates and watches to genetics and informatics—has continued,
productivity growth in the trade and financial services sectors reinforced trends initiated in
the mid-1990s. Employment continued to increase through 2007 despite financial sector
woes, which slowed gains in the second half of the year. The unemployment rate was down
to 2.7 percent in December, and vacancy rates continued to rise. Businesses were reporting
particular shortages in technical and IT areas. Strong immigration and cross-border
commuter flows—with rising skill content—have supported labor supply (Figure 1).

6.
The structural change accompanying the rebound has raised the potential
growth rate, but the extent of the increase is unclear. The authorities’ estimates of
potential growth have a large range. The methodologies that generate higher estimates of
potential growth (and lower output gaps) are those that allow for time varying trends. These
higher estimates reflect a shift from manufacturing, where capacity constraints apply in the
short-run, to services-based growth, where capital is not a constraint and labor supply has
recently met the skills demanded. Such a benign interpretation of developments is not
unreasonable and could even imply no current output gap. However, for fiscal planning, staff
and the authorities use a more conservative potential growth rate of 1.8 percent, which
implies a positive output gap averaging some 1 percent in 2007-08.
7.
Notwithstanding these favorable developments, the financial turbulence, felt
with force in Switzerland, has raised systemic concerns—though no immediate credit
contraction.
•

•

•

As elsewhere, the tensions were first
manifested in the interbank markets for
short-term liquidity, and these have
continued to recur.
The asset portfolio of UBS—and to a
lesser extent of Credit Suisse—has had
to be significantly written down, and
UBS has required two rounds of capital
injection.
While asset deleveraging is ongoing
and the big banks are increasing their
liquidity, domestic lending has
remained surprisingly steady. In
contrast, the torrid pace of foreign
lending is sharply down.

Liquidity in interbank markets, particularly for term money, has periodically
threatened to dry up—and spreads in these markets remain elevated, especially at
longer maturities. Following the onset of the financial turbulence in July 2007, interest rate
spreads (over the tomorrow/next index swap) widened—though less so than in other major
financial markets. Spreads then seemed to fall and stabilize in much of the final quarter of
2007. They have, however, been subject to new waves of anxiety. In the most recent wave,
longer-term interbank borrowing has been subject to substantially larger premiums than
short-term borrowing. Clearly, banks are reluctant to lend for extended maturities and,
especially the two large banks, have been building their liquidity reserves.

Pressures at the two large banks have also raised broader systemic issues.
Concerns about their creditworthiness have remained elevated, evident in wide spreads on
credit default swaps, a sharp fall in equity prices, and a declining estimated “distance to
default.” Despite its allegedly riskier asset portfolio, reflected in higher credit default spreads
before 2007, Credit Suisse earned estimated profits of $7.8 billion in 2007. However, in the
first quarter of this year, concerns grew with the mark down of $5.3 billion on structured
credit positions, resulting in a loss of $2.1 billion. UBS has been hit hard, reflecting its
particularly high exposure to the US subprime assets. With writedowns now about
$38 billion, UBS ended 2007 with a loss of $4 billion and reported a further loss of
$12 billion in the first quarter of 2008. Since last summer, the long-term rating of UBS has
been lowered from AA+ to AA- by Fitch and by S&P, and from Aaa to Aa1 by Moody’s.
However, markets have responded favorably to a rights issue, which follows the capital
injections earlier in the year from a sovereign wealth fund, a large private investor, and
payment of dividend in stock rather than in cash. According to Fitch’s measure of the
intrinsic strength of the banking system, the Swiss banking system has slipped from A (very
high) to B (high).

Despite these pressures, domestic credit growth has remained steady, while
foreign lending has decreased sharply. The decline in overall credit growth is principally
the consequence of a sharp contraction in the growth rate of foreign loans, from the elevated
70 percent annualized rate in mid-summer. Domestic private sector credit, which grew at a
healthy rate of 5½ percent year-on-year through the summer of 2007, actually accelerated to
7 percent thereafter, despite global tensions. In this regard also, the Swiss experience has
matched the experience in the eurozone, where domestic credit growth has remained
relatively stable.

B. Growth Prospects
11.
As the authorities emphasized, real sector forward-looking indicators have
remained surprisingly positive. The momentum from buoyant growth in much of Europe

10
during 2007 is still evident. Industrial capacity utilization and order books suggest continued
strength, and sentiment indicators are moderating only gradually. Manufactured goods’
demand from Europe and Asia has remained relatively steady. The KoF composite leading
indicator has trended down but only slowly. Nervousness in the financial sector
notwithstanding, lending surveys do not yet foreshadow a credit squeeze. Indeed, some
analysts regard corporate liquidity and profitability as constraining demand for credit.
Consensus forecasts for growth in 2008 have come down since October 2007, but the
average is still high—at around 2.0 percent—though with a large variance.

1.4 percent in 2008, and then to 1.3 percent

11
in 2009.1 Largely because the authorities anticipate a less severe U.S. downturn, implying
also a more modest European slowdown, the SNB projects GDP growth of between 1.5 and 2
percent in 2008, and the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs has a point estimate of 1.9
percent; both expect deceleration in 2009.
13.

The slowdown stems from several sources, which will likely emerge sequentially.

•

Exports of goods and services will slow at first, as U.S. and European imports
decelerate. Given Switzerland’s strong export orientation, this influence will likely
manifest early with reduced growth of goods’ exports and a sharp curtailment of
financial service income. The authorities’ historical analysis shows that a sharp fall in
stock prices, as has recently occurred, is accompanied by a sharp decline in financial
service exports. While the stronger Swiss Franc has not reached levels that would
significantly hurt exports of goods, continued appreciation could have a material
effect. In the short-run, GDP growth will likely be held up by consumption growth,
given the recent strength in employment.
Growth contributions of the financial sector have been
significant.

Export dependence has been high and rising.

Staff estimates presume that the 2007 quarterly pattern of growth would be redistributed due to significant
inventory effects in the 4th quarter national accounts. There was agreement that the national statistics office
would most likely revise the 2007 data, with the peak of the cycle moved to the second quarter. Absent this
adjustment, the carry-over effects from reported 4th quarter growth alone would be about 1½ percent, and the
2008 growth rate would be in the 1.6-1.7 range.

•

The drop in banks’ earnings will also have a direct and early impact on GDP growth,
given the financial sector’s relatively large contribution to growth swings in recent
years.

•

Finally, slowing exports, the inflationary effects of the oil price increase and, in
particular, the global financial tensions can all be expected to dent consumer
confidence, leading to weaker consumption expenditures in the late 2008 and
especially 2009 (Box 2). This expected weakness in consumption contributes,
especially in 2009, to staff’s difference in GDP growth projections relative to those of
the authorities. While corporate profitability and existing orders should underpin
machinery and equipment investment for a while, the uncertainty will likely engender
caution.
III. MAINTAINING FINANCIAL SECTOR STABILITY

14.
The Swiss authorities have responded vigorously to limit the knock-on effects of
the current financial tensions. They have injected liquidity into the banking system, often
in coordination with other major central banks, maintained an enhanced oversight of the
major banks and insurance companies, and worked actively with other regulators to share
information, coordinate supervisory activities, and draw lessons for the future.

13
Box 2. Global Financial Conditions Weigh on Swiss Growth
Past relationships suggest that the global financial downturn points to continued risks. Staff analysis shows a
remarkable correlation between profits at the two big banks and growth one year ahead. Based on recorded 2007 profits,
this statistical relationship projects a sharply slowing growth rate in 2008. Further investigation suggests that profits at the
two banks are a reflection of global financial conditions and are, in particular, correlated with the so-called term spread
(the difference between the 10-year and 3-month interest rates). Just as the dropping profits in 2001 and 2002 predicted the
slowdown of 2003, so did the shrinking term spread (or the flattening yield curve).
Yield spreads have declined.

Growth is correlated with large banks' RoE.

The yield curve’s well-established record of predicting growth rates applies to Switzerland. Temporary rapid growth
tends to push up short-term rates either because monetary authorities seek to cool the economy or market rates rise
independently. Because future growth expectations do not rise, long-term rates stay stable or even decline, and the spread
narrows. The spread between the 10-year Swiss confederation bond yield and the 3-month CHF Libor has dramatically
declined in recent quarters. For the Swiss economy, the real GDP growth rate is well forecasted by this yield spread. The
coefficient on the yield spread is statistically significant at one percent level and the model shows a high predictive power
(0.8 R-squared) for future GDP growth. The yield spread is particularly successful in predicting the consumption
component of GDP, implying that it is an early indicator of consumer sentiments and confidence. These forecasts predict
weakness 4-6 quarters ahead.

A. Interbank Liquidity

15.
In line with central banks in other major financial centers, the Swiss National
Bank (SNB) has provided the necessary liquidity to ease interbank tensions. Heavier
than normal doses of liquidity provision have occurred on days of heightened concerns or at
the start of maintenance periods. However, despite an active policy to enhance availability of
liquidity, the monthly average level of commercial bank sight deposits at the central bank (a
measure of SNB provided liquidity) has not grown more rapidly than in the past since
liquidity injections and withdrawals have been carefully-timed. An expanded list of collateral
eligible for SNB repos was approved in June 2007, prior to the onset of the crisis, and has
proved adequate so far. The SNB also coordinated with the Federal Reserve and the
European Central Bank in providing dollar liquidity.
Bank deposits at the SNB, and the monetary base,
have remained relatively stable.

B. Capital Adequacy

16.
Banks’ business models have evolved
to economize on capital, thereby however
raising systemic risk. The search for new,
often low-margin, businesses in the
increasingly competitive international financial
markets has led to banks acquiring of
apparently low-risk assets, often certified as
such by rating agencies. The low assigned risk
weights allowed some banks to comfortably
meet their regulatory capital requirement (Tier1 plus Tier-2 capital as a proportion of riskweighted assets) while maintaining very high
leverage (low ratios of capital-to-total assets).

The UBS trends, in this regard, are striking. Other European banks, including Credit Suisse,
have also taken this approach. In good times, this earned high returns for banks’ equity
holders, as in 2006. However, ex post, their greater riskiness than earlier recognized and their
illiquidity have reinforced each other. Actions of individual banks may have created spillover
risks because of the perception of common vulnerability across European banks.

17.
Undercapitalization of UBS has been an important concern. Measured by
international standards, UBS remains adequately capitalized but maintaining these standards
has required it to rebuild capital to levels consistent with its positioning as a global banking
group with major asset management as well as banking operations. In conjunction with
reporting its first round of write-offs in December, UBS announced efforts to add
SwF 19.4 billion (about $17.8 billion) to the bank’s Tier-1 capital. Despite initial
reservations, shareholders approved capital injection by Singapore’s GIC and an unnamed
private investor, though the cost was reportedly high for a then Moody’s Aaa-rated issuer

16
and relative to other recent capital injections.2 A second round of new capital ($15 billion), to
be raised in a rights issue following the second round of write-offs, has been underwritten by
major U.S. and European investment banks. This will restore capital ratios close to levels
prevailing before the credit market turmoil.
C. Banking Regulation

18.

The lessons from recent events have identified the need for focus in four areas:

•

Better risk assessment and risk management;

•

Increased capital buffers;

•

More liquidity; and

•

Greater disclosure.

More realistic risk assessment is crucial. The call for more prudent risk
19.
management has followed two, complementary, tracks: better governance and enhanced
regulation. Existing management structures clearly proved an insufficient restraint on risk
taking. However, the effectiveness of proposed corporate governance measures remains
unclear, especially with regard to compensation schemes and the role of non-executive
directors, and implementation will need new industry norms. In contrast, it is widely
accepted that the buildup of structured finance positions would have been lower had the
Basel II regulatory framework been fully implemented.3 Compared with Basel I, the new
framework captures off-balance-sheet assets better and takes a more sophisticated approach
to measuring risks. The Swiss authorities have now largely implemented Basel II, including
the Pillar 2 (supervisory review) process.4 But they are also revisiting their risk-based capital
framework, drawing on the recently revealed outcomes and correlations across asset classes.
These reassessments will, in turn, lead to typically higher capital requirements.
However, given the limits of any risk-based framework, consideration of
20.
additional capital is merited to cushion against unanticipated risks. The authorities are

The two-year convertible notes for SwF 13 billion (about $12 billion) have been placed with the Government
of Singapore Investment Corporation (SwF 11 billion) and an undisclosed Middle Eastern investor
(SwF 2 billion) at a 9 percent annual interest rate. Additional capital is to be raised through the resale of treasury
shares and the replacement of the 2007 cash dividend with a stock dividend.

Basel II regulations came into force on January 1, 2007 and were adopted by all banks on January 1, 2008.

They will implement Pillar 3 requirements (disclosure in relation to market discipline) from the start of 2008.

17
considering the use of a leverage ratio for large banks to supplement existing capital
requirements. Such an approach could add a transparent capital buffer. As staff noted and the
authorities recognize, the approach has its limitations, not least the possibility that banks will
have an increased incentive to “hide” their assets by moving them off-balance-sheet.
However, staff agreed that implemented with Basel II and appropriate safeguards, a leverage
ratio approach could serve as a useful complement to the existing regime, while helping to
strengthen the supervisory response to future increased risk-taking by the banks.
21.
While additional capital will also mitigate liquidity risks, further development of
liquidity risk management in response to recent events is a priority. In line with the
recommendations in the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update in May 2007,
the authorities are developing a stress testing framework to improve global liquidity risk
management by the major banks and are actively reviewing banks’ contingency plans and
liquidity management policies. They are also collaborating with other regulators
internationally to enhance global practices.
22.
The Swiss Federal Banking Commission also recognizes that a lack of adequate
disclosure amplified market anxieties and is working with regulators internationally on
improvements. The Commission’s immediate focus is on close monitoring of the two big
banks and reported it had the relevant information necessary for supervisory purposes.
However, the authorities have also called for increased transparency of commercial banks’
risk positions in order to improve market discipline. They suggested that greater public
disclosure requirements need careful consideration and standardization, particularly
regarding complex financial instruments, to be useful to the public. The Commission is,
therefore, pursuing options for enhanced disclosure mainly within the context of international
discussions and developments.
D. Insurance Developments

23.
Despite their risk-reduction efforts, Swiss insurance companies would suffer
from a major global downturn. The insurers operate in a mature domestic market, derive a
large share of premium income from overseas business, and have a major presence in global
reinsurance. Since the problems experienced in the weak equity markets of 2001-03, the
insurance sector has performed impressively, risk exposures have been reduced, and recent
events in global credit markets have had a much smaller impact than on the banks. The
authorities are closely monitoring credit exposures and noted that all companies currently
meet minimum solvency standards, on a statutory basis. However, greater earnings volatility
is now expected.
24.
Although not a binding solvency requirement until 2011, the Swiss Solvency Test
(SST) is spurring improvements in risk management and in the quality of supervisory
dialogue. Regulators are using the SST to improve both their insights into insurers’ risks (for

18
example the continuing exposure to worsening global economic and financial conditions)
and their monitoring of solvency levels. The SST has been applied to major insurance
companies since the start of 2006, and is now being extended to reinsurance companies (and
smaller primary insurance companies). The regulator is also embedding the SST within a
wider risk-based supervisory framework encompassing requirements on corporate
governance, risk management and internal controls. These are welcome developments,
broadly in line with the recommendations of the 2007 FSAP.
25.
The insurance regulation agenda needs continued prioritization and attention to
overall resources. As well as building on the success of the SST, there is a need to develop
a system of onsite supervision linked to risk assessment, to increase supervisory resources for
reinsurance and to strengthen international supervisory cooperation, particularly with
regulators outside Europe. While the regulator has plans in these areas, staff observed that
limited resources in relation to the scale of the tasks would require careful prioritization. The
authorities noted there would be risks in deferring key parts of what is an integrated reform
program and placed the emphasis on maintaining adequate resources overall.
E. Regulatory Capabilities

26.
Regulatory enhancements will be of limited value without effective supervision
and enforcement. The launch, on January 1, 2009, of FINMA—the new regulator,
integrating banking, insurance, and anti-money-laundering—is an opportunity to further
strengthen supervision. Although the authorities see limited scope for harmonizing
regulatory requirements across sectors, they stressed that their vision for FINMA is for an
even more effective regulator of the domestic financial sector and a more influential voice in
international regulatory fora. As well as the continuing implementation of Basel II and the
new insurance solvency requirements, FINMA will face early challenges in implementing
regulatory change resulting from current credit market events.
27.
A key to delivering the vision for FINMA will be to secure adequate skills and
resources. The authorities noted that under the proposed staff regulations, if approved by
the Federal Council, FINMA will have adequate flexibility to offer remuneration that will
retain and attract the skilled staff. This flexibility will extend to FINMA’s wider budgeting
and strategic planning. In this context, staff expressed concern that the full complement of
board members as well as the chief executive or other members of the general management
had not yet been appointed. The authorities recognized this as a priority.
28.
FINMA’s special challenge lies in supervising the major banking and insurance
groups. The authorities expect that FINMA will carry forward the existing approach that
relies on close supervision, with extensive involvement of auditors. Staff recommended
continued expansion of onsite activities by the Swiss Banking Commission to bring a better
balance with the work of the auditors. Staff also supported a targeted rules-based framework,

19
with transparent benchmark performance measures and linked supervisory responses for
capital requirements. The authorities indicated their openness to such an approach. Also,
particularly for the banking groups, close coordination of supervisory activities with key
overseas regulators has worked well. However, the authorities recognized that maintaining
the stability of global operations of their large, complex financial institutions will require
stronger commitments from host supervisors, especially in adverse circumstances when
conflicts of interest may appear.
IV. MONETARY POLICY

29.
The current conjuncture poses special challenges for monetary policy. CPI
inflation averaged a modest 0.7 percent in 2007, while core inflation was 0.6 percent.

core inflation. The greater inflation risk has
unfortunately coincided with worsening growth
prospects. At successive policy decision points since September, this polarization has
increased, heightening the trade-offs involved. Moreover, the consideration of safeguarding
against a particularly adverse outcome has added to the complexity of decision making.
30.
In this complex and uncertain environment, the SNB signaled its concerns
regarding inflation in its September decision. Under a floating exchange rate, the SNB’s
monetary policy seeks price stability, defined as a positive headline annual inflation rate but
one below 2 percent. Policy decisions are guided by inflation forecasts over a three-year
horizon. Within this objective, the SNB takes due account of business cycle conditions. The
SNB seeks to influence the 3-month Libor, allowing that rate to move in a 1 percentage point
band. The September decision to raise the target band by ¼ percentage point, led to a
cumulative increase of over 200 basis points from mid-2005 to the 2.25-3.25 percent range.
In doing so, the SNB maintained relatively stable monetary conditions as the decline in the
exchange rate mirrored the increase in policy rates.

31.
Recognizing that monetary conditions are tight, the SNB has eased by steering
down the 3-month Libor when the risk premium has tended to rise. In September, the
ongoing market turmoil had pushed the Libor rate to above the mid-point of the existing
range, where it is typically maintained. In response to this market-driven tightening of
monetary conditions, the SNB lowered the 1-week repo rate to bring the 3-month Libor down
to 2.75 percent, the mid-point of the range. The SNB’s focus on the 3-month Libor
recognizes this rate’s significance as a benchmark for a variety of longer-term rates, which
directly influence lending and borrowing decisions. Thus, resisting an increase in this rate
helped contain borrowing costs. In its March 2008 report, noting the strengthening of the
Swiss franc, the SNB stated “on the whole, monetary conditions are tighter than they were in
December” and was “of the opinion that an adjustment in the interest rate (the 3-month
Libor) was not called for under the current circumstances.” While it has kept the target range
of the 3-month Libor unchanged, slower expected growth and the insurance motive have
continued to influence policy implementation (Box 3). Maintaining the 3-month Libor at or
close to 2.75 percent—and in practice, preventing it from rising—has been achieved through
lowering shorter-term repo rates. Because the SNB states its policy stance in terms of the 3month Libor, it requires a comparison of the shorter-term policy rates of other central banks
with the SNB’s 1-week repo to recognize that the SNB has eased in line with the Bank of
England (text figure).

Staff supported the effective easing of monetary policy. The authorities
themselves preferred to use the term “accommodative” to describe their effective easing.
Inflation expectations remain well anchored, core inflation is below 1 percent, and the SNB’s
medium-term headline inflation forecasts are well within the central bank’s definition of
price stability. The monetary policy response has been appropriate, especially because fiscal
policy, which was not especially effective in the previous downturn, could not have
responded at the necessary speed and, as the authorities also emphasized, is subject to
external leakages. Indeed, with its lower growth and contained inflation scenario, staff
conveyed support of further modest monetary easing.
33.
In contrast to the broad agreement on the monetary policy stance, the
discussions on the operational framework were inconclusive. At the time of the
September decision the target range for the 3-month Libor and the operational 1-week repo
rate were moved in opposite directions. Thus, while the stance was signaling a tightening,
accommodation was being engineered. Since September, the SNB has maintained its target
range—and, hence, policy stance—steady, but provided monetary accommodation when
necessary by adjusting the 1-week repo rate. The authorities rightly maintained that this has
imparted some flexibility to the conduct of monetary policy in this stressful period. However,
the implication is that the monetary policy stance of the SNB cannot always be inferred from
its announced target range in the same way as that for other central banks. Thus, if SNB’s
changes in the policy stance (inferred from the movements in the 3-month Libor) are
compared to those of policy changes at other central banks, the SNB appears to have slightly
tightened (text figure) while the others (U.S. and U.K.) have held steady or eased. However,
when comparing like-for-like, the SNB has eased about the same as the Bank of England,
with the ECB and the U.S. at the two extremes. Staff sees this as going beyond a
communication issue, and its operational and substantive implications deserve further
analysis.

22

Box 3. Monetary Policy Under Uncertainty
Under tail-end shocks, monetary policy may be guided by an insurance motive. Switzerland has
become increasingly integrated with international markets. Growth and inflation are closely tied to
developments in the euro zone. Capital markets are tightly integrated with Europe—and even labor markets
are quickly moving in that direction. Since integration gradually reduces the possibility of fine tuning
inflation, the SNB’s decisions are typically related, though with some leads and lags, to the broader
movement of official rates. However, significant independent response is sometimes called for, as in the
severe downturn of 2001-2002.

Such an insurance motive may be operative
now. Gauged by a Taylor’s rule, the decision to
hike the rate by 25 basis points in September was
consistent with the view that inflation was a
concern. However, the decision was a surprise in
view of the ongoing financial turmoil, and while
inflation considerations may have suggested
continued tightening into December, the SNB,
citing uncertainty, then paused. A similar pause
was evident in the previous downturn. Currently
many financial markets appear to be in the midst
of tail-end shocks. Theory and practice (including
in Switzerland in the previous downturn) support
such caution.

V. PUBLIC FINANCES

34.
Though strengthened by recent efforts, the long-run sustainability of public
finances is not yet assured. The federation’s debt-brake fiscal framework, calling for a
cyclically-adjusted balance over the cycle, helped achieve a fiscal surplus in 2006, a year
ahead of schedule, and the surplus increased further in 2007. However, the debt brake can
only deal with cyclical pressures at the federal level. It does not apply to the social security
system; and the confederation cannot impose a fiscal rule on subnational governments. The
highly devolved Swiss federalism requires time to coordinate a response to aging. The
authorities are formulating comprehensive long-term policy initiatives, which the staff
continues to support.
A. Fiscal Developments

35.
The 2007 fiscal result was better than budgeted as tax revenues expanded with
the continued economic strength. With tight expenditure control and buoyant revenues, the
general government achieved a surplus of 2.2 percent of GDP in 2007, implying an
improvement in the structural surplus to 1.7 percent of GDP. Surpluses at the federal level
were supplemented by a balanced budget in social security accounts and surpluses at the
cantonal and communal levels. Taken together, these efforts reduced the gross debt to
44 percent of GDP.

B. Fiscal Projections and Policy

36.
The federal fiscal balance is projected to weaken and provide a small stimulus in
2008. An overall surplus of 0.8 percent of GDP is projected for 2008 (Tables 2 and 3),
representing a big swing from a surplus of 2.2 percent in 2007. The authorities explained that
the stimulus will, however, be small. About 1 percent of GDP constitutes extraordinary
expenditures, with the bulk of it a transfer to the Infrastructure Fund. However, only about a
quarter of this will be spent in this fiscal year. Another ¼ percent of GDP reflects accounting
changes that reports expenditures already incurred in 2007 in the 2008 budget. The
authorities stated that the modest positive impulse was not intended since their experience
has been that a stimulus cannot be well timed and the additional expenditures largely
increase imports. Thus, the stimulus applied in the downturn of 2001-2003 had little effect.
Staff agreed with the policy stance. By 2009, some inevitable slowdown of revenue
generation will occur. However, the authorities believe that projected surpluses in the
cantons will likely be revised upwards.
37.
Although the public debt-to-GDP ratio is currently on the decline, long-run
fiscal sustainability has not yet been achieved. Staff projections of an inter-temporal
balance sheet suggest that the government’s net worth (including implicit liabilities from
future aging costs and pension underfunding) is improving but a long-run shortfall still exits.
As such, under current policies, debt will begin to increase in about 15 years (Table 4) in
response to the projected rise of health care expenditures and other long-term pressures. The
Long-Term Sustainability Report due to be published in May marks an important step in
recognizing the tasks ahead and raising awareness of needed actions. However, as staff
emphasized and the authorities recognize, this needs to be followed by concrete measures to
contain expenditures. The authorities reported that while specific new actions had not yet
been determined, the focus is likely to be on: (i) an increase in the VAT rate to finance
disability insurance; (ii) an orderly reform of social benefits; and (iii) containment of health
care expenditures. In this regard, staff suggested that the savings to be achieved through the
Task Evaluation Program could prevent aging-related expenditures from crowding out other
social expenditures. Staff also recommended the use of an inter-temporal government
balance sheet as a tool for planning and communication.

The debt brake rule is to be augmented to cover extraordinary expenditures. A
38.
concern with the debt brake rule has been that it exempts “extraordinary expenditures.” Since
this exemption can be abused and since legitimate extraordinary expenditures for funding
large projects will nevertheless occur, the proposal requires the authorization of these
expenditures be contingent on additional measures over the medium term. Any extraordinary
revenues will reduce the necessary compensation amount accordingly. The proposal has been
submitted for public consultation in April and is expected to be approved by the parliament
during the course of 2009. It is expected to enter in application with the 2011 budget.

39.
The confederation is committed to improving the attractiveness of Switzerland
as a business location. In this respect, the corporate income tax reform just approved, and to
be implemented from 2009, will eliminate the double taxation of dividends for qualifying
individual shareholders and, therefore, improve incentives to increase investment and remove
biases favoring particular forms of project financing. A unified VAT framework, which will
eliminate exemptions, improve efficiency, reduce administrative costs, and allow for a lower
rate of 6 percent (currently 7.6 percent), could become effective as of 2011 at the earliest.
Finally, the elimination of the marriage penalty tax has, for most married couples, reduced
the high taxation of second earners and should increase labor force participation of skilled
women. Similarly, cantons, with their low debt and traditionally-conservative fiscal stance,
are likely to continue to lower their corporate tax rates. The authorities reiterated that these
measures were consistent with their international obligations and that they served to create
incentives for other countries to improve their public finances to create space for reduced
taxation.
VI. ASSESSMENT OF EXTERNAL STABILITY

40.
Switzerland’s sizeable and growing current account surplus appears
disconnected from developments in the real exchange rate. The current account surplus
has steadily increased from 8 percent of GDP early in the decade to 17 percent of GDP in

26
2007 (Table 5). During that same period, the nominal and real exchange rates depreciated by
about 7 and 10 percentage points respectively. This may suggest that a depreciating exchange
rate has contributed to the growing surplus. However, the link appears tenuous:
•

Despite the depreciating effective exchange rate, the trade surplus has remained small
and relatively flat at about 1½ percent of GDP.

•

The export of services produced a services balance surplus of 7½ percent of GDP in
2007, largely due to the two international banks and the insurance sector.

•

Continuing its surge, investment income reached 12 percent of GDP in 2007. Soaring
profits of Swiss multinationals from their rapidly rising stock of overseas investment
and pension assets generate substantial income from abroad.

For 2008, the current account surplus is projected to decline to about 14 percent
41.
of GDP. Investment income is expected to take the biggest hit—about 1½ percent of GDP—
with lower expected yields on foreign assets. Weaker goods exports and, especially, the
slower financial market turnover is projected to lower financial service income.

Both sides agreed that the current account surplus mostly reflected structural
factors. The Swiss structural balance is large, given the country’s high per capita income, its
aging population, and the country’s role as an international financial center. Special features
of the Swiss current account are also evaluated in assessing the level and sustainability of the

27
current account (Box 4).5 The recent CGER estimates under all three standard approaches—
external stability, macro balance, and the equilibrium exchange rate—lead to the conclusion
that the real exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals, especially after considering
the Swiss Franc’s appreciation by about 5 percent in real effective terms over the last few
months.
•

The external stability approach suggests an undervaluation of 8 percent. This
corresponds to a 3½ percent of GDP gap between the underlying and NFAstabilizing current account surpluses (12½ and 9 percent of GDP, respectively). The
estimate adjusts for the accounting treatment of retained earnings (Box 4).

•

The macro balance approach estimates an undervaluation of 7 percent, reflecting a
2½ percent of GDP gap between the underlying current account and the current
account norm (10 percent of GDP, making the same allowance for accounting
factors).

•

Under the equilibrium exchange rate approach, staff analysis finds undervaluation
of about 7 percent.

5

Also, the Swiss NFA position has grown much more slowly than would be expected from the accumulating
current account surpluses. The authorities, with access to the detailed data, have concluded that this is because
of valuation changes and exchange rate movements.

28

Box 4. Special Features of the Swiss Current Account
The authorities stressed that the accounting treatment of investment income complicated the assessment
of the current account surplus. Most of the earnings of Swiss multinationals are not paid out in dividends but
rather are kept as retained earnings. Under IMF balance of payments accounting rules, these are treated as
income inflows into the Switzerland, with counterpart FDI outflows through the capital account. Thus, although
no money crosses borders—either coming into or exiting from Switzerland—the capital and current accounts are
inflated. At the same time, foreigners hold Swiss assets mainly as stocks, and the retained earnings of the
underlying companies are not treated as income outflows. This asymmetrical treatment overestimates the current
account surplus by 4-5 percentage points of GDP. The elimination of the double taxation of dividends for
qualifying individual shareholders by 2009 may increase the payout ratio and help to lower the current account
surplus in the future.

The authorities also noted that the foreign controlled holding companies domiciled in Switzerland had a
minor effect on the surplus. Switzerland has attracted foreign controlled finance and holding companies that
do business throughout Europe. These companies have made large direct investments abroad, but also have
sizable direct investment liabilities with their foreign parent companies. Because they earn investment income
from abroad and pay investment income to the parent company, their average net impact on the current account
had been less than 1 percent of GDP.

VII. STAFF APPRAISAL

43.
The resilience and dynamism displayed recently by the Swiss economy is now
being tested by the realities and uncertainties of the global shake up. From the doldrums
at the start of the decade, the Swiss economy emerged on an impressive cyclical rebound
with clear evidence of structural change and an increase in its potential growth rate. A
cyclical correction was to be expected. But events have moved rapidly. The sharp anticipated
slowdown in U.S. and European growth and the financial tensions that continue to test the
global system carry serious implications for Switzerland. Growth is set to decelerate, perhaps
quickly, with risks for the financial sector. And as a major international financial center,
Swiss public policy actions have international consequences.
44.
The policy priority is to pay due attention to securing greater domestic financial
stability. The task is challenging and the lessons from the ongoing financial tensions can
only slowly be incorporated into regulatory and supervisory practice. Nevertheless, the
proactive approach of the Swiss authorities to increase buffers in the financial system is
welcome. Monetary and fiscal policies must play supportive roles within their well-defined
frameworks. In this regard, the tendency of monetary policy to be accommodative and impart
a modest stimulus while the fiscal stance remains conservative appears to strike the right
balance for now. As events unfold, these choices may need to be revisited.
45.
The authorities have responded vigorously to limit the knock-on effects of the
current financial tensions. They have injected liquidity into the banking system, often in
coordination with other major central banks, maintained an enhanced oversight of the major
banks and insurance companies, and worked actively with other regulators to share
information, coordinate supervisory activities, and draw lessons for the future.
Looking ahead, the authorities are rightly focused on increasing the buffers in
46.
the financial system. More comprehensive risk assessment within the Basel II framework,
and taking into account the recent outcomes and correlations, will lead to higher capital
requirements. However, the lesson also is that additional capital buffers would cushion
against unanticipated risks. In this regard, a leverage ratio approach, implemented alongside
Basel II and appropriate safeguards, could serve as a useful complement to the existing
regime. Consistent with the May 2007 FSAP update, the authorities are developing a stress
testing framework to improve liquidity risk management and are more actively reviewing
banks’ contingency plans and liquidity management policies. Finally, progress in
implementing the Swiss Solvency Test for insurance companies is being bolstered through
greater emphasis on internal controls and strengthening onsite supervision and international
supervisory cooperation. This extensive work program requires careful management within
the existing resource envelope.

30
47.
Regulatory refinements, however, will be insufficient without boosting
supervisory capabilities and resources. Since FINMA will remain at a resource
disadvantage relative to the groups it deals with, it deserves to be bolstered in various ways.
Early decisions to complete the appointment of the board and senior management of FINMA
would reinforce the vision for the new integrated regulator as a force in domestic and
international initiatives to improve financial regulation. The regulators’ preference for an
approach based on close supervision of the major groups is well-founded, given the market is
dominated by a small number of such players. But it may need to be supplemented by rules
that specify transparent benchmark performance measures and supervisory responses. In this
context, also of value would be a further shift to onsite activities by supervisors, with
appropriate reliance on external auditors to monitor regulatory compliance. So too would be
efforts to build on existing cross-border supervisory arrangements for global groups, to
secure even more active support of host supervisors in maintaining the stability of global
operations.
48.
In a highly uncertain environment, monetary policy has had to balance inflation
risks in a worsening growth environment. The SNB has steered a carefully calibrated
policy course. While signaling its concern with regard to inflation in its September 2007
decision by raising the target band for the 3-month Libor rate, the SNB has lowered its 1week repo rate to guide the 3-month LIBOR to the midpoint of the target band. The effective
easing thus engineered has been appropriate in the context of the potentially serious
downside risks and prospective alleviation of inflation pressures. Looking forward, the
relatively contained inflation outlook appears to provide scope for further easing. For its part,
the operational framework combining the 3-month Libor and the shorter-term repo rates has
revealed a potentially useful flexibility. But, in view of the difference vis-à-vis other central
banks, its signaling and substantive effects deserve further analysis.
49.
The state of public finances continued to improve in 2007—and the authorities
remain committed to a conservative fiscal approach. With a smaller surplus in 2008, a
small stimulus is anticipated in 2008. However, since it has had limited effectiveness in the
past, the authorities rightly do not anticipate a more vigorous use of the fiscal stimulus even
if growth were to slow markedly. Although the public debt-to-GDP ratio is declining, longterm fiscal sustainability requires continued fiscal prudence and structural reforms. While
this awareness exists, the next step is to formulate specific actions. In the short run, valuable
savings can be achieved through the Task Evaluation Program. Also, a useful tool for
planning and communication would be an inter-temporal government balance sheet. Finally,
the proposal to extend the debt-brake rule to incorporate “extraordinary” expenditures is
welcome.
The external current account surplus largely reflects structural factors.
50.
Switzerland’s large surplus is expected to come down this year. The surplus reflects the
country’s high per capita income, its aging population, and its position as a major financial

31
center. In addition, accounting norms and the specificities of the investment outflows and
inflows tend to overstate the surplus relative to other countries. Taking into account these
considerations, the current account surplus and the exchange rate appear to be broadly in line
with fundamentals.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Switzerland be held on
51.
the standard 12 month cycle.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

The exchange rate of the Swiss franc is determined by supply and demand in the foreign
exchange market, and therefore classified as an independently floating exchange rate regime.
The Swiss National Bank reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market. All
settlements are made at free market rates. Switzerland maintains an exchange system free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions,
except for restrictions in place for security reasons notified to the Fund pursuant to Decision
No. 144-(52/51).
On April 25, 2008, Switzerland notified the IMF of the exchange restrictions that have been
imposed against certain countries, individuals, and entities, in accordance with relevant UN
Security Council resolutions and EU regulations.
In accordance with UN Security Council resolutions, restrictions are currently in place with
respect to specific individuals and entities associated with the former government of Liberia,
Iraq, Osama bin Laden, the Taliban, and the Al-Qaïda network, specific individuals and
entities posing a threat to international peace and security in Côte d’Ivoire, in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC), impeding the peace process in Sudan, engaged in the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK) Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD)–
related programs, ban on financing and financial services related to the provision of arms and
related materiel to Lebanon, specific individuals and entities involved in the nuclear and/or
ballistic missile programs of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The lists of individuals and entities
against whom financial sanctions are in force are based on the decisions by the competent UN
Security Council sanctions committee and are amended regularly.

42
In accordance with EU regulations, restrictions are currently in place with respect to specific
individuals associated with the previous government of the former Republic of Yugoslavia,
Zimbabwe, Myanmar, ban on financing and the provision of financial services related to
military activities in Uzbekistan, specific individuals and entities associated with the
government of Belarus. The lists of targeted individuals are identical to the list in the
corresponding EU regulations.

Article IV Consultation:

Switzerland is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. The 2008 mission
visited Bern and Zürich during March 3-17, 2008 and held discussions with Finance Minister
Merz, Chairman Roth of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank (SNB), and other
senior officials. Outreach activities included discussions with members of parliament, NGOs,
the private sector, and think-tanks. Messrs. Moser (Executive Director) and Weber (Advisor)
attended some of the meetings.
The mission comprised A. Mody (Head), K. Ross, A. Carare (EUR), K. Ueda (RES), I. Tower
and J. Tuya (MCM).
In agreement with the authorities, the mission focused on core surveillance issues. No
background papers have been produced.
The mission held a joint press conference on the concluding statement. The authorities have
agreed to the publication of the staff report.

Annex II. Switzerland: Statistical Issues

Switzerland’s economic and financial statistics are adequate for surveillance purposes.
Switzerland generally publishes timely economic statistics and posts most of the data and the
underlying documentation on the internet. In June 1996, Switzerland subscribed to the Fund’s
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), and its metadata are currently posted on the
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. Switzerland is in full observance of SDDS
requirements, and it is availing itself of the SDDS’s flexibility options on dissemination of
production index data (for periodicity and timeliness) and of wages and earnings data (for
periodicity). However, a number of statistical gaps and deficiencies remain, mainly reflecting a
lack of resources and the limited authority of the Federal Statistical Office (BfS) to request
information:
•

reliable general government finance statistics appear with considerable lags, mainly due to
delays in compiling fiscal accounts at the level of cantons and communes;

•

internationally comparable fiscal statistics on an accrual basis will become available for the
central government in the second half 2008;

•

pension statistics are published with a long lag;

•

GDP by industry appears with a considerable lag.

To address deficiencies, the authorities are taking or intend to take the following steps:
The SNB launched in 2004 a quarterly survey on the cost of borrowing and completed the
pilot phase in June 2005. From July 2006, the SNB conducts the survey on a monthly basis. In
September 2005, the SNB started compiling more comprehensive statistics on mutual funds.
In October 2005, the SNB published, in collaboration with the Federal Statistical Office,
annual financial accounts for 1999-2003 (stock data). Data on financial flows and nonfinancial assets was published in 2007. In conjunction with the SNB’s centennial, long-run
historical time series covering monetary aggregates, capital markets, and the SNB balance
sheet have been published. At the end of 2007, the SNB introduced a new monthly survey on
interest rates for various banking products. Under the agreement with SFBC on reciprocal
exchange of data, the SNB has since 2007, been collecting the new capital adequacy statement
information, in accordance with Basel II. Also, since 2007, the SNB has conducted surveys of
Liechtenstein-based companies when preparing its international investment position.
Annual national accounts were upgraded in 2003 to the European System of Accounts 1995
(ESA95) and with the release of the Q4 2004 data, the Secretariat for Economics (SECO)
revised accordingly its quarterly national account estimates. SECO started publishing in
March 2006 a quarterly production account. The main innovations in the new national

44
accounts were in investment (with detail on information and communications technology),
private and public consumption (hospitals were transferred to the private sector), and the use of
chain price indices (without adjustment for quality).
In 2004, a statistical cooperation agreement was concluded with the EU as part of
Bilateral II for the harmonization of several Swiss statistics with EU standards.
The Federal Finance Administration has started preparations for revamping fiscal statistics
with the adoption of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001, the reform of the
accounting standards for cantons and communes (Weiterentwicklung der Rechnungslegung der
Kantone und Gemeinden) and the introduction of full accrual budgeting and accounting at the
level of the federal government (Neues Rechnungsmodell Bund) along the lines of the
International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). Figures according to the new
accounting standards are expected in 2008 (as mentioned above). In the interim, government
finance statistics for publication in the GFS Yearbook will be reported on a cash basis but
presented in the GFSM 2001 format.
Quarterly balance of payments and international investment position data are compiled by
the SNB and meet international standards. However, monetary gold transactions relating to
sales of gold reserves not required for monetary policy purposes have not been correctly
reflected in the balance of payments. For legal reasons, and until the distribution of the
proceeds of gold sales between the SNB and the Federal Department of Finance was concluded
in February 2005, the proceeds of the gold sales not needed for monetary purposes were
considered as part of the official reserves in the balance of payments. After that date, they
appear in the position “other assets of the SNB” in the balance of payments.
Switzerland participated in the Coordinated Compilation Exercise for Financial
Soundness Indicators (FSIs). Data and metadata on a benchmark set of indicators of the
soundness of the financial system (for year-end 2005) has been posted on the IMF website.
The authorities have made progress on AML/ CFT recommendations. The Federal
Council adopted a draft law implementing the revised FATF recommendations, which should
be in force by end-2009. Supervisory ordinances on private insurance, gaming, and banking
commission have also been adopted, and a revised banking association due diligence code will
be in force by mid-2008. The Swiss authorities will report on these reforms to the FATF in
October 2008.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Switzerland
On May, 23, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Switzerland. 1
Background
The economy has performed impressively. Growth has exceeded the euro area average
in each of the past four years, employment has surged and inflation has remained
relatively muted. This favorable outcome can be traced to a strong external environment
that has led to an increase in high value-added manufacturing, and in financial sector
income flows which reinforced Switzerland’s role as a major global financial center.
Global credit strains, however, have had an impact on the financial sector. While Credit
Suisse and Swiss Re have reported losses, UBS has been particularly hard hit,
reflecting its high exposure to U.S. subprime assets. Subprime losses at UBS have
amounted to US$38 billion, and have led to writedowns by the main rating agencies, as
well as two capital injections of about US$28 billion. Still, while deleveraging at the big
banks is ongoing, domestic lending has remained on a surprisingly steady pace.
The economy gathered speed in 2006 and into the first half of 2007, resulting in a
positive output gap of about 1 percent. GDP growth accelerated to 3.1 percent in 2007,
as private consumption was supported by a very favorable labor market, and investment
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
was underpinned by strong corporate profitability and tightening capacity constraints. So
far, leading indicators have remained surprisingly positive. Demand of manufactured
goods from Europe and Asia is steady and consumer-related industries, such as retail
trade and tourism, have performed particularly well. Economic growth, however, is
expected to moderate to 1.4 percent in 2008 as the worsening external environment
takes its toll on goods exports and financial sector inflows, and financial tensions lower
consumer confidence, gradually weakening consumption.
Headline inflation averaged 0.7 percent in 2007, while core inflation was 0.6 percent.
CPI inflation has recently picked up due to fuel and food price increases but is expected
to moderate by the end of the year. For 2008, inflation is projected to average 2 percent
and fall to 1.4 percent in 2009. Foreign labor, in particular, has helped to keep wage
pressures in check, and has bolstered competitiveness.
The Swiss National Bank (SNB) continued to normalize interest rates in the first half of
2007, but has since relaxed monetary policy when necessary. The SNB’s target range
for the 3-month Libor has been increased by 200 basis points since mid-2005 (to 2.253.25 percent) as the Swiss franc weakened. Since September, however, repo rates
have been reduced to accommodate emerging credit strains which placed upward
pressure on Libor rates.
The state of public finances continued to improve in 2007. The general government
achieved a surplus of 2.2 percent of GDP aided by strong cyclical revenues and
surpluses at lower levels of government. Debt to GDP ratios have fallen below
45 percent but aging-related expenditures are expected to reverse this trend in the
medium-term.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Switzerland’s impressive growth performance over the
last four years, and commended the authorities on their strong macroeconomic policies
and structural reform efforts. Directors noted that the financial turbulence of the past
year—and the continued tensions, especially in the interbank markets—have generated
risks for the Swiss financial sector. Although the economy has weathered well these
challenges, Directors considered that, along with the slowdown in U.S. activity and the
prospect of slower growth in Europe, these developments are projected to decelerate
Swiss growth in the period ahead.
Against this background, Directors observed that the key policy priority is to maintain
domestic financial stability, which, given Switzerland’s strong international linkages,
would contribute also to international stability. They commended the authorities for their
vigorous response to date to limit the fallout from the financial turbulence. In particular,
Directors welcomed the authorities’ well-timed injections of liquidity into the banking
system in concert with other major central banks, and their enhanced oversight of the
major banks and insurance companies. They also praised the authorities for their
proactive sharing of information and lessons learned with other regulators, and their

3
smooth coordination of supervisory activities, while calling for continued work on
measures that will further enhance financial sector stability. This work should focus on
the following four areas: better risk assessment and risk management; increased capital
buffers; more liquidity; and greater disclosure.
Looking ahead, Directors noted the importance of stronger buffers to protect the
financial system. They noted that recent developments will likely lead to higher capital
requirements under the Basel II framework, and that additional capital may be needed to
cushion against unforeseen risks. In this regard, most Directors considered that a
leverage ratio approach envisaged by the authorities could serve as a useful
complement to the existing regime, if implemented alongside Basel II and with
appropriate safeguards. Directors also welcomed Switzerland’s development of a
stronger stress testing framework to improve liquidity risk management and a more
active review of banks’ contingency plans and liquidity management policies. In the
insurance sector, Directors noted progress in implementing the Swiss Solvency Test for
insurance companies, and welcomed the strengthened on-site supervision and
international supervisory cooperation.
Directors welcomed the recent appointment of the board and senior management of the
new financial regulator (FINMA), and emphasized the need to ensure that the agency
has the appropriate level of supervisory capabilities and resources. Directors
recommended further strengthening of on-site supervision capabilities, with appropriate
reliance on external auditors to monitor regulatory compliance. They also stressed the
importance of building on existing cross-border supervisory arrangements for global
groups, and securing more active support of host supervisors in maintaining the stability
of global operations.
Directors agreed that the calibration of monetary policy has correctly balanced the risks
to inflation and economic growth. They indicated that the effective easing of monetary
policy has been appropriate given the potentially serious downside risks to the economy
and the projected decline of inflation. Looking ahead, Directors welcomed the
authorities’ commitment to continue to monitor developments carefully. A number of
Directors considered that the relatively contained inflation outlook provides some scope
for further easing. A number of other Directors believed that the current monetary stance
remains appropriate at the present juncture. Regarding the operational framework,
Directors noted that its flexibility has served the economy well, and looked forward to
further analysis of its signaling and substantive effects.
Directors commended the authorities for the strong fiscal performance. They
emphasized that, following the small fiscal stimulus anticipated in 2008, further progress
toward long-term fiscal sustainability will require continued fiscal prudence and structural
reforms. In this regard, Directors welcomed the Long-Term Sustainability Report as an
important step in raising awareness of the needed actions, and looked forward to the
early formulation of specific policy measures. Directors noted that savings could be

4
achieved through a consolidation of governmental responsibilities as outlined in the
Task Evaluation Program. They also welcomed the proposal to extend the debt-brake
rule to incorporate “extraordinary” expenditures.
In reviewing the factors behind Switzerland’s large external current account surplus,
Directors considered that the surplus largely reflects structural factors, notably the
country’s high per capita income, its aging population, and its position as a major
financial center. They also noted that accounting norms and the specificities of the
investment flows tend to overstate the surplus relative to other countries. Taking into
account these considerations, Directors generally agreed that the exchange rate
appears to be broadly in line with fundamentals.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat

Statement by Thomas Moser, Executive Director for Switzerland
May 23, 2008
1.
On behalf of my Swiss authorities, I would like to thank the staff for the stimulating
and constructive discussions. In light of the global financial market turmoil and the
importance of Switzerland’s financial sector, and in line with the refocusing of the Fund’s
activities on macro-financial linkages, the staff report rightly focuses on financial sector
stability issues and policies, including on regulatory questions. Many issues that the report
highlights are at the forefront of international policy discussions and thus of relevance
beyond Switzerland. My authorities welcome the overall positive assessment of their policy
responses in this regard, and the staff report will be very helpful in strengthening the support
for these measures.
Growth Outlook
2.
The Swiss economy has enjoyed four years of solid, broad based growth, at a rate
above its long-term average growth rate. For 2008 and 2009, a slowdown is expected, given
the deterioration in the international economic and financial environment, but at the time
being there is still little concrete evidence of a marked slowdown. The Swiss authorities
expect GDP growth to slow to about 2 percent in 2008 and to 1-1.5 percent in 2009.
3.
As pointed out by the staff, Switzerland’s openness and its large and international
financial sector expose Switzerland’s economy to exogenous shocks, but thanks to its
flexibility the Swiss economy should be well capable of handling such shocks. The lower
growth prospects for the U.S. economy and, to a lesser extent, for Europe will undoubtedly
have an adverse affect on Swiss exports, but this is partially compensated by continuing
strong growth in Asia and the Gulf region. It should also be pointed out that higher oil prices
do not only have an adverse impact on the Swiss economy, as higher income in oil-exporting
countries stimulates demand for the Swiss investment and luxury goods industries.
4.
As to financial sector linkages, Switzerland’s two major international banks are
undoubtedly affected by the international financial turmoil, by and large through their
investment banking arms. However, the Swiss banking sector as a whole has continued to be
very profitable, and there is little evidence of a tightening in credit conditions in Switzerland.
It should also be noted that the very solid financial footing of Swiss households and
companies would help to cushion such a tightening.
Maintaining Financial Sector Stability
5.
My Swiss authorities fully share staff’s views on measures to further enhance
financial sector stability. They would like to emphasize three main priorities that will support

2
the stability objective: (i) enhanced international cooperation, (ii) the close monitoring of the
two large banks, and (iii) the launch of the financial supervisory authorities (FINMA).
6.
On international cooperation, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) participated from the
outset of the financial market turmoil in international cooperation and continues to coordinate
with the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank in providing dollar liquidity. The
SNB and the Swiss Federal Banking Commission (SFBC) are also actively involved with
their respective foreign counterparts in enhancing the exchange of information and policy
response. Switzerland is fully engaged in the international efforts to strengthen regulatory
standards in the Basel Committee and other relevant for a, and is ready to actively contribute
to multilateral efforts aimed at maintaining financial sector stability, including in the IMF
and the FSF.
7.
Switzerland is well aware of the systemic importance of its two large banks. Both the
SFBC and the SNB are implementing pragmatic steps to improve the supervision and
regulation for risks and liquidity management at the large banks, and to raise capital
requirements. For example, a regular, mandated stress testing exercise with the two large
banks has been introduced. The Swiss authorities are also well on track for the launch of
FINMA; the remaining board members and its director were appointed on May 21. The
independence of FINMA is a prerequisite for the agency to be able to fulfill its supervisory
duties. It is also an objective of FINMA to enhance Switzerland’s input to international
cooperation.
8.
As to the insurance sector, the Swiss authorities concur with staff that the insurance
supervisor should focus on the consistent implementation of the Swiss Solvency Test (SST),
and on monitoring companies that show SST ratios of less than 100 percent. Based on the
integrated approach, the SST will be complemented by a focus on corporate governance, risk
management, and internal controls.
9.
On pension funds, it should first be noted that with an asset volume of comfortably
over 100 percent of GDP, the (mandatory) occupational benefit plan system in Switzerland is
well endowed. However, there is broad agreement among the authorities and the industry that
pension funds should generally have a higher degree of coverage and that valuation reserves
should be increased further. Many pension funds have in fact significantly increased the
latter. It should also be pointed out that legal provisions require pension funds to notify any
undercoverage, so as to initiate corrective measures on which reports (on implementation and
effectiveness) must be submitted annually to the Federal Council. Also, one fifth of the
pension fund liabilities are insured with private insurance companies who have to meet strict
coverage and solvency requirements at all times.

Monetary Policy
10.
At slightly over 2 percent in 2008, inflation is now expected to be somewhat higher
than assumed in the staff report, i.e., slightly above the rate which the SNB regards as
compatible with price stability. However, inflation is expected to ease again toward the end
of the year and no further action from the SNB is required. But vigilance remains necessary
as it cannot be excluded that inflation will prove more persistent than expected. The scope for
easing, mentioned in the staff report, needs to be qualified accordingly.
11.
My Swiss authorities would like to point out that increasing integration with
international markets in general, and Europe in particular, has not eliminated the scope for
independent monetary policy responses. Both in 2001 and 2002 the SNB moved faster and
more forcefully than the ECB. In 2003, it stopped reducing interest rates earlier than the
ECB, and in 2004 again, the SNB acted before the ECB. It is true, however, that growth and
inflation in Switzerland are closely correlated developments in the euro zone, but it should
also be mentioned that inflation in Switzerland is significantly and permanently lower than in
the euro area.
12.
As the staff report rightly notes the SNB’s operational framework differs from the
operating procedures of other central banks: the SNB targets the three-month Swiss-franc
Libor, whereas other central banks set the overnight or the one-week repo rates. The staff
seems to see little value in this Swiss particularity, but the concept has served the SNB and
the Swiss economy well, particularly during the recent financial market turmoil. The Libor –
and not the repo or the overnight rate – is an important reference interest rate for the Swiss
economy. By targeting a three-month market rate rather than a risk-free overnight rate, the
SNB has been able to largely offset the gyrations in the risk premium over the recent months,
and thus been able to isolate the non-financial sector of the Swiss economy from the turmoil
on financial markets. By incorporating what could be termed an “automatic monetary
stabilizer,” this operational framework has led the policy stance to be more accommodative –
or less restrictive – than it would have been otherwise. We agree with staff, however, that
these issues deserve further theoretical and empirical analysis.
Public Finances
13.
Fiscal performance in 2007 was again better than budgeted for all levels of
government. Thanks to buoyant revenues stemming from strong economic growth, the
general government surplus in 2007 increased further to 2.2 percent of GDP from 1.9 percent
in 2006. The authorities are particularly satisfied that expenditure control was maintained
despite strong revenues. The surpluses over the past years have also allowed a significant
reduction in public debt. At around 44 percent of GDP, the current level of gross debt is over
10 percentage points below the historical peak in 2003.

4
14.
As staff notes, long-term fiscal sustainability has also improved over the past years.
The authorities are aware of the fiscal challenges stemming from an aging population. By
introducing the Long-Term Sustainability Report as a regular feature of the medium-term
budget planning, an important step was made to inform and sensitize policy makers and the
public of the order of magnitude of costs related to demographic change. A crucial message
of the report is the speed with which adjustment costs increase, if concrete measures to
reduce costs are delayed. The authorities are confident that the report will help in the
implementation of structural changes in the areas of social security and health care.
15.
At the federal level, the authorities remain committed to the two main goals that have
anchored fiscal policy over the last years: stabilizing federal gross debt in nominal terms and
reducing expenditure growth to a sustainable level. The debt brake, introduced in 2003, has
been the main instrument in this respect. To further strengthen this fiscal rule, the Federal
Council has proposed an amendment of the budget law, which would ensure that also
extraordinary expenditure is taken into account by the debt brake. At present, extraordinary
spending under exceptional circumstances is exempted from the fiscal rule and can lead to an
increase of debt, thereby undermining the original spirit of the fiscal rule. The amendment of
the budget law introduces the obligation to compensate extraordinary expenditure over a
period of six years with additional spending cuts over and above those required by the debt
brake for maintaining the balance in the ordinary accounts. At present, the proposal is in a
broad public consultation process. The Federal Council plans to submit the bill to Parliament
in September 2008.
16.
As regards the reduction of expenditure growth to a sustainable level, the Task
Evaluation Program remains the main instrument to define specific measures and structural
reforms across all areas of the federal government. The Federal Council recently reconfirmed
the specific medium-term expenditure growth rates for the different tasks, which ensure a
stabilization of the current expenditure-to-GDP ratio. It also submitted a report to Parliament,
outlining 50 possible reform areas, which are currently being specified by the respective
ministries.
